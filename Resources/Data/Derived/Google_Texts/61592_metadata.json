It was carved up into apartments, then gutted for a bed and breakfast that never came to be, then left vacant for nearly 20 years.\n\nWhen Historic Boulder took ownership in 2010 of the house at 800 Arapahoe Ave., the home was structurally unsound, with holes in the roof and cracks in the walls, and required emergency stabilization.\n\n\"It was daunting for Historic Boulder to even take this project on,\" said Thomas Thorpe, an architect who served as the construction project manager and owners' representative. \"The building was structurally unstable from top to bottom.\"\n\nThe Hannah Barker House in Boulder, 1895.

Documents filed with the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder show the sale price was at least $660,000. Wein will complete the interior renovations to the home, while the money from the sale goes back into Historic Boulder's revolving fund for future preservation projects.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We love returning it to its original purpose as a single-family home,\" said Abby Daniels, executive director of Historic Boulder.\n\nA house with practically no foundation\n\nMembers of Historic Boulder did not want to provide a total project cost, which includes not just the construction itself, but the carrying costs of taxes and insurance. The rehabilitation project received $323,000 in grants from the State Historical Fund, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the McConnell Foundation and the Boulder Arts Commission, with each grant requiring local fundraising to match a portion of the grant. The organization also put $511,000 of its own money into the project.\n\nThorpe said the gutting of the home by a previous owner meant there were very few surprises in the renovation process, unlike many other historic buildings, but the removal of the structural walls and beams contributed to the instability of the house.\n\nHistoric Boulder's first move was to brace the roof from the inside and place weatherproof sheeting over the roof on the outside.\n\nOne surprise, though, was that the house had no foundation to speak of.\n\n\"The stones go down 12 to 18 inches and then it's just dirt,\" Thorpe said. \"How this 135-year-old building was still standing was amazing. The masons did a really good job when it was built.\"\n\nThe second phase of the project, completed in 2012, involved repairing the weakest brick walls and creating a foundation by injecting concrete through tubes under the historic brick walls.\n\nThe Hannah Barker House was only the second historic home in Colorado to receive this permeation grouting technique, which may have helped save the house during the 2013 floods.\n\nIn the third phase of the project, completed in 2013, volunteers with HistoriCorps rehabilitated the front porch, and Historic Boulder removed the lead paint from the interior.\n\nThe Hannah Barker House on Arapahoe Avenue, seen in 2013.

Four historic chimneys were repaired, and a cupola and spire that had once graced the roof were reconstructed. The house was also painted in its original colors.\n\n'She was our muse'\n\nThe last two phases of the project, which include rehabilitating 22 historic windows, the front door and the original wrought iron fence, as well as installing mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and a new kitchen and bathrooms, will be completed by the owner.\n\nThe oldest existing portion of the house was built in 1875 by Caleb and Carrie Stowell, and a number of additions in an Italianate style were made over the years.\n\nEzra and Hannah Barker bought the house in 1877.\n\n\"It's one of the oldest homes in Boulder,\" Daniels said. \"We knew it was important to save the house. But the more we learned about Hannah Connell Barker, we knew it was important to save the house because she left such a legacy in Boulder.\"\n\nBarker had no children, and Daniels believes the house itself helped preserve her story into the modern day.\n\nThorpe said Barker's story captivated everyone who worked on the project.\n\n\"We said that she was our muse,\" Thorpe said. \"I used to say the rehabilitation project was a big thing but her presence in Boulder is so much bigger. She was a civic leader, a business leader, a philanthropist. She is still here. The contractors, the builders, the carpenters, they all wanted to know about her.\"\n\nBarker most likely was born in 1844 in Ireland as Hannah Connell and emigrated to Massachusetts with her family in 1852. She arrived in Colorado in 1867 and taught schoolchildren in a saloon in Ward before moving to Boulder in 1869, where she continued to teach in the newly formed Boulder School District.\n\nShe married Ezra Barker, an early pioneer of Boulder with extensive real estate holdings, in 1877, but he died six years later of tuberculosis, leaving most of his property to Hannah Barker.\n\nShe platted the town of Highland Lawn on the western end of what is now Arapahoe Avenue and Marine Street and told residents to plant trees, though not cottonwoods. The area was later annexed into Boulder.\n\nBarker was active in the temperance movement and the Congregational Church. She was on the board of directors of the Boulder Bank and chair of the all-female board of directors of the Boulder Creamery. She was president of the Fortnightly Club, a group that organized lectures on arts and culture in members' homes, and she helped establish the public reading rooms that later became the first public library.\n\nHer summer home near Nederland became Barker Reservoir, though she did not sell the land willingly.\n\nShe died in 1918 of the influenza epidemic and left her home to her longtime friend Mary Davidson, who lived there until 1923. The house was divided into apartments in 1939 and fell vacant in the 1990s.\n\nRuth McHeyser, the chair of the Hannah Barker House Rehabilitation Committee, said some people might question the value of saving one house, but it helps preserve the memory of a remarkable woman in early Boulder.\n\n\"I think her story might have been lost,\" McHeyser said. \"It wasn't very well known at all. It's one house in a neighborhood, but it really adds such character to that neighborhood. People were very intrigued by the house and the story.\n\n\"It's that tangible place when you walk in a neighborhood, and it's a reminder of the past.\"\n\nErica Meltzer: 303-473-1355, meltzere@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/meltzere", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29336120/boulders-hannah-barker-house-revived", "sailthru.author": "By Erica Meltzer \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29336120:view"}, "startDate": "2016-01-02T11:05:34-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "From its beginnings as one of early Boulder's most stately homes, Hannah Barker's residence on Arapahoe Avenue gradually sank into disrepair.
