She repeatedly interrupted her warm-up routine in preparation for her women\u2019s singles final to check the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cHe inspires me a lot. He\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Prachi said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most clutch players I ever met.\u201d\n\nBut the frail, five-foot-four boy lost the decisive seventh game against Timothy Wang, a 22-year-old U.S. Olympian. Both Prachi (PRA-CHI) and Kanak (KAH-NAHK), who live in Milpitas, hope to earn spots on the U.S. team in the upcoming 2016 Summer Games. On this day, however, Kanak exited the Las Vegas Convention Center doubly disappointed, not only by his defeat, but after hearing the news that Prachi had lost her final, too.\n\n\u201cI always cheer for her when she\u2019s playing,\u201d Kanak said. \u201cI want her to do well because I know she works so hard.\u201d\n\nBoth have devoted the past eight years to table tennis. Year-round, the siblings train with two private coaches five to six times each week for about two hours every weekday and seven hours on weekends, at either the Indian Community Center near the family\u2019s home or the TopSpin Club in Santa Clara. Kanak, an eighth grader, is the eighth-best under-15 player in the world and aims to play professionally. Prachi, an eleventh grader at Milpitas High School with straight-As, is a two-time U.S. Women\u2019s National Team member.\n\n\u201cIf they keep up their practice and continue to progress, making the Olympics, that should be realistic,\u201d said Stefan Feth, a former German Men\u2019s National Team member who serves as the Jhas\u2019 coach.\n\nTheir father, Arun Jha, and mother, Karuna Jain, have similar Olympic hopes for their children. Though neither parent was exceptionally talented in table tennis, they don\u2019t yearn for their children to accomplish what they never did.\n\n\u201cYou put in the most effort in practice and training, and you let the chips fall where they might when they are playing,\u201d Arun said. \u201cIf they lose, it\u2019s not a big deal for me. I just try to motivate them and support them as much as I can.\u201d\n\nAs parents, they had encouraged Prachi to rally with them at the ICC when she was eight years old, and five year-old Kanak watched and copied his big sister. Early on, local coaches believed the sibling tandem could shift from recreational to competitive play after noticing Prachi\u2019s exceptional hand-eye coordination and the quickness that Kanak exhibited on the soccer field.\n\nHowever, Feth didn\u2019t consider their physical traits as the only signs of potential success.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing about them is that they have a big passion for the sport,\u201d Feth said. \u201cYou can rarely stop them from playing. That\u2019s a very good base for a player. It\u2019s something they\u2019ve always had.\u201d\n\nPrachi and Kanak demonstrate their passion for table tennis in different ways.\n\nBefore school, Kanak wakes up early to watch Internet streams of professional international table tennis competitions. He knows the dates and locations of upcoming tournaments and memorizes nearly every player\u2019s match record and world ranking. Even when he travels to train or compete, he avoids all distractions.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t care to go sightseeing. He\u2019s not into gadgets,\u201d said his father. \u201cHe is solely focused on table tennis.\u201d\n\nPrachi, on the other hand, invites an occasional diversion from her tight schedule. Unlike her brother \u2014 whom his parents have occasionally home-schooled to accommodate his table tennis training and tournament schedules in Europe and Asia \u2014 Prachi prioritizes academics over a professional table tennis career. Her normal day consists of \u201cschool, ping pong, homework, and sleep,\u201d and she said she struggles to make time for her friends.\n\nHer passion for table tennis, however, keeps her motivated.\n\n\u201cI really enjoy table tennis. Even when I lose, I really want to get back and play some more,\u201d Prachi said.\n\nWhile they have never competed against each other in tournaments, Prachi and Kanak often exchange heated topspin rallies during practice points at the end of their group training sessions. They enjoy playing against each other, smiling and laughing after particularly entertaining points. But when they were younger, the two were much more competitive with each other.\n\n\u201cThere was a sibling rivalry in the beginning. One would say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re training three hours. Why do I only get two? Why do you get to train with Stefan, and not me?\u2019\u201d Arun said.\n\nNow, their relationship has matured from being rivals to becoming more respectful.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from Prachi,\u201d Kanak said. \u201cShe always works hard and that really gets me motivated to work hard also. And she always is very focused. She has school and table tennis, and right now it\u2019s hard for her but she\u2019s balancing it well. That\u2019s really amazing.\u201d\n\nPrachi equally lauds her brother. \u201cHe\u2019s naturally very athletic. I\u2019m not even close to that,\u201d Prachi said. \u201cHe\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nAs admiring as they are of each other, the siblings refrain from mentioning their own accomplishments. Kanak appeared uncomfortable, even sheepish, when asked to talk about his proudest achievement. The two are naturally humble, and their coaches do what they can to keep it that way.\n\n\u201cWe try a day-by-day approach,\u201d said Nan Li, Prachi and Kanak\u2019s former coach, and a former U.S. Women\u2019s National Team member. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to pump the kids up so much because from their success there comes a lot of pressure. We try to keep our kids humble because it can end anytime or hopefully it keeps going.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, the siblings face different kinds of pressure. The older sister said she hopes to score high on her SATs and maintain a strong grade point average to attend a good college, while playing table tennis at a high level. The younger brother said he wants to steadily improve in order to become a top-100 player in the world.\n\nAt the very least, they can be certain that they will have each other\u2019s support along the way.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Writer Preston Chin was a member of the 2009 U.S. Junior Boys National Table Tennis team, just like Kanak Jha is now.
