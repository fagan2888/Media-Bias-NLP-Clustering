Here are a few more facts about the senator, his state and his opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, that you may not know:\n\n1. He can win over drunken retirees.\n\nDuring his first Senate re-election campaign in 1990, McConnell and his opponent, Harvey Sloane, were at a Fraternal Order of Police hall in Louisville. Each had served as judge executive of Jefferson County, which includes Louisville, and each had clashed with the police union over contracts. \u201cThere were lots of retirees there, and they had started drinking at about 3 in the afternoon,\u201d McConnell told me. \u201cAnd I laid out my case, and some old guy in the back just drunker than a hoot owl says\u201d \u2014 and at this point, McConnell adopted a bit of a slur \u2014 \u201d \u2018Senator, I don\u2019t like you,\u2019 and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t like Sloane.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, you\u2019re gonna be happy, because one of those S.O.B.s is gonna lose.\u2019 \u201d The group dissolved into laughter and eventually backed McConnell.\n\n2. He\u2019s got serious beef with The Courier-Journal.\n\nO.K., you might already know about this: McConnell complains to anyone who will listen about the gibes he has endured over the years from The Courier-Journal, Louisville\u2019s newspaper and historically the most influential daily in the state. In fact, feuding with the newspaper seems so much a part of his identity that it brings him a sort of gratification. Or at least that was the premise of a story that Hunter Bates, a former McConnell chief of staff, told me. One of The Courier-Journal\u2019s liberal editorial writers, David Hawpe, was a frequent McConnell antagonist. But he seemed to warm to McConnell for a while, at least on the First Amendment issues that McConnell has embraced, opposing campaign finance reform and a flag-burning amendment. After a period of detente, as Bates recalled, Hawpe again became sharply critical of McConnell when they disagreed on an issue relating to the University of Louisville. McConnell\u2019s aides were disappointed: An influential voice was once again on the warpath against the senator. But McConnell seemed pleased, as Bates remembered, because order had been restored. \u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable for him,\u201d Bates said. \u201cThe world he knows included battling this guy.\u201d\n\n3. He\u2019s buds with Senator Rand Paul. Sort of.\n\nAs his state and his party have moved to the right over the years, McConnell has shifted to keep pace. His newfound opposition to federal earmarks, which for decades he bragged about delivering to his poor state, is perhaps the most vivid example of his move. But so was his quick decision in 2010 to rally to the side of Rand Paul, who thumped McConnell\u2019s handpicked candidate in that year\u2019s Republican Senate primary. \u201cWhere Senator McConnell excels is that I don\u2019t think he holds a grudge,\u201d is how Paul put it to me. Paul was, however, less effusive when I asked what political lessons he had learned from watching McConnell campaign. \u201cEverybody kind of has their own style with regard to campaigning,\u201d he said, before waiting for the next question.\n\n4. He and Harry Reid have more in common than they might think.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret in Washington that McConnell and Reid, the Senate majority leader, do not get along these days. The problem may be less about their differences and more about the degree to which they are alike: septuagenarian political survivors and consummate inside players, each a fierce partisan always looking for the upper hand and showing little regard for how they come across on TV. They also inspire loyalty among their staff members and have a legion of former aides still offering support and advice.\n\nSteve Law, a former McConnell chief of staff and campaign hand who now runs the \u201csuper PAC\u201d American Crossroads, recalled running into a former Reid hand during the great Washington blizzard of 2010. Facing impassable roads, Law settled in for the night at a hotel just across the Potomac River, struck up a conversation with the Reid-ite and found much common ground. \u201cWhen you are stranded at the Key Bridge Marriott, all you can do is drink whiskey and swap stories, and it was amazing how similar our recollections were,\u201d Law told me.\n\n5. He\u2019s not above taking advantage of a little voter ignorance.\n\nIn his first Senate bid in 1984, McConnell had, by virtue of his background in Kentucky\u2019s largest city, been targeted as the \u201curban\u201d candidate by the incumbent Democrat he was challenging. Six years later, running against Sloane, he was immune to that attack: Sloane was also from Louisville. This pleased McConnell greatly. \u201cI\u2019m up in eastern Kentucky campaigning, run into a couple old boys, and one of them said, \u2018Senator, you\u2019re going to be re-elected,\u2019 \u201d he recounted. \u201cI said, \u2018I sure am glad to hear that.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why is that?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, you know that feller Sloane, he\u2019s from Louisville.\u2019 I said thank you and moved right along.\u201d\n\n6. In facing Grimes, he\u2019s also facing the Clintons.\n\nGrimes calls herself a \u201cClinton Democrat,\u201d which is genuine as a reflection of her family\u2019s relationship to the Clintons but also politically smart in a state Bill Clinton carried twice. When I asked her about McConnell\u2019s attempt to link her to the current Democratic president, she tested out a \u201cwon\u2019t be long now\u201d line I\u2019ve heard from other Southern Democrats. \u201cKentuckians know how to do arithmetic, and they realize that the president has two more years left on his term and we are electing a senator for the next six,\u201d she said.\n\n7. Coal isn\u2019t the only crisis in Eastern Kentucky.\n\nMcConnell has made coal a central element of his campaign, and there is little doubt that the future of mining is a pressing issue in a state where 90 percent of residents have coal-powered electricity and two regions of the state have coal-based economies. But Eastern Kentucky, the poorest region of a poor state, has a problem just as acute as the future of mining: the abuse of prescription drugs. On the day I traveled to the area with McConnell last month, two local newspapers carried front-page headlines about what has become an epidemic. News of the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention visiting the region dominated one front page, and an article about the sentencing of the owners of a pain clinic for illegally distributing Oxycodone was spread across another. Over lunch at a stop in Pikeville, an aide to Representative Harold Rogers, who represents the area, related a gripping statistic: In a six-week period last year, 13 children who go to the Harlan Boys & Girls Club lost a parent to a prescription drug overdose, 11 of whom witnessed their parent die.\n\n8. McConnell and Grimes both have reasons for not pressing Obamacare.\n\nIt is not exactly a mutual nonaggression pact, but neither McConnell nor Grimes has an interest in focusing on the Affordable Care Act. Grimes has been nudged by some Kentucky Democrats to embrace a law that has nearly halved the state\u2019s uninsured population, but she has so far resisted out of fear of giving McConnell any opportunity to link her to an issue so identified with Obama, who is quite unpopular in the state. McConnell criticizes Grimes for supporting the health law, but he and his allies have been more focused on linking her to what they see as the more culturally resonant issue of coal.\n\nEven if no one is trumpeting its success on the campaign trail, Obamacare has been successful in Kentucky. This is especially true in the impoverished eastern part of the state, where McConnell hopes to cut into Grimes\u2019s margins or even win some traditionally Democratic counties. Most of those now insured under the law in this region (and in much of the state) are receiving coverage through the expansion of Medicaid, which Gov. Steven L. Beshear, unlike most Southern governors, accepted.\n\nMcConnell criticized Beshear for accepting the Medicaid expansion, calling it \u201ca mistake,\u201d and said he wanted to repeal the entire law \u201croot and branch.\u201d But when I pressed him about the politics of taking away Medicaid from those individuals that now have it, he suggested that was unlikely \u2013 even while still faulting Beshear for the decision. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it will be taken away from them,\u201d McConnell said of the expanded Medicaid coverage. Speaking about Beshear and Kentucky\u2019s state government, he added: \u201cThey\u2019ve made the decision to expand it, they\u2019re gonna have to pay for it.\u201d\n\n9. His rivalry with Grimes is bigger than the Senate race.\n\nSome may identify Kentucky with its famous rite of spring, the Kentucky Derby. But the sport that actually consumes most Kentuckians is college basketball. McConnell cheers for his alma mater, the University of Louisville. Grimes lives in Lexington and pulls for the hometown team, the University of Kentucky. These allegiances to U. of L. and U.K., to use the local shorthand, can make for a delicate political topic because of the intense rivalry between the schools. But the astute politician knows how to toe the line. When Bill Clinton visited Kentucky earlier this year, he noted at a Grimes fundraiser in Louisville that he was friends with both John Calipari and Rick Pitino, respectively the head coaches for the men\u2019s basketball teams at the University of Kentucky and University of Louisville.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140903105842, "BN": "6thfloor", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "magazine/6thfloor", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/6thfloor/post", "per": "Grimes, Alison Lundergan;McConnell, Mitch", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Grimes Alison Lundergan,McConnell Mitch,Elections Senate,United States Politics and Government,Republican Party,Kentucky,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/6thfloor/9 Things You Maybe Didn't Know About Mitch McConnell ( 20140903 )", "news_keywords": "Alison Lundergan Grimes,Kentucky,Mitch McConnell,Republicans,Senate races,US Politics", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jonathan Martin", "SCG": "6thfloor", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jonathan Martin", "byl": "Jonathan Martin", "twitter": {"description": "Here are a few more facts about the Mitch McConnell, his state and his opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, that you may not know.", "title": "9 Things You Maybe Didn't Know About Mitch McConnell", "url": "http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/9-things-you-maybe-didnt-know-about-mitch-mcconnell/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/02/magazine/McConnellBlog1/McConnellBlog1-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "creator": "@jmartnyt", "site": "@nytmag", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003088971, "description": "Here are a few more facts about the Mitch McConnell, his state and his opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, that you may not know.", "CG": "Magazine", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "September 3, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1409756322, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/jonathan_martin/index.html", "section": "Magazine", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/magazine/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-09-03T16:02:01-04:00"}, "geo": "Kentucky", "utime": 20140903160201, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140903, "pdate": 20140903, "des": "Elections, Senate;United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/02/magazine/McConnellBlog1/McConnellBlog1-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "The 6th Floor Blog", "description": "Here are a few more facts about the Mitch McConnell, his state and his opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, that you may not know.", "title": "9 Things You Maybe Didn't Know About Mitch McConnell", "url": "http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/9-things-you-maybe-didnt-know-about-mitch-mcconnell/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/02/magazine/McConnellBlog1/McConnellBlog1-videoSixteenByNine600-v2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://6thfloor.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/9-things-you-maybe-didnt-know-about-mitch-mcconnell/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "9 Things You Maybe Didn't Know About Mitch McConnell", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/02/magazine/McConnellBlog1/McConnellBlog1-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "September 3, 2014"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhere Senator McConnell excels is that I don\u2019t think he holds a grudge,\u201d is how Paul put it to me.\nPaul was, however, less effusive when I asked what political lessons he had learned from watching McConnell campaign.\nAs his state and his party have moved to the right over the years, McConnell has shifted to keep pace.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that it will be taken away from them,\u201d McConnell said of the expanded Medicaid coverage.\nOr at least that was the premise of a story that Hunter Bates, a former McConnell chief of staff, told me."}
