How can the highest European Court, in such a sensitive matter, ignore its own case law, while introducing a significant error at the heart of its argument?\u201d questioned a statement from the The European Center for Law and Justice.\n\nWND reported recently on the case, in which the European Court of Human Rights approved a policy of imposing euthanasia on patients who cannot agree.\n\nIt came in a ruling in the case of Vincent Lambert of France.\n\nHis parents, sister and half-brother petitioned the court to protect him after he \u201csustained serious head injuries in a road-traffic accident on 29 September 2008, which left him tetraplegic and in a state of complete dependency.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been treated in several hospitals, but physiotherapy sessions yielded no results, and doctors determined he was in a \u201cchronic vegetative state,\u201d described as \u201cminimally conscious plus.\u201d\n\nThe court found that not only can a bureaucracy decide on euthanasia, the victim\u2019s parents lack the right to intervene.\n\nThat decision, according to spokesman Gregor Puppinck of the ECLJ, cited a previous case the human rights body had decided, Glass v. the United Kingdom, in asserting the legitimacy of plans to euthanize the accident victim.\n\nIn that case, which was similar to the Lambert case, \u201cthe mother of a child hospitalized for respiratory disorders complained about the decision of the medical team to administer to her minor son, against her will, a high dose of morphine that may cause his death,\u201d the ECLJ reported.\n\n\u201cThe doctors elected to not resuscitate him in the event of a respiratory crisis. Wishing to defend the life of her son against a medical decision, the patient\u2019s mother brought her case to the ECHR, as in the Lambert case.\u201d\n\nIn that case, the same ECHR found, \u201cthe decision of the authorities to override the second applicant\u2019s objection to the proposed treatment in the absence of authorization by a court resulted in a breach of Article 8 of the Convention.\u201d\n\nThe ruling found \u201cthat there has been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\u201d\n\nSo, the ECLJ said, \u201cDoctors should either respect the will of the mother or obtain an injunction against her decision. \u201d\n\nBut the Lambert decision that quoted the earlier precedent said, erroneously, \u201cthere had been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention.\u201d\n\nPuppinck noted there is no appeal available from the ECHR\u2019s Grand Chamber. But he said it\u2019s likely there will be some maneuver implemented to get around it.\n\n\u201cOne cannot imagine that this error will stay; it shall be removed. Thus, the Lambert case is not closed at the ECHR,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTo limit the consequences of this error, some will argue that only the final decision of the court matters (i.e. the operative words) and that an error of reasoning does not affect the final decision. The court would have to admit openly \u2013 and it is true, that its decision is not strictly deduced from the legal reasoning. Indeed, in fact the court, after having decided on the merits, built its reasoning in order to explain the decision and to develop its doctrinal corpus. This teleological method may have provided the opportunity for error to arise.\n\n\u201cOthers will say that to err is human. This is true; but the life of a man is at stake here,\u201d the ECLJ said.\n\nThe Lambert case has created a controversy of its own, with judges who dissented in the 12-5 decision writing, \u201cIn 2010, to mark its 50th anniversary, the court accepted the title of \u2018The Conscience of Europe\u2019 when publishing a book with that very title. Assuming, for the same of argument, that an institution, as opposed to the individuals who make up that institution, can have a conscience, such a conscience must not only be well informed but must also be underpinned by high moral or ethical values. These values should always be the guiding light, irrespective of all of the legal chaff that may be tossed about in the course of analyzing a case.\n\n\u201cIt is not sufficient to acknowledge, as is done in paragraph 181 of the judgment, that a case \u2018concerns complex medical, legal and ethical matters\u2019; it is of the very essence of a conscience \u2026 that ethical matters should be allowed to shape and guide the legal reasoning to its proper final destination. That is what conscience is all about. We regret that the court has, with this judgment, forfeited the above-mentioned title.\u201d\n\nThe dissenting judges Lambert is not dead and can breathe on his own and digest food.\n\n\u201cIn other words, Vincent Lambert is alive, and being cared for. What, we therefore ask, can justify a state in allowing a doctor \u2026 in this not so much to \u2018pull the plug\u2019 (Lambert is not on any life-support machine) as to withdraw or discontinue feeding and hydration so as to, in effect, starve Vincent Lambert to death?\u201d\n\nWND reported that the decision recalled the decision a decade ago that ordered doctors to stop providing food and water to Terri Schiavo.\n\nWND reported extensively on the Schiavo case, including on the 10th anniversary of her death.\n\nA care facility stopped giving her food or water in 2005 on court instructions, and less than two weeks later, she was dead.\n\n\u201cIf you go back and look at her records, she was starting to form words,\u201d her brother, Bobby Schindler, told WND on that occasion. \u201cIt was really encouraging to our family, and to Michael (Terri\u2019s husband) right at first.\u201d\n\nTerri had collapsed in her Florida home for an unknown reason and was taken to a hospital by first responders who feared she was dead. She was comatose for a time, then started responding and was moved to a care center. Her family members say she was getting better.\n\nThen there was a deterioration in Terri\u2019s condition. Bobby Schindler alleges it was after Michael Schiavo, her husband, started dating that he cut off Terri\u2019s therapy and then eventually petitioned the court to withdraw treatment, which included food and water.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the timeline, and you see Michael\u2019s actions, you can see that this was all calculated,\u201d Schindler alleged.\n\nThe case brought to headlines and kitchen tables across America the plight of those who are seriously brain injured, their rights and whether or not they are cognizant of their surroundings. The case generated four requests to the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene, and all were rejected.\n\nJeb Bush, a 2016 GOP presidential candidate, was governor of Florida at the time and filed several documents on behalf of Terri. But eventually, according to his press secretary at the time, he concluded the outcome was \u201cin the court\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nBush wrote a letter to the probate judge who ordered Terri\u2019s feeding tube be removed and filed a friend-of-the-court brief in an unsuccessful motion to bring the case under federal jurisdiction.\n\nGet the book that powerfully and comprehensively tells \u201cTerri\u2019s Story,\u201d or \u201cFighting for Dear Life,\u201d both available at the WND Superstore.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "An error has been uncovered in an international tribunal\u2019s ruling that would allow officials in France to euthanize a man seriously injured in a 2008 road accident, according to one of the human rights organizations that argued on behalf of the man. \u201cThis is an obvious and appalling error that is hard to explain.
