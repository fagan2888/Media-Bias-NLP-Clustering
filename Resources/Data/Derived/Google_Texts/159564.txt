As debate heats up over “New York values,” a New York entrepreneur is providing a way for men to masturbate in public as a way to reduce stress and leave more focused on their work.

Adam Lewis and his “award-winning sex toy brand Hot Octopuss” are introducing “the world’s first ‘GuyFi’ male stress relief booth in Manhattan,” according to a press release. The “booth” appears to be an old telephone kiosk with a chair, a curtain, and an Internet connection.

The press release explains further: “According to Time Out, a remarkable 39% of New Yorkers ‘self-soothe’ in the workplace to alleviate stress. Hot Octopuss has created the GuyFi booth to take this habit out of the office and into a more suitable environment designed to give the busy Manhattan man the privacy, and the high-speed Internet connection, he deserves.”

Lewis adds: “At Hot Octopuss we are all about looking for new solutions to improve everyday life and we feel we’ve done just that with the new GuyFi booth. We hope the city’s men enjoy using the space we’ve created in whatever way they want. It’s completely free of charge… all that we ask is they thank us when they get their promotion!

“We’ve aimed our booth at men because they are our main customers but we invite people of all genders to use. And don’t worry, we are working on solutions specifically tailored for women and trans people too.”

It is not clear whether anyone is actually using the booths. Temperatures are below freezing this week.

Meanwhile, on the other coast, Californians are becoming more introspective about why people “love to hate” them, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Some of the reasons include: “We’re obsessed with plastic surgery and looking perfect”; “if we’re not materialistic, then we’re just weird hippies”; and “we’re having more fun.”
