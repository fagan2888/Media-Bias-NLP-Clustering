Sioux Falls, SD

Sioux Falls woke up this morning under cold, grey skies, but that couldn't stop the 5,500 runners who turned out for the 2015 Avera Race Against Breast Cancer.

The race was over within hours, but fighting breast cancer is a marathon in its own way: one much longer and less predictable.

Of course, having an enthusiastic support group helps. On days like this, they're everywhere, pulling together for breast cancer patients and survivors alike.

Nationwide, an estimated three million women live with breast cancer, and while the survival rate continues to climb, doctors are recommending a proactive approach.

Kathleen Fesler ran for the E Team to support her friend Jenn's mother.

"When we found out Jenn's mom had cancer, we wanted to be there for her," Fesler said.

Breast cancer survivor Susie Winter has been in remission for a little over two years.

"They wanted to take every step possible to make sure that I was cancer-free," Winter said.

Early detection is key to winning the fight against breast cancer. That's why Avera is working to keep screenings convenient with their mobile imaging truck.

"You're able to find cancer far before you would ever be able to feel it," Avera Breast Center Quality Control Mammographer Jasele Brue said.

Avera also has a Mobile Digital Mammography unit. The truck is helping their doctors to reach patients who might not otherwise stop at a clinic.

"We go to various businesses, libraries, fairs. It's just a yearly preventative screening test that every woman about age 40 should do," Brue said.

Fighting cancer can feel like a marathon, but not knowing how the race will end doesn't mean you shouldn't run.

Saturday's race raised $400,000 for cancer care and research.
