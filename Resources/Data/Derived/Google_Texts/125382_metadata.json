They submitted those briefs on April 12.\n\nToday, the government and religious organizations submitted their responses to those filings.\n\nA diverse, ecumenical coalition is suing the Obama administration over the opt-out process, saying it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n\nInstitutions with deeply held religious objections to providing contraception, sterilization, or abortifacient drugs must certify their views in writing. That triggers the insurance companies to provide those drugs \u2013 something the Little Sisters of the Poor, among others, say makes them a cooperating party in sin.\n\nReligious petitioners asked for the government to allow insurance companies to offer separate insurance policies that cover only contraception. When religious employers do not purchase an all-inclusive health insurance plan, the insurance companies could contact female employers and offer the separate plan at no cost.\n\nThe government brief, filed by Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr., replies that requiring women to accept or activate such coverage would create a \u201cbarrier to the delivery of preventive services.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's actually pretty condescending,\u201d Mark Rienzi, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, told LifeSiteNews during a conference call late this afternoon. Women are perfectly capable of \u201cpicking up the phone\u201d and calling insurers, he said.\n\nVerrilli's response also states that the Obama administration \u201cspecifically considered contraceptive-only policies during rulemaking proceedings, but adopted a different approach,\u201d because some state insurance laws would make the policies \u201cunworkable.\u201d\n\nRienzi replied, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act expressly preempts any contrary state law\u201d from taking effect. Besides, federal law supersedes state law, he said; that's just \u201cthe way the Constitution works.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration also argued that \u201cit would be startling to hold that RFRA entitles a religious objector not only to an exemption, but also to insist on being exempted without notifying anyone.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\n\nHowever, Rienzi said that the government brief essentially admits there are less restrictive means available than the current government scheme, which violates RFRA's guarantee of the free exercise of religion.\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters did not file a lawsuit early in this process,\u201d Rienzi told LifeSiteNews. \u201cThey waited, because they trusted the government\u201d would accommodate their consciences.\n\nThe Sisters have said from the outset that \u201call they want to do is be out of the process and focus on caring for the elderly poor, as they have for the last 175 years,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was echoed by the nuns themselves. \u201cWe are so grateful that the [Supreme] Court asked to hear more about our case,\" said Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, mother provincial for the Little Sisters of the Poor. \u201cWe just want to focus on our mission of serving the elderly poor as we have for the last 175 years while being faithful to the teachings of our church.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is about the freedom of all Americans to follow their faith,\u201d said Dr. Blair Blackburn, president of East Texas Baptist University. \u201cWe simply ask the Court to recognize that ETBU is a conscientious objector, and that the federal government is insisting that we act as a conscientious collaborator.\u201d\n\nDr. Robert Sloan, president of Houston Baptist University, said he is \u201chopeful that the Supreme Court will let us continue to serve our students and others.\u201d\n\nJustices are expected to rule on Zubik v. Burwell in June.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "Both sides filed their last legal motions before the Supreme Court is expected to rule.", "title": "Obama admin\u2019s HHS mandate case is \u2018condescending\u2019 to women: Little Sisters\u2019 attorney", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/25409435063_ddeb952f9c_k.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/the-obama-admins-hhs-mandate-case-is-condescending-to-women-little-sisters", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "Both sides filed their last legal motions before the Supreme Court is expected to rule."}, "description": "Both sides filed their last legal motions before the Supreme Court is expected to rule.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Little Sisters did not file a lawsuit early in this process,\u201d Rienzi told LifeSiteNews.\nReligious petitioners asked for the government to allow insurance companies to offer separate insurance policies that cover only contraception.\nA diverse, ecumenical coalition is suing the Obama administration over the opt-out process, saying it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA).\n\u201cWe are so grateful that the [Supreme] Court asked to hear more about our case,\" said Sister Loraine Marie Maguire, mother provincial for the Little Sisters of the Poor.\nThat triggers the insurance companies to provide those drugs \u2013 something the Little Sisters of the Poor, among others, say makes them a cooperating party in sin."}
