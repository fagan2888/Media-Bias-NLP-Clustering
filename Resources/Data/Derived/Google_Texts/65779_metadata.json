So would we\n\nToday marks the 38th day since I asked the Dept. of Veterans Affairs in Washington, D.C., for an on-the-record official to discuss why disability compensation cases were being transferred from Baltimore and Philadelphia to Wilmington and other northeast Veterans Benefits Administration offices last year, increasing Wilmington\u2019s backlog \u2013 which continues to grow despite an overall national trend in the opposite direction.\n\nWe went to VA in Washington because Wilmington is essentially a satellite of the larger Philadelphia office and has no spokesman. Philadelphia does, but the office is only occasionally responsive and has been completely non-responsive on the why of this issue.\n\nOn Dec. 17, a VA public affairs officer in Washington offered me an off-the-record background briefing on the issue. That means I couldn\u2019t quote anything said. More to the point, it meant that I might learn a lot but that VA was not going to offer up an official to publicly account for the growing backlog at Wilmington.\n\nAgencies in Washington love to offer background to reporters, who will often take it in the absence of nothing to give their readers. Backgrounders, however, lack the credibility the words gain coming from an identifiable public official from an agency.\n\nIn VA\u2019s case, it\u2019s the height of arrogance \u2013 and a lack of responsiveness that is an insult to every veteran left waiting at Wilmington.\n\nThe backlog is an important issue. Veterans waiting for Wilmington to process their compensation cases are having to wait even longer because the caseload has grown. These are folks who are claiming service-related injuries or maladies that in many cases interfere with their ability to fully function \u2013 to hold a job, among other challenges. For them, compensation isn\u2019t some sort of bonus. It\u2019s part of the nation\u2019s payback for their service \u2013 absent which they wouldn\u2019t have the injury or malady.\n\nWhen I asked in mid-November for an explanation, Wilmington\u2019s backlog had grown from 654 to 903 since March 30, a span of time when VA\u2019s national backlog had fallen from 569,547 to 382,473. (It\u2019s since ticked up again, to 400,546.)\n\nAccording to the latest weekly report from VA, dated Jan. 21, Wilmington\u2019s 903 has grown over the past two months to 1,050.\n\nLast summer, VA told me that a major reason for the growth at Wilmington was that 774 cases were \u201cbrokered\u201d \u2013 government-speak for transferring cases from one VBA to another \u2013 to Wilmington from Baltimore (262) and Philadelphia (512) during fiscal year 2013. (I was also told by the Philadelphia Regional Office that 300 cases with pending appeals were sent to Philadelphia because Wilmington lacked a proper review officer.) According to e-mails provided by the Philadelphia Regional Office, Baltimore brokered cases to five other VBA offices as well. Its backlog fell between March 30 and mid-November from 15,661 to 6,608.\n\nIt\u2019s apparent that VA doesn\u2019t want to talk about this.\n\nMy most recent query on the backlog issue topic was sent to VA in Washington Nov. 19. That got an immediate reply: \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d On Nov. 25, I was sent some background on the practice of brokering and a promise that \u201cwe\u2019re checking now to see who could be available to talk.\u201d On Dec. 3, I asked again for that interview. On Dec. 17, I was sent a note with an apology for not getting back to me \u201clast week,\u201d and the background briefing offer. I countered that I wanted an accountable official who could talk on the record.\n\nI, and our readers, are still waiting.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Want to know why Wilmington's VA compensation case backlog keeps growing?\nWe went to VA in Washington because Wilmington is essentially a satellite of the larger Philadelphia office and has no spokesman.\nWhen I asked in mid-November for an explanation, Wilmington\u2019s backlog had grown from 654 to 903 since March 30, a span of time when VA\u2019s national backlog had fallen from 569,547 to 382,473.\nMy most recent query on the backlog issue topic was sent to VA in Washington Nov. 19.\nAccording to the latest weekly report from VA, dated Jan. 21, Wilmington\u2019s 903 has grown over the past two months to 1,050."}
