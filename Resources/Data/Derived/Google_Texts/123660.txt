On May 1, 2015, 8-year-old Lake Bozman lost his long battle with acute myeloid leukemia, but thanks to the skills of Georgia-based photographer Brandy Angel, he was still able to take part in his parents’ wedding months later.

This past year, Lake’s mother, Anna Bozman Thompson, married long-time boyfriend Travis Thompson. According to Anna, although she was able to feel her son’s presence on her wedding day, it was difficult to take family pictures without him.

“I could feel my emotions taking over after the ceremony when it was time to take pictures. I became anxious and almost irritated, but I knew these pictures had to be taken,” Anna shared in a Facebook post.

So, she asked Angel to superimpose an old image of him on the new wedding photos, which Angel achieved by blending a family portrait taken months earlier with the wedding shot.

“I needed this picture more than she or anyone could ever know,” Anna told UK's The Times. “This is my family. And we will be together again.”

The heart-touching photos have since gone viral, with Angel remarking that at one point they were trending even more than the Kardashians, USA Today reported. Angel believes that so many people are moved by the touching image because we’ve all lost someone along the way.

This isn’t the first time Angel has helped families dealing with sickness and tragedy through her photography. She has helped others receive life-saving organ donations and granted dying wishes all with the power of her images. Last year she started a nonprofit foundation, Be The Change-Brandy Angel Foundation, to help further her efforts.
