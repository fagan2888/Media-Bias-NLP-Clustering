Yes! Yes!\n\nWe definitely need more of this kind of query in our political debates. First of all, it perks up an audience. And you learn stuff. As the yes-or-no segment went on, we discovered that all the candidates had gotten speeding tickets and that the Tea Party guy was once charged with carrying a gun in an airport.\n\nAlaska is one of the states that will decide which party controls the Senate next term. The incumbent, Democrat Mark Begich, is running hard as a moderate who works hand-in-hand with Alaska\u2019s Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski. (Murkowski recently served Begich with a cease-and-desist letter, demanding that he stop running ads showing them smiling at each other.)\n\nOne of the Republican contenders, Joe Miller, is so far to the right that he\u2019s practically in Canada. Miller, who\u2019s obsessed with immigration and \u201camnesty,\u201d recently sent out a mailer covered with pictures of scary-looking, tattooed Hispanic men. \u201cBegich wants them to vote. And if 20 million illegals vote, you can kiss the 2nd amendment goodbye,\u201d it read.\n\nBesides being racist and incredibly offensive, the flier appeared to be arguing that criminals are sneaking across our southern border bent on making firearms illegal. \u201cNow who would be more against gun control than Salvadoran gangsters?\u201d wondered Michael Carey, a columnist for the Alaska Dispatch.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFour years ago, Miller actually won the Republican Senate nomination, knocking out Murkowski after claiming she had changed her positions \u201cmore often than a moose sheds its antlers.\u201d The moose ad was the high point of his campaign, as opposed to, say, the time his security guards handcuffed a reporter.\n\nCooler heads prevailed in November, and Murkowski got re-elected as a write-in candidate. In the Senate, she votes with the Republicans most of the time, but she works well with Democrats. Except Mark Begich who, really, was just there in the room when she was smiling at an amusing joke she happened to remember.\n\nThe two normal Republicans in the race \u2014 Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell and former Attorney General Dan Sullivan \u2014 are pretty much sticking to running against federal spending. \u201cI\u2019m not going to Washington with a gunny sack to bring home federal money,\u201d Treadwell announced during the debate. \u201cI\u2019m going with a crowbar to pry loose our liberties.\u201d\n\nYet \u2014 you\u2019ve already guessed this, right? \u2014 Alaska gets more federal money per person than any other state. And there\u2019s virtually no discussion of eliminating anything its residents \u2014 who pay no state income tax or sales tax \u2014 get now. During the debate, all three Republicans supported more spending on the military and a continuation of Alaska\u2019s super-subsidized mail service.\n\nWe have been through this before in Mississippi. First, the candidate decries Washington spendthrifts. Then, when pressed for ideas on ways to cut back, he comes up with Obamacare and something totally unrelated to his home state. In Mississippi, it was Alaska\u2019s Bridge to Nowhere. However, many Alaskans still believe that $398 million span between Ketchikan and Gravina Island was a perfectly reasonable idea.\n\nDuring the debate, Sullivan referred to any federal program he liked as \u201cinfrastructure.\u201d Treadwell said his fiscal restraint did not cover stuff his state actually needs. (\u201cIf we need an icebreaker with 44,000 miles of coastline, I\u2019m going to fight for it. If we need sanitation, I\u2019m going to fight for it.\u201d)\n\nIf the Senate nomination was the only thing on the ballot Tuesday, we could anticipate a turnout of about somewhere from 6 to 16 people, depending on how many of Joe Miller\u2019s eight children are old enough to vote. But there\u2019s more! Including a big referendum on taxing oil companies, with Sarah Palin urging her fans to tax the rich.\n\nPalin has been a wing nut for so long that we\u2019ve forgotten that she made her name in Alaska as an actual reformer. Her great achievement as governor was a law that taxed oil companies at rates between 25 percent and 75 percent, depending on their profits. After she abandoned the state midterm for the glories of reality television and Fox News commentary, the Legislature backtracked and eventually replaced the sliding scale with a flat tax of 35 percent.\n\nGrass-roots opponents collected enough signatures to get a vote on restoring the old system. Unfortunately, the roots are being outspent about 100 to 1 by the oil companies. And Palin\u2019s 18-minute monologue in support of her signature reform \u2014 broadcast on her SarahPalin channel \u2014 has the overall effect of being trapped in an airplane with a seatmate who has inhaled helium.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLook them in the eye and say: \u2018You\u2019d better look Big Oil in the eye!\u2019 \u201d Palin said.
