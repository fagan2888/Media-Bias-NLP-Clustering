The issue is of particular urgency for the hospitals this year because the federal government plans to stop funding the LIP program, or Low Income Pool, which pays hospitals for the care they provide to low-income patients.\n\nThat would leave the two systems, combined, looking at a budget hole of $140 million to $150 million.\n\nOrlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, a Democrat, said he has \"been talking with our local business leaders and hospital partners to understand this complex issue and the proposals in the Legislature\" and hopes to reach a solution \"that ensures both access to health care for our most vulnerable residents and financial stability for our state.\"\n\nRepublican leaders in the state Senate have been receptive to discussing the idea of expansion. On Tuesday, a Senate committee will take up an alternative known as the Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange Program, or FHIX.\n\nRather than expanding Medicaid in its current form, that proposal would set up a state exchange that relies heavily on federal money to buy private insurance for uninsured Floridians. But it would also place additional conditions on people seeking coverage.\n\nThe state House leadership remains opposed.\n\nBut in Orlando, with Dyer and Jacobs on board, advocates of expansion see a unique opportunity.\n\n\"The important thing ... is, for the first time businesses have lined up in favor of expansion,\" said Mike Griffin, vice president of public affairs for Florida Hospital. \"For the first time, Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Chamber and the Senate have all got proposals out there.\"\n\nFlorida Hospital's Griffin is hopeful a proposal can be crafted to win bipartisan support and eventually get Gov. Rick Scott's signature.\n\n\"The legislative process will have fits and starts to it, but to have the Senate at this point put forth a thoughtful piece of legislation, that's a good sign,\" he said.\n\ndbreen@orlandosentinel.com or 407-420-5189", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Area business, political leaders line up to push health-care expansion", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act went nowhere the past two legislative sessions in Tallahassee.", "title": "Area business, political leaders line up to push health-care expansion", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-medicaid-expansion-business-support-20150309-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54fe0246/turbine/os-medicaid-expansion-business-support-20150309", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp13.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Central Florida leaders push Medicaid expansion", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/83013538", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-09", "Description": "The expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act went nowhere the past two legislative sessions in Tallahassee.
