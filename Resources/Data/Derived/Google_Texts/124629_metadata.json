Of course, we\u2019re talking about Medicaid Expansion.\n\nThis has been quite controversial, but a great discussion, if you\u2019re into seeing both sides of an issue. There are pros and cons to Wyoming adopting the expansion, but over all, is it really a good idea?\n\nIf you\u2019re on the pro side, then your argument is basically, \u201cWe have about 17,000 residents in Wyoming who would benefit from it and hospitals are dying without the reimbursements. Plus, our businesses are paying Federal tax and we should benefit from that.\u201d\n\nIf your against the expansion, then your argument is basically, \u201cIf we take on Medicaid expansion, we are supporting Obamacare and our state just can\u2019t afford it right now. Plus, all of the \u201cout of the woods\u201d residents who would qualify for Medicaid on top of the people that already qualify, could very well brake us here in Wyoming.\u201d\n\nSo, both arguments are valid, but are they workable? It seems that the argument, among lawmakers in D.C. and possibly in Wyoming, to abolish \u201cObamacare\u201d seems to be wearing down. In other words, lawmakers on the Republican side seem to be accepting the fact that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay, therefore, they are not interested in getting rid of it. Nor do they really know exactly how.\n\nIf that is the case, then should Wyoming adopt Medicaid Expansion to refurbish funds to hospitals and help out people that need it? In smaller towns throughout the Cowboy State, hospitals feel the financial pinch much more than the bigger ones.\n\nIf legislatures do plan to write up a bill and pass it in the 2016 legislative budget session in Wyoming, it should be done with the understanding that when the Federal dollars run out, then the program goes away.\n\nBut when it is all said and done, most people don\u2019t think that the country can continue to afford or financially support the ACA, and if the country can\u2019t afford it, then maybe Wyoming can\u2019t either.\n\nLawmakers Remain Undecided On Mediciad Expansion Here", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://k2radio.com/files/2014/12/MEDICAID-FLYER.jpg", "sailthru.author": "garyfreeman", "description": "It failed in the general session, but might be given another try in the 2016 Wyoming Legislative Budget Session.
