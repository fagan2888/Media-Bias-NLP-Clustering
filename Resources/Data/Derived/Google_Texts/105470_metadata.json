REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n4091020\n\nDemocrats claim three million people have enrolled in private health insurance through Obamacare. But how many have actually paid for their plans?\n\nSeveral state exchanges have begun reporting the number of customers that did pay their first premiums, and some results are as low as 51 percent.\n\nThe Obama administration defines HealthCare.gov enrollees as those who have simply selected plans, but not paid. If the limited data available plays out for more states, actual enrollment could be much lower than the three million private insurance signups currently claimed.\n\nOnly five of the 15 state exchanges clearly differentiate between paid enrollments and selected plans or completed applications. The remaining 35 states operating under HealthCare.gov make no such distinction.\n\nWhile the number of states reporting this information is small, they actually make up a good chunk of Obamacare\u2019s currently accepted 3 million nationwide enrollment total. According to the Obama administration\u2019s most recent detailed report on enrollment data, these five states \u2014 New York, California, Washington state, Nevada and Rhode Island \u2014 account for a third.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s exchange last reported that three-fourths of its reported enrollees had paid their first premiums, according to California Healthline; Washington\u2019s totals released Tuesday indicate that only 51 percent have purchased their plans.\n\nNew York\u2019s numbers are fuzzier, since the exchange itself doesn\u2019t separate applications for Medicaid and private plans. It counts 412,221 enrollments for public and private coverage (just 251,000 are private plans), but notes that another 697,000 customers have completed applications on the exchange website. If the entire 421,221 have paid (or accepted the low- to no-cost Medicaid coverage), New York\u2019s payment rate is only 59 percent.\n\nNevada\u2019s payment rate is just 66 percent \u2014 14,999 out of 22,597 so far \u2014 and Rhode Island has by far the best total, with 14,086 paid customers out of 16,512, for a payment rate of 85 percent.\n\nEven analysts who are pessimistic about Obamacare\u2019s chances of success believe most states will have a fairly high proportion of consumers follow through and pay their premiums. Health industry expert Bob Laszewski estimates that around 20 percent of so-called enrollees won\u2019t end up purchasing their coverage \u2014 just under Rhode Island\u2019s rate.\n\nBut the data available so far indicates a much lower share of fully-paid customers.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
