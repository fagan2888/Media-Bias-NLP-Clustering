White House press secretary Josh Earnest appeared on CNN’s “Reliable Sources” in his first Sunday show interview and defended the Obama administration as the “most transparent” in history.

Specifically, host Brian Stelter brought up a letter written last week by the Society of Professional Journalists in which 40 press groups command the president to be more transparent. Stelter asked Earnest if perhaps the Obama administration is “withholding more than ever.”

“I think the president’s record of transparency stands up to any of the records of his predecessors,” replied Earnest.

The CNN host then wondered whether Earnest himself could improve the flow of information to temper such accusations of the administration.

“Well, I definitely am committed and I have a responsibility in this job to try to help the president live up to his commitment to be the most transparent president in history,” the press secretary explained.

“I’m surprised that you still say that line: Most transparent president in history,” Stelter said, flabbergasted. “He has been criticized so many times for saying that given the prosecutions of whistle blowers and other steps. You all still stick by that line?”

“Absolutely,” Earnest said assuredly.

“There are a number of steps that we’ve taken to give people greater insight into the White House,” he added.

One of these “steps” involves allowing press to gain access to fundraisers that Obama attends at private homes. So, the president might not be completely honest about the NSA or Obamacare, but he’ll let you come to one of his swanky parties.
