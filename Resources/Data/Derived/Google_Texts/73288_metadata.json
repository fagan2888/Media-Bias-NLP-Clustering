Candidates including Cory Gardner of Colorado, Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Ed Gillespie and Barbara Comstock in Virginia, and Mike McFadden of Minnesota have announced they want birth control pills to be available over the counter.\n\nMr. Gardner wrote an op-ed explaining his position in The Denver Post on June 19. The candidate cites a 2012 study by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists saying that pharmacists and \u201cwomen themselves\u201d were able to effectively screen patients for risks related to contraception.\n\nMr. Gardner argues that offering birth control over the counter will save families money and time. He says that making a medication available at drugstores brings down the costs and saves women from unnecessary doctors\u2019 appointments. \u201cFewer unneeded doctors\u2019 appointments mean fewer missed workdays and child-care expenses, more productivity and more time with family. This is particularly true for rural families like mine where doctors are not always nearby.\u201d\n\nMr. Gardner also sees a political advantage: \u201cToo many people in Washington would rather play politics with contraception instead of actually making life easier for women. Too many Democrats prefer to attack Republicans on the issue of contraception rather than actually make contraception more available and affordable and too many Republicans are afraid to break the mold.\u201d\n\nReihan Salam writes in a column for National Review that conservatives can yet take the lead on social issues in this election. He applauds \u201cthe recent Republican embrace of allowing for the sale of birth control pills over the counter as a way of parrying liberal attacks\u201d that Republicans are out of step on social policies or are harming women\u2019s health. But the position is not only political; it is also, Mr. Salam argues, \u201cauthentically conservative\u201d and would empower women, especially ones who are uninsured. He concludes, \u201cOne hopes that this birth control shift will prefigure a new policy creativity on social issues.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Republicans are doing everything they can to appeal to women voters. According to an article in The Wall Street Journal (registration required), men favor Republicans over Democrats by 17 percentage points, whereas women prefer Democrats by 14. For that reason, Republicans are finding ways to criticize their opponents for undermining women, such as in a television ad claiming that Senator Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, pays his male staffers more than his female staffers.\n\nJonah Goldberg at National Review laughs off the idea that Republican control of Congress has been bad for women: \u201cBy any objective measure, things have been going great for women for a long time.\u201d He writes: \u201cwomen earn 57 percent of bachelor\u2019s degrees, 63 percent of master\u2019s degrees, and 53 percent of doctorates. They constitute the majority of the U.S. workforce and the majority of managers.\u201d He renames the recession \u201cthe mancession,\u201d a reference to the fact that women kept their jobs or went back to work more quickly than men.\n\nAll the same, Republicans are getting pushback about whether offering contraceptive pills over the counter would truly help women. Dr. Nancy L. Stanwood, a practicing ob-gyn and board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, told ThinkProgress that changing birth control\u2019s availability without ensuring that it is covered by health insurance will keep women from being able to get it. \u201cWe know that increasing access is important, but affordability is part of access,\u201d Dr. Stanwood said.\n\nMs. Stanwood notes that making birth control pills available over the counter is likely to mean they won\u2019t be covered by insurance, in effect weakening the provision of the Affordable Care Act that guarantees that insurance cover the total cost of contraception. It will likewise make insurance less likely to pay for other forms of contraception, such as the I.U.D., an expensive form of contraception that is also one of the most effective. Thomas M. Burton and Natalie Andrews write, in The Wall Street Journal, that the Food and Drug Administration would need to approve any such change, which would be initiated by the drug companies, not Congress.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has made clear its opposition to the plan and criticizes the opportunism of Mr. Gardner and others. \u201cIf Cory Gardner and others were serious about expanding access to birth control, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to repeal the no-copay birth control benefit,\u201d said Dawn Laguens, the executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in a news release. \u201cThis is simply a cynical political attempt to whitewash his terrible record and agenda for women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nThinkProgress catalogs some of the legislation supported by the candidates now purportedly in favor of supporting women\u2019s health needs. Mr. Tillis was House speaker when North Carolina\u2019s legislature passed an \u201cextreme provision that required doctors to force women to look at ultrasounds of their fetuses before getting an abortion.\u201d Ms. Comstock supported a similar mandatory ultrasound law that initially required a transvaginal ultrasound before an abortion could be performed and was later amended to accept an abdominal one. Mr. Tillis also led an effort to defund Planned Parenthood, and Ms. Comstock opposed a Medicaid expansion in Virginia that would cover 400,000 uninsured citizens, including an estimated 169,000 women.\n\nWhether the Republican\u2019s gambit will pay off with women voters remains to be seen. The Wall Street Journal quotes Marcy Stech, a spokeswoman for Emily\u2019s List, which raises money for pro-choice Democrats: \u201cVoters are too smart to fall for these false tactics,\u201d she said. \u201cRepublicans know they have this problem, and they keep thinking the fix to their problem is a cosmetic one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140929061023, "twitter": {"description": "Republican candidates want to make birth control pills available over the counter.
