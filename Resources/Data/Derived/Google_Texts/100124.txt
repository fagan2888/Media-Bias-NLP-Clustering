Most people took yesterday’s outage at the New York Stock Exchange in stride. Not Stephen Colbert.

In a video segment entitled “Apocalypse Dow,” the late-night comedian took to You Tube late Wednesday to offer his take on the stock-market shut-down, which hit on the same day that Chinese shares were crumbling and United Airlines was forced to ground dozens of flights because of a technical issue.

His reaction to the day’s events? He locked himself in his office with a stash of supplies, and proclaimed the arrival of the end times.

Wednesday’s events, he said, were a “festival of dread and an all-you-can-eat hysteria buffet.” Holding up a chart that showed stock-trading volumes, he cried:

“Do you understand that for nearly four hours, America’s bankers had no idea how rich they were?!”

(That’s not technically correct, of course. Even as trading ground to a halt on the NYSE floor, it continued on other platforms.)

Then he ran through the list of supplies he’d stockpiled in his “bunker,” including some bottled water, snack foods, three-hole-punched paper…and a chicken.

“I have prepared for the times when pain is the only law and blood is the only truth,” he cried.

Then he summoned an intern, who came in looking like a character from the latest Mad Max movie, and issued a command:

“Bring me the head of the false profit, Jim Cramer!”
