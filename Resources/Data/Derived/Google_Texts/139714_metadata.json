Taxpayers \u2013 both individuals and businesses \u2013 worked hard to ensure that they met deadlines, with more than 151 million of them filing electronically.\n\nProject at a glance Project: Integrated Enterprise Portal Program Office: Internal Revenue Service Technology used: Keynote application monitoring, ServiceNow Ticket Management, Akamai Global Traffic Management and Caching Services, McAfee Web Gateway, SoapSonar and SoapUI, TLS encryption Time To Implementation: 2.5 years from acquisition, 1 year for first phase, and an additional year for the second phase Before: Separate infrastructures for different portals meant limited ability to share data and content, difficulty meeting demand and managing systems and inconsistent user experiences. After: An integrated, scalable private cloud combines the functionality of 60 separate applications.\n\nWith the ever increasing numbers of e-filers, IRS officials knew their existing technology wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the demand from tax payers or the agency\u2019s 80,000 employees.\n\nThe IRS\u2019s existing electronic processing system was made up of disparate applications, each with its own infrastructure, limiting the agency\u2019s ability to share data internally and hampering its ability to serve taxpayers in an end-to-end fashion. In addition, the aging infrastructure didn\u2019t have the capabilities necessary to support the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Clearly, the system had to be completely overhauled.\n\nThe Integrated Enterprise Portal (IEP) was designed to be an innovative and cost-effective system that would provide a fully scalable, managed private cloud capability to the IRS, enabling one-stop, web-based services for internal and external users.\n\nTo maintain full control over the IEP program, the IRS team chose to act as program and project manager, overseeing a build-out, integrating the new portal with existing filing processes and providing strategic direction. Accenture performed the actual technology implementation.\n\nIt was also important to maintain control over the entire process because of the need to deliver the project on time and within budget. The \u201con time\u201d part was particularly important, as development had to be finished between busy periods on the public-facing website, IRS.gov.\n\n\u201cWe had a very small window to work with as far as deployment because the filing season starts in January, and a peak of returns coming in in April and October,\u201d said Robert Leahy, then IRS director of enterprise program implementation and now an associate CIO. Further shortening the window were three government furlough days during the development period in which the entire IRS was shut down and no work could get done.\n\n\u201cIt put a lot of pressure on the technology team, and it required very close coordination and strict adherence to schedules,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cWe locked down requirements and didn\u2019t allow any changes during the 18 month development cycle. That helped us stay focused on what needed to be done without getting sidetracked.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "IRS, ACA, Integrated Enterprise Portal, IEP, Accenture", "og": {"url": "https://gcn.com/articles/2014/10/06/gcn-award-irs-iep.aspx", "image": "https://gcn.com/~/media/GIG/GCN/Redesign/Articles/2014/October/IRS.png", "site_name": "GCN", "description": "The IRS used cloud and virtualization tools to create a more manageable web environment for employees and taxpayers and new capabilities in support of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Cloud-based portal kept IRS ahead of the e-filers -- GCN"}, "description": "The IRS used cloud and virtualization tools to create a more manageable web environment for employees and taxpayers and new capabilities in support of the Affordable Care Act."}, "article_summary": "2014 GCN AWARDSCloud-based portal kept IRS ahead of the e-filersDuring 2013, the Internal Revenue Service processed more than 240 million federal tax returns, collected nearly $2.9 trillion in gross taxes, and issued more than 121 million refunds.\nTaxpayers \u2013 both individuals and businesses \u2013 worked hard to ensure that they met deadlines, with more than 151 million of them filing electronically.\nWith the ever increasing numbers of e-filers, IRS officials knew their existing technology wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the demand from tax payers or the agency\u2019s 80,000 employees.\nTo maintain full control over the IEP program, the IRS team chose to act as program and project manager, overseeing a build-out, integrating the new portal with existing filing processes and providing strategic direction.\nThe \u201con time\u201d part was particularly important, as development had to be finished between busy periods on the public-facing website, IRS.gov."}
