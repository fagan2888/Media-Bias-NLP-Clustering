He\u2019s built a career helping others and says he\u2019s ready to be the leader our country needs. That requires making stops across the nation, especially in small communities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed coming to all of the smaller venues here in Iowa because you have a chance to be one-on-one with lots of people and really get a sense of who the American people are,\u201d Dr. Carson said. Dr. Carson addressed several issues including the Affordable Care Act, getting people to vote, and most notably a U.S. and Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst deals we\u2019ve ever done. It makes no sense. In no way does it stop them from making nuclear weapons, and all it does is makes it clear to the rest of the Middle East that they better get going on their nuclear projects,\u201d Dr. Carson said.\n\nHe admits he was on the brink of retirement, but now, he\u2019s embracing being put on a different path.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for somebody who\u2019s not a politician, who\u2019s not just trying to put another notch on their belt. Who has a history of solving problems, who loves his country, and wants to get us on the right track.\u201d\n\nFor those listening, including Doug Rozendaal, coming to events like this is educating yourself toward an educated presidential vote.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for all Iowans to get out and be involved in the process and meet these folks one-on-one, shake their hands, and learn what it is they have to say,\u201d Rozendaal said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In front of a packed house at Village Court in Mason City, Dr. Ben Carson shares why he's the best fit for leading our country.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411539697", "og": {"site_name": "KIMT 3", "description": "In front of a packed house at Village Court in Mason City, Dr. Ben Carson shares why he\u2019s the best fit for leading our country.", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson in Mason City", "url": "http://kimt.com/2015/07/16/dr-ben-carson-in-mason-city/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkimt.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/ben-carson-pkg.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In front of a packed house at Village Court in Mason City, Dr. Ben Carson shares why he\u2019s the best fit for leading our country.", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson in Mason City", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkimt.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/ben-carson-pkg.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@KIMTNews3", "site": "kimtnews3", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Iowa & Minnesota - Breaking News & Weather for Rochester, Mason City, Austin, Albert Lea, Charles City", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.kimt", "fb": {"pages": 89871599854}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kimt.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/7287d35464b7baee8309485b59e054fe?s=16", "application-name": "KIMT 3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KIMTNews3", "published_time": "2015-07-16T21:53:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-17T18:35:13+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "2i99Fl0hVU3wt8IF02PBCq2ak6-ypocTZjG02s19_M8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd979f\"", "article_summary": "MASON CITY, Iowa \u2013 In front of a packed house at Village Court in Mason City, Dr. Ben Carson shares why he\u2019s the best fit for leading our country.\nDr. Carson is a Detroit native and renowned neurosurgeon.\nDr. Carson addressed several issues including the Affordable Care Act, getting people to vote, and most notably a U.S. and Iran nuclear deal.\nIn no way does it stop them from making nuclear weapons, and all it does is makes it clear to the rest of the Middle East that they better get going on their nuclear projects,\u201d Dr. Carson said.\n\u201cPeople are looking for somebody who\u2019s not a politician, who\u2019s not just trying to put another notch on their belt."}
