The new eligibility rules will affect almost 20,000 uninsured patients.\n\nThe patients are currently uninsured, but according to officials at Harris Health, 77 percent of them could get insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThey just haven\u2019t yet because paying premiums and deductibles on those plans currently costs more than just going to Harris Health and paying nominal fees such as $3 per visit.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the out-of-pocket costs for insurance and the cost of free services, almost anyone would do the math and say why should I pay more?\u201d said Mike Norby, Harris Health\u2019s CFO.\n\nHarris Health had previously offered virtually free care to people earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Starting in March, the free care threshold will drop to 150 percent of the federal poverty level. An individual would only qualify if she makes less than $18,000 a year.\n\nThe board managers of Harris Health voted 7-1 Thursday morning to change the eligibility. They hope patients who earn more money than the new income threshold will enroll in the subsidized insurance plans available through the Affordable Care Act. Enrollment begins November 1.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a move in the right direction,\u201d said George Masi, CEO of Harris Health.\n\nHarris Health is facing a projected deficit of $53 million in the next fiscal year. The change in patient financial aid will cut the system\u2019s deficit, but only by half.\n\nMasi says the deficit would disappear completely if the state\u2019s Republican leaders would only expand Medicaid health coverage. Harris Health could then move 70,000 uninsured patients into Medicaid, netting $87 million in new revenue.\n\n\u201cIf you do a root cause analysis, and you want to talk about the reason, or reasons \u2013 clearly, in my opinion, it\u2019s the failure of the state to adopt Medicaid in an expanded fashion, per the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Masi said.\n\nRepublicans in Texas and some other states have refused because the expansion is linked to Obamacare.\n\nMasi said he is hopeful Republicans in Texas will eventually expand Medicaid, but it won\u2019t be for a few years, at least.\n\n\u201cWho knows what else is going to happen in the larger political sphere, but this gives us a lot of breathing room,\u201d Masi said.\n\nThe board managers said Thursday they might have to restrict financial aid even more next year. Norby said there is already a freeze on capital improvement projects and maintenance has been deferred. Waiting times for appointments could also increase.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Affordable Care Act", "description": "Harris Health will restrict financial aid to about 15,000 patients in an effort to push them to enroll in health care plans through the Affordable Care Act.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "Harris Health will restrict financial aid to about 15,000 patients in an effort to push them to enroll in health care plans through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Houston\u2019s Public Hospital Will Encourage More Patients To Enroll In Obamacare | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/09/24/127156/houstons-public-hospital-will-encourage-more-patients-to-enroll-in-obamacare/", "image": {"url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/24172600/harris-health-system-400px-310px-tn.png", "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/24172600/harris-health-system-400px-310px-tn.png"}, "type": "article"}, "wordCount": 451, "twitter": {"description": "Harris Health will restrict financial aid to about 15,000 patients in an effort to push them to enroll in health care plans through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Houston\u2019s Public Hospital Will Encourage More Patients To Enroll In Obamacare", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2015/09/24/127156/houstons-public-hospital-will-encourage-more-patients-to-enroll-in-obamacare/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/24172600/harris-health-system-400px-310px-tn.png", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Carrie Feibel", "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2015-09-24T12:26:00+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-09-24T12:26:00+00:00"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, News, aca, harris health, health science, news, obamacare", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1570\"", "article_summary": "Harris Health will restrict financial aid to about 15,000 patients in an effort to push them to enroll in health care plans through the Affordable Care Act.\nHarris Health had previously offered virtually free care to people earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\nThe new eligibility rules will affect almost 20,000 uninsured patients.\nStarting in March, the free care threshold will drop to 150 percent of the federal poverty level.\nHarris Health could then move 70,000 uninsured patients into Medicaid, netting $87 million in new revenue."}
