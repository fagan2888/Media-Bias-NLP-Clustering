Michelle Yoon and Imelda Plascencia\n\n\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The language around immigration and healthcare reform in this country has become a confusing jumble of acronyms: DACA. DAPA. PRUCOL. ACA.\n\n\n\nBut the alphabet soup that has found its way into the national dialogue in recent months was demystified to about a dozen ethnic media reporters by immigration and health care advocates here Dec. 17 so that they in turn could explain it to their communities and urge them to take advantage.\n\n\n\nMarielena Hincapi\u00e9 is executive director of the National Immigration Law Center. She called President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA) program something \u201cthat has been fought for and won by immigrants themselves.\u201d And, she noted: \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a life-changing situation for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnnounced on Nov. 20 as part of the president\u2019s executive action, DAPA is open to some 5 million undocumented immigrants nationwide \u2013 about 1.6 million of them in California. It provides a temporary reprieve from deportation for undocumented parents whose children are American citizens or legal permanent residents, and who have lived in the country for at least five years and have not committed serious crimes. DAPA status is renewable every three years.\n\n\n\nThe Executive Action also expands DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) by removing the current age ceiling of 31 years. It also increases the DACA renewal period from two to three years.\n\n\n\nBut like DACA, beneficiaries of the DAPA program will get deportation deferrals and work permits only. They will not be eligible for green cards or any other visa or formal immigration status that only Congress can bestow.\n\n\n\n\u201cAlthough Executive Action is only temporary, the status quo is so unacceptable,\u201d said Hincapi\u00e9, noting that for an undocumented mother even the simple of act of driving her child to school could be paralyzing: \u201cShe is afraid of getting stopped because of racial profiling,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nStill other undocumented immigrants who are eligible for either DACA or DAPA worry that by applying they might bring attention to undocumented relatives not eligible for either program and thus open the way to deportation. But Hincapi\u00e9 assured the audience that no information on the application form is shared with immigration officials.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where you come in,\u201d she said, urging the reporters in the room to get the word out about this. She told the media that \u201cif more people applied, the more difficult it would be for future administrations \u2026 to take it away.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, despite the benefits of DACA, a significant number of eligible immigrants have yet to apply, said Ronald Coleman, California Immigrant Policy Center\u2019s government affairs manager. He pointed out that while around 400,000 youth are eligible for DACA in California, less than 50 percent of them have applied. Coleman speculated part of reason could be because some of those eligible don\u2019t know they are.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to put all our resources out\u201d and let them know about DACA and DAPA, he said, pointing out that there are economic benefits to providing deferred action to undocumented immigrants.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith work authorization, immigrants will have more economic mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could look for jobs that provide employer-based health insurance.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven though DACA and DAPA recipients will be excluded from all federally funded health care programs under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), those living in California have the unique advantage of being able to get comprehensive state-funded Medi-Cal if they meet all eligibility requirements. That includes having an income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level ($15, 856 for a single individual).\n\n\n\nTwenty-nine-year-old panelist Imelda Plascencia said expanding DACA to allow those who have lived continuously in the United States since January 1, 2010 \u2013 instead of the original June 15, 2007 cutoff date \u2013 will allow her to enroll in the program. She said that one of the things she\u2019s most looking forward to after applying is enrolling in Medi-Cal so she can get a long overdue physical and dental checkup.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living with gall stones for years,\u201d said Plascencia, who is the project manager of Health Initiatives at the Dream Resource Center, part of the UCLA Labor Center. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t have access to health care, I\u2019ve been treating it with pain killers.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut while speakers praised the president\u2019s move, they also noted those eligible for either program might still have no access to health insurance.\n\n\n\nPanelist Michelle Yoon, 23, is a founding member of the Los Angeles chapter of ASPIRE (Asian Students Promoting Immigrant Rights Through Education). She said she got DACA status in 2013, and has employer-funded health insurance. But her 56-year-old mother, who now qualifies for DAPA, will not qualify for Medi-Cal because she makes a \u201clittle too much money\u201d as a store salesperson.\n\n\n\nDoreena Wong, project director for Advancing Justice \u2013 L.A. Health Access Project, lamented that when such programs as DACA and DAPA are rolled out, the Asian and Pacific Islander communities are not targeted because \u201cwhen people think of undocumented, they think of Hispanic.\u201d Little or no material is provided in Asian languages.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s ironic, she said, because there are more foreign-born immigrants from Asia in California (59 percent) than there are from Latin American countries. This is perhaps why \u201cour communities have a higher uninsured rate.\u201d\n\n\n\nColeman pointed out that even with deferred action programs, the status of many undocumented immigrants would remain the same. For example, many in the LGBT communities will not qualify for DAPA since \u201c[deportation] relief is based on family.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor those left behind, Democratic Sen. Ricardo Lara\u2019s Health Care For All bill would be the answer, he said. The bill, which didn\u2019t make it out of the Senate Appropriation\u2019s Committee earlier this year, was reintroduced by Lara last month.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to focus on making sure that everybody in California is covered,\u201d Coleman said.\n\n\n\nThe Dec. 17 event was organized by New America Media and the L.A. chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justiceat the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "immigration reform, daca, dapa, executive action, health care reform", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
