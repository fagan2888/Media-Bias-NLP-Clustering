Both have made a point of standing up against sweeping pieces of legislation such as Obamacare or Dodd-Frank (to which patent reform has been \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 compared). Both even argue in favor of a more populist, aspirational conservative message (what Cruz calls \u201copportunity conservatism\u201d).\n\nSo why the difference over this subject, in particular? The prosaic political explanations are there, of course: For instance, Lee has been trying to cultivate an aura of independence, and is therefore generally more willing to buck agenda-setting groups like the American Conservative Union (which is so against patent reform that it\u2019s going to use it in its scorecard), whereas Cruz relies on them for much of his support. Moreover, Utah (Lee\u2019s home state) is an emerging hub of the patent-skeptical tech industry, while Texas (Cruz\u2019s home state) is home to the infamously pro-patent troll East Texas District Court. From a cynical perspective, therefore, one could argue that both men are simply looking out for their constituents.\n\nHowever, a look at their public statements on the subject reveals a clue to something that may go deeper. Here\u2019s Lee back in 2013 on the unveiling of the Patent Transparency and Improvements Act:\n\n\u201cCongress has a constitutional responsibility to ensure that our system of intellectual property \u2018promote[s] the progress of science and the useful arts.\u2019 Our patent system must protect legitimate property rights and encourage innovation,\u201d Lee said. \u201cRecently, we have seen increased abuse of the patent system in a way that actually discourages innovation and growth of the economy. This legislation, together with other proposals introduced by members of the Judiciary Committee, will restore the proper balance to the patent system.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s Cruz explaining his vote against the PATENT Act (the Senate\u2019s current incarnation of patent reform):\n\n\u201cI think we need to be particularly solicitous of protecting inventors, protecting the little guy, protecting those who are asserting their rights protected by the United States Constitution to develop new innovations, and I fear that if we lean too far against the small patent holder that in turn will hamper innovation in our economy.\u201d\n\nThe interesting thing about Cruz and Lee\u2019s statements is that on the surface, they entirely agree with each other on one point: That stopping invention and innovation is bad, and that anything that hampers inventors or innovators ought to be opposed. The question at contention, then, is from whom each legislator is trying to protect these hypothetical innovators.\n\nIn Lee\u2019s case, the answer is obvious: The trial bar and its incestuous relationship with patent trolls. In Cruz\u2019s case, it\u2019s not so obvious, at least if you look at his own statements. But a look at the statements of those who agree with him is more revealing. For instance, here\u2019s former Ohio GOP Chairman Ken Blackwell on patent reform efforts:\n\nI have consistently warned of the dangers of these bills: The troublesome crony capitalism at work and strings being pulled behind the scenes by companies like Google; the dangers of moving bills forward that compromise intellectual property and put America\u2019s policies in line with those of countries like China; the problems innovators \u2014 everyone from your local inventor to medical research programs at universities \u2014 will have securing funding and maintaining sound ownership of their inventions.\n\nAnd here\u2019s Presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, making a similar point:\n\nWatch carefully who is supporting that legislation. It\u2019s not the small it\u2019s the big. It\u2019s the big companies whose ongoing economic benefit depends upon their ability to acquire innovations and patents at a lower cost.\n\nIn other words, you could argue that the question that Lee and Cruz are really debating is who is more likely to prey on small businesses \u2014 patent trolls, or Google? Except the answer to that question is obvious: it\u2019s patent trolls. And if you doubt that, ask the opponents of patent reform to produce a single local inventor who\u2019d actually be hurt by the bills. Once you exclude universities \u2014 who don\u2019t actually invent anything, but instead pad their Presidents\u2019 salaries by selling their patents to trolls \u2014 none is forthcoming. In contrast, supporters of patent reform can point to numerous small businesses who are being harmed by trolls right now.\n\nThe difference, then, may lie in something more fundamental, and it is this: we may be witnessing a debate between a very 20th-century era idea of what a patent is on Cruz\u2019s side, versus a forward-thinking 21st-century vision from Lee. One sees this in the constant references among reform opponents to the little guy \u201ctinkering in his garage,\u201d when the fact is that most innovators today are sitting at their laptops, rather than tinkering in their garages. In fact, Google itself was built by two \u201clittle guys\u201d coding on their laptops, and the same goes for Facebook, or any of the other bogeymen that reform opponents bring up. These innovators \u2014 the ones that actually exist \u2014 are who reform supporters are trying to protect.\n\nBut this doesn\u2019t fit the mental image of \u201cinnovation\u201d that most Americans have, which is something more akin to the Wright Brothers building the airplane than to the Winklevoss twins sponsoring Bitcoin. The 20th century affection for manufacturing and building things still runs deep among the GOP base \u2014 witness Donald Trump\u2019s success claiming he\u2019ll bring manufacturing jobs back to the states \u2014 and to someone with that 20th century idea of economic success, the disruptive nature of the tech industry and its intangible products probably look more like freeloading by uppity nerds than like any sort of actual invention. Cruz, who is competing with Trump for the same pool of voters, has to appear sympathetic to these concerns, despite the fact that his own state is rapidly beginning to compete with Utah and Silicon Valley in the tech world.\n\nIn other words, the unfortunate fact is that it for many Republicans, it simply may not be safe to be seen as pro-tech, despite the fact that doing so arguably handed them the 2014 election. For the sake of the party going forward, one hopes that this irrational aversion to the people who are now the primary drivers of the American economy, both at the small business and big business level, will soon be put to rest by the realities of the situation.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf45\"", "article_summary": "Both have made a point of standing up against sweeping pieces of legislation such as Obamacare or Dodd-Frank (to which patent reform has been \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 compared).\nAnd if you doubt that, ask the opponents of patent reform to produce a single local inventor who\u2019d actually be hurt by the bills.\nOn the surface, it\u2019s hardly obvious why the two should differ, with Lee supporting patent reform, and Cruz opposing it.\nIn contrast, supporters of patent reform can point to numerous small businesses who are being harmed by trolls right now.\nAs it happens, when it comes to the disagreement between Ted Cruz and Mike Lee over the idea of patent reform, both are true."}
