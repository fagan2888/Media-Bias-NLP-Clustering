The Donald was asked about the current state of world affairs, where the billionaire noted that the Iran deal is terrible, we seem to forget that North Korea already has a nuclear arsenal, along with an unhinged leader, and how it’s simply unrealistic for us to do all the policing in the world.

Of course, he added the Chinese threat into the discussion, adding that their economic strength and increased aggression into the South China Sea is a cause for concern.

Trump has no problems with Russian President Vladimir Putin taking on ISIS in Syria.

“If Putin wants to go in and knock the hell out of ISIS, I’m all for it–100 percent. And I don’t understand how anybody would be against it,” said the billionaire magnate. “They blew up a Russian airplane. He cannot be in love with these people,” he added.

As for the Ukraine, Trump asked, “why are we always doing the work?” Referring to Germany and our European allies who he feels don’t do their fair share concerning global security. It’s a regional problem–and Germany has an economy and a military that should be–in Donald’s view–doing more to work on normalizing the strategic situation there.

“We cannot continue to be the policeman of the world. We owe $19 trillion; we have a country that’s going to hell; [and] we have an infrastructure that’s falling apart.”

Jeb Bush disagreed, saying there’s a difference between a world policeman and a world leader. He also described Trump’s Syria policy as something akin to a board game.
