Associated Press\n\nFor months, Democratic presidential contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders warily circled one another, contrasting their policy ideas in mostly gentle terms that emphasized their own positive messages.\n\nNo more.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton unloaded on Mr. Sanders, charging that he wants to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for his single-payer health care plan, whereby the government would replace private insurance companies and pay for almost all health care costs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how you can be serious about raising working and middle class families\u2019 incomes if you also want to slap new taxes on them\u2014no matter what the taxes will pay for,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a campaign stop in Dallas on Tuesday. She said she was the \u201conly one\u201d in the Democratic debate \u201cwho will commit to raising your wages and not your taxes.\u201d\n\nAhead of that, her campaign\u2019s press secretary Brian Fallon hit Mr. Sanders by name, saying that a 2013 version of his health care plan would amount to a tax increase of 9% on middle-class families. \u201cSimple math dictates he\u2019ll need to tax workers even more to pay for the rest of his at least $18-20 trillion agenda,\u201d he said. (To be clear, some $15 trillion of that total is for health care, and all those numbers are over 10 years.)\n\nBy day\u2019s end, the Sanders campaign had unloaded with a statement of its own, calling the Clinton charge a \u201cfalse attack.\u201d Spokesman Michael Briggs argued that the Clinton attacks are really aimed at trying to divert attention from her connections to Wall Street, which she was forced to defend in Saturday\u2019s debate.\n\n\u201cIn an attempt to divert the public\u2019s gaze from Wall Street coziness, the Clinton campaign has launched a false attack on universal health care,\u201d Mr. Briggs said.\n\nIn truth, both the Clinton and the Sanders statements both include misleading charges.\n\nThe Clinton statement said Mr. Sanders included a 9% tax on middle class workers in his 2013 plan. In fact, the plan included a 2.2% tax on workers and a 6.7% tax on wages paid by employers, so the total is only 9% if one assumes the entire tax is passed onto workers. And the Clinton campaign ignores the fact that under single-payer health care, employers would no longer have to provide coverage to their workers.\n\nMeantime, the Sanders statement pulls a bunch of quotes from Mrs. Clinton from 2007 and 2008 that suggest she supported a single-payer plan because she advocates for \u201cuniversal health care.\u201d In fact, she was proposing a plan that is very similar to what became the Affordable Care Act, which offers subsidies and makes it easier to buy coverage but does not have the government provide it to everyone.\n\nFurther, Mr. Briggs notes that Mr. Sanders has not put forward an updated health plan but doesn\u2019t explain why not given that this is a proposal he talks about all the time. Aides had said over the summer that the plan might be released within weeks, but that never happened.\n\nSanders strategist Tad Devine said Tuesday that Mr. Sanders may never put forward a detailed plan. \u201cHe may just say, `It\u2019s Medicare for all,\u2019\u201d he said, and then point to existing proposals as possible models. \u201cI don\u2019t think we want to have 14 plans (on various subjects) between now and Feb. 1\u201d when the first votes are cast.\n\nMORE:\n\nHillary Clinton Faces Foreign-Policy Challenges\n\nSanders Vies for Union Favor\n\nRyan Warns of Budget, Guantanamo Bay Confrontations With White House", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Democratic rivals Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have a go at one another over their past health care proposals, after months of circling one another warily, if politely.
