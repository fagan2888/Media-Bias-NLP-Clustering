Amid its ongoing, devastating drought, it\u2019s experiencing an unusually nast outbreak of West Nile Virus: 238 human cases, and 9 deaths, have been reported so far this year, compared to the 117 cases reported this time in 2013 and the five-year average of just 75. In Orange County, the epicenter of the outbreak, 90 people have so far become infected \u2014 seven times the number of diagnoses for all of 2013. State officials say they expect the outbreak will continue to spread.\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health\n\nResearchers have been warning that certain conditions created by climate change \u2014 increases in heat, precipitation and humidity \u2014 will be favorable to mosquitoes, providing ample opportunity for them and the variety of diseases they carry to multiply while their range expands. One invasive species, the Asian Tiger Mosquito, is already spreading rapidly \u2014 it\u2019s invaded 36 states since arriving just a quarter century ago \u2014 and experts predict that, as climate change worsens, so too will its presence. In two decades, write researchers at the Public Library of Science, the land area covered by the pest may increase from 5 to 16 percent; as winters get warmer toward the end of the century, they could cover half the Northeast U.S.\n\nBut as California is proving, this isn\u2019t the only way climate change could create a mosquito crisis. While the state has certainly seen its share of record temperatures this summer, it\u2019s been making headlines for how little rainfall it\u2019s received. But instead of working to suppress the propagation of mosquitoes, as we might expect, experts say the drought may actually be enabling the West Nile outbreak.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mosquitoes typically thrive in rainy conditions, but that hasn't let California off the hook", "title": "California hit with record West Nile outbreak \u2014 and its epic drought is to blame", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Mosquitoes typically thrive in rainy conditions, but that hasn't let California off the hook", "title": "California hit with record West Nile outbreak \u2014 and its epic drought is to blame", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/11/california_hit_with_record_west_nile_outbreak_and_its_epic_drought_is_to_blame/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_200494427.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mosquitoes typically thrive in rainy conditions, but that hasn't let California off the hook", "title": "California hit with record West Nile outbreak \u2014 and its epic drought is to blame", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/shutterstock_200494427.jpg", "creator": "@readingirl", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California Drought, Chikungunya, Climate Change, dengue fever, Extreme weather, mosquitoes, Orange County, west nile virus", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae06\"", "article_summary": "Topics: California Drought, Chikungunya, Climate Change, dengue fever, Extreme weather, mosquitoes, Orange County, west nile virus, Sustainability News, Life News, NewsCalifornia can\u2019t catch a break.\nBut instead of working to suppress the propagation of mosquitoes, as we might expect, experts say the drought may actually be enabling the West Nile outbreak.\nBut as California is proving, this isn\u2019t the only way climate change could create a mosquito crisis.\nAmid its ongoing, devastating drought, it\u2019s experiencing an unusually nast outbreak of West Nile Virus: 238 human cases, and 9 deaths, have been reported so far this year, compared to the 117 cases reported this time in 2013 and the five-year average of just 75.\nState officials say they expect the outbreak will continue to spread."}
