As my colleague Joan Walsh reported on Thursday, this backward-looking attempt to lay out a forward-looking platform for the Democratic Party did not go entirely according to plan.\n\nWhich is not to say it was a failure. In fact, for a photo-op held during a non-election year in May and headlined by a relatively unknown local politician, the unveiling of the agenda probably got more attention than it deserved. Even so, as Joan relayed from the scene, there was some tension at the event \u2014 and not only because President Obama\u2019s hard sell of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is driving some liberals to distraction while making others defensive. Sure, the agenda does call on lawmakers to \u201c[o]ppose trade deals that hand more power to corporations at the expense of American jobs, workers\u2019 rights, and the environment,\u201d which is basically how the TPP is described by its foes. But that discord was for the most part kept under the surface.\n\nThe real reason de Blasio\u2019s stab at playing the role of Progressive Moses was a bit awkward (despite going much better for him than it did for Ed Miliband) is knottier and harder to ignore. And it didn\u2019t only trip up Hizzoner, but also marred a same-day Roosevelt Institute event on \u201crewriting the rules\u201d of the economy, which was keynoted by no less a figure than Sen. Elizabeth Warren. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s long dogged the American left, and the United States more generally, and it\u2019s one that will not go away, no matter how fervently everyone may wish. It is, of course, the issue of race; and as these D.C. left-wing confabs showed, it will dash any hope of a liberal future unless the \u201cprofessional left\u201d gets deathly serious about it \u2014 and quick.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t read Joan\u2019s piece (which you really should), here\u2019s a quick summary of how race wound up exposing the fault lines of the left at two events that were supposed to be about unity of purpose. Despite American politics becoming increasingly concentrated over the past two years on issues of mass incarceration and police brutality \u2014 which both have much to do with the legacy of white supremacy and the politics of race \u2014 neither de Blasio\u2019s agenda nor the Roosevelt Institute\u2019s report spend much time on reforming criminal justice. To their credit, folks from both camps have agreed that this was a mistake and have promised to redress it in the future. Still, it was quite an oversight \u2014 and a shame, too, because it justifiably distracted from an agenda and a report that were both chock-full of good ideas.\n\nI wasn\u2019t in the room when de Blasio\u2019s agenda or the Roosevelt Institute\u2019s report were created, but I feel quite confident in saying that the mistake here was not a result of prejudice or thoughtlessness or even conscious timidity. I suspect instead that ingrained habits and knee-jerk reflexes \u2014 born from coming of age, at least politically, in the Reagan era \u2014 are more likely to blame. Because while the radical left has been talking about and organizing around racial injustices for decades, mainstream American liberalism, the kind of liberalism that is comfortably within the Democratic Party mainstream, is much less familiar with explicitly integrating race into its broader vision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The progressive movement in America has a bright future \u2014 but only if it sheds the habits of the Reagan-era past", "title": "Ronald Reagan doesn\u2019t live here anymore: Why it\u2019s high time liberals stop tiptoeing around race", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The progressive movement in America has a bright future \u2014 but only if it sheds the habits of the Reagan-era past", "title": "Ronald Reagan doesn\u2019t live here anymore: Why it\u2019s high time liberals stop tiptoeing around race", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/ronald_reagan_doesnt_live_here_anymore_why_its_high_time_liberals_stop_tiptoeing_around_race/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/hillary_warren_de_blasio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The progressive movement in America has a bright future \u2014 but only if it sheds the habits of the Reagan-era past", "title": "Ronald Reagan doesn\u2019t live here anymore: Why it\u2019s high time liberals stop tiptoeing around race", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/hillary_warren_de_blasio.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #blacklivesmatter, arthur brooks, Barack Obama, Bill de Blasio, contract with america, E.J.
