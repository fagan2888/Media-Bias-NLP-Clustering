(Photo: Rachel Mummey/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nAs the CFO of a military non-profit, I know some issues are truly non-partisan, that go above and beyond party politics just like our military. I\u2019ve directed political campaigns and been a candidate myself, and I\u2019ve seen just how ugly things can get playing political football, and how money influences the political discourse.\n\nI was honored when a non-partisan organization like Iowa Pays The Price asked me to be one of its co-chairs. So far, one-third of all Super PAC money has been or will be spent here in Iowa leading up to the caucuses.I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that we need more transparency and simplification in our campaign finance laws.\n\nAllowing transparency is the best disinfectant for political partisan activity and would allow us to be better educated as voters. Current federal campaign finance laws impose a $2,700 contribution limit for individual contributions each in the primary and general elections. In Iowa, there aren\u2019t any contributions limits for elections. I propose we do the same for federal races.\n\nReforming McCain-Feingold limits would place emphasis back on candidates and their campaigns. It\u2019s up to us to hold our candidates and political parties accountable for the negativity by helping drive the process through the candidates and not the Super PACs. Special interest money doesn\u2019t always serve the best interests of Iowans. The truth is we don\u2019t know who\u2019s funding our members of Congress. This must change. I believe in\n\ntransparency, disclosure and accountability through streamlining bureaucracy. After speaking with Democrats and Republicans, I believe these are issues we can fight together for and do what is best for everyday Iowans.\n\n\u2014 David Niffenegger, Iowa Pays the Price co-chair, Des Moines\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1UvVG54", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "go above and beyond party politics just like our military.
