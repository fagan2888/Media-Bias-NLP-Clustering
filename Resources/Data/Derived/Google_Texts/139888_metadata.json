New Jersey\u2019s hospital industry spent $4.5 million, 25 percent more than the previous years, followed by the $4.3 million by unions, and $3.6 million from the insurance industry.\n\nNo industry faced more change and uncertainty than hospitals in 2013, lobbyists and health care executives said. They furiously shopped around for new partners to cushion themselves against the funding cuts that will help pay for the health care law. At the same time, suburban and urban hospitals were fighting against each other over a tax that would have given select local and county governments authority to impose a tax on hospital revenue for five years.\n\nAll the clashes boil down to the simple fact that the industry is dependent on public funding, said Rick Pitman, executive director of the Fair Share Hospital Collaborative, which represented 27 suburban hospitals that spent $194,500 to defeat the tax legislation.\n\n\"How do you make it work? Lobbying is part of battling to get your fair share,\" Pitman said.\n\nDale Florio of the Princeton Public Affairs Group \u2014 which, at $9.4 million was the top earner for the 11th straight year \u2014 described the health care market in the age of Obamacare as \"the wild, wild west.\"\n\n\"Insurers and providers are looking for new ways to deliver care,\" said Florio, whose firm represents hospitals and the state\u2019s largest insurer, Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Jersey. \"You can agree or disagree with the President\u2019s plan, but it has gotten everybody\u2019s creative juices flowing. Oftentimes that means more business opportunities for firms like ours.\"\n\nJeff Brindle, the Election Law Enforcement Commission\u2019s executive director, speculated that overall spending on lobbying was also spurred by proposed gun-control legislation and the successful passage of a minimum-wage hike.\n\n\"Lobbying helps crystallize issues for our elected officials and the public, and helps decision-makers weigh the pros and cons of legislative action or inaction,\" Brindle said.\n\nHospitals also were represented on the list of spending by special interest groups. The industry\u2019s largest trade group, the New Jersey Hospital Association, spent $628,337, and Hackensack University Medical Center spent $508,500 in 2013, according to the report.\n\nThe hospital association lobbied on many issues key to the industry's future, from the state budget, to the lack of mental health treatment services, to the expansion of Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act, association spokeswoman Kerry McKean Kelly said.\n\n\"Fiscal policy is important because healthcare providers need reimbursement and revenues to survive and continue caring for individuals,\" she said.\n\nHackensack spokeswoman Nancy Radwin said lobbying helped \"support efforts as they relate to the ever-changing healthcare landscape,\" as well as the effort to open HackensackUMC at Pascack Valley.\n\nThe state\u2019s largest teacher\u2019s lobbying group, the New Jersey Education Association, spent $3.3 million in 2013 \u2014 topping all special interst groups for the third time in five years, the report said.\n\nAmerican for Prosperity, a conservative group formed by the Koch Brothers whose former director in New Jersey, Steve Lonegan, ran for U.S. Senate last year, entered the top 10 list of spenders among interest groups by shelling out $951,233.\n\nThe group\u2019s state director, Darwyn Iwicki, said he doesn\u2019t consider it as lobbying in the traditional sense, in which \"everyone else has their own agenda and fiefdom, protecting their handouts.\"\n\nHe said it advocated for laws and policies to create jobs, reduce state spending and lower property taxes. \"Ultimately we are protecting Joe Taxpayers who don\u2019t know why their taxes go up every year,\" he said.\n\nAARP New Jersey ranked fourth in spending last year, with $717,148, the report said. Tackling issues such as utility rate hikes, Its lobbyist, Doug Johnston said the money is spent \"challenging the most powerful legislators and corporations in the state.\"\n\nBy testifying at public hearings and communicating with its 1.3 million members, AARP has successfully reduced rate hikes sought by some utility companies, Johnston said.\n\n\"Utility consumers in New Jersey have been assaulted with rate hike requests at the Board of Public Utilities,\" Johnston said. \"AARP advocates to ensure ratepayers don\u2019t have to pay a penny more than really necessary for their home utilities.\"\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 See which special interest groups spent the most to influence NJ lawmakers, Christie\n\n\u2022 Wolff & Samson tops million dollars in lobbying in 2013, new report shows\n\n\u2022 More Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "budget, health-news, medicaid, nj-assembly, nj-senate, us-senate-special-2013, news", "title": "Obamacare, proposed tax drove hospital lobbying in 2013, report said", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Hospitals shelled out more money than any other New Jersey industry in trying to sway lawmakers and the Christie administration in 2013", "title": "Obamacare, proposed tax drove hospital lobbying in 2013, report said", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/obamacare_proposed_tax_drove_hospital_lobbying_in_2013_report_said.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/14431764-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hospitals shelled out more money than any other New Jersey industry in trying to sway lawmakers and the Christie administration in 2013", "creator": "@susanklivio", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/14431764-standard.jpg", "title": "Obamacare, proposed tax drove hospital lobbying in 2013, report said", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, March 07, 2014, 10:44 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, March 07, 2014,  6:00 AM", "article_author": "Susan K.
