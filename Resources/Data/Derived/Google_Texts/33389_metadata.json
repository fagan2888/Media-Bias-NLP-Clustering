So they sought to fire or replace oppositional voices with friendly voices that flattered their ideas and policies. The outcome they sought, then, was one in which their positions would go unchallenged and they could have nice feelings about themselves (unfortunately this is not a hypothetical; the next debate actually turned out that way).\n\nIndeed, the candidates\u2019 \u201cdemands\u201d included prohibition of things like \u201ccandidate-to-candidate questioning\u201d and \u201callow[ing] members of the audience to wear political messages,\u201d while the RNC-generated talking points suggested moderators shouldn\u2019t be allowed to ask candidates \u201cgotcha\u201d questions about things the candidates said and details of candidates\u2019 policy proposals. While Ben Carson\u2014who proposes a neo-McCarthyist policy of federal government policing of campus speech\u2014rails against student protesters at Yale and University of Missouri, he and his fellow candidates appear unaware that, in full-on adulthood, they still haven\u2019t learned the lessons they\u2019re trying to teach.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to call this hypocrisy, but something else important is happening here. When it comes to speech and policy, the Republican candidates operate in a deep gulf between theory and practice. Carson has a sense of what free discourse in an ideal world should look like, and Trump has a sense that he can impose his foreign-policy will through sheer bravado, but when it comes to practical concerns\u2014like policy details, or handling aggressive debate moderators\u2014the ideal falls apart.\n\nThis is the point we need to understand if we\u2019re going to understand the relationship between protests against racism at Yale and University of Missouri and the national politics of race and free speech. Free speech absolutism is an elegant idea premised on the expectation that a free, thoughtful, self-reflexive and educated populace has far more to gain from talking through offensive and oppositional speech than practicing censorship. The reality, however, is that very few of us\u2014educated or not, young or old\u2014turn out to be very good at operating under extreme or overwhelming verbal attack, or understanding when something is better left unsaid.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we should practice censorship, rather we should expect degrees of compromise as well as error when real-world forces like power imbalances, threats, and systematic offenses exert influence on what we mistakenly call \u201cmerely\u201d the exchange of words and ideas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Angered by oppositional speech?
