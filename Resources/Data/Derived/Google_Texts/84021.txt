It’s no secret that Democrats who told us how great ObamaCare was going to be will find the 2014 elections rough-going. But a new ad from the folks at EndingSpending.com gives a peek at what they’ll face.

Though only 30 seconds long, it packs a punch. The ad opens with the line “On health care, Jeanne Shaheen didn’t tell the truth.” That’s followed by footage of Shaheen making pretty much the same promises on ObamaCare the president did: “You can keep your insurance if you like it . . . It will increase choices for families . . . It will promote competition.”

The senator’s promises are followed by facts about ObamaCare in New Hampshire that contradict these claims. It all ends with a clever jab: “So next November, if you like your senator, you can keep her. If you don’t, you know what to do.”

Ending Spending is a conservative outfit that originally started up to oppose earmarks but has since expanded its focus to the federal budget and the national debt. The ad on ObamaCare is now going viral for an obvious reason: Though this one targets Sen. Shaheen, it can be applied to any other Democrat, especially in the Senate, who made the exact same promises as Shaheen did.

With ObamaCare more unpopular among Americans than its ever been, and its many promises so thoroughly discredited, it’s going to be hard for the politicians who assured us otherwise to explain it all away. A headline over a Washington Post item on this spot captures it best: “This is the ad every Democrat should be scared of in 2014.”
