(EPA/ERIK S. LESSER)\n\nThe first person Marco Rubio thanks by name in the acknowledgments of his new book, \u201cAmerican Dreams,\u201d is kind of a big deal. \u201cI thank my Lord, Jesus Christ, whose willingness to suffer and die for my sins will allow me to enjoy eternal life,\u201d the senator from Florida writes. The second person Rubio thanks: \u201cMy very wise lawyer, Bob Barnett.\u201d\n\nEven with the Almighty on your side, it\u2019s smart to keep a Washington power broker on retainer.\n\nMemoirs and policy books by presidential hopefuls morph into extended stump speeches, predictable and dutiful works whose generic titles mirror their insight and originality. But at least one part of these books is consistently enjoyable and revealing: the acknowledgments.\n\nThere is still plenty of posturing there, and that\u2019s some of the fun. It\u2019s also where the candidates disclose intellectual debts, hint at political favors and, under the guise of heightened honesty (they\u2019re acknowledging, right?), unwittingly emphasize the very shortcomings they\u2019re seeking to overcome. In a crowded Republican primary field, several of the candidates have written \u2014 or at least published \u2014 books recently, and their acknowledgments can be more instructive than any policy speech, debate zinger or surrogate\u2019s bark.\n\nOf course, just about all the candidates thank their families right away. There are values voters to win over, people! Rand Paul (\u201cTaking a Stand\u201d), Ted Cruz (\u201cA Time for Truth\u201d), Carly Fiorina (\u201cRising to the Challenge\u201d), Rick Perry (\u201cFed Up!\u201d) and Mike Huckabee (\u201cGod, Guns, Grits, and Gravy\u201d) all begin their acknowledgments with copious gratitude for spouses, children and/or parents. Paul, however, acknowledges his own greatness as much as his family\u2019s. \u201cTo my sons William, Duncan, and Robert,\u201d the senator from Kentucky writes, \u201cI hope the example I set for you in daily life will help you as you become adults.\u201d Ted Cruz, the Texan Cuban American by way of Canada, is quick to praise his parents as \u201ctwo Americans of grit, passion, and fortitude,\u201d just in case anyone had doubts.\n\nRubio also expresses gratitude for his family\u2019s support, but not before a giving a lengthier shout-out to Norman Braman, the 83-year-old car-dealer billionaire who has bankrolled Rubio\u2019s past campaigns. The senator thanks Braman \u201cnot only for the advice and comments on the book, but for your friendship and wise advice to me over the years.\u201d I suppose mentioning the cash would be unseemly.\n\nAcknowledgments can make plain the candidates\u2019 insecurities and self-perceived weaknesses. After thanking God and family, Scott Walker (\u201cUnintimidated\u201d) tries to buttress his national security credentials, not easy for a Midwestern governor. \u201cFirst, a salute to Major General Don Dunbar and the ten thousand men and women of the Wisconsin National Guard,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt is my sincere honor to serve as your commander in chief.\u201d (Too bad Walker\u2019s bloodiest battles have been against public employees\u2019 unions.) Rick Santorum, forever fighting \u201celectability\u201d concerns, spends much of his acknowledgments still bitter about the 2012 primaries; he complains that the media boxed him in as a \u201csocial issues\u201d candidate and failed to see his bond with working-class voters. (Hence his book title, \u201cBlue Collar Conservatives.\u201d) And Perry, often accused of being intellectually unencumbered, emphasizes the historians and legal scholars he consulted for \u201cFed Up!,\u201d published before his failed run at the Republican Party\u2019s 2012 presidential nomination. (Regrettably, the former Texas governor also writes that thanking his wife is a \u201cno-brainer,\u201d an expression Perry should avoid in any sentence describing his decision-making.)\n\nAlthough unlikely to have provided assistance other than spiritual or inspirational, Ronald Reagan makes cameos in the acknowledgments of some 2016 Republican candidates. Paul cites the courage of Reagan and Margaret Thatcher in challenging their parties\u2019 orthodoxies, drawing a parallel to his continued efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and fight Obama\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional, lawless amnesty.\u201d And Walker thanks conservative Reagan biographer Craig Shirley for instructing him in the ways of the Gipper\u2019s 1980 campaign.\n\nCruz, meanwhile, inadvertently echoes a different president. The senator from Texas concludes his acknowledgments by reflecting on his immigrant father. \u201cOnly in a land like America is his story \u2014 is our story \u2014 even possible,\u201d Cruz writes. Sounds a bit like Barack Obama\u2019s 2004 Democratic National Convention speech, in which the then-Illinois state senator declared that \u201cin no other country on Earth is my story even possible.\u201d Criticize a guy\u2019s rhetoric long enough and you\u2019re bound to start sounding like him.\n\nSome candidates wonk out and list their various policy advisers. (Message: I\u2019m serious). In their 2013 book \u201cImmigration Wars,\u201d former Florida governor Jeb Bush and co-author Clint Bolick highlight the expertise of Emilio Gonzalez, a former immigration official at the Department of Homeland Security, and Tamar Jacoby, head of ImmigrationWorks USA. Also, in what must have been Bush\u2019s pre-\u201canchor babies\u201d phase, the authors offer \u201ca heartfelt thanks to the many immigrants we have had the honor to meet and know and who inspire and teach us what it means to be American.\u201d Rubio, meanwhile, names 45 \u201cscholars and policy experts\u201d who form his brain trust on domestic and foreign policy, including guys from the reform conservative movement and the American Enterprise Institute. And I do mean \u201cguys\u201d \u2014 of the 45, only one is a woman. Nina Rees, president of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, take a bow.\n\nLike Rubio thanking God and his Washington attorney, other candidates play the inside-outside game in their acknowledgments. Walker recaps his preferred pastimes: \u201cIn addition to hanging out with my family\u201d (values, check) \u201cor watching sporting events\u201d (regular guy, check), \u201cone of my favorite ways to relax is riding my 2003 Harley Davidson Road King\u201d (cool guy, check). But he slips in a mention of \u201cmy friend Reince Priebus,\u201d chairman of the Republican National Committee and former head of the Wisconsin GOP (establishment, check). Walker skips Rep. Paul Ryan, a fellow Wisconsinite and the party\u2019s veep candidate in 2012. It\u2019s a noteworthy omission for a politician who lists more than 200 people in his acknowledgments, including friends (and yes, donors) Crystal and Jim Berg, who apparently throw fantastic pond parties.\n\nOn occasion, candidates drop out of character. In his acknowledgments, Huckabee drips folksiness like sawmill gravy on biscuits. He laments that this is the first book he\u2019s written without Jet, his beloved black Lab, and says his publisher\u2019s enthusiasm has been \u201cbetter than a bowl of grits with cheese and shrimp.\u201d But when he thanks his son David, \u201cwho runs several of the companies I own,\u201d he sounds downright Trumpesque.\n\nThe Republican front-runner offers only brief acknowledgments in his 2011 book, \u201cTime to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again,\u201d devoting a lone paragraph to his publisher and a few staffers. It\u2019s just as well for Donald Trump, because the acknowledgments in his 2000 book, \u201cThe America We Deserve,\u201d showcase the perils of the form. Back then, Trump thanked \u201cthe tough and tireless Roger Stone\u201d \u2014 the same political adviser with whom the candidate suffered a high-profile break this month.\n\nRelative newcomers Fiorina and Ben Carson (\u201cOne Nation\u201d) also skimp on their acknowledgments, missing a chance to suck up, back-scratch and repackage. They\u2019ll learn! Oddly, Sen. Lindsey Graham (N.C.), one of the most experienced candidates of the bunch, omits an acknowledgments section altogether in his recent e-book, \u201cMy Story.\u201d In fact, he seems to resent the entire political-book exercise.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a story. Not everyone has to tell it, of course, and most people have the good sense not to,\u201d Graham begins. \u201cBut if you\u2019re in my line of work, and the time arrives when you start imagining a big promotion . . . you are by custom expected to give a general account of your life.\u201d With a sales pitch like that, Graham has no one to thank but himself.\n\nThese books, meant to distinguish the candidates, often reinforce how small and overlapping the world of presidential contenders can be. For example, two different candidates thank the same ghostwriter (embarrassing!), a former speechwriter for Attorney General John Ashcroft. \u201cJessica Gavora was a true partner,\u201d Fiorina writes, \u201chelping me think through the structure and the content.\u201d And for Rubio, the help seems to have been even more integral: \u201cI am grateful to Jessica Gavora for helping me craft and organize the manuscript, interview the people who shared their life stories and meet the various deadlines on time.\u201d\n\nSounds like a lot of work. How about a co-byline, senator? That\u2019s the best acknowledgment of all.\n\nBooks cited:\n\nImmigration Wars: Forging an American Solution by Jeb Bush and Clint Bolick.
