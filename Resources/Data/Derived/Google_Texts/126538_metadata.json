(NASDAQ: SPAN) announced today that it has signed an exclusive agreement for the distribution of most of its line of medical beds and therapeutic support surfaces in Australia. The three-year agreement was signed with Alphacare, a leading supplier of healthcare and rehabilitation equipment in Australia. Alphacare\u2019s initial order of approximately USD $270,000 has already been completed.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about expanding sales of our medical beds and therapeutic support surfaces to Australia,\u201d commented Jim Ferguson, president and chief executive officer of Span-America. \u201cThe exclusive agreement with Alphacare will provide us with a strong national dealer network in Australia. We believe that recent changes in Australia will offer an increase in demand as customers in the aged-care sector are now free to select the products that best suit their needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe principals with Alphacare have over 30 years of experience in the healthcare equipment supply business. Our team will be working with them to maximize our joint sales opportunities including two upcoming national conferences in Australia: the Aged Care Procurement Show in Melbourne in May 2016, and the LASA National Congress in Gold Coast in October 2016,\u201d concluded Ferguson.\n\nThe initial term of the agreement with Alphacare is for three years, and it can be extended annually after the initial term according to the terms of the agreement.
