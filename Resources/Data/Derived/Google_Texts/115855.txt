Three people have been charged with the armed robbery of a medical marijuana dispensary in Denver last month, and a fourth person is in custody.

Khamis Horn, 26, James Hughes, 20, and Lynn Shangreaux, 18, were each charged with first-degree kidnapping and two counts of aggravated robbery on Wednesday, according to a news release from the Denver District Attorneyâ€™s Office.

Christopher Bletson, 24, was arrested, but not yet formally charged in the case, according to the release.

The charges stem from the robbery of a medical marijuana dispensary on Aug. 22 in the 4400 block of Zenobia Street, the release states.

Horn, Hughes and Bletson allegedly robbed the dispensary at gunpoint while Shangreaux drove the getaway car, according to the release.

All four remain in custody with their bonds set at $50,000, according to the release.
