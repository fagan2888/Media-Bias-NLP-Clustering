Researchers have developed a simulator that creates \u201cvirtual taste\u201d online, by activating the tongue through electrical signals.\n\n\u201cTaste is an expressive sense,\u201d a video describing the project says, \u201cconnecting personal emotions and experiences. Can we share the same tasting experience digitally and remotely?\u201d\n\nDr. Nimesha Ranasinghe, a researcher at the National University of Singapore's Keio-NUS CUTE Center who led the project, found a way to recreate the taste of both food and drink by activating the tongue through non-invasive electrical and thermal stimulation. On his website, Dr. Ranasinghe explains that, \u201cThe digital taste interface, a control system, is developed to simulate the taste sensations digitally on the tongue.\u201d\n\nHis device is called the Digital Taste Interface. The researchers were able to conduct signals through a silver electrode, which touches the tip of a person\u2019s tongue. These signals then produce various taste sensations \u2014 salty, sour, sweet, and bitter. Thermal stimulation was used to generate minty, spicy, and sweet sensations.\n\nBut where might such virtual taste be used? In a news release, Dr. Ranasinghe noted that a possible outlet for this simulation could be in video games. \u201cAs an illustration, if a gamer completes a task or level successfully, a sweet or minty dose will be rewarded,\u201d the news release states. \u201cHowever, failure is delivered with a bitter taste.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the researchers believe that the simulator could also be used in medicine. People with diabetes would be able to taste sweetness virtually, without causing a negative impact on their blood sugar levels. Likewise, chemotherapy patients who find that all foods taste like metal, could utilize the device to improve their appetite, Dr. Ranasinghe said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "virtual taste, simulation, computer, food", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "By attaching an electrode to the tongue, researchers can create the virtual taste of various foods electronically.", "title": "Researchers Find A Way To Simulate \u2018Virtual Taste\u2019 Online", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/taste-internet-researchers-find-way-simulate-virtual-taste-online-266272", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/03/eating-food-computer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By attaching an electrode to the tongue, researchers can create the virtual taste of various foods electronically.", "title": "Researchers Find A Way To Simulate \u2018Virtual Taste\u2019 Online", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/taste-internet-researchers-find-way-simulate-virtual-taste-online-266272", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/03/eating-food-computer.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/03/eating-food-computer.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-01-03T14:28:25-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-03T14:28:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "By attaching an electrode to the tongue, researchers can create the virtual taste of various foods electronically."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaaa1\"", "article_summary": "Researchers have developed a simulator that creates \u201cvirtual taste\u201d online, by activating the tongue through electrical signals.\nScientists believe they can make virtual taste available on computers, to be used in video gaming or health care.\nOn his website, Dr. Ranasinghe explains that, \u201cThe digital taste interface, a control system, is developed to simulate the taste sensations digitally on the tongue.\u201dHis device is called the Digital Taste Interface.\nBut where might such virtual taste be used?\nLikewise, chemotherapy patients who find that all foods taste like metal, could utilize the device to improve their appetite, Dr. Ranasinghe said."}
