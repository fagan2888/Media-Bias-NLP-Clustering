Some individual plans are still available outside the marketplaces, however, with late-December enrollment deadlines, provided you don\u2019t want financial help with your premiums.\n\nMore than three dozen states have at least one insurer offering individual plans outside the government exchanges, according to the online insurance brokerage eHealth.com. Insurers in some states are offering enrollment deadlines as late as Dec. 31, for coverage starting Jan. 1. (They include Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming, eHealth says.)\n\nThe catch is that because the plans aren\u2019t offered through the marketplaces, they aren\u2019t eligible for financial help, like tax credits to reduce your premium. So, if you make less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 $46,680 for a single person in 2015 \u2014 you\u2019ll probably find a better deal on Healthcare.gov or one of the state-based exchanges. (With a few exceptions, since some states that have extended their marketplace deadlines, the earliest marketplace coverage can begin now is Feb. 1).\n\nIf your income is much higher than the federal limit, however, you may want to compare plans off the exchange to see if one meets your needs. The plans have to meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act, so they can\u2019t exclude people who are already sick and must offer essential benefits, including preventive care. They may differ, however, in details like doctor availability, since some on-marketplace plans may have narrower provider networks in order to hold down premiums. \u201cOne big issue, certainly, has been network design,\u201d said Elizabeth Carpenter, a director at the consultant Avalere Health.\n\nCarrie McLean, eHealth\u2019s director of customer care, noted that availability of \u201cplatinum\u201d level plans, the most costly level of marketplace plans, may vary by state. Washington State, for instance, didn\u2019t offer any platinum plans on its exchange this year. So if you wanted such a plan, you\u2019d have to shop off exchange in that state, she said. (A spokeswoman for Washington\u2019s exchange said that platinum plans were being offered in 12 counties for 2015 by the insurer BridgeSpan.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso, Ms. McLean noted, consumers who have a history with a specific insurer and prefer to stick with that company may also want to shop off exchange in some states. In California, she said, the insurer Cigna isn\u2019t participating in Covered California, the state-run marketplace.\n\nEven so, there are good reasons for shopping on the marketplaces. If your income is close to the financial help cutoff, or if it fluctuates throughout the year, you probably should stick to marketplace plans, said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThat\u2019s because if your income drops, you could become eligible for a \u201cspecial\u201d enrollment period and begin receiving the premium tax credit midyear, said Ms. Pollitz \u2014 provided you were already enrolled in a qualified marketplace plan.\n\nAlso, \u201cplan choices and trade-offs in premiums and deductibles are likely much easier to see on the marketplace websites,\u201d said Sara Collins, a health insurance expert with the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nHere are some questions about non-marketplace individual coverage:\n\n\u25a0 How can I find companies that offer non-marketplace coverage in my state?\n\nHealthcare.gov, the federal marketplace, also offers a \u201cplan finder\u201d tool that lists A.C.A.-compliant plans offered outside of the exchanges.\n\n\u25a0 What if I find a plan that appears much cheaper than a comparable one on the marketplaces?\n\nMs. Pollitz advises that you should make sure the plan is actually A.C.A. compliant. There are still plans available off the marketplace that don\u2019t comply \u2014 but if you buy one, you won\u2019t meet the mandate to have coverage, and could be subject to penalties.\n\n\u25a0 What is the penalty for not having health insurance in 2015?\n\nThe fee for a single person rises to the higher of $325 or 2 percent of income (up from $95 or 1 percent of income in 2014).",
