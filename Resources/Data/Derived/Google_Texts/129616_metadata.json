So when it comes to the political arguments of any given news cycle, we more often than not disagree. But while that\u2019s been the case with the contentious \u201creligious freedom\u201d law recently passed (and more recently amended) in Indiana, I do think Dougherty\u2019s Tuesday column about the controversy made a point that has otherwise gone under-appreciated.\n\nIt\u2019s an obvious one, too. A reminder that, to paraphrase Orwell, the hardest truths to remember are often the ones staring you in the face. What Dougherty understands is that the kerfuffle that consumed Indiana \u2014 and, to a lesser degree, Arkansas \u2014 during the past week was not about the Constitution, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s 2016 ambitions or partisan politics. It was about symbolism and the culture war; it\u2019s really as simple as that.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t live and breathe politics likely figure this is self-evident. But for the kind of people who spend at least some time every day catching up on the latest news and political debates, the essential nature of the religious liberty vs. LGBT rights argument can get knocked down by a wave of ancillary information. Secondary or tertiary points \u2014 which only really matter insofar as they\u2019re a sword or a shield to use in online arguments or while bickering with friends \u2014 grab the media\u2019s attention. And eventually, the conversation drifts away from reality as well as what really matters.\n\nFor example, look at the sheer number of articles that have been written in the past week or so about whether or not Indiana\u2019s RFRA differs from the one Congress passed in the 1990s. A cursory search will show you examples from Vox, the Indianapolis Star, Think Progress, the Federalist, the Washington Post and National Review. Generally, these pieces reach the conclusions you\u2019d expect: The left-of-center sites report that Indiana\u2019s RFRA is different \u2014 or that the recent Hobby Lobby decision has changed the federal law\u2019s implications \u2014 and the right-of-center ones find that there are no significant differences.\n\nIf you simply want to know everything you can about the new policy in Indiana, or if you find constitutional questions particularly compelling, most of these pieces are valuable. And I\u2019m absolutely not criticizing the journalists and editors who wrote and commissioned them; providing as much relevant information as you can is the journalist\u2019s stock-in-trade. But because so much energy is put into arguing over a talking point, the real reason why the bill inspired such outrage gets lost in the shuffle, and you end up arguing over details that are ultimately beside the point.\n\nA short segment about the Indiana fight, which I participated in for the conservative Newsmax TV, offers a good example. Overall, I felt things went pretty well. It was my first stint as a televised talking head, so I made more faces and bobbed around nervously more than I should have; but host Ed Berliner didn\u2019t ask any cheap \u201cgotcha\u201d questions, and I thought the conversation he moderated between myself and the Washington Examiner\u2019s Sarah Westwood produced more light than heat. Which, as anyone who\u2019s watched five minutes of CNN\u2019s Don Lemon knows, is rare for cable.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Instead of getting swept up in talking points and legalisms, we should focus on the real reason Indiana matters", "title": "It\u2019s the culture war, stupid: Why identity is at the heart of Indiana\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d fight", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Instead of getting swept up in talking points and legalisms, we should focus on the real reason Indiana matters", "title": "It\u2019s the culture war, stupid: Why identity is at the heart of Indiana\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d fight", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/04/its_the_culture_war_stupid_why_identity_and_symbolism_are_at_the_heart_of_indianas_fight_over_gay_rights/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/mike_pence_protest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Instead of getting swept up in talking points and legalisms, we should focus on the real reason Indiana matters", "title": "It\u2019s the culture war, stupid: Why identity is at the heart of Indiana\u2019s \u201creligious freedom\u201d fight", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/mike_pence_protest.jpg", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elias Isquith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, culture war, don lemon, ed berliner, Editor's Picks, LGBT Rights, michael brendan dougherty, Mike Pence, Newsmax, religious liberty, RFRA, sarah westwood", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It was about symbolism and the culture war; it\u2019s really as simple as that.\nWhat Dougherty understands is that the kerfuffle that consumed Indiana \u2014 and, to a lesser degree, Arkansas \u2014 during the past week was not about the Constitution, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), Indiana Gov.\nA short segment about the Indiana fight, which I participated in for the conservative Newsmax TV, offers a good example.\nA reminder that, to paraphrase Orwell, the hardest truths to remember are often the ones staring you in the face.\nSo when it comes to the political arguments of any given news cycle, we more often than not disagree."}
