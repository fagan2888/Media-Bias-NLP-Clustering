The state Republican Party points to Page 69 of the leaked Nunn campaign memo: \u201cMichelle has national connections and relationships that most candidates could never convene, from Warren Buffet to General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt to Usher.\u201d\n\n***\n\nMeanwhile, the campaign of U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn says the Democrat has accepted five debate offers over the next 10 weeks, and urged David Perdue to do the same. To help encourage the Republican, the Nunn campaign offered this quick sound bite of an interview twixt Perdue and WSB Radio\u2019s Scott Slade, who asks Perdue if he\u2019s willing to debate the Democrat. Replied the candidate: \u201cAbsolutely. Anywhere. Anytime.\u201d\n\nThe proposed debates:\n\n\u2014 Oct. 7, sponsored by WMAZ of Macon;\n\n\u2014 Oct. 15, by the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer;\n\n\u2014 Oct. 26, by the Atlanta Press Club/Georgia Public Broadcasting;\n\n\u2014 Oct. 27 by the League of Women Voters;\n\n\u2014 and Nov. 2 hosted by WSB-TV.\n\n***\n\nWhen Congress returns next week, it will need to pass a spending bill to keep the federal government open beyond the close of next month\u2019s fiscal year. With a chance to control the U.S. Senate in the offing, and the first anniversary of the most recent government shutdown coming up, many Republicans want the debate kept as low key as possible.\n\nBut not all of them. Some say they\u2019ll attempt to rollback any shifts in immigration policy that President Barack Obama has decided to make by then. From the Wall Street Journal:\n\nRebelling against Mr. Obama wouldn\u2019t alienate Republican voters, said Rep. Jack Kingston (R., Ga.), who said he didn\u2019t want to extend many White House policies in a spending bill, even in the short term. \u201cIt\u2019s in the best interest of the country to sit down and hammer things out,\u201d Mr. Kingston said, even if that stokes fears of a shutdown. \u201cOur base is so motivated that I don\u2019t think it would keep them away\u201d in the election, he said.\n\n***\n\nThe smoke is clearing from Ferguson, Mo., but the aftershocks continue. Gwinnett County Sheriff Butch Conway has some harsh words for U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson\u2019s bill to curtail military surplus to local police departments. Via the Gwinnett Daily Post:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I have Hank\u2019s cellphone number,\u201d Conway said this week, \u201cbut I would like to contact him the next SWAT callout we have and, instead of taking one of our armored vehicles to the location, I would invite Hank to walk up to the door and see if they\u2019ll surrender their weapons and come out peacefully. Because Hank seems to think that\u2019s all it takes.\u201d \u2026 Conway called the idea of his department carrying out its 40 or 50 annual SWAT calls without an armored vehicle \u201cinsane.\u201d \u201cI wish it was 30 years ago where we didn\u2019t have the violence that we have now, especially the firearm violence,\u201d Conway said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different world.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThis weekend, the New York Times picked up on plans by Rep. John Lewis and others to boost black voter turnout this fall in part by invoking the Ferguson, Mo., unrest. In the same piece, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed threw the Trayvon Martin case in the mix:\n\nMr. Lewis is headlining efforts to mobilize black voters in several states with competitive Senate races, including Arkansas, Louisiana and North Carolina. The drive is being organized by the Congressional Black Caucus, in coordination with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Other steps, such as recruiting N.B.A. players to help register more African-Americans, are also underway. \u2026\n\nBut in an interview on Friday, Mayor Kasim Reed of Atlanta said whites \u2014 or, as he put it, \u201cthe majority community\u201d \u2014 did not fully appreciate the fury among African-Americans and their desire to register their discontent. Invoking the mother of Trayvon Martin, the black Florida teenager killed in 2012, and her plea for people to \u201cuse my broken heart,\u201d Mr. Reed said he was telling black voters something similar: \u201cThe most important tribute you can make to individuals who you believe were treated unfairly is to exercise your franchise.\u201d\n\n***\n\nGov. Nathan Deal\u2019s run-in with immigration activists at the University of Georgia last week has earned national attention.\n\nGawker picked up on it last week, and Democrat Jason Carter\u2019s campaign wrote up a Buzzfeed post about the \u201cscandal.\u201d NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d touched on the topic in the above segment over the weekend, but you\u2019ll note that the reference to the Georgia governor was a blind one.\n\nMeanwhile, Jon Richards over at Peach Pundit offered his own take in a recent post. He was also at the UGA meeting when Lizbeth Miranda and three others students sparked the confrontation that led Deal to \u201cpresume\u201d one of them was an undocumented immigrant.\n\nHere\u2019s Richards\u2019 take:\n\nGovernor Deal continued to insist that the issue of undocumented immigrants wanting to become college students should be dealt with at the federal level. And, the ex-Congressman complained that whenever a proposal to reform the immigration process comes up in Washington, it is denounced as amnesty, and the proposal goes nowhere. That drew a standing ovation from those in attendance that ended the discussion about undocumented students. What can we learn from what happened at the meeting? First, it was wrong for Governor Deal to assume that the students speaking up about access to college by undocumented students were illegal immigrants. However, it was also wrong for Miranda to imply that Deal\u2019s statement was because of her race.\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s cocaine monkey, the sequel. The National Republican Congressional Committee is re-upping its stimulus-related attack on Augusta Democratic U.S. Rep. John Barrow with the above ad.\n\n(As Politifact noted two years ago about a similar spot, the study on how monkeys react to cocaine \u2014 part of research on drug addiction \u2014 was not in the stimulus bill itself, but it was what the National Institutes of Health used some of its stimulus grant money on.)\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee\u2019s attack ads on Augusta Republican challenger Rick Allen got the Factcheck.org treatment late last week. And it wasn\u2019t pretty:", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/09/02/bill-clinton-headed-for-ushers-house-and-a-michelle-nunn-fundraiser/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/082214-senate-kdj04.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "The Wall Street Journal reports that Bill Clinton, the last presidential candidate to carry Georgia, will headline a Sept. 13 fundraiser for U.S....", "title": "Bill Clinton headed for house of Usher \u2014 and a Michelle Nunn fundraiser | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
