At next Saturday\u2019s marathon trials in Los Angeles he will attempt to make his fourth Olympic team, at age 33 and knowing it could be his last, a point driven home last month by the abrupt retirement of Ryan Hall.\n\nThey had been contemporaries since college \u2014 Ritzenhein won the 2003 NCAA cross country title by finishing 1.3 seconds ahead of Hall \u2014 and they were teammates on the 2008 Olympic marathon team in Beijing. Hall\u2019s body just can\u2019t take the marathon anymore, and Ritzenhein knows how fortunate he is to be running Saturday.\n\n\u201cFor me to be 33 and to feel as good as I do right now,\u201d Ritzenhein said, \u201cthat\u2019s a blessing.\u201d\n\nRitzenhein is a favorite to make Team USA. Brianne Nelson, a mother of two who lives in Golden, is hopeful but realistic. Kara Lubieniecki of Boulder, meanwhile, knows she probably won\u2019t make the team, but she\u2019s training hard to give it a try anyway.\n\nNelson wanted to make the 2008 Olympic team in the marathon but then became pregnant. She took three years off, gave birth in 2008 and again in 2010, then ran at the 2012 trials more to participate than compete because caring for girls ages 3 and 1 was hardly conducive to training at an elite level. The Fort Lewis College graduate will run the marathon trials knowing that at age 35, this is probably her last chance to be an Olympian.\n\n\u201cThe marathon is a distance I respect,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be able to put everything you\u2019ve been training for, all that time and effort, and to execute it on that one day is going to be a challenge.\u201d\n\nLubieniecki, a graduate of Bear Creek High School, works as a research assistant in a CU exercise physiology lab.\n\nShe\u2019s never had the luxury of being a full-time runner, and at age 26 she\u2019s torn between her aspirations in running and her long-term career goals. She knows she\u2019s unlikely to make the Olympic team.\n\n\u201cAnything is possible,\u201d Lubieniecki said. \u201cBut if I were betting on it, I wouldn\u2019t bet on me being in the top three. I\u2019m going to give it the best shot I can give. That\u2019s part of the fun of it.\u201d\n\nThey call it fun, running up to 110 miles a week in the winter while knowing all sorts of things can go wrong in a marathon. Only the top three make the Olympic team, and in 2012 Ritzenhein finished fourth. Eight seconds from third.\n\nFollowing is a closer look at their stories.\n\nRitzenhein\n\nRitzenhein ran the 10,000 meters at the 2004 Athens Olympics with a broken foot. He was the top American in the marathon at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, finishing ninth (34 seconds ahead of Hall). In 2009 he broke Bob Kennedy\u2019s hallowed 13-year-old American record in the 5,000 meters (12:56.27). He\u2019s proudest of what he did after not making the 2012 team in the marathon, though.\n\nHe had only five months to recover from the marathon trials and train for the 10,000 at the track and field trials. Finishing in the top three there wouldn\u2019t guarantee him a spot on the team, because he didn\u2019t have a current Olympic qualifying time. He would have to finish in the top three and get the qualifying standard (27 minutes, 45 seconds) at the trials on a cold, rainy night. He made the team by finishing third and beating the standard by nine seconds.\n\n\u201cThat was probably the hardest thing I\u2019ve had to do,\u201d said Ritzenhein, who lives in Rockford, Mich. \u201cIt was like the odds were against me the whole time and all the way up to the start of the race, when it was pouring rain and 50 degrees and I didn\u2019t have the standard. That day was about overcoming my own demons of missing the team, having surgeries, feeling like I was maybe at the end of my career in running. To be able to come back and make that team in the 10K was really the biggest thing for me.\u201d\n\nLast year he was the top American man at the Boston Marathon, finishing seventh, and was ranked the No. 2 American for the season by Track & Field News. He is healthy and is coming off some of the best training of his career.\n\n\u201cFrom an age standpoint I can train as hard as ever, I just have to recover a little bit better,\u201d Ritzenhein said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m at a great spot at 33. I think I can still run as good or better than I ever have at the marathon distance.\u201d\n\nNelson\n\nAt the 2012 marathon trials, Nelson finished 61st, more than 17 minutes behind winner Shalane Flanagan, but she was proud just to be there. First she had to qualify for the trials, which she did by training on a treadmill while keeping an eye on her toddlers because her husband works 24-hour shifts as a paramedic/firefighter. Sometimes the baby would wake up early from a nap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d still have 15 minutes left in a run,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI\u2019d have to block the treadmill with the couch, throw toys and watch her play. Everything was very challenging.\u201d\n\nDespite those complications and being a sleep-deprived mom, Nelson ran 1:14:36 in the 2011 Rock \u2018N\u2019 Roll Philadelphia half marathon to qualify for the trials.\n\n\u201cI was just pumped to get there (the trials). It\u2019s kind of nice to know what I\u2019m expecting now, going with a totally different mind-set than I was in 2012.\u201d\n\nHer girls are now in kindergarten and second grade. That carves out some time for her training, but her husband\u2019s work schedule is still a complication.\n\n\u201cWe just make it work,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cHe knows I need to get my runs in. There\u2019s been some times when the kids have been sick and he had to work, so I just know I have to get on the treadmill. If that means I\u2019m doing two hours on the treadmill because the kids are sick, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nNelson finished second last year in the USA Road Circuit but concedes she is \u201cprobably a longer shot\u201d to make the marathon team.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a championship-style race. You\u2019re going to have a lot of people going in there with different race plans \u2014 some going for broke from the gun, some hanging back, (then) sweeping and picking everybody up. I\u2019m coming off a really good season. I\u2019m feeling pretty fresh.\u201d\n\nLubieniecki\n\nLubieniecki can\u2019t help but wonder what kind of runner she would be if she devoted herself fully to running after graduating from California State University-Chico. Instead she went to CU for a master\u2019s degree and got a job there which included helping out with research and teaching exercise physiology.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of professional goals in the health world that I do want to pursue,\u201d said Lubieniecki, who is not quite 5 feet tall. \u201cPart of 2016 is going to be for me to decide how far do I want to take running, how far do I want to pursue a further career? I\u2019ve considered a Ph.D., or going to some kind of professional school, but to do that I would need to commit more of my time to that rather than running. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready to give up running just yet. I still love running, I still love feeling fast and working out.\u201d\n\nShe concedes her chances of making the Olympic team are \u201cnot real high,\u201d but she might continue to train for the 2020 Games.\n\n\u201cOh, man, I would like to think so,\u201d Lubieniecki said. \u201cI would definitely go for another Olympic year if 2016 proves to be really positive.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer\n\nMarathon Olympic trials\n\nWhere: Los Angeles\n\nWhen: Saturday, men starting at 11:06 a.m., women at 11:22 a.m.\n\nTV: Channel 9, 11 a.m.\n\nFormat: Top three men and top three women make the Olympic team in the marathon, provided they have the necessary Olympic qualifying standard (2:19 for men, 2:45 for women).\n\nMen to watch: Luke Puskedra, Salt Lake City; Meb Keflezighi, San Diego; Dathan Ritzenhein, Rockford, Mich.\n\nWomen to watch: Shalane Flanagan, Portland, Ore.; Desiree Linden, Chula Vista, Calif.; Annie Bersagel, Oslo, Norway (formerly of Greeley).", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado athletes are chasing olympic dreams", "title": "Colorado athletes are chasing olympic dreams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/colorado-athletes-are-chasing-olympic-dreams/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__BN20160207_C1_BNSP07OLYMARATHONp3.jpg", "height": 441}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__BN20160207_C1_BNSP07OLYMARATHONp3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T20:50:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T06:12:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0bc5\"", "article_summary": "Nelson wanted to make the 2008 Olympic team in the marathon but then became pregnant.\nHe had only five months to recover from the marathon trials and train for the 10,000 at the track and field trials.\nThe Fort Lewis College graduate will run the marathon trials knowing that at age 35, this is probably her last chance to be an Olympian.\nShe knows she\u2019s unlikely to make the Olympic team.\nFormat: Top three men and top three women make the Olympic team in the marathon, provided they have the necessary Olympic qualifying standard (2:19 for men, 2:45 for women)."}
