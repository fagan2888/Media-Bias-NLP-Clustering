Shelly\u2019s executive order sets out tribal policies to govern how FEMA grants are used. In addition, the Navajo statement said, the Nation is also eligible to receive relief as a sub-grantee of FEMA grants awarded to Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.\n\n\u201cThese policies and procedures are not only instrumental for the Nation to administer FEMA grants, but they also strengthen our ability to work with the states during times of disasters,\u201d said Shelly.\n\n\u201cThe executive order assists with our rollout of new policies and procedures that will get the FEMA funds to chapters and programs a lot faster than in previous years,\u201d said Rose Whitehair, director for the Navajo Nation Department of Emergency Management. \u201cFor Indian Country, we need emergency managers and trained personnel in the worst way.\u201d\n\nThe summer monsoon season wrought havoc on the Navajo Nation, and FEMA personnel has been on the ground for weeks assessing the damage. Tribal personnel must be trained to assist in communication, help point out the most needy of areas, and \u201cto provide appropriate cultural sensitivity during emergency situations,\u201d the Navajo statement noted.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for us to do the right thing,\u201d said George Kelly Casias, FEMA Tribal Liaison assigned to the Navajo Nation.\n\nDuring the summer monsoons and into September, 86 of the Navajo Nation\u2019s 110 chapters experienced major flooding. Two previous orders cover flooding that occurred from July 23 to 28 and another bout from September 9 to 22. But storms and flash floods plagued the Nation throughout those weeks.\n\nRELATED: Flash Flooding on Navajo Nation Displaces Scores, Wrecks Homes With Mold and Mud\n\nThe Navajo Nation in September reported that it had received more than 150 percent of what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) considers the terrain\u2019s normal amount of precipitation, the Navajo Division of Transportation said in a statement at the time.\n\nLast August 21 the Navajo Nation Commission on Emergency Management declared a state of emergency because of the damages from the torrential monsoonal flooding. The rainfall breached more than 50 earthen dams, washed out roads and created at least one sinkhole.\n\nShelly\u2019s January 15 executive order strips out some of the red tape and makes the aid more directly accessible by routing it through fewer agencies, according to the Navajo statement. By making the aid award and distribution system less complicated, the executive order eliminates problems that were occurring under the old system, from overpayments to some chapters to mistakes in account and project numbers.\n\n\u201cThe policies and procedures are going to make this process a lot smoother and faster for the chapters and programs,\u201d said Whitehair. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With disaster assistance now available to tribes through the 2013 Stafford Act, the Navajo Nation has set out to streamline the process of applying for its residents.FEMA disaster aid will reach Navajo Nation residents quicker thanks to new executive order.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/22/cutting-red-tape-navajo-nation-fema-aid-gets-sped-and-streamlined-153209", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/navajo_nation_shelly-fema-rick_abasta_0.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Cutting Red Tape: Navajo Nation FEMA Aid Gets Sped Up and Streamlined"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-22T15:30-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Cutting Red Tape: Navajo Nation FEMA Aid Gets Sped Up and Streamlined"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/22/cutting-red-tape-navajo-nation-fema-aid-gets-sped-and-streamlined-153209", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Navajo Nation, Disaster Aid, Disaster Assistance, Natural Disaster Assistance, Monsoon Rain, Navajo Nation President Ben Shelly, FEMA, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Stafford Act", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Cutting Red Tape: Navajo Nation FEMA Aid Gets Sped Up and Streamlined"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe159c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis executive order will streamline the process for the Navajo Nation and FEMA to respond to emergencies quickly and efficiently,\u201d Shelly said.\nWith disaster assistance now available to tribes through the 2013 Stafford Act, the Navajo Nation has set out to streamline the process of applying for its residents.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for us to do the right thing,\u201d said George Kelly Casias, FEMA Tribal Liaison assigned to the Navajo Nation.\nRELATED: President Obama Signs Law Putting Tribes on Equal Footing as States for Federal Emergency AidShelly\u2019s Executive Order No.\nShelly\u2019s January 15 executive order strips out some of the red tape and makes the aid more directly accessible by routing it through fewer agencies, according to the Navajo statement."}
