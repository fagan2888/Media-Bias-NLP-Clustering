When the White House came calling, we jumped at the chance to put our questions about the bill to Chief of Staff Denis McDonough. GQ contributor Reid Cherlin, who worked as a White House spokesman in 2009-10, caught up with McDonough about what went so wrong, and why guys should get covered.\n\nGQ: First I\u2019ll let you make your pitch. I know you guys are trying to get young men\u2019s attention.\n\nWe\u2019re underscoring to everybody the promise at the heart of the Affordable Care Act, which is, quality, affordable health care coverage available in a transparent marketplace for the first time ever. It\u2019s March, and open enrollment closes on March 31, and we want to make sure that people take advantage of it now.\n\nWe\u2019re also reaching out to young men, because you tend to think as a young man you\u2019re indestructible. In my case I played sports my whole life. I got out of college and I didn\u2019t bother to get health care coverage because I just figured I didn\u2019t need it. But you know that if you blow out your knee on a basketball court or you get in a car accident, and you\u2019re uninsured, it can bankrupt you.\n\nAnything like that ever happen to you?\n\nI taught in Belize for a year, and before I left, my parents were birddogging me to get health care coverage. So what I did was, I reenrolled in college, and then got coverage through my college. One of the guys I went with did not do that. We were playing soccer one night and he busted his leg. I remember thinking at the time, \u201cHoly mackerel. One, I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m not any good at soccer\u2014because I wasn\u2019t playing in the soccer game right then, and two, I\u2019m glad that I got my health care coverage.\u201d\n\nPinterest Photo: Gettty\n\nI spent a lot of time at the White House trying defend and explain the bill, and I still get a lot of people saying: \u201cYou haven\u2019t explained it well enough. No one understands what the bill is.\u201d On top of which, people just generally hate thinking about their health coverage. How do you overcome that?\n\nAs to whether we\u2019ve explained the health care bill sufficiently: think about the fact that over three million young people have stayed on their parents\u2019 health insurance, in a way that you don\u2019t have to go reenroll in college, the way I did. And we\u2019ve got 85 percent of the country who already have health care coverage, and that coverage is now much more comprehensive and much less discriminatory than it was during the whole course of history.\n\nBut this is Washington, and what Washington does is it doesn\u2019t talk about the positive and good things. It talks about\u2014or makes up, in this case\u2014challenges. And we get that.\n\nWe\u2019re not going to listen to the back and forth on this. The experience of what people get when they\u2019re in the system, that\u2019s the most powerful way for us to rebut all the myths and deceptions that are being peddled by folks out there.\n\nWhy is it that it\u2019s been so hard in the most developed economy, in the most robust market in the world, why has it been so hard to buy health care until now? The reason it\u2019s been so hard is because it was designed to be hard. And we\u2019re turning that upside down, and over the course of time that\u2019s going to work.\n\nLots of people are saying, \u2018Well, they said if you liked your plan you could keep it, and that turned out not always to be true.\u2019 And the website didn\u2019t work. The merits of the policy aside, there\u2019s a trust issue out there. How do you repair that?\n\nYour readers are very discerning people. So we want them to just try for themselves. Go to Healthcare.gov and check it out. And I think what you\u2019ll see is a transparency in the marketplace such that they\u2019ve never seen before.\n\nThe other point is that we\u2019re going to try to find [target enrollees] where they are. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re talking to you. That\u2019s why we\u2019re aggressively working social media. I\u2019ve been talking to sports radio all week\u2014\n\nThat must have been a hardship for you.\n\nIt\u2019s a nice break, to be honest with you.\n\nWhat we believe is that people want health care, and that\u2019s true whether you\u2019re a so-called invincible or whether you\u2019re a 44-year-old dude like me. And when you get a clear shot at it, I think people take it.\n\nYoung consumers were raised in this marketplace on the internet where they can go shop and and price-compare on anything they buy. When they see this, I think they\u2019ll like it.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve got your word that the website works as advertised?\n\nThe website is working very well. I\u2019ll be the first to acknowledge that we had a rough October and November. You would have seen at that time, obviously, reports of eight-second response times; that\u2019s laughable. Response times today are under half a second. Error rates of around 6 percent in October; error rates today are under half a percent. Over the course of the last couple of weeks we\u2019re seeing more than half a million visitors per day, and those people able to shop, compare, and purchase.\n\nSo do you have my word for it? Yeah, you have my word for it.\n\nIn 2010, the midterms happened while health care was still up in the air, and those elections didn\u2019t go well for you. The president called it a \u201cshellacking.\u201d Do you have a different prediction this time around?\n\nWe think that it\u2019s time for the opponents to find something that they\u2019re for. They\u2019ve established pretty clearly what they\u2019re against. It\u2019s time for them to establish something that they\u2019re for. And you\u2019ll hear the president out there talking about he\u2019s for. There\u2019s no question that these are obviously going to be tough fights, but we\u2019re ready to have them, and I feel really good about it.\n\nWhen this was being passed, you were running the National Security Council. Most people know you, if they know you, from the Bin Laden photo from the Situation Room photo. Now that you\u2019re White House chief of staff, do you cross-apply any of those skills?\n\nWe like to say down in the NSC that no plan survives first contact. And the strength is not in the plan, it\u2019s in the planning. That\u2019s something that General Eisenhower used to say. So I think we demonstrated on October 1 that no plan survives first contact. But we\u2019ve built a team and we\u2019re working this hard.\n\nWe think that as with anything else we used to do down the hall at the NSC, nothing\u2019s easy. Especially things that are important and good are not easy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president wants you, young man because you're not listening.
