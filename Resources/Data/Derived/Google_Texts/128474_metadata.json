Some, such as MetLife, may be putting in a good effort. But for many of the largest life and annuity carriers, and for the bulk of the industry, consumer-facing Internet capabilities aren't a priority \u2014 judging by an experiment conducted on dozens of websites last summer by analyst Karen Monks.\n\n\u201cProgress on customer self-service has been too slow,\u201d Monks writes in the conclusion to her report titled \u201cLife Insurance Online Self-Service \u2014 Can You Go It Alone?\u201d\n\nMonks says life carriers lack urgency when it comes to their online presence and functionality. That bodes ill for capturing future, younger buyers who won\u2019t give the time of day to companies that don\u2019t offer Internet-based transactions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that insurers are ready for the digital world and where things are going,\u201d Monks told InsuranceNewsNet. \u201cDirect is a digital concept and, if they are not ready for an influx of data and analysis, they are not ready to go direct or don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\nIn her study of the top 50 life insurance websites, just over half of the websites helped to locate an agent. None offered an online chat function with an agent, and only 10 percent offered a visitor online chat functions with a customer service representative.\n\n\u201cFor most life insurers, the agent and the insurer technology are not seamlessly connected, especially if the agent force is not a captive force,\u201d Monks writes in her report.\n\nAny carrier aspiring to direct sales online should provide a licensed agent to answer a prospective policyholder\u2019s questions \u2014 it\u2019s an important part of the sale \u2014 yet top life insurance brands are not offering direct sales, according to Monks.\n\n\u201cThis is most likely due to the continuing reliance on agents and brokers for sales, particularly high-net-worth sales, and the concern over brand erosion,\u201d Monks writes. \u201cDirect sales create a perceived channel conflict that most life insurers have not resolved.\u201d\n\nNo one expects life and annuity carriers to deliver comprehensive services as fast as BestBuy or Amazon via the direct channel. At the very least, though, carriers could use the website to offer calculators and help prospects find agents in their ZIP code.\n\nStill, many life carriers don\u2019t even offer those functions, Monks said. Could this seeming intransigence be possible in the Internet age?\n\nCarriers may be missing out on a \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d by not offering self-service on websites, the report says.\n\nNew sales opportunities for carriers could be opened with more robust agent engagement through effective lead generation created by online help, agent contact and chat, or by offering to find an agent for prospects, Monks writes.\n\n\u201cDirect sales may cause friction with the agent base; however, that doesn\u2019t mean insurers shouldn\u2019t be thinking of a way of engaging customers in a hybrid or semi-direct way to encourage increased sales,\u201d Monks writes. \u201cSadly, we see few insurers discussing any of these issues.\u201d\n\nCarrier websites are still more \u201cinformational than transactional\u201d with regard to marketing and sales. In addition, personal financial planning calculators and real-time online help aren\u2019t the norm. When\u2019s the last time a window popped up on a carrier site asking consumers, \u201cHow may I help you?\u201d\n\nNor have insurance carriers embraced self-service for basic functions such as address changes or online billing, with portals offering only limited functionality, Monks says.\n\nDownloading a claim is more prevalent than it used to be but few life insurers allow for the initiation of the claim online, she says.\n\nCarriers have excuses, many of them valid: rigid back-office systems, legacy platforms ill-suited to the Web, decades-long product cycles, a preference on the part of policyholders to conduct the final sale face-to-face with agents, and the long-standing tradition of selling coverage through intermediaries.\n\nEven so, says Monks, who was formerly with John Hancock, in this day and age consumers have every reason to expect more from insurance websites. At the very least, website should contain calculators that demonstrate the value \u2014 and cash values \u2014 of a universal life policy.\n\nNearly every seller of 401(k) products has retirement calculator tools on its website to give investors an idea of the power of compounding. Banks years ago adopted Internet-based transactions and communication years ago.\n\n\u201cThere were quite a few fails and the link didn\u2019t work,\u201d Monks said about her summer research on the top 50 individual life insurance websites. \u201cI went to two (insurance carrier websites) today and the websites were down.\u201d\n\nIn one instance last summer, Monks uncovered an incident where the system got the policyholder\u2019s name wrong. Such incidents typically happen following a merger, when one insurance company\u2019s policy administration system doesn\u2019t recognize policy numbers originally generated by the acquired carrier.\n\nCyril Tuohy is a writer based in Pennsylvania.
