But a new survey from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave has come up with some findings that don\u2019t quite fit those stereotypes. Not in the least. 1. Freedom to choose\n\n\n\nYou might think older people are pretty much constrained by family obligations or health concerns to live in certain areas, but they\u2019d beg to differ with you. In fact, the percentage of retirees saying that they are now free to live pretty much anywhere they want to increases steadily as they age. In fact, they\u2019re twice as likely to say so as people who aren\u2019t retired and who are still tied to the twin obligations of workplace location and family needs.

They love where they are Not only do 65 percent of retirees say that they\u2019re living in the best home of their lives, they\u2019re also happier than non-retirees with other things about where they live. Seventy-nine percent say their homes are comfortable; 75 percent say they\u2019re in a safe community; 62 percent say that home is a good place to handle family visits and 48 percent are even happy with the weather. 4. Memories count more than money\n\n\n\nYes, many are so attached to their homes and the memories that they made there that they\u2019d abandon the chance to fly south (or west, or some other compass point) to be able to live within the walls that sheltered them earlier in life. In fact, among those who are staying put, 54 percent said \u201cI love my home\u201d was the top reason.\n\n5. The majority of retirees move at least once during retirement\n\n\n\n5. The majority of retirees move at least once during retirement While they aren\u2019t citing the weather as the reason to relocate, 64 percent of retirees say they\u2019re likely to do so at least once; 37 percent have already done so and another 27 percent anticipate a change in homes. The top reason they give for the upheaval is the desire to be closer to family (29 percent). Other pressing concerns are cutting home expenses (26 percent), health changes (17 percent), a change in marital status (12 percent), empty nest (7 percent) and or simply wanting the cash from the sale of the home they\u2019re leaving (7 percent).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Marlene Y.
