The Affordable Care Act has extended health-care coverage to 6 million low-income Americans via Medicaid expansion and signed up 4 million uninsured Americans through online exchanges.

While the roll out for the ACA was rocky, much like President George W. Bush's Medicare Drug Expansion in 2005, the legislation is being parodied on three floats during New Orleans' annual Mardi Gras celebration, notes the conservative website GatewayPundit.com.

The right wing website BreitBart.com says the floats, which "mock [the] failure of Obamacare," will appear in the Mardi Gras parade on March 4.
