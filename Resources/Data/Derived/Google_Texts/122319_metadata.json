This includes news sites like Vice, satire from The Onion, content from the very recently Comcast-backed Vox, BuzzFeed brands and from existing broadcasters like NBC Sports. (Video via Vice, The Onion, Vox Media and NBC Sports)\n\nIf there\u2019s truth to the rumors, Watchable will be in good company. The chase after OTT is industry-wide. Verizon is planning a similar service, Dish\u2019s Sling TV is already in the wild for $20 a month, and even Apple is said to be trying to get its own offering off the ground. (Videos via CNET, The Wall Street Journal)\n\nIf there\u2019s one big driving force, it\u2019s the trend of audiences \u2014 and especially younger audiences \u2014 getting more of their content online. Case in point: you\u2019re watching this video.\n\nOne Cisco study showed the Internet video delivered to traditional television screens doubled in 2014, and suggests it will increase four times over by 2019.\n\nWe as consumers are already comfortable here. Look no further than services like Netflix, which on its own vacuums up more than 36 percent of prime-time Internet bandwidth. (Video via Netflix)\n\nAnd for producers, cooperation is enticing. Traditional media companies get a boost to their audience demographics while online publishers get access to the advertising reach of traditional television.\n\nComcast reportedly plans to make Watchable \u2014 watchable across its mobile apps, naturally, and to upgrade its set-top boxes to handle the new traffic over the next few years.\n\nThis video includes an image from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Comcast is the latest big media company expected to jump into the digital video space for traditional TV screens.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Comcast is the latest big media company expected to jump into the digital video space for traditional TV screens.", "title": "Comcast's 'Watchable' Could Heat Up The Digital Video Race", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/comcast-s-watchable-could-heat-up-the-digital-video-race/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1439657482.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Comcast is the latest big media company expected to jump into the digital video space for traditional TV screens.", "title": "Comcast's 'Watchable' Could Heat Up The Digital Video Race", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/comcast-s-watchable-could-heat-up-the-digital-video-race/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1439657482.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=gyb20xdzrvKXnXBJPWg48rY7iZXiTL_L&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://50102", "iphone": "newsy://50102", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://50102", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "newsy,comcast,digital video,internet video,over the top video,digital video on traditional tv,digital video on traditional screens,OTT screens,comcast OTT, comcast OTT plans,comcast OTT rumors", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1439657482.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "And apparently, Comcast has been hard at work, because that service for short-form digital video now has a name: \"Watchable.\"\nComcast is the latest big media company expected to jump into the digital video space for traditional TV screens.\nComcast reportedly plans to make Watchable \u2014 watchable across its mobile apps, naturally, and to upgrade its set-top boxes to handle the new traffic over the next few years.\nBusiness Insider reports Comcast is aiming for a slew of partners to provide their video content on demand through Watchable.\nRumors of a Comcast-backed, over-the-top video service started in April."}
