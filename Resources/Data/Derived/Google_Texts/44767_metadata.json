Bush\u2019s catastrophic legacy,\u201d writes Maajid Nawaz, in an article headlined How Obama Lost the Mideast to Putin,\n\nSyria will be Obama\u2019s. Bush\u2019s sins of commission wrought no less chaos than Obama\u2019s sins of omission. If the Stop the War lobby\u2019s primary motive was to avoid civilian casualties, then by any standard they should slither away shamefully into voluntarily redundancy.\n\nBy latest human rights accounts, Syria\u2019s five-year civil war has left 470,000 dead. To add to our disgrace, we don\u2019t even know how accurate these figures are because\u2014as if in despair\u2014the United Nations gave up collecting statistics 18 months ago. Syria has spiraled into the biggest humanitarian, political and security challenge of our time. The Cuban Missile crisis of 2016. \u2026\n\nHearing of Turkish and Saudi ground troops, Russia\u2019s Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev responded by threatening \u201cpermanent war\u201d. Hypocritically, Russia has already committed her own ground troops, and flies up to 510 combat sorties a week inside Syria from its airbase near Latakia.\n\nPutin is pursuing his aim of dividing Europe, and dividing NATO, by championing the Kurds. As Turkey downed a Russian jet last year, Russia retaliated by amassing her forces on the Turkish border to secure a base in the Syrian Kurdish region. The two countries\u2019 militaries are currently fighting on the ground \u201cmere kilometers from each other\u201d and if a clash occurs NATO could either be unwillingly dragged into war or \u2014 to Putin\u2019s delight \u2014 lose all credibility as a common defence pact. \u2026\n\nThis is how it came to be that the region now stands precariously at the cusp of World War III. But so much of this could have been avoided, if President Barack Obama had displayed two qualities in his foreign policy: leadership and strategic vision. \u2026\n\nThe consequences of Obama\u2019s stunning lack of vision will be felt in Europe, too, in more ways than one. As Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Kurds, Turkey, Russia and various jihadist terrorist factions such as ISIS and al Qaeda fight over the Middle-Eastern jewel, half of Syria\u2019s population has become displaced. Hundreds of thousands are fleeing to Europe, and the resulting cultural civil strife this has sparked will only bolster those \u2014 like Putin \u2014 who seek to break up the European Union. \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s too late for Obama now, but not for the next American president to recoil from this record of failure. American leadership and strategic vision should, first and foremost, have recognized that the intervention pendulum has swung too far the other way, to pacifism. A global power vacuum, by definition, would soon be filled by another power. Enter Russia. \u2026\n\nAmerican leadership would have called Putin\u2019s bluff over that \u201cred line,\u201d and recognized that Putin\u2019s position in Moscow was weaker than it looked. American leadership would have recognized that the recent center-left trend towards isolationism \u2014 far from being true to the principles of liberal internationalism \u2014 has always been symptomatic of parochial conservative populism. This is why it eventually gave way to Donald Trump.\n\nAmerican strategy would have exploited the opportunity of talks with Iran to force a compromise over Assad. American strategy would have exploited the Egyptian, Saudi and Israeli common foes of Iran and Assad, to unify them instead around a deal over Palestine. American strategy would have long ago supported an independent Kurdish state before Russia began to seize that opportunity, too. A Kurdish state would have been the Middle East\u2019s only secular, democratic Muslim-majority country, and could have acted as a torchlight for the entire region against insurgent Islamism.\n\nInstead, none of this happened. But Obama did receive a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nCongratulations, Mr. President.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml", "og": {"site_name": "Ricochet", "description": "\u201cJust as Iraq was President George W.
