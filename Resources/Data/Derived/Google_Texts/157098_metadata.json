Until today, no one knew just how small that circle is.\n\nA report from Credit Suisse says that a mere 110 people control 35 percent of Russia\u2019s household wealth. The country has one billionaire for every $11 billion in wealth. For comparison\u2019s sake, in the rest of the world there is one billionaire for every $170 billion.\n\n\u201cRussia has the highest level of wealth inequality in the world, apart from small Caribbean nations with resident billionaires,\u201d the Credit Suisse report said.\n\nSince Russia has a total population of 143 million, the new finding means that less than .000001 percent of the population controls more than two-thirds of the country's wealth.\n\nThe report also noted that wealth in Russia has grown at a staggering rate over the last decade, but that wealth hasn\u2019t been spread around. In 2000, there were only 8 billionaires in Russia.\n\nCIRCLE OF WEALTH\n\nThe report is yet another sign of how Russia\u2019s success over the last decade has been limited to an extraordinarily small number of people. It\u2019s these people that keep Putin in power; as long as they\u2019re rich, he\u2019ll keep a firm grip on power.\n\nRELATED: 8 WHO SQUARED OFF AGAINST PUTIN AND LOST\n\nThis kind of wealth inequality will be difficult to maintain over time, according to Credit Suisse. The vast majority of Russia\u2019s wealth is in the country\u2019s west, around Moscow and St. Petersburg. The rest of the country, which stretches over nine time zones, is years behind economically. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the have-nots demand a piece of the country\u2019s wealth.\n\n\u201cThere were hopes that Russia would convert to a high skilled, high income economy with strong social protection programs inherited from Soviet Union days. This is almost a parody of what happened in practice,\" the report found.\n\nIt continued: \u201cEfforts were made at the outset to distribute state assets equitably: Most of the housing stock was given away to residents and shares in Gazprom were allocated to Russian citizens. But other choice assets in resource-rich companies went to the chosen few, and subsequent developments in a nation notorious for weak institutions have reinforced the importance of political connections rather than entrepreneurial talent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Just 110 people control 35 percent of all of Russia\u2019s wealth.
