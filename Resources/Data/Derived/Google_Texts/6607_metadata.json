Market research firm Datassential took a big bite into the American sandwich market in a recent report that looked at everything from where sandwiches are served (nearly three-fourths of all restaurants) to which trends are hot (barbecue, \u201cupscale breads\u201d like brioche or pretzel buns). As part of their survey of hundreds of Americans, the Datassential team asked this amusingly phrased question: \u201cThink back to the very last time you had a sandwich. What type of sandwich was it?\u201d\n\nThe answers from 946 respondents are broken down in the charts below. Turkey and ham topped the list, with Americans usually making the sandwiches at home and eating them cold.
