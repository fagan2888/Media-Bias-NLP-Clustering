A sunflower farm in northeast Kansas has drawn attention from across the world.

More than 25,000 people made their way to the Grinter Farms sunflower fields between Lawrence and Tonganoxie this year, including some from Japan and Guatemala and a BBC camera crew. They came to see what acres and acres of sunflowers -- an estimated 1 million plants -- look like in full bloom.

Ted and Kris Grinter allow people to wander through the fields and take pictures, asking only for a $1 donation for every sunflower taken.

This year's season is over. The sunflowers are starting to droop and harvesting has begun, so visitors are asked to stay away until next year.
