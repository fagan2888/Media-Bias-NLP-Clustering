The state has also targeted 28,000 parolees for Medicaid.\n\nAll told, Illinois could have 3 million people \u2014 nearly one in four in the state \u2014 on Medicaid when Obamacare officially begins Jan 1.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, we\u2019re going to see what is the largest tax increase on working families in Illinois history with the shift of these increased health costs,\u201d said state Sen. Dave Syverson, R-Rockford.\n\nSyverson said Illinois spent $12 billion on Medicaid last year and he expects Illinois\u2019 costs to jump to $13 billion next year. Syverson hopes the federal government never stops paying 90 percent or more of the cost for the new Medicaid enrollees.\n\n\u201cJust like every other federal program where they have promised to cover (the costs) they will change their mind,\u201d Syverson said. \u201cThis is an expense that is going to back to the states in a few years. And it is something that the states clearly can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nContact Benjamin Yount at Ben@IllinoisWatchdog.org or find him on Twitter @BenYount.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois is adding hundreds to Obamacare, tens of thousands to Medicaid.", "title": "Numbers don\u2019t lie: In Illinois, Obamacare means Medicaid - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/ObamaCare.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-15T04:19:37+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/116247/numbers-dont-lie-illinois-obamacare-means-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Illinois", "tag": "Dave Syverson,Illinois,Illinois Policy Institute,medicaid,Naomi Lopez-Baumen,ObamaCare", "published_time": "2013-11-15T04:00:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-15T04:19:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois is adding hundreds to Obamacare, tens of thousands to Medicaid.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/11/ObamaCare.jpg"}, "title": "Numbers don\u2019t lie: In Illinois, Obamacare means Medicaid - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Illinois is adding hundreds to Obamacare, tens of thousands to Medicaid."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06c8\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, nearly 15 times that number, or 19,447, have been pushed into Medicaid through Illinois\u2019 Obamacare portal.\nSyverson said Illinois spent $12 billion on Medicaid last year and he expects Illinois\u2019 costs to jump to $13 billion next year.\nWhen Illinois talks about Obamacare, it really means Medicaid.\nLopez-Baumen said federal Health and Human Services figures expect 75 percent of the nation\u2019s uninsured to get their health coverage through Medicaid.\nAll told, Illinois could have 3 million people \u2014 nearly one in four in the state \u2014 on Medicaid when Obamacare officially begins Jan 1."}
