Laying out an optimistic vision of America five and ten years from now, the President deftly avoided speaking out on pressing, controversial short-term issues such as gun control and the unfolding hostage crisis in Iran. Instead, Obama went big, taking a victory lap for his presidency, touting the \u201cspirit that made the progress of these past seven years possible.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s greatest hits, he reminded the country, includes saving the U.S. economy from the 2008 crash, improving No Child Left Behind, reforming the student loan repayment system, passing the Affordable Care Act, cheap and clean energy (\u201cGas under two bucks a gallon ain\u2019t bad,\u201d he quipped), mending diplomatic relations with Cuba, making progress on climate change reform, and the Iranian nuclear deal. Plus, did you remember how he killed Osama bin Laden?\n\nBecause he totally did that:\n\nIf you doubt America\u2019s commitment \u2014 or mine \u2014 to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden. Ask the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell. When you come after Americans, we go after you. It may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.\n\nWhile Obama kept the spotlight on problems like ISIS, climate change, income inequality, and influence of money in politics, the president also avoided several of the issues he hopes to take executive action on in his final year. Unmentioned in Obama\u2019 final State of the Union address were women\u2019s reproductive rights and gun control\u2014not to mention that mildly inconvenient naval hostage crisis playing out in Iran.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With his time in office wrapping up, the president wants America to remember the good times.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Tina Nguyen", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "With his time in office wrapping up, the president wants America to remember the good times.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Final State of the Union Was Basically a List of His Greatest Hits", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/01/barack-obama-state-of-the-union-greatest-hits", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5695cff09da0b28a1ac9c1ef/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/obama-sotu-greatest-hits.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "With his time in office wrapping up, the president wants America to remember the good times.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Final State of the Union Was Basically a List of His Greatest Hits", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5695cff09da0b28a1ac9c1ef/master/pass/obama-sotu-greatest-hits.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "barack obama,state of the union", "pubdate": "2016-01-12T11:18:00Z", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Barack Obama, delivering his last State of the Union address, outlined a vision of the future that relied a lot on the past.\nUnmentioned in Obama\u2019 final State of the Union address were women\u2019s reproductive rights and gun control\u2014not to mention that mildly inconvenient naval hostage crisis playing out in Iran.\nBecause he totally did that:If you doubt America\u2019s commitment \u2014 or mine \u2014 to see that justice is done, ask Osama bin Laden.\nIt may take time, but we have long memories, and our reach has no limit.\nAsk the leader of al Qaeda in Yemen, who was taken out last year, or the perpetrator of the Benghazi attacks, who sits in a prison cell."}
