Anytime he heard a sliver of good news, the president reacted the same way: He knocked on the polished cherry wood table in the Roosevelt Room.\n\nIt\u2019s a small thing, almost a nervous tic, but Obama\u2019s habit of knocking on wood during Obamacare meetings had become notable, something that close advisers talked and even joked about among themselves.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama had always projected the aura of a deeply confident man, someone who on the basis of past experience was justified in assuming that good luck just naturally happened to him. But in the second term, confronted by recurring setbacks and regular reminders of the limits of his power, he began to convey a sense that even hopeful news might be ephemeral, a mirage.\n\n( PHOTOS: Obama's Hotel California)\n\nWhen Obamacare fixer Jeffrey Zients told the president for the first time that the website would finally hold up under a rush of visitors, Obama joined his senior aides in a round of knocking. When the insurance marketplace finally functioned as it should, they knocked. When enrollment numbers picked up in March, they knocked.\n\nIn interviews with more than 60 people who have had close dealings with Obama \u2014 his aides, lawmakers, friends, historians, critics and outside advisers \u2014 the portrait emerges of a president shadowed by a deepening awareness that his time and power are finite, and that two-thirds of his presidency is already in the past tense.\n\nThe interviews, which illuminate Obama\u2019s thinking, outlook and choices as he navigates his second term, suggest a paradox. Often stymied at home and abroad, Obama recognizes that he is less in control of the Washington agenda than ever in his presidency \u2014 a reality that has left him deeply frustrated at times. Last week was a case study, with the Veterans Affairs scandal and resignation of Secretary Eric Shinseki eclipsing Obama\u2019s surprise visit to Afghanistan and major foreign policy speech at West Point.\n\n( WATCH: Obama: What you didn't know)\n\nYet his newfound realism has also given him a palpable sense of liberation.\n\nThe president, finally, is much freer to talk about things that matter to him. He discusses issues of race in a far more personal way, more frequently, than he ever did in his first term. He is more prone to speak his mind on contentious social issues, to the point of volunteering that, in his younger days, \u201cI got high\u2019\u2019 \u2014 an unusually blunt take on his past that aides say they would have prevented before his reelection, fearful of how his critics would use the sound bite.\n\nObama still hasn\u2019t accepted the extraordinary isolation of being president. But he\u2019s become more deliberate in finding ways to break out, particularly as he suffers the early onset of empty nest syndrome. With his daughters around less, the Obamas are taking fuller advantage of the perquisites of the office, such as squeezing \u201cA Raisin in the Sun\u201d on Broadway into a recent Manhattan fundraising trip.\n\nIn a departure from a long practice of keeping his personal circle strikingly tight and rarely lingering at official events, Obama has been hosting star-studded dinners that sometimes go on well past midnight and inviting a few newcomers such as former NBA star Alonzo Mourning into his social sphere. He\u2019s playing golf more than any other year, replacing basketball as his go-to sport, partly because of concerns about getting injured.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama\u2019s new teammate: Alonzo Mourning)\n\nObama is giving more thought to his post-presidency than his aides like to suggest. He has spoken privately of his intention to establish a foundation with the reach and influence of the Clinton Global Initiative, the international fundraising juggernaut started by former President Bill Clinton. And despite his deep connections to Chicago, he has told friends he would like to live in New York City.\n\nThe president\u2019s political world is more and more beyond his command. Instead, it is driven by Republicans in Congress, potentially power-shifting Senate races in states where Obama isn\u2019t welcomed to campaign, and to speculation centered on Hillary Clinton\u2019s agenda \u2014 not his own. Obama tells anxious Democrats that there is only so much he can do beyond fundraising and better implementing the health care law. But he also has told allies that losing the Senate to Republicans would make his last two years in office unbearable.\n\nThis sense of diminished possibilities has infused his governing strategy.\n\n( PHOTOS: Obama going gray)\n\nObama is most animated by the enormous challenge of closing the income gap between the rich and poor, but he\u2019s had to rely on only small-ball initiatives. He and his aides have charted out a schedule of executive actions through early next year, giving the West Wing a renewed focus even if the ambition pales in comparison to the early days.\n\nBut a presidency built on finding ways to elude Congress is a remarkable descent for a leader whose second inaugural address was an audacious call to arms for a liberal resurgence. These days his actions reflect a conclusion that his best option is to navigate shrewdly within narrow limits rather than soar above them with transformative politics.\n\nAt the recent White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, Obama was sufficiently at peace to deliver joke after joke about \u201cmy stellar 2013.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI admit it, last year was rough,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cSheesh. At one point, things got so bad, the 47 percent called Mitt Romney to apologize.\u201d\n\nFollow @politico\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "In his second term, the president sees his power limited.
