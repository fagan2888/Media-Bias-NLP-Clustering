Kennedy. Roughly 10,700 farm workers could be left uninsured or require California taxpayers to pay a subsidy.\n\nThe United Farm Workers (UFW) insurance plan \u2013 the Robert F. Kennedy Medical Plan \u2013 limits annual benefits to $70,000, in violation of the Affordable Care Act, which bars caps on benefits, the Los Angeles Times reports. The union was already given a waiver, but that expires in September.\n\nThe UFW plan is funded by employers and the farm workers. Purchasing replacement insurance could increase the cost by 35 percent to 80 percent, the Times reported.\n\nSome Democratic legislators are backing a bill to provide a $3.2 million subsidy for the union.\n\nState Sen. Ellen Corbett, a Democrat, said the subsidy would be financed from cigarette taxes and would \u201csupport some of our hardest workers, who bring our food to the table.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Darrell Steinberg\u2019s spokesman Mark Hedlund said taxpayers will be on the hook for a larger even larger costs if the farmworkers wind up on Medi-Cal, Califonira\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Mike Morrell (R-Rancho Cucamonga) said, \u201cIt seems like we are picking winners and losers,\u201d Morrell said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why this particular group [would be] sent $3 million.\u201d\n\nEven the UFW question the subsidy.\n\n\u201cCreating a special set of rules for one plan, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d she said. \u201cOur plan absorbed the cost,\u201d said Clare Einsmann, the trust\u2019s executive vice president.\n\nIn 2010, the UFW\u2019s PAC gave more than $10,000 to Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s campaign and thousands more to legislative candidates, the Times says. Dolores Huerta, who helped create the union with Chavez, has helped promote Obamacare coverage to Latinos in California.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 0, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare has now managed to cause angst with an insurance plan created by the efforts of farm labor activist Cesar Chavez and named for Robert F.
