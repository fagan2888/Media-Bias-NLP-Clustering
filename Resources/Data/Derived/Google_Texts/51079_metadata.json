Trust me, I should know. And in the case of Jimmy Carter, it\u2019s a miraculous breakthrough for medicine, and a gift to the world that an extraordinary person gets to have more time in it. It\u2019s a sign of hope. It\u2019s not enough.\n\nOn Sunday, the 91 year-old former president of the United States made the extraordinary announcement \u2014 first to his fellow parishioners at the Sunday school at Plains\u2019 Maranatha Baptist Church \u2014 and then via an official statement from the Carter Center \u2014 that \u201cMy most recent MRI brain scan did not reveal any signs of the original cancer spots nor any new ones. I will continue to receive regular 3-week immunotherapy treatments of pembrolizumab.\u201d\n\nIn August, Carter announced that he had been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma \u2014 the deadliest form of skin cancer, and one that traditionally has offered few treatment options. As the LA Times reported at the time, \u201cFormer President Jimmy Carter can be thankful that he fell ill in 2015 instead of 2010.\u201d That just happens to be the year I was first diagnosed with melanoma \u2014with a metastatic recurrence just a year later. It\u2019s a diagnosis that has typically offered patients a mere handful of months to live. As the Atlanta Journal Constitution noted this week, \u201cOnly a few years ago, Stage IV melanoma was tantamount to a death sentence.\u201d\n\nBut fortunately for people like Carter \u2014 and me \u2014 the field of treatment is changing rapidly. Thanks to an innovative clinical trial, I was one of the first individuals in the world to be treated with a combination of two drugs designed to essentially take the brakes off the immune system so it can be activated to recognize and destroy cancer cells. Three months after starting the trial, I presented no evidence of disease. I\u2019ll be four years cancer free next month. And I could not be more thrilled or hopeful that in October, my drug combination became the first combination immunotherapy treatment approved by the FDA. Last month, one of my drugs \u2014 Opdivo \u2014 was approved for use in renal cancer; just earlier this year it was also approved for non-small cell lung cancer. And that\u2019s just my two drugs. There are many more, including Carter\u2019s Pembrolizumab (Keytruda). Meanwhile, ongoing immunotherapy clinical trials are also showing success with an array of other cancers.\n\nBut despite the cause for hope, there are limitations. This week, as I was describing my cancer treatment to a fellow writer, I mentioned that it has had a roughly 30% success rate. He \u2014 like my oncologist when she first got me into my clinical trial \u2014 seemed impressed with the number. But it\u2019s a lot less cause for celebration when you\u2019re the one with a fatal form of disease. It\u2019s certainly not the kind of chance you\u2019d be thrilled to take in say, your birth control. USA Today notes that Carter\u2019s treatment offers similar odds, reporting this week that \u201cAbout one-third of patients who take Keytruda get a benefit, either because the cancer shrinks or stops growing.\u201d What happens to the rest?", "article_metadata": {"description": "I know firsthand what immunotherapy can do -- and what it can't", "title": "Jimmy Carter\u2019s cancer treatment saved my life, too", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I know firsthand what immunotherapy can do -- and what it can't", "title": "Jimmy Carter\u2019s cancer treatment saved my life, too", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/09/jimmy_carters_cancer_treatment_saved_my_life_too/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/jimmy_carter2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I know firsthand what immunotherapy can do -- and what it can't", "title": "Jimmy Carter\u2019s cancer treatment saved my life, too", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/jimmy_carter2.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Cancer, clinical trials, Immunotherapy, Jimmy Carter, melanoma, Opdivo, Yervoy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Cancer, clinical trials, Immunotherapy, Jimmy Carter, melanoma, Opdivo, Yervoy, Life NewsThis didn\u2019t used to be sort of thing a person comes back from.\nThis week, as I was describing my cancer treatment to a fellow writer, I mentioned that it has had a roughly 30% success rate.\nAnd I could not be more thrilled or hopeful that in October, my drug combination became the first combination immunotherapy treatment approved by the FDA.\nAnd in the case of Jimmy Carter, it\u2019s a miraculous breakthrough for medicine, and a gift to the world that an extraordinary person gets to have more time in it.\nHe \u2014 like my oncologist when she first got me into my clinical trial \u2014 seemed impressed with the number."}
