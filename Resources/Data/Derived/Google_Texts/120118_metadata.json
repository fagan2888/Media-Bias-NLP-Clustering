The topics discussed were pressing: a potential war with ISIS, voting rights, a still-struggling economy. But one key element was in conspicuously short supply: the media.\n\nThis was increasingly the reality in much of the country, as campaigns played out in communities where the local press corps has been thinned by layoffs and newspaper closures. What if you held an election and nobody showed up to cover it? Americans have now discovered the answer: You get an election with lots of paid ads, but with little journalism, context or objective facts.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2012, the newspaper workforce decreased by 30 percent nationally, according to the American Society of Newspaper Editors. That has included a major reduction in the number of newspaper reporters assigned to cover state and local politics. Newspaper layoffs have ripple effects for the entire local news ecosystem, because, as the Congressional Research Service noted, television, radio and online outlets often \u201cpiggyback on reporting done by much larger newspaper staffs.\u201d Meanwhile, recent studies from the University of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank suggest the closure of newspapers can ultimately depress voter turnout in local elections.\n\nColorado is a microcosm of the hollowing out of local media. In 2009, the state lost its second-largest newspaper with the shuttering of the 150-year-old Rocky Mountain News. The state\u2019s only remaining major daily, the Denver Post, has had rolling layoffs.\n\nAccording to Denver Post editor Greg Moore, in the 2014 election cycle the paper had only 7 reporters covering elections throughout the state \u2014 a 50 percent reduction in the last 5 years. Challengers in districts that the Post decided not to cover say the media\u2019s decisions about resources may help determine election outcomes.\n\n\u201cIt creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. When the local press assumes a race can\u2019t be close, then they don\u2019t cover it, and then that suggests to voters a candidate isn\u2019t credible,\u201d said Martin Walsh, the Republican congressional candidate who unsuccessfully challenged Denver\u2019s Democratic representative, Diana DeGette. \u201cUltimately, that guarantees that the race won\u2019t be close.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just 36 percent of the electorate showed up to cast their ballots.
