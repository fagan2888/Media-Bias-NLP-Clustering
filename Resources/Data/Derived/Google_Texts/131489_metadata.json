In order to do that, they had to make Faried a \u201cdesignated player.\u201d And according to the CBA, a designated player\u2019s first-year salary is the maximum, which means Faried would have been paid a max contract under those rules.\n\nThis contract is an average of $12.5 million per season. The deal will likely be signed Wednesday.\n\nFaried did not talk with reporters on Tuesday. The Nuggets arrived back in town at 2:30 a.m. after their first preseason game, against the Lakers on Monday night. The team watched film and shot free throws after going 29-of-44 in the 98-95 loss to the Lakers.\n\nFaried wasn\u2019t part of that problem, making six of his eight free-throw attempts. But the Manimal was bottled up everywhere else, going 0-for-4 from the field and finishing with one rebound.\n\n\u201cThe ball didn\u2019t come his way,\u201d coach Brian Shaw said. \u201cThey were more prepared for him in terms of runouts and things of that nature.\u201d\n\nTeams are going to be paying acute attention to Faried, Shaw said. The fame he gained in the summer playing for Team USA \u2014 and his impending contract extension has placed him at or near the top of opponent scouting reports.\n\n\u201cWhen his contract and all that stuff is taken care of, and it\u2019s done and all of the numbers come out, and all of the accolades that he got from this summer and how he ended up last season, he\u2019s going to have to learn how to play a different way as well,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cBecause he will be a point of emphasis for other teams to game plan against, whereas before maybe he wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhich, Shaw said, isn\u2019t unlike others who have experienced a rise in star power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what every player goes through that reaches that level,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cStar players, once they have an effective season, the next season team\u2019s start \u2026 game-planning specifically for the strengths that you bring to the floor. He has to learn to negotiate through that and play around that.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets return to the court Wednesday at Pepsi Center against Oklahoma City for the Thunder\u2019s preseason opener.\n\nNone of the Nuggets players coming off surgery \u2014 Nate Robinson, Danilo Gallinari, J.J. Hickson or JaVale McGee \u2014 will play against Oklahoma City, Shaw said.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets\u2019 Kenneth Faried agrees to 4-year extension for $50 million", "title": "Nuggets\u2019 Kenneth Faried agrees to 4-year extension for $50 million", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/07/nuggets-kenneth-faried-agrees-to-4-year-extension-for-50-million/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141007__fariedp1.jpg", "height": 549}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141007__fariedp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-07T17:24:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:25:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Nuggets have come to agreement on a 4-year, $50 million contract extension with Kenneth Faried, according to a league source, that could grow to $52 million with incentives.\nThe sides had earlier agreed to a five-year, $60 million contract beyond this season but it did not comply with rules of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA).\nNone of the Nuggets players coming off surgery \u2014 Nate Robinson, Danilo Gallinari, J.J.
