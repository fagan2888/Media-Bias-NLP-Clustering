Bush, Hurricane Katrina, Michael Dukakis, presidential library, Swiftboat, Ted Cruz, Thomas Frank, Tom Frank, Willie Horton, wmd, Politics News\n\nBarack Obama has formally entered that phase of the presidential life cycle that is all about defining his legacy, building a presidential library, and courting the judgment of historians. I suppose it is a good thing for politicians to consider the scrutiny of future generations. In fact, I wish they worried about it more; I wish they constantly asked themselves and their advisers what the nation\u2019s scholars will make of their decisions. It would be a healthful check on an otherwise too-powerful office, where the decision to drop a bomb or render a suspect is attended by few other consequences.\n\nUnfortunately, presidential libraries and historical scrutiny are not the same thing. They aren\u2019t even in the same category, really. I visited three of the most recently built presidential museums a few weeks ago\u2014the Bill Clinton Presidential Center plus two museums commemorating the administrations of men named George Bush\u2014and found them to be, by and large, institutions of bald propaganda, buildings on which hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to cast, literally, in stone, a given individual\u2019s personal war with reality.\n\nAll of the presidential museums I visited have certain things in common. They each contain a replica of the Oval Office as it was decorated when the museum\u2019s subject worked there. They each display lots of formal White House dinner settings and gifts the president received from foreign leaders. They usually feature a presidential limousine or some other mode of official conveyance. Their object is always the same: to make you, the visitor, love and esteem the politician in question.\n\nThis is closer to advertising than it is to scholarship. It can be persuasive. In fact, all three museums I visited were successful, to a certain degree, at convincing me to admire their subjects. I walked into each as the most skeptical possible visitor, ready to find fault and argue with the text. I didn\u2019t particularly like any of the three presidents in question, although I voted for Bill Clinton and I once gave a lecture at the University of Arkansas\u2019 nearby Clinton School of Public Service. But I left all three of these presidential shrines thinking the same thing of the man in question: Dang, he seems like a good guy. Despite all his screw-ups, he must have meant well.\n\nSometimes this warm feeling would stick to me all the way back to my hotel room, where I would finally wash it away with a cold six-pack.\n\n*\n\nAnother thing these presidential libraries have in common is that they soft-pedal those moments of partisan rancor known as elections. Yes, each of them has lots of campaign buttons and the stupid sloganeering memorabilia you can collect at party conventions, but usually this stuff is sequestered in a single room or display case with little more explanation than a few commonplaces quoted from a campaign book. The feeling you get is that elections are exciting but largely without real content, and the less said about them the better. Now, on to the important stuff, which is to say, the big decisions and uplifting remarks that our subject made while he sat in the Oval Office.\n\nAnd so, in the George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College Station, Texas, you will find nothing in the collections on display about \u201cvoodoo economics,\u201d the striking label George H. W. Bush applied to Ronald Reagan\u2019s doctrines while on the campaign trail in 1980. You will search his exhibit on the 1988 presidential election in vain for a reference to either the infamous Willie Horton TV commercial or the flag-veneration fury that Bush stoked, even though both episodes are regarded by historians as milestones on the road to the culture-war bottom. Instead, the main commentary on that year\u2019s contest is delivered by George\u2019s wife, Barbara, who appears in a video testifying to her husband\u2019s many personal virtues. When this fine fellow George Bush finally lost in 1992, the museum makes clear, it was only thanks to public misapprehension of economic issues.\n\nGo to Little Rock, Arkansas, and visit the Clinton museum, however, and you will find that the public of 1992 got matters exactly right, that they perceptively grasped that \u201cit was Bill Clinton who claimed the mantle as the candidate of change,\u201d whatever that means. To judge by the library\u2019s orientation movie, the most urgent issue facing the nation in 1992 was, as Clinton himself put it, that \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be one country again.\u201d\n\nThe exception to this Law of Meaningless Elections should be the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas; after all, its subject only won the presidency in 2000 after an election so close it brought on a Constitutional crisis. Sure enough, there is a large exhibit on that very subject, complete with examples of the Florida ballots that proved so disastrous and an endless video loop of media errors on election night. But once again, what is not emphasized is what is most important, in this case the awkward but essential fact that George W. Bush actually received fewer votes than his opponent and therefore had no real business being in the White House at all. I could find no mention in the museum at all of Bush\u2019s ugly, Swiftboating triumph of 2004.\n\nI was going to criticize this aspect of presidential libraries for the obvious reason that elections aren\u2019t some afterthought to be dismissed with empty phrases; they are, or should be, the very essence of politics.\n\nBut on second thought, maybe there is something healthy about the way these museums downplay partisan conflict. I personally find it irksome to sit in a chair and relive George Bush senior\u2019s inaugural address, easily one of the most fatuous orations of the twentieth century. (\u201cA thousand points of light.\u201d) But other people\u2014like, say, the consensus-minded folks who write newspaper columns\u2014no doubt find it reassuring and even inspiring. The way George H. W. Bush\u2019s museum presents him, this lifelong Republican partisan comes off like a fair and decent individual, especially when you compare the exhibits in his shrine to, say, the recent contumely of his fellow Texan Ted Cruz. Maybe presidential libraries are the last bastion of American civility, and I should stop typing this essay right now.\n\n*\n\nIt is the presidential library of Bush\u2019s son Dubya that makes such an approach impossible, because\u2014just like the man himself in real life\u2014it uses a surface of friendly platitudes and pseudo-professional objectivity to smuggle in distortion and ideology of the crudest sort. This is apparent from almost the first exhibit the visitor comes to, \u201cCreating Opportunity.\u201d This is supposedly about Bush\u2019s stewardship of the economy, but look closer and it\u2019s actually a salute to one single economic tool\u2014tax cuts\u2014so oblivious to what really happened in the Bush years that it includes a hands-on display for kids teaching them \u201cHow tax relief helps small businesses grow the economy.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t envy the people who won the contract to design Dubya\u2019s museum. His reign saw so many catastrophes to gloss over, so many screw-ups to minimize and so many blunders to skate past that it must have taxed the imagination of the cleverest PR professionals. The basic problem facing them, of course, was how to present this stuff without making Bush seem like a scoundrel and without stoking visitors to a flaming rage. The strategy they appear to have settled upon is to defuse each discrete Bush disaster by presenting it between slabs of noncontroversial Bush virtue.\n\nAnd so the infuriating exhibit on tax cuts is followed by a heroic, day-by-day reconstruction of Bush\u2019s activities during his single chapter of greatness after September 11, 2001. Then: \u201cDefending Freedom,\u201d which is to say, invading Afghanistan and Iraq, passing the Patriot Act, opening his prison at Guantanamo Bay, and all the obscene rest of it. If you read carefully, you will find the Iraq War concession you\u2019re looking for: \u201cNo stockpiles of WMD were found.\u201d Otherwise, the museum sticks closely to the old script. The Iraq invasion was part of a \u201cGlobal War on Terror\u201d; we did it \u201cto enforce the will of the international community\u201d; and Saddam Hussein was really, really bad. Besides, remember how they tore down that statue? How they dipped their fingers in that purple ink when they voted?\n\nThis thick stuff is chased by lighter memories of Laura and the twins and all the fun they had. Barney the dog capers once again on the White House lawn. There\u2019s an exhibit on the President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, which I had never heard of before but which has obvious merit as a disgust suppressant. And there\u2019s a sycophantic letter from Bono, written on Vanity Fair letterhead and carefully preserved for all mortified eternity in a glass vitrine.\n\nThen, it\u2019s back to the shit. An exhibit on Hurricane Katrina\u2014or, more precisely, on how the lousy response to the hurricane wasn\u2019t really Bush\u2019s fault. (Bush\u2019s pal Brownie is not mentioned.) An exhibit on the financial crisis, which, the president tells us, was \u201cnot a failure of the free market system.\u201d Then comes the museum\u2019s most ingenious device for blame-evasion: \u201cDecision Points Theater,\u201d an exhibit in which the greatest blunders of the last decade are presented as a sort of video game. In the scenario on the screen when I was there, visitors watched frantic TV news footage from the worst days of the 2008 financial crisis and were presented with two choices: Bail the bankers out or let the bastards fail\u2014because those were the only two possibilities, right? If you think Bush screwed things up, well, let\u2019s see you get a higher score than he did.\n\nBy the way, the group I watched chose to let the Wall Street banks fail, a satisfying denouement that is popular with the visitors, a nearby guard told me.\n\nWhat I am saying is that this is a museum whose entire objective is to get one man off the hook for his egregious misrule. Maybe all presidential libraries do this; maybe it\u2019s only more noticeable here since Iraq is still in flames and Wall Street banks are still fleecing the world and Bush\u2019s free-market wrecking crew actually has a chance of resuming their experiment in good government any day now. But before your revulsion can boil over, you find yourself learning about the remarkable virtues of the George W. Bush retirement. His library has a Platinum LEED rating. He himself helped to build a humble clinic in Africa in 2012 and has arranged many sporting events for wounded veterans. Maybe you\u2019ll even buy the jigsaw puzzle they\u2019re selling in the gift shop that shows Bush and seven other Republican presidents playing cards, all of them lost in hilarious bonhomie.
