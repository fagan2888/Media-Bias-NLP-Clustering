The year-end spending deal that Obama signed in December delayed the start of the Cadillac tax for two years, until 2020. The Congressional Budget Office said the two-year delay would result in lost revenue of $17.7 billion over 10 years.\n\n\u2018Gold\u2019 Plans\n\nUnder the ACA, health plans pay a 40 percent excise tax on the cost of their coverage over a threshold value, currently $10,200 for individuals or $27,500 for families. Those limits are expected to adjust upward before the tax takes effect in 2020.\n\nObama\u2019s budget would raise the threshold at which plans are subject to the tax in states with higher health care costs. Instead of a single threshold across the country, employers could offer more generous coverage in states where \u201cgold\u201d-level plans offered on the ACA\u2019s insurance exchanges cost more than the Cadillac tax limits. Gold plans are the second-most generous plans available on the exchanges.\n\nThe effect would be that fewer employers would pay the tax.\n\nThe White House says that taxing the highest-value health insurance plans will encourage efficiency by hospitals, doctors and other caregivers. Employers -- including labor unions that are among Democrats\u2019 biggest supporters -- have opposed the tax as unfairly singling out businesses that provide their employees with generous health benefits.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is one of the president\u2019s signature achievements. Republicans in Congress have tried repeatedly to overturn it; on Monday, the House failed to override Obama\u2019s veto of a bill intended to gut the law. By tweaking the Cadillac tax -- one of the most unpopular parts of the law -- Obama hopes to preserve a key piece of his legacy.\n\n\u2018More Viable\u2019\n\n\u201cIn a way, it makes the underlying law more viable, but it probably will not mollify the opponents,\u201d Chris Jennings, president of Jennings Policy Strategies and a former Obama aide, said in an interview.\n\nCongress and Obama in December also enacted moratoriums on ACA taxes on medical devices and health insurers. The Treasury Department estimates 7 percent of people with employer-provided health insurance have plans subject to the 40 percent Cadillac tax.\n\n\u201cWe encourage Congress to enact sensible improvements to the tax, and the administration has put forward its ideas for consideration,\u201d Furman wrote. \u201cWe believe the most important step Congress can take is to ensure that the tax goes into effect without any further delay.\u201d\n\nObama will release his budget proposal on Feb. 9.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Angela Greiling Keane", "description": "President Barack Obama will propose reducing the bite of the unpopular \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost health insurance plans in the budget he releases next week, in a bid to preserve a key element of the Affordable Care Act.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/igxmgcESN5Qw/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "President Barack Obama will propose reducing the bite of the unpopular \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost health insurance plans in the budget he releases next week, in a bid to preserve a key element of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Obama Aims for More Targeted Cadillac Tax in Budget Proposal", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-03/obama-aims-for-more-targeted-cadillac-tax-in-budget-proposal", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/igxmgcESN5Qw/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama will propose reducing the bite of the unpopular \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost health insurance plans in the budget he releases next week, in a bid to preserve a key element of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Obama Aims for More Targeted Cadillac Tax in Budget Proposal", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-03/obama-aims-for-more-targeted-cadillac-tax-in-budget-proposal", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/igxmgcESN5Qw/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "President Barack Obama will propose reducing the bite of the unpopular \"Cadillac tax\" on high-cost health insurance plans in the budget he releases next week, in a bid to preserve a key element of the Affordable Care Act."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Obama Aims for More Targeted Cadillac Tax in Budget Proposal", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "O1ZTKYSYF01W01", "parsely-author": "Angela Greiling Keane", "date": "2016-02-03T22:55:20.087Z", "keywords": "Health,Congressional Budget Office,Barack H Obama", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Health,Congressional Budget Office,Barack H Obama", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-02-03T22:55:20.087Z", "parsely-tags": "Health,Congressional Budget Office,Barack H Obama,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-02-03/obama-aims-for-more-targeted-cadillac-tax-in-budget-proposal"}, "article_summary": "The year-end spending deal that Obama signed in December delayed the start of the Cadillac tax for two years, until 2020.\nBy tweaking the Cadillac tax -- one of the most unpopular parts of the law -- Obama hopes to preserve a key piece of his legacy.\nThe Treasury Department estimates 7 percent of people with employer-provided health insurance have plans subject to the 40 percent Cadillac tax.\nThe White House says that taxing the highest-value health insurance plans will encourage efficiency by hospitals, doctors and other caregivers.\nObama\u2019s budget would raise the threshold at which plans are subject to the tax in states with higher health care costs."}
