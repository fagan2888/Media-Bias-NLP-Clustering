R. Horton, began requiring all new employees \u2013 and any existing employees who wanted to keep their jobs \u2013 to sign an agreement saying that they agreed to \u201cvoluntarily waive all rights to trial in court before a judge or jury on all claims\u201d between the employee and the company. They would submit, instead, to binding arbitration.\n\nNot only did employees who signed the agreement waive their right to participate in a class action lawsuit, they also waived their right to participate in class-based arbitration. The National Labor Relations Board in 2012 ruled that the agreement was illegal, but last month the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans overturned that ruling.\n\nRelated: The Sneaky Hidden Clause in Credit Card Agreements\n\nThe ruling has some labor lawyers concerned that if the appeals court ruling is upheld, clauses barring class action lawsuits and class arbitrations could quickly become standard elements in most employment contracts, effectively barring many non-unionized workers from a tool that has historically been used to vindicate workers\u2019 rights.\n\nCatherine K. Ruckelshaus, general counsel and program director for the National Employment Law Project, said that because of under-funding of agencies that enforce labor laws, class action \u201chas been pretty much the only game in town\u201d for workers looking for relief from abusive employers. \u201cIf you can\u2019t aggregate the claims, there is very little pressure on the employer,\u201d said Ruckelshaus.\n\nIn recent years class actions have been used successfully to challenge the practice of making employees work \u201coff the clock\u201d at major retailers and to require that overtime pay be given to workers illegally classified as exempt from overtime requirements.\n\nThere are several arguments in favor of allowing contracts that mandate arbitration. It\u2019s usually cheaper and faster than going through the court system, and to be sure, businesses are often subjected to frivolous lawsuits in the guise of class actions.\n\nRelated: Christie Could Face Class Action Lawsuit for Traffic Jam\n\nBut according to Ruckleshaus, the contracts take advantage of employees who aren\u2019t in a position to refuse to sign them, and who get nothing in return for what they are giving up.\n\n\u201cAlmost any worker or employee is not going to feel empowered to say \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to sign that\u2019 if it\u2019s presented as a condition to getting or keeping a job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible assault on our right to our day in court.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is why the case is so important,\u201d said Craig Becker, who served as an NLRB board member under a recess appointment until the end of 2011, and voted in favor of the agency\u2019s ruling in the Horton case.\n\nBecker, now general counsel to the AFL-CIO, said the ability of workers to pool resources in order to act against perceived unfair practices is \u201ca mechanism that most people take for granted.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Throws a Gut Punch to Teachers\u2019 Unions\n\nMandatory arbitration clauses are not new, and are not unique to employment contracts. They are a common feature of credit card contracts and other financial agreements. (And are currently being examined by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.) They have also, for example, historically been a part of employment contracts for executive-level and other high-ranking employees in the financial services industry.\n\nBut their increasing use in low-wage employees\u2019 contracts, along with the bar to class action, are relatively recent developments, which have attracted the attention not just of the courts, but of lawmakers.\n\nSen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Rep. Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) have sponsored a bill, the Arbitration Fairness Act of 2013, which would bar companies from requiring employees and consumers to consent to binding arbitration prior to a dispute arising. Consent to binding arbitration would still be allowed after a dispute has arisen.\n\nIn a statement provided to the Fiscal Times, Franken said, \u201cMandatory arbitration puts consumers and workers at a huge disadvantage, limiting their access to meaningful legal recourse and preventing them from banding together with others who experienced the same injustices. My Arbitration Fairness Act would restore critical rights to workers and consumers who have been wronged.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 States that Cheat the Most on Jobless Benefits\n\nThe future of the arbitration clause in employment contracts in the wake of the Horton decision is unclear \u2013 a single ruling in a federal appeals court, said a former NLRB member, is unlikely to convince businesses that their use is now unchallengeable.\n\n\u201cThe key take-away from this case is that the issue is not dead, said Ron Meisburg, former general counsel of the NLRB and, for a time, a board member under a recess appointment.\n\n\u201cThe Board is very likely to continue to enforce the law and maintain that these kind of clauses are unlawful,\u201d continued Meisburg, who is now a partner and co-head of the Labor-Management Relations Practice Group at the Proskauer law firm in Washington, DC. \u201cSo for the time being, maintaining these contract clauses puts companies at risk of NLRB prosecution and an adverse decision.\u201d\n\nA number of other cases, however, including two that are working their way through the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, have many labor attorneys convinced that the Supreme Court is likely to weigh in on the issue in the near future.\n\nFollow Rob Garver on Twitter @rrgarver\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If a Federal Appeals Court ruling is upheld, it could become virtually impossible to sue your boss.", "title": "You Can No Longer Take Your Company to Court", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/16/You-Can-No-Longer-Take-Your-Company-Court", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03122013_empty_courtroom_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/16/You-Can-No-Longer-Take-Your-Company-Court", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03122013_empty_courtroom_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If a Federal Appeals Court ruling is upheld, it could become virtually impossible to sue your boss.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "They have also, for example, historically been a part of employment contracts for executive-level and other high-ranking employees in the financial services industry.\nNot only did employees who signed the agreement waive their right to participate in a class action lawsuit, they also waived their right to participate in class-based arbitration.\nBut their increasing use in low-wage employees\u2019 contracts, along with the bar to class action, are relatively recent developments, which have attracted the attention not just of the courts, but of lawmakers.\nIt\u2019s usually cheaper and faster than going through the court system, and to be sure, businesses are often subjected to frivolous lawsuits in the guise of class actions.\nThe National Labor Relations Board in 2012 ruled that the agreement was illegal, but last month the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans overturned that ruling."}
