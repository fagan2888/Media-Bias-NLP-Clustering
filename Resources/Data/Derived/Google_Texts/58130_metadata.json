But the student protesters have made it a point to act civilly, shielding themselves with nothing more than umbrellas and picking up litter in the streets they occupy.\n\nHong Kong leaders, in their first conciliatory gesture, held a televised debate Tuesday with the protesters. Government leaders said they were willing to submit a report to China\u2019s capital, Beijing, acknowledging the surge of public discontent that emerged from the protests.\n\nLee, in an exclusive interview the next day via Skype, told The Daily Signal that the report to the Communist regime should be easy to make.\n\n\u201cThe whole world has seen how peaceful the protesters have been,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee then directed his comments at Leung Chung-ying, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive and top official:\n\n\u201cHe should be proud of the Hong Kong people. He should explain to Beijing that you have nothing to fear from these people.\u201d\n\nBeijing \u201chas nothing to fear\u201d of the Hong Kong protesters, says Martin Lee.\n\n>>> Pro-Democracy Leader Says Hong Kong\u2019s Young Protesters Have Won Already\n\nAt the same time, Lee was critical of President Obama for being \u201cvery quiet\u201d about the struggle for free elections in Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI thought the foreign policy of your administration was one of supporting democracy and rule of law,\u201d Lee said.\n\nAlthough the Hong Kong government made no promises and showed no signs of giving in to the students\u2019 primary demands, Lee said, the prime-time talks provide positive momentum for the democracy movement.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good first step,\u201d Lee said, adding:\n\nAt least it\u2019s something positive. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s a step. Obviously no one expected a full agreement. One good thing is that until then, the government took a very firm line that they would not climb down from. The students wanted some conciliatory move that showed there\u2019s goodwill.\n\n\u2018One of the Most Stupid Comments\u2019\n\nAt 76, Lee, a veteran lawyer and politician, remains a powerful voice and champion of democracy.\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t directly advise the students, earlier this year Lee befriended 17-year-old Joshua Wong, the public face of the student protest movement. On Sept. 28, Lee was giving a speech to the demonstrators when police launched tear gas at the crowd.\n\nDuring a wide-ranging interview, Lee was sharply critical of the United States and Britain for not acting forcefully enough in support of Hong Kong:\n\nIf the British government doesn\u2019t want to get involved, they are obviously putting money before honor. Hong Kong is a great embarrassment to China trade. I\u2019m also not sure why the U.S. government has been very quiet. I thought the foreign policy of your administration was one of supporting democracy and rule of law.\n\n>>> Hong Kong\u2019s Former No. 2 Official Fields 7 Questions on Her City\u2019s Future\n\nMartin Lee says Britain is \u201cputting money before honor\u201d by not acting more forcefully to help Hong Kong.\n\nLee also criticized Leung, Hong Kong\u2019s Beijing-appointed leader, for comments he made Monday.\n\nIn his first interview with foreign press since protests began, Leung told reporters that free elections to choose his successor would give poor people too much of a voice in politics.\n\n\u201cIt was one of the most stupid comments,\u201d Lee said, adding:\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been making many intelligent comments. A huge sector of the community turned against him. A lot of people in Hong Kong make less than $1,800 per month. He\u2019s saying these people are not fit to govern Hong Kong. It\u2019s very insulting.\n\nOpen to Compromise\n\nHong Kong, known for high property prices, also has one of the world\u2019s biggest wealth gaps. Both factors have inspired the student protesters.\n\nDemonstrators have demanded Leung\u2019s resignation and insisted on the democratic election of his successors as well as all lawmakers.\n\nThe reform would allow voters, not a nominating committee aligned with Communist leadership in China, to pick candidates.\n\nSince 1997, the year Britain handed over rule of Hong Kong to China, a 1,200-member \u201celection committee\u201d has picked the city\u2019s leader every five years.\n\nThe committee is represented by four sectors of society, and the system\u2019s defenders claim it gives voice to diverse occupations such as business, fishing and social work.\n\nIn August, China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress said a nominating committee modeled after the existing committee would screen candidates in Hong Kong\u2019s first election for chief executive in 2017.\n\n>>> Watch the Shockingly Brutal Beating of a Pro-Democracy Hong Kong Protester\n\nSome protesters and democracy advocates, including Lee, have expressed a willingness to compromise if Hong Kong reformed the composition of the proposed committee to make it more representative of the population.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the students insist on one model,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThe general fear is that Beijing controls all the candidates. What\u2019s the difference between a rotten orange, a rotten apple and a rotten banana?\u201d\n\nMartin Lee says Beijing\u2019s election proposal is like giving Hong Kong people a choice among rotten fruit.\n\nLee says that because Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law, or mini-constitution, guarantees universal suffrage\u2013the right to vote\u2013a nominating committee should not be prescribed to the same four sectors of society. He said:\n\nWhen we were promised universal suffrage, no one in Hong Kong thought it would be Bejing picking all the candidates, like Iran. It\u2019s totally unacceptable to us. We\u2019ve been waiting so many years.\n\nEnd Game Not Clear\n\nAlmost a month into the protests, the students continue to wait. They haven\u2019t left the streets.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict how the stand-off might conclude, Lee says, but an escalation of police violence is not out of the question.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate end game would be the removal of everybody by force,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey may try plastic bullets, which can kill people. Maybe they will use water cannons.\u201d\n\nLee added that he doesn\u2019t expect that outcome, or one similar to the bloody end of China\u2019s Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, because China has matured since then. He said:\n\n\u201cIn 1989, the Communist Party thought they would lose control of the entire country. There is no such worry now. China\u2019s economy is strong. I don\u2019t think think this will be a repeat of Tiananmen.\u201d\n\nIf Leung refuses to resign as chief executive, Lee said, then Hong Kong\u2019s leader must assert leadership in another way. Because the student protesters, ever peacefully, demand it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult position for everyone,\u201d Lee said of the job of chief executive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Veteran pro-democracy leader Martin Lee says the Hong Kong government has a long way to go to begin to address the demands of demonstrators.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Veteran pro-democracy leader Martin Lee says the Hong Kong government has a long way to go to begin to address the demands of demonstrators.", "title": "76-Year-Old Democracy Leader Praises Hong Kong Protesters", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polphotos329989.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-24T11:42:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/12mCmDm"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Veteran pro-democracy leader Martin Lee says the Hong Kong government has a long way to go to begin to address the demands of demonstrators.", "title": "76-Year-Old Democracy Leader Praises Hong Kong Protesters", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/polphotos329989.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2014-10-24T03:02:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T11:42:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hong Kong, democracy, protests, Beijing, China, Martin Lee, Leung Chung-ying, Hong Kong chief executive, Britain, Basic Law"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7a3\"", "article_summary": "Lee then directed his comments at Leung Chung-ying, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive and top official:\u201cHe should be proud of the Hong Kong people.\nHe said:When we were promised universal suffrage, no one in Hong Kong thought it would be Bejing picking all the candidates, like Iran.\nHe should explain to Beijing that you have nothing to fear from these people.\u201dBeijing \u201chas nothing to fear\u201d of the Hong Kong protesters, says Martin Lee.\n>>> Pro-Democracy Leader Says Hong Kong\u2019s Young Protesters Have Won AlreadyAt the same time, Lee was critical of President Obama for being \u201cvery quiet\u201d about the struggle for free elections in Hong Kong.\nThe aggressive actions by Hong Kong police threatened to undo the elegant image of the city."}
