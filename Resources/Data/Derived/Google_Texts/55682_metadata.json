One group says we should hack them back.\n\nAfter the FBI said North Korea was responsible for the hack, the Human Rights Foundation launched a campaign called #HackThemBack, an initiative to \u201chack\u201d the Kim regime by providing its citizens with information about liberty, freedom and human rights.\n\nThe activists will conduct the \u201chack\u201d by launching films, books and USBs full of Korean-language Wikipedia pages into North Korea.\n\nThe foundation will use \u201chydrogen balloons to airlift material beyond the DMZ (demilitarized zone); land-based smuggling routes through the dictatorship of China; and radio transmissions and programming to reach those who own forbidden tunable short wave radios\u201d to send information into the Hermit Kingdom.\n\nThe Human Rights Foundation called #HackThemBack a \u201cnonviolent\u201d and a \u201ccivil society response.\u201d\n\n\u201c#HackThemBack is a peer-to-peer approach, where anybody who is concerned can empower the underfunded yet courageous men and women who are bringing about change in North Korea through the power of information and ideas,\u201d said chief operating officer Sarah Wasserman in a statement. \u201cTotalitarianism cannot bear an informed and educated citizenry, aware of the option to live in freedom, to participate in their own destinies, and to enjoy the civil rights that so many take for granted in a democracy.\u201d\n\nThe foundation said North Korea is dependent on propaganda to control its citizens. Despite the authoritarian regime, HRF said, North Koreans are \u201chungry for a better life.\u201d They risk their lives to watch contraband Hollywood films.\n\nFilms and TV shows the group has previously launched into North Korea include \u201cBraveheart,\u201d \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fury,\u201d \u201cTitanic,\u201d \u201cTeam America\u201d and \u201cDesperate Housewives.\u201d They hope to include \u201cThe Interview\u201d in a future launch.\n\nAt the Oslo Freedom Forum in October 2014, Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector and a member of HRF, described how seeing \u201cTitanic\u201d changed her outlook on North Korean life.\n\n\u201cWhen I was growing up in North Korea, I never saw anything about love stories between men and women,\u201d Park said. \u201cThere is no books, no songs, no press, no movies about love stories. There is no \u2018Romeo and Juliet.\u2019 Every story was to brainwash about the Kim dictators.\u201d\n\nShe said when she saw the film, she \u201cwas wondering if the director and the actors would be killed,\u201d thinking \u201cHow could they release such a movie? I was so curious.\u201d\n\nPark said that North Koreans are taught through propaganda that \u201cdying for the Kim regime was the most honorable thing anyone could do,\u201d and the regime produces films to reinforce this belief. She described being \u201cinspired\u201d as a child by one such film.\n\nThen, Park saw \u201cTitanic\u201d\u2014and it gave her \u201ca taste of freedom\u201d:\n\nI realized that \u2018Titanic\u2019 showed me a human story about love, beauty, humanity \u2026 it wasn\u2019t propaganda, but a story about people dying for love, a man willing to die for a woman. It changed my thinking. It changed the way I saw the regime and the endless propaganda. \u2018Titanic\u2019 made me realize that I was controlled by the regime.\n\nIn a recent issue brief, David Inserra, a Heritage Foundation research associate for homeland security and cybersecurity, and Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation, advocated several courses of action the United States could take to respond to the cyberattack, including returning North Korea to the state sponsors of terrorism list:\n\nNorth Korea poses a growing national security threat to the United States and its allies. Pyongyang continues to augment and refine its nuclear and missile arsenals. In recent years, the regime has conducted cyber attacks against government and private targets. Without a firm response from the U.S. to North Korea\u2019s hack of Sony and subsequent threat of terrorism, such attacks and threats against the U.S. and her interests will only grow more common.\n\nThe United States recently issued more sanctions on North Korea after the attack. The Obama administration called the attack \u201csupported by\u201d Pyongyang, while Pyongyang has repeatedly denied responsibility.\n\nYou can learn more about the #HackThemBack initiative on Indiegogo.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The activists will conduct the \u201chack\u201d by launching films, books and USBs full of Korean-language Wikipedia pages into North Korea.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The activists will conduct the \u201chack\u201d by launching films, books and USBs full of Korean-language Wikipedia pages into North Korea.", "title": "Group Launches #HackThemBack to Counter North Korea", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-12.04.02-PM.png", "updated_time": "2015-01-05T22:11:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1tK51PB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The activists will conduct the \u201chack\u201d by launching films, books and USBs full of Korean-language Wikipedia pages into North Korea.", "title": "Group Launches #HackThemBack to Counter North Korea", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2015-01-05-at-12.04.02-PM.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2015-01-05T13:39:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-05T22:11:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "North Korea, Sony, Sony hack, the interview, human rights, human rights foundation, cyberattack, #hackthemback"}, "article_summary": "The activists will conduct the \u201chack\u201d by launching films, books and USBs full of Korean-language Wikipedia pages into North Korea.\nThe United States recently issued more sanctions on North Korea after the attack.\n\u201cWhen I was growing up in North Korea, I never saw anything about love stories between men and women,\u201d Park said.\nFilms and TV shows the group has previously launched into North Korea include \u201cBraveheart,\u201d \u201cFreedom\u2019s Fury,\u201d \u201cTitanic,\u201d \u201cTeam America\u201d and \u201cDesperate Housewives.\u201d They hope to include \u201cThe Interview\u201d in a future launch.\nHow should the United States respond to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures?"}
