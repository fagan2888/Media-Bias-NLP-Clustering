On Aug. 29, the U.S. Justice Department announced that it would not seek to prevent the implementation of those laws.\n\nMaine made medical use of marijuana legal in 1999 and established a dispensary system for medical marijuana patients 10 years later. Earlier this year, 35 state lawmakers co-sponsored a bill by Rep. Diane Russell, D-Portland, to legalize and tax recreational use of marijuana. That bill was soundly defeated in committee, but Russell\u2019s last-ditch attempt in June to put the question to a statewide referendum failed in the House by just four votes.\n\nDavid Boyer, political director for Marijuana Policy Project in Maine, said that while the group continues to support legislative efforts toward legalization, the group will seek to put the issue in front of Maine voters via referendum in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe legalization movement has really sped up over the past few years, but the political class is still kind of behind the times on this issue,\u201d Boyer said in an interview Monday. \u201cWe put a lot of effort into Rep. Russell\u2019s bill this past year, and if it\u2019s up again, we\u2019ll put more resources into it. But we can\u2019t count on all the politicians in Augusta to do the right thing on this issue, so we need our own plan.\u201d\n\nA recent poll of potential Maine voters conducted by Public Policy Polling indicated that 48 percent think marijuana should be legal, while 39 percent say it should continue to be criminalized and 14 percent are unsure. Legalization has majority support from Maine Democrats and unenrolled voters, polling at 58 percent and 57 percent, respectively, according to the poll results. Among Republicans, 63 percent said they opposed legalization.\n\nAlthough the group\u2019s referendum goal is three years away, Boyer said the effort to get there has already begun.\n\nAt big events such as the Lobster Festival in Rockland, activists distributed handbills comparing marijuana with alcohol. Marijuana Policy Project seeks to regulate, tax and sell pot the same way as booze, and this is a comparison they\u2019re banking on to resonate with Maine voters.\n\n\u201cAlcohol use is linked to about 5,000,000 violent crimes in the U.S. each year. Studies find no link between marijuana use and violent behavior,\u201d stated one flier, citing statistics from the U.S. Department of Justice. The flip side of the brochure features an attractive, smiling young woman next to text that reads: \u201cSome folks prefer alcohol. My preference is marijuana. Does that make me a bad person?\u201d\n\nRob Kampia, the national executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, will come to Maine later this month to meet with potential campaign donors and activists, Boyer said.\n\n\u201cMarijuana prohibition is an utter failure and causes far more harm than good,\u201d Kampia said in a statement. \u201cBy taxing and regulating marijuana in a manner similar to alcohol, we can take profit away from criminals, create jobs, generate tax revenue and allow law enforcement to focus on serious crimes.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement groups in Maine largely disagree with that last point: The Maine Chiefs of Police Association, Maine Sheriffs Association and Maine Drug Enforcement Agency all testified against Russell\u2019s bill.\n\n\u201cMarijuana is not the benign organic plant that the drug legalization agenda would have us believe,\u201d wrote MDEA Director Roy McKinney, who argued the drug is addictive and known to cause or complicate mental health issues.\n\nRetired police chief Robert Schwartz, executive director of the Maine Chiefs of Police, said his group would continue to oppose any effort to legalize marijuana.\n\n\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s something that no doubt will be a headache for law enforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Mario Moretto on Twitter at @riocarmine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 The national group that successfully pushed for legalization of marijuana in Colorado announced Monday that it will accelerate its efforts to pass laws that treat pot like alcohol in 10 more states by 2017.
