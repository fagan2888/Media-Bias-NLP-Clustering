We have been bipartisan.\"\n\nThe manager\u2019s amendment, from Feinstein and CISA co-sponsor Sen. Richard Burr Richard BurrThe Trail 2016: Hell breaks loose Burr, Ross in statistical dead heat in NC Senate race Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version MORE (R-N.C.), is meant to mitigate some of the privacy and surveillance fears that have kept CISA off the Senate floor for so long.\n\nThe package is expected to be adopted by the Senate.\n\n\u201cIt makes important changes to the bill,\u201d Feinstein said on the floor Wednesday, \u201cto address privacy concerns about the legislation.\u201d\n\nWhile many industry groups, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers and even the White House have backed CISA as a necessary first step to better understanding and repelling hackers, privacy advocates and an increasing number of tech companies have argued the bill would simply shuttle Americans\u2019 personal data to the government without actually strengthening cyber defenses.\n\nThe Burr-Feinstein amendment is meant to assuage worries that Feinstein\u2019s colleagues expressed as CISA moved through the upper chamber.\n\nVarious provisions within the amendment restrict the data that companies can share with the government, eliminate controversial government uses of that data and set up a more robust government scrub of any personal information it accidentally receives, Feinstein explained.\n\nThe clauses are a combination of six edits from Burr and Feinstein and portions of 14 amendments from other lawmakers that have been tacked on since August.\n\nBefore the August recess, Senate leaders agreed to consider at least 22 amendments on CISA, including the Burr-Feinstein package. The duo was able to get eight of those amendments rolled into their manager\u2019s package, in addition to six proposals from other senators.\n\nThe edits likely helped CISA gain the support of key Democrats, including Sen.

Notably, one would establish a filter at the Department of Homeland Security to scrub any personal information such as Social Security numbers before cyber threat data is shared government-wide.\n\n\u201cThe [manager\u2019s] amendment we are debating today makes a number of improvements to the bill that was first made public after the Intelligence Committee reported it out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also includes several changes that I, as well as several of my colleagues, have been calling for.\u201d\n\nBut the package hasn\u2019t won over civil liberties groups and leading CISA critic Sen.
