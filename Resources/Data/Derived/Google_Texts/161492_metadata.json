The surprise wasn\u2019t so much the re-assignment of Johnson but the hiring of Martinez.\n\n\u201cWatching the club it had become apparent to me that we had reached the point that a change was necessary,\u201d general manager Jack Zduriencik said in a statement. \u201cI appreciate Howard Johnson\u2019s professionalism and work ethic, but we simply were not getting the results that we expect and require.\u201d\n\nMartinez spent his entire 18-year major league career with the Mariners and is regarded as one of the best right-handed hitters of his generation. He has worked the past several seasons working as a guest hitting instructor during spring training.\n\n\u201cFor the last three years I\u2019ve been thinking that I want to get back into the game,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI think this is the right time. I haven\u2019t seen so much talent in the Mariners for a long time.\u201d\n\nPopular with his teammates and fans, Martinez joins a team that has the worst batting average in the majors at .233 and ranks 28th in runs scored.\n\n\u201cThe fact is we haven\u2019t performed up to our capabilities probably for a season and a half. I certainly believe this club is better than what it\u2019s shown from an offensive standpoint,\u201d manager Lloyd McClendon said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he can jump start us and help us quite a bit.\u201d\n\nThe 52-year-old Martinez played 2,055 career games with Seattle and hit .312 with a .418 on-base percentage for his career, and won two AL batting titles. Major League Baseball renamed the designated hitter of the year award in Martinez\u2019s honor.\n\n\u201cHopefully we can really get something going with Edgar and he can help us going,\u201d Mariners catcher Mike Zunino said. \u201cTo pick his brain and see what he did and his approach on hitting is going to be a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nMartinez was already working with players in the cage and giving pointers during batting practice before Saturday\u2019s game, although he said he\u2019d mostly be learning about individual needs for now.\n\n\u201cI have some ideas for some of the guys, but at the same time it\u2019s also a lot of listening and watching, for the next few days, especially,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nSeattle is hoping Martinez can quickly find ways to improve an offense that has been shut out four of the last nine games.\n\n\u201cWe were disappointed in how the offense was performing. We all clearly believe this is a better offensive club than what we were producing,\u201d Zduriencik said before Saturday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very confident that the things Edgar will speak to our players about and bring to the table will be a real positive impact on us. We\u2019re in a position right now where we think it was just time to make a move, and we did,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Seattle Mariners are looking to the past to reinvigorate the worst hitting team in baseball, hiring Edgar Martinez as their hitting coach on Saturday and reassigning Howard Johnson to the minor league system.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Seattle Mariners are looking to the past to reinvigorate the worst hitting team in baseball, hiring Edgar Martinez as their hitting coach on Saturday and reassigning Howard Johnson to the minor league system.", "title": "Mariners hire Edgar Martinez as hitting coach, reassign HoJo", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/20/mariners-hire-edgar-martinez-as-hitting-coach-reas/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/20/6ba92060ae58f81b790f6a7067008c2e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/20/6ba92060ae58f81b790f6a7067008c2e.jpg", "description": "The Seattle Mariners are looking to the past to reinvigorate the worst hitting team in baseball, hiring Edgar Martinez as their hitting coach on Saturday and reassigning Howard Johnson to the minor le", "card": "summary", "title": "Mariners hire Edgar Martinez as hitting coach, reassign HoJo"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHopefully we can really get something going with Edgar and he can help us going,\u201d Mariners catcher Mike Zunino said.\n\u201cFor the last three years I\u2019ve been thinking that I want to get back into the game,\u201d Martinez said.\nSEATTLE (AP) - The Seattle Mariners are looking to the past to reinvigorate the worst hitting team in baseball, hiring Edgar Martinez as their hitting coach on Saturday and reassigning Howard Johnson to the minor league system.\nSeattle is hoping Martinez can quickly find ways to improve an offense that has been shut out four of the last nine games.\nWe all clearly believe this is a better offensive club than what we were producing,\u201d Zduriencik said before Saturday\u2019s game."}
