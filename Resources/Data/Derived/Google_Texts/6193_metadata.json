Vote in Poll\n\nJerry Seinfeld has no interest in getting into the diversity debate on television.During a BuzzFeed interview on \"CBS This Morning,\" Seinfeld, in his trademark dry tone, told Peter Lauria that he's annoyed by the enduring question about whether the cast of his new Web series, \"Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,\" is stacked with white men like himself.\u201c[Do] people think it\u2019s the census or something?\u201d Seinfeld quipped, drawing laughter from the audience. \u201cWe represent the actual pie chart of America? Who cares? I have no interest in gender or race or anything like that.\u201dHe jokingly told Lauria to \u201ctake a look around, Peter, what do you see? A lotta whitey! What\u2019s going on here?\u201d before getting more serious and explaining his position.\u201cEveryone else is calculating, is this the exact right mix? To me, it\u2019s anti-comedy. It\u2019s more about PC nonsense than are you making us laugh?\u201dTime magazine writer Lily Rothman devoted a column to Seinfeld\u2019s interview and the subject of race and gender diversity in comedy, saying the comedian \u201cmight regret being so flip.\u201dHis answer, she opined, \u201cis now driving the latest controversy over the racial and gender makeup of the comedy world.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible that 'Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee' won\u2019t drive conversation for long enough to have an impact, but if the issue stays in the spotlight, Seinfeld\u2019s perspective will lose,\u201d Rothman wrote.\u201cA continued lack of diversity on his show would prove his detractors\u2019 point \u2014 and make him look racist and sexist, even if he\u2019s merely failing to actively think about matters of race and sex \u2014 while increased diversity would seem to acknowledge that the \u201cnonsense\u201d isn\u2019t so nonsensical at all.\"There\u2019s no longer a way for a prominent comedian with Seinfeld\u2019s level of influence to be so glib about the issue \u2014 especially given that of his 26 guests, only two have been women and another two have been nonwhite. (There have been no minority women guests so far.)\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "jerry seinfeld,minorities,tv,quotas", "pubdate": "2014-02-05T14:20:21", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Jerry Seinfeld has no interest in getting into the diversity debate on television.", "title": "Seinfeld: Worries About Diversity in Comedy are 'PC Nonsense'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/jerry-seinfeld-minorities-tv-quotas/2014/02/05/id/551086/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/jerry-seinfeld-minorities-tv-quotas/2014/02/05/id/551086/", "description": "Jerry Seinfeld has no interest in getting into the diversity debate on television.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Seinfeld: Worries About Diversity in Comedy are 'PC Nonsense'"}, "epoch": 1391610021, "keywords": "jerry seinfeld,minorities,tv,quotas", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2014-02-05T14:20:21"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/jerry-seinfeld-minorities-tv-quotas/2014/02/05/id/551086/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Jerry Seinfeld has no interest in getting into the diversity debate on television."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80d0\"", "article_summary": "I have no interest in gender or race or anything like that.\u201dHe jokingly told Lauria to \u201ctake a look around, Peter, what do you see?\nWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d before getting more serious and explaining his position.\u201cEveryone else is calculating, is this the exact right mix?\nVote in PollUrgent:Is Obamacare Hurting Your Wallet?\n(There have been no minority women guests so far.\nUrgent:Is Obamacare Hurting Your Wallet?"}
