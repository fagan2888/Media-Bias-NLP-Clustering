He said board members \"have great confidence in Darcy and look forward to working with her as CEO.\"\n\nDavis' competitors for the post at one point included three candidates with ties to the Broward Health public hospital district, which is under investigation by state and federal authorities. A state inquiry came to light after the recent suicide of Broward Health's chief executive officer, Dr. Nabil El Sanadi.\n\nWhile the concerns in Broward prompted questions from some board members in Palm Beach County, Ward said it wasn't the determining factor in choosing Davis.\n\n\"Fortunately we had a really strong internal candidate who made it a non-issue,\" board member Nancy Banner said.\n\nThe Health Care District of Palm Beach County has faced some hiccups of its own, triggering an ongoing review by state auditors.\n\nAnd in July, Dr. Ron Wiewora stepped aside as CEO after a no-confidence vote by the board.\n\nSome board members had complained about communication problems with Wiewora, saying he was slow to tell them about important issues.\n\nLong before the emergence of Obamacare, Palm Beach County voters in 1988 approved creating the Health Care District and authorized new taxes that now pay for the district's $236 million annual budget.\n\nThe Health Care District runs clinics, operates the Trauma Hawk rescue helicopter, school nurse programs, a hospital in Belle Glade and a nursing home in West Palm Beach. The district also provides free or low-cost health insurance coverage.\n\nDavis is a certified public accountant and longtime health care industry executive who went to work for the Health Care District in 2011.\n\nPrior to joining the district, Davis was senior vice president and chief financial officer for Memorial Health University Medical Center in Savannah, Ga.\n\nThe district board still has to approve a salary and contract for Davis. Her predecessor was paid $254,633 a year. The board meets again March 9 to consider finalizing Davis' deal.\n\nDavis said some of her goals include improving the district's public outreach efforts and expanding programs that \"are filling in the gaps where Obamacare doesn't cover.\"\n\n\"We continue to emphasize growth,\" Davis said. \"There are a number of people who continue to be unserved.\"\n\nabreid@sunsentinel.com, 561-228-5504 or Twitter@abreidnews", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Palm Beach County Health Care District picks Davis as CEO", "date": "2016-02-25", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "author": "South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Sentinel.com", "description": "The Health Care District of Palm Beach County is sticking with one of its own to lead the taxpayer-funded agency that provides everything from clinics to insurance for people in need.", "title": "Palm Beach County Health Care District picks Davis as CEO", "url": "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-palm-health-district-ceo-20160225-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56cf8a61/turbine/fl-palm-health-district-ceo-20160225", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.17", "twitter": {"site": "@sunsentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402230662, app-argument=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/deeplinkid/86023165", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 64829476886, "app_id": 728754867160252}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Health Care District, Darcy Davis, Palm Beach County", "news_keywords": "Health Care District, Darcy Davis, Palm Beach County", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "The Health Care District of Palm Beach County has picked Darcy Davis, the district's current chief operational officer, to become CEO after a national search that had been ongoing since a leadership shakeup in July."}, "article_summary": "Davis is a certified public accountant and longtime health care industry executive who went to work for the Health Care District in 2011.\nThe Health Care District of Palm Beach County has faced some hiccups of its own, triggering an ongoing review by state auditors.\n\"Darcy had showed that she was superior to the other candidates,\" said Philip Ward III, Health Care District board chairman.\nThe Health Care District of Palm Beach County is sticking with one of its own to lead the taxpayer-funded agency that provides everything from clinics to insurance for people in need.\nThe Health Care District runs clinics, operates the Trauma Hawk rescue helicopter, school nurse programs, a hospital in Belle Glade and a nursing home in West Palm Beach."}
