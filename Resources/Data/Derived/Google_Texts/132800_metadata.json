The companies are the two main Iowa carriers selling insurance on the government\u2019s new online marketplace, which is a key part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCoOportunity Health sent letters to 9,100 Iowa customers saying it has proposed raising base rates 14.3 percent next year. Coventry told customers it plans to raise their rates by varying amounts, averaging 8.7 percent. A Coventry spokeswoman said she was unsure how many letters went out.\n\nThe two companies proposed their rate increases to Iowa\u2019s insurance commissioner, who will hold public hearings next month before deciding whether to approve the new prices. Customers also are invited to send comments to the insurance division, which has begun posting them online.\n\nPredictably, consumers are unhappy to see proposed price increases. \u201cIt feels like the ultimate bait and switch when an increase comes so early in \u2026 enrollment and implementation of the (Affordable Care Act),\u201d one CoOportunity customer wrote. Another consumer wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting and I feel like we were used and betrayed.\u201d\n\nCliff Gold, CoOportunity\u2019s chief-operating officer, expressed sympathy. \u201cWe wish we weren\u2019t increasing this much either,\u201d Gold said in an interview.\n\nGold said about half of his company\u2019s proposed price increase was due to an unexpected quirk in the way the federal and state governments are enforcing new coverage rules under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe law, passed in 2010, said that by 2014, all insurance policies would have to meet new requirements. Those rules included that no one could be excluded from coverage or charged more due to pre-existing health problems. However, the government last year let carriers extend their previous policies through 2014. Then it announced this year that it would allow another two-year extension.\n\nMost Iowans affected by the policy extensions have health insurance from the state\u2019s dominant insurer, Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield.\n\nIn general, Gold said, the old policies covered only relatively healthy people, because those with chronic health problems were excluded from the pools. The policy extensions let members of the old pools retain their relatively low premiums, while leaving the rest to buy new policies that meet the Affordable Care Act rules, Gold said. That situation is forcing up premiums for people in the new plans, he said.\n\nGold said 38 percent of CoOportunity\u2019s proposed premium increase is due to increased health care prices and use of services. He said the percentage of premiums going to cover his company\u2019s administrative expenses is dropping, because those costs are being spread over more members as the new company grows.\n\nGold said CoOportunity members who receive coverage via their employers will see much smaller premium increases than individual policyholders face, because the policy-extension wrinkle only affects the individual-policy market. The proposed premium increase also doesn\u2019t affect CoOportunity Health members who received their policies via the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, which is Iowa\u2019s version of an expanded Medicaid program. The government pays the entire premium for those people.\n\nMany of the consumers receiving CoOportunity or Coventry notices about proposed premium increases would not have to pay the entire increase. That\u2019s because they bought their insurance on healthcare.gov and obtained federal subsidies. Those subsidies should rise next year to help cover increased premium costs.\n\nWellmark is expected to announce this month how much it plans to raise premiums next year for the 150,000 Iowans who buy its individual policies. It also is expected to say soon whether it will start selling policies on healthcare.gov, which is the only place Iowans can purchase insurance that is eligible for federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHearings\n\nThe Iowa Insurance Division has set hearings for July 26 to consider the proposed premium increases from CoOportunity Health, Coventry Health Care and a third carrier, Time Insurance. The division is also posting written comments on its website, at iainsuranceca.wordpress.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1pVYMlQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "CoOportunity executive says retention of old coverage plans forces up costs", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "CoOportunity executive says retention of old coverage plans forces up costs", "title": "CoOportunity, Coventry plan to increase health premiums", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2014/06/14/cooportunity-coventry-plan-increase-health-premiums/10513837/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CoOportunity executive says retention of old coverage plans forces up costs", "title": "CoOportunity, Coventry plan to increase health premiums", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a032733674bb3242890ce22812214f6584dfa43c/c=300-0-1140-840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/business-newsx2.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Cliff Gold", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Cliff Gold", "title": "CoOportunity, Coventry plan to increase health premiums", "author": "Tony Leys,", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/business", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e26cfb82badd8e84cd9db68bc780c54591f1861e/c=405-0-1035-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/business-newsx2.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dac7d256a59f84940e502b66fdba9c9126e1eda5/c=300-0-1140-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/business-newsx2.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ea01a6a00dbd2496de65f37025887b7eaa790f77/c=160-0-1280-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/business-newsx2.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bd64435675ed77d92ee7226039c86a4975acbcd1/c=0-15-1440-825&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/business-newsx2.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-13T23:41:04-05:00", "shorthed": "Health insurers plan premium increase", "articleid": 10513837, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf590beeec04e793cbf8e7ec6bbd1a1289afc9ba/c=0-15-1440-825/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/business-newsx2.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2a7e9250d0c4461d31b889d1561416dbe34fc853/c=484-0-956-840/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/business-newsx2.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "The letters were sent to people who bought individual policies from CoOportunity Health or Coventry Health Care.\nSeveral thousand Iowans are receiving notices this week that their health insurance premiums could rise substantially next year.\nHearingsThe Iowa Insurance Division has set hearings for July 26 to consider the proposed premium increases from CoOportunity Health, Coventry Health Care and a third carrier, Time Insurance.\nThe proposed premium increase also doesn\u2019t affect CoOportunity Health members who received their policies via the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan, which is Iowa\u2019s version of an expanded Medicaid program.\nGold said 38 percent of CoOportunity\u2019s proposed premium increase is due to increased health care prices and use of services."}
