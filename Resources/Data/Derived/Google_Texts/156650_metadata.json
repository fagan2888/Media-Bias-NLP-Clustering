In fact, a number of politicians, religious leaders and scholars have expressed hope in recent years that a convincing answer on the God question might dampen the violence committed in His name.\n\nYale Divinity School theologian Miroslav Volf recently edited a book titled \u201cDo We Worship the Same God? Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue.\u201d\n\nIn the introduction, Volf explained why the title question matters:\n\n\"To ask: \u2018Do we have a common God?\u2019 is, among other things, to worry: \u2018Can we live together?\u2019 That\u2019s why whether or not a given community worships the same god as does another community has always been a crucial cultural and political question and not just a theological one.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there\u2019s CNN Belief Blog contributor and Boston University religion professor Stephen Prothero.\n\nHis book on this subject is titled \u201cGod Is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run The World.\u201d\n\nProthero writes:\n\n\u201cFor more than a generation we have followed scholars and sages down the rabbit hole into a fantasy world where all gods are one \u2026 In fact this naive theological groupthink \u2013 call it Godthink \u2013 has made the world more dangerous by blinding us to the clash of religions that threaten us worldwide.\u201d\n\nIn the world of politics, President George W. Bush asserted the unity side of the argument more than once in the years after the 9/11 attacks - often as a way to deflect accusations that America was at war with Islam.\n\nBush told Al Arabiya television, \u201cI believe there is a universal God. I believe the God that the Muslim prays to is the same God that I pray to. After all, we all came from Abraham. I believe in that universality.\u201d\n\nPope Francis invites Israeli, Palestinian leaders to Vatican peace talks\n\nPope John Paul II drew from the same rhetorical well several times.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the same God, the one God, the living God, the God who created the world and brings his creatures to their perfection,\u201d he first said in a speech to Muslims in Morocco in 1985.\n\nLooking for a more recent example? Consider the plight of Vatican envoy to Malaysia.\n\nShortly after he arrived there last year, Archbishop Joseph Marino said that is was fine by him that Christian translations of the Bible into Malay use the word \u201cAllah\u201d for \u201cGod.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllah\u201d is, of course, the Arabic word for God and is found in the Quran. The Christian translators explained that since most Malaysians are Muslim, it\u2019s the word they\u2019re most comfortable with and therefore the best choice for the translation.\n\nBut many Muslim authorities in Malaysia were furious. They say Christians are slipping in the familiar word as a way to convert Muslims. And conversion of Muslims is all but illegal in Malaysia.\n\nThere\u2019s a lawsuit ongoing about the translations. Marino had to apologize for pushing into Malaysian politics.\n\nPoints of disagreement\n\nSo what do the \u201cAbrahamic\u201d religions disagree about?\n\nAmong other things: the purpose of humanity, the relationship of God and humanity, sin, forgiveness, salvation, the afterlife, Jesus, Muhammad, the calendar, and the religious importance of Abraham himself.\n\nPlus the nature of God.\n\nAny summary will leave out enormous nuance. Internal divisions within religions have fueled some of the worst examples of human violence. Consider the long and frequently bloody history of troubles between Catholics and Protestants or the growing death toll of Muslim-on-Muslim attacks.\n\nBut there are common elements about God widely accepted in each tradition.\n\nJudaism\n\nStart with Judaism, since it came first and established roots that carried into the other two.\n\nJewish tradition teaches that there is one and only one God, creator of everything, and He established physical and moral laws. As Judaism\u2019s preeminent prayer says: \u201cThe Lord our God, the Lord is one.\u201d\n\nThis God walks and talks directly with His creations \u2013 for a while.\n\nEventually, He chooses one particular nomad (Abraham) to father a mighty nation that God sets up as an example to other nations.\n\nThis God likes the smell of burning meat and demands other extremely specific physical offerings as evidence of obedience and repentance. And He gives His chosen people a particular set of laws \u2013 but doesn\u2019t mind discussion and even argument about those laws.\n\nA famous rabbinic saying implies that every word in Judaism\u2019s sacred texts can be understood in 70 correct (but related) ways. And human reasoning can even trump divine intention. (No kidding. It\u2019s in the Talmud)\n\nThis God judges His people every year. Tradition says he\u2019s willing to accept imperfection, as long as it comes with repentance.\n\nHe\u2019s big on obedience, not so much on faith. He\u2019s not nearly as attentive to the behaviors of non-Jews. (There\u2019s a famous Jewish joke with the punch line \u201cWould you mind choosing somebody else once in a while?\u201d)\n\nTradition holds that there\u2019s a World To Come after death where moral accounts will somehow be settled. But this God is vague on details.\n\nChristianity\n\nThe most obvious differences in the Christian God are the traditional teachings about the Trinity and Jesus. God is three separate persons who are also one. How? Christianity says the Trinity is a \u201cmystery\u201d of faith.\n\nAccording to Christian tradition, God begets a son who is somehow also Him but not Him to atone for Original Sin. He sacrifices that son though a brutal death and thus achieves humanity's salvation.\n\nBut the son, who also is God, rises from the dead. And that sacrifice redeems eternally all who accept and believe in it. Faith, not behavior, is the essential measure of salvation.\n\nThis God is willing to vastly expand what it means to be among His \u201cchosen people.\u201d He\u2019s also willing to cancel many of the laws that had applied to that chosen group for this expanded membership.\n\nOrthodox Jews say that God prohibits them from eating a cheeseburger; Christians say God has no problem with them wolfing down Big Macs.\n\nUnlike the Jewish God, whose instructions are almost all about this world, the Christian God is focused more on eternal salvation: heaven and hell.\n\nFinally, for this God, much of the Jewish scriptures (which are all God\u2019s word) are actually about foreshadowing Jesus. Including Abraham.\n\nIslam\n\nThe Muslim God is a bit more like the Jewish God.\n\nThere is no Trinity in Muslim tradition. Jesus was a prophet, but no more divine than other prophets.\n\nGod has never has had anything like physical attributes and has no gender. (Some Muslim commentators say that the noun \u201cAllah\u201d is masculine, but only in the way that all nouns in some languages include gender.)\n\nMuslim tradition holds that God wants one thing from humans: Submission. The word \u201cIslam\u201d is defined as \u201csubmission to the will of God.\u201d\n\nFor Muslims, all true prophets in Jewish and Christian traditions were actually Muslim because they knew to submit correctly to God. Differences between Muslim, Jewish and Christian interpretations of God are due to errors that crept into the other two faiths, Islam teaches.\n\nThe Muslim God, like the other two, initially demanded that Abraham sacrifice a son. But the Muslim God wanted Abraham\u2019s son Ishmael, not Isaac, who Jewish tradition holds was offered as a the sacrifice.\n\nThe Muslim God also designated, from before the world began, a perfect man to be his final prophet: Muhammad. God\u2019s perfect truths are found only in the Quran and in the sayings of Muhammad, the hadiths.\n\nAnd the Muslim God, like the Christian God but unlike the Jewish God, will welcome believers to paradise and condemn many non-Muslims - exactly which ones is a matter of much discussion - to eternal torment.\n\nFinal answer\n\nSo do Christians Muslims, and Jews, really all worship the same God?\n\nIn two major volumes on the subject recently published by scholars from various faiths and traditions, including Volf\u2019s, the most inclusive response from these scholars is basically: Yes, and it\u2019s our God.\n\nThis is not a new way of answering the question.\n\nIn 1076, Pope Gregory VII wrote this to a Muslim leader: \u201cWe believe in and confess one God, admittedly, in a different way\u2026\u201d\n\nBut like many other religious leaders on all sides of the argument, Gregory insisted that his version of the Almighty is the one whom the others are unknowingly and incompletely worshiping.\n\nA less exclusivist set of religions might shrug off the differences. But all three claim to have the only \u201cTrue Faith.\u201d\n\nSo do all three faiths actually worship the same deity, whether they call him God or Allah or Adonai?\n\nGod only knows.\n\nJeffrey Weiss is an award-winning religion reporter in Dallas.The views expressed in this column belong to Weiss.
