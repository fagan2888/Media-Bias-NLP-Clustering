Perry bids for 2016 relevancy\n\nRick Perry doesn\u2019t want to be forgotten.\n\nThe Texas governor, whose 2012 presidential bid famously flamed out after a series of verbal blunders, is making moves to try to keep his name on the radar for a potential national comeback.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHis strategy: Curry favor with influential party stalwarts, demonstrate to voters in key Democratic strongholds that he has the answers for how to jump-start the economy and even show a little political leg with a pit stop in Iowa this November.\n\nAll this activity comes as Perry is weighing whether he should take another shot at the White House.\n\n( PHOTOS: Rick Perry\u2019s career)\n\nIt isn\u2019t a simple calculation. Not only would Perry have to win back the support of those who abandoned his disastrously unsuccessful 2012 run, but he would also have to contend with a new crop of party favorites, like Sens. Rand Paulof Kentucky, Marco Rubio of Florida and a fellow Texan, Sen. Ted Cruz, who are gaining a national following.\n\nRepublican strategists say a Perry presidential bid would be uphill but not insurmountable.\n\n\u201cI think expectations would be low on his debate performances, and if he was able to get himself into a position where he was studied and ready to go, that would surprise a lot of people and enhance his chances,\u201d said Matt Schlapp of Cove Strategies, who served as political director to former President George W. Bush. \u201cI think he would also benefit from the fact that there is no obvious front-runner in 2016, that he\u2019s not a creature of Washington, and obviously, he benefits from the fact that he\u2019s from one of the most important fundraising states that you need to conquer to get the nomination.\u201d\n\nVeteran Republican Party operative Fred Malek agreed.\n\n( WATCH: Perry, O'Malley face off on Obamacare)\n\n\u201cCertainly, he could recover from the debate gaffe as we\u2019ve seen Bill Clinton recover from the lengthy speech that he gave as a keynoter of the national convention to become the nominee,\u201d Malek said, referring to the former president\u2019s 1988 speech that was so long that he had to go on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d to try to stanch the bleeding.\n\nMalek cautioned, however, that inviting people to Austin and traveling around the country doesn\u2019t mean Perry will seek the presidency.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he is running for anything other than he is thinking through where his future lies,\u201d Malek said.\n\n( WATCH: Rick Perry leaving gov's office, doesn't rule out 2016)\n\nStill, Perry certainly appears to be laying the groundwork to make a potential run possible.\n\nTexas Republican state Chairman Steve Munisteri said it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone if Perry gets in the race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s been shy about that he has another interest in running for president; he\u2019s been upfront with people about that,\u201d Munisteri said.\u201dMost people have to run two or three times before they get the nomination.\u201d\n\n( See POLITICO's full elections coverage)\n\nOne of the strongest signs that Perry is looking beyond Texas for his post-governor life is the invites he has quietly been sending to influential businessmen, veteran political operatives and big-money fundraisers to Austin for a series of dinners.\n\nLongtime Perry confidant Jim Lee, a major donor and bundler for the governor, has been emailing potential attendees, according to a copy of an email obtained by POLITICO.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He is making moves to try to keep his name on the radar for a potential national comeback.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He is making moves to try to keep his name on the radar for a potential national comeback.", "title": "Perry bids for 2016 relevancy", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/rick-perrys-bid-to-stay-relevant-for-2016-97134.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/20/130929_rick_perry_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Rick Perry (1667),2016 Elections (346),Elections (1440),Texas (549)", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Annapalmerpolitico/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab80\"", "article_summary": "Perry bids for 2016 relevancyRick Perry doesn\u2019t want to be forgotten.\n( WATCH: Rick Perry leaving gov's office, doesn't rule out 2016)Still, Perry certainly appears to be laying the groundwork to make a potential run possible.\nMalek cautioned, however, that inviting people to Austin and traveling around the country doesn\u2019t mean Perry will seek the presidency.\nOne sign that Perry may run: He has quietly been sending invites to a series of dinners.\nAll this activity comes as Perry is weighing whether he should take another shot at the White House."}
