The body of a woman who hadn't been seen since Monday afternoon was found Tuesday.

Authorities say Valene Perault helped her husband with chores on their ranch around 4 p.m. Her husband believed she headed home after closing a gate, but she wasn't there when he returned.

The Jackson County Sheriff says the 82-year-old's body was found on a neighbor's property. Authorities say she walked nearly four miles from her home and was found in the White River.

The snowy weather made the search more difficult. The Sheriff says the area received four to five inches of snow in the past 24 hours and strong winds have caused a lot of drifting.
