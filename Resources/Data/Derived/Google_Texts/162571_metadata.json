When I made aliyah (a word that means \u201cascent\u201d or \u201cJewish immigration to Israel\u201d) from the U.S. in 1984, the Jewish population stood at around three million; today it has doubled to over six million and is the largest Jewish community in the world. The huge rise comes from both natural growth and immigration. Jews who are already here vote \u201cyes\u201d by having the Western world\u2019s highest fertility rates; many Jews who were living elsewhere have been coming here.\n\nAnd now it turns out that the rate of yerida (a word that means \u201cdescent\u201d or \u201cJewish emigration from Israel\u201d) is at an all-time low\u2014yes, even in this era of globalization, and with some Israelis loudly complaining about high prices here. The Jerusalem Post reports:\n\nIn 2012\u2026the number of \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u2014people who left Israel and stayed abroad for over a year\u2014went down to 15,900, the lowest since the establishment of the state\u2026.\n\nNearly a quarter of them had returned to the country or reported a planned return date as of April 2014.\n\nMost of those who left the country were not born in Israel, and 25 percent of them are not Jewish. Many had moved to Israel from the former Soviet Union since 1990.\n\nAnd the New York Times adds that\n\nSergio DellaPergola, a leading [Israeli] demographer, said emigration was actually lower now than at any time in Israel\u2019s 66-year history, and also lower than in comparably developed countries. Far more people left Israel in the 1970s and 1980s, when inflation skyrocketed\u2026.\n\nEven so, if you\u2019re considering making aliyah, it\u2019s natural to have fears about taking such a big plunge. I had some of them too; but by now they\u2019re a thing of the distant past.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "4 Reasons Jews Shouldn\u2019t Fear Moving to Israel | Lifestyle", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Lifestyle", "description": "Why it makes more sense than ever to live here.", "title": "4 Reasons Jews Shouldn\u2019t Fear Moving to Israel", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2014/10/26/4-reasons-jews-shouldnt-fear-moving-to-israel/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/36/files/2014/10/shutterstock_144640577.jpg", "updated_time": 1464305133, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why it makes more sense than ever to live here.", "title": "4 Reasons Jews Shouldn\u2019t Fear Moving to Israel", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2014/10/26/4-reasons-jews-shouldnt-fear-moving-to-israel/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/36/files/2014/10/shutterstock_144640577.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "4 Reasons Jews Shouldn\u2019t Fear Moving to Israel | Lifestyle", "pinterestDescription": "4 Reasons Jews Shouldn\u2019t Fear Moving to Israel", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "4 Reasons Jews Shouldn\u2019t Fear Moving to IsraelIsrael is becoming a more and more popular place for Jews to live.\nFar more people left Israel in the 1970s and 1980s, when inflation skyrocketed\u2026.\nThe Jerusalem Post reports:In 2012\u2026the number of \u00e9migr\u00e9s\u2014people who left Israel and stayed abroad for over a year\u2014went down to 15,900, the lowest since the establishment of the state\u2026.\nMost of those who left the country were not born in Israel, and 25 percent of them are not Jewish.\nJews who are already here vote \u201cyes\u201d by having the Western world\u2019s highest fertility rates; many Jews who were living elsewhere have been coming here."}
