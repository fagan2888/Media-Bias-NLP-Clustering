The two anti-Dick Cheney war protesters were booked, processed, and released within an hour. Their court dates are pending.\n\nThe anti-Dick Cheney demonstrators were protesting inside the fence of Cheney\u2019s property in McLean, Virginia, when police arrived. The homeowners had called police, protesting themselves that the protesters \u201cwere not allowed to be there.\u201d Whether or not Dick Cheney was at the home while people were outside protesting him is unknown.\n\n\u201cPolice asked them (the Dick Cheney protesters) to leave or face trespassing charges,\u201d said Henriquez. \u201cTwo refused to leave the premises.\u201d\n\nThe co-founder of Code Pink, Medea Benjamin, heartily denied the police version of their Dick Cheney protest.\n\n\u201cThe police asked us to move to the street, so we did. And they arbitrarily arrested two of us,\u201d said Benjamin.\n\nCode Pink\u2019s national coordinator, Ali McCracken, explained the \u201ctorturers tour\u201d, which sounds almost like a progressive dinner party except people were protesting instead of eating at the different locations they visited.\n\nFirst the protesters went to the home of CIA Director John Brennan, also in McLean, said McCracken. No one was arrested there, so off to the nearby CIA headquarters went the Code Pink protesters. After protesting there for awhile, they descended on Dick Cheney\u2019s house.\n\nWhat is the goal of the anti-Dick Cheney, John Brennan, and CIA group? According to McCracken, they are calling for the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba to be shut down. McCracken feels the arrests during her group\u2019s anti-Dick Cheney protest illustrate how upside down the world is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic and ridiculous that while the men responsible for torture are out running free and profiting from years of failed wars \u2013 Dick Cheney has profited grossly off the Iraq War \u2013 police were out arresting peaceful protesters who are calling for a new foreign policy based on diplomacy and compassion.\u201d\n\nA report released last month by the U.S. Senate was critical of the CIA, saying the government organization misled both the White House and the public about how it \u201ctortured\u201d detainees following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, reports Reuters.\n\nDick Cheney has called the report \u201cdeeply flawed,\u201d and defended the harsh interrogation techniques on terrorism suspects used by CIA following 9/11, when more than 3,000 people were murdered in New York and Washington.\n\nDick Cheney has also called the report a \u201cterrible piece of work\u201d and \u201cfull of crap.\u201d\n\n[Image via Yahoo News]", "article_metadata": {"description": "While many don't live to see their 83rd year, an 83-year-old woman and a man were arrested in a suburb outside of Washington D.C. on Saturday after protesting", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "While many don\u2019t live to see their 83rd year, an 83-year-old woman and a man were arrested in a suburb outside of Washington D.C. on Saturday after protesting", "title": "Two Protesters Arrested Outside Dick Cheney\u2019s Home After Refusing to Leave \u2018Torturers Tour\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1746409/two-protesters-arrested-outside-dick-cheneys-home-after-refusing-to-leave-torturers-tour/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Dick-Cheney.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-11T15:07:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-11T15:37:08+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Dick-Cheney.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-01-11T15:07:19+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "9/11,cia,code pink,cuba,dick cheney,guantanamo bay,protest,terrorists,torture,water-boarding,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Dick-Cheney.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "While many don\u2019t live to see their 83rd year, an 83-year-old woman and a man were arrested in a suburb outside of Washington D.C. on Saturday after protesting"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a7b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPolice asked them (the Dick Cheney protesters) to leave or face trespassing charges,\u201d said Henriquez.\nNo one was arrested there, so off to the nearby CIA headquarters went the Code Pink protesters.\n\u201cTwo refused to leave the premises.\u201dThe co-founder of Code Pink, Medea Benjamin, heartily denied the police version of their Dick Cheney protest.\nDick Cheney has also called the report a \u201cterrible piece of work\u201d and \u201cfull of crap.\u201d[Image via Yahoo News]\nThe two anti-Dick Cheney war protesters were booked, processed, and released within an hour."}
