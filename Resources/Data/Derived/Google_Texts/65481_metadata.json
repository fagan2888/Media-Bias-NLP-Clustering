So, she got a lackluster retail gig and moved into her mom\u2019s Massachusetts condo. At the time, Weis, who works as a substitute teacher and editor, says she wouldn\u2019t have dreamed of charging her daughter rent.\n\n\u201cI was a perfectly codependent mom,\u201d says Weis with a chuckle. \u201cI always stepped in and took care of her\u2014maybe because I felt guilty that her father left us when she was six years old.\u201d\n\nWeis\u2019 daughter is now 29, and seven years later the two are still living together. But, as her daughter got better-paying side jobs in between studying for her master\u2019s in social work, Weis knew it was time to broach the idea of having her make a financial contribution\u2014if not rent, then at least splitting the household bills.\n\n\u201cInitially, she wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea of paying for some of the bills,\u201d Weis says about her daughter. \u201cBut she knew it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nToday, the two split the bills for electricity, water and the rest of their utilities.\n\nRELATED: ARE BOOMERANG KIDS OVERSTAYING THEIR WELCOME\n\nTo Charge or Not to Charge?\n\nFrom sharing the utility bills here and there to paying rent every month, when your adult child moves home, should you ask him or her to contribute financially? It\u2019s a thorny question many parents are grappling with these days.\n\nConsider the numbers: 21.6 million adults between the ages of 18 and 31\u2014or 36% of people in this demo\u2014lived at home with their parents in 2012, according to the August 2013 Pew Research Center report \u201cA Rising Share of Young Adults Live in Their Parents\u2019 Home.\u201d This is the highest share in 40 years.\n\nExperts call these children \u201cboomerang kids,\u201d and when a grown child moves back home, it\u2019s important to make sure that everyone is on the same page, says David Blaylock, a CFP\u00ae with LearnVest Planning Services. \u201dThe first conversation that needs to happen is resetting boundaries. Keep in mind that they were probably in high school when they last lived at home, so they shouldn\u2019t be returning to the exact same rules as when they left,\u201d he advises.\n\nAs for paying for the privilege to move back in, Blaylock believes parents should charge a nominal fee for rent, but one that\u2019s way below market rate. \u201cI would advise that parents not charge more than 10% of the child\u2019s take-home pay,\u201d he says. \u201cThe amount should be enough as to feel like a responsibility, but not so much as to be a burden.\u201d\n\nParents Who Make Them Pay\n\nSherman Ragland, a father of three, wouldn\u2019t dream of not charging his adult daughter rent, especially since his rate, $450 per month, is a fraction of what she\u2019d pay if she lived on their own.\n\nRELATED: HOW CLINGING TO MOMMY AND DADDY IS RUINING A GENERATION\n\nHis oldest daughter worked in retail while she was in college. When she graduated in 2009, she had her own apartment and worked a full-time job at a major department store chain. But a few years ago, she decided to switch careers to government contracting, which would mean taking a pay cut. \u201cWe suggested she move in to save some money,\u201d says Ragland of his now 26-year-old daughter.\n\nHe is far from a traditional landlord. In fact, he still thinks of his primary role as being that of generous father. Case in point: What his daughter doesn\u2019t know is that he has been setting aside all of her \u201crent\u201d in an account for her to have once she\u2019s ready to move out.\n\nBlaylock isn\u2019t necessarily a fan of this setup. \u201cInstead of saving the money without the child knowing about it, you\u2019re missing out on a teaching opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe goal is to help your child manage her assets better, so talk about why you\u2019re putting the money aside. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be like Mom and Dad to the rescue again \u2026 \u2018Here\u2019s this big pile of money!\u2019\u201d\n\nRagland, a real estate investor in the Washington, D.C., area, believes older kids can also pull their weight in other ways. His daughter and 22-year-old son (who also lives at home while he finishes up his college degree) do chores alongside his 12-year-old son. \u201cThey do dishes and contribute to the running of the house, but they don\u2019t pay a cent for food,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a definite perk to living at home again.\u201d\n\nHow Moving (Back) in Can Help Kids Out\n\nMary Dell Harrington, a writer in Westchester, N.Y., who covers these topics on her website, Grown and Flown, welcomed her 23-year-old son to live at home\u2014rent-free\u2014when he graduated from college in May and was interviewing for jobs. During the day, when he didn\u2019t have an interview, he did work around the house, whether taking care of the family dogs, being home to greet the occasional appliance repairman or getting dinner on the table.\n\nRELATED: WHEN RETIREMENT MEANS CHANGING DIAPERS\n\n\u201cThe only problem with his dinner prep is that he loves spicy food and used Tabasco sauce a little too liberally for some in the family,\u201d she jokes.\n\nHarrington sees no downside to letting her son live with her without chipping in financially, especially since he recently got a job and will soon move out of the house.\n\nThanks to their setup, her son has been able to save up for life on his own. \u201cIf he had to immediately begin paying for all of his living expenses in New York City where he works, it would be way more difficult for him to get on his feet financially,\u201d she explains. \u201cWith a financial cushion of money he saved living at home, he\u2019ll have a running start.\u201d\n\nShe admits, however, that if the rent-free living arrangement had been more permanent, her son would have an unrealistic sense of money management. \u201cIf he was living at home long-term, he\u2019d have no idea how expensive it is to maintain an apartment, pay utilities and buy groceries,\u201d she says.\n\nA Second Chance to Bond?\n\nBill Parker, an accountant in Scottsdale, Ariz., invited his 23-year-old daughter to move in with him two and a half years ago, when she had to drop out of college after becoming sick and being unable to keep up with her workload. Parker says that their time together has brought him endless joy\u2014not to mention 25 percent of the rent. (He didn\u2019t do a 50-50 split because he makes more money than his daughter.)\n\nRELATED: 7 REASONS RENTALS ARE ROCKING THE HOUSING MARKET\n\n\u201cI got divorced from her mom almost seven years ago, so I see this as a great opportunity to bond with her under less stressful circumstances,\u201d he says.\n\nParker says asking his daughter, who works as a marketing assistant, to contribute to the rent wasn\u2019t tough at all. \u201cI explained that the rent she\u2019ll pay me is less than what she would pay if she lived with friends,\u201d he says.\n\nIn addition, his daughter also helps pay for half of the groceries and half of the utility bills. \u201cI want her to feel the pain of turning air conditioning up, leaving lights on, etc.,\u201d he says.\n\nAt the end of the day, he couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cThis has probably been the best two and a half years of our relationship,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have grown closer than we ever were.\u201d\n\nWhat remains tough: The fact that he worries a lot\u2014maybe more than if they weren\u2019t living together. \u201cI worry when she\u2019s out at night,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. Having her live with me will be a memory I keep for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s something else to keep in mind when a child moves back home: It doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing. \u201cIt\u2019s a second chance,\u201d says Blaylock. Not only can cohabitation bring parents and children closer, but it can also give parents another opportunity to teach their children some of the money lessons that they might\u2019ve skimmed over or skipped entirely when they were younger. \u201cParents can even accept some of the responsibility for what\u2019s going on and say, \u2018Maybe I didn\u2019t do such a good job of teaching you this stuff when you were 16, but let\u2019s start now,\u2019 he suggests. \u201cThat way the kid doesn\u2019t feel like a failure.\u201d\n\nAs for Weis, there is now an end in sight to her cohabitation with her daughter. \u201cShe can\u2019t wait to move out,\u201d she says. \u201cWe may be best friends, but we both agree that it\u2019s time we had our separate lives. Luckily, for now, she has the upstairs and I have the downstairs\u2014that\u2019s how we\u2019ve made this work.\u201d\n\nMore from LearnVest:\n\nWhere Do You Draw the Line With Adult Children?\n\nOne Mom\u2019s True Story: How I Stopped Spoiling My Kids\n\nShould You Put Your Kids\u2019 Financial Health Before Your Own?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "From sharing the utility bills here and there to paying rent every month, when your adult child move homes, should you ask him or her to contribute financially?
