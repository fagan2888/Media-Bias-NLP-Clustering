Employees will not need to have the Form 1095-C in hand in order to file their 2015 tax returns, if they choose to file in advance of receiving their form from their employer (for those employers that choose to wait to file until March 31).\n\nFor companies still facing challenges in meeting the 1095-C filing deadline, Praisner notes that making a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort at compliance with the ACA reporting requirements, such as by indicating a relationship with a third-party compliance vendor, could be taken into consideration.\n\n\u201cWe stand ready to assist other employers who have not yet begun the compliance process or believe they will be severely challenged in gathering the necessary employment data,\u201d Praisner said. \u201cBottom line, the good news for employers is that there is still time \u2013 both to meet the IRS deadlines and to secure the most effective compliance solution.\u201d\n\nTo find out more about the ACA Compliance Suite from Tango, please visit: http://www.tangohealth.com/services/aca-compliance.\n\nAbout Tango Health\n\nTango Health Benefits Optimization saves organizations money, makes employees happy, and ensures regulatory compliance with the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
