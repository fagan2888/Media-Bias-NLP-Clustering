I think it will,\u201d says Montana Health Cooperative CEO Jerry Dworak. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m confident it will.\u201d\n\nMontana\u2019s co-op, which opened for business in late 2013, is one of 23 state-based co-ops created and financed by the law known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d A dozen failed this year.\n\nThe co-ops are intended to be competitive, nonprofit alternatives in state health-insurance markets, selling subsidized individual policies on the online \u201cmarketplace\u201d -- also created by the new law.\n\nThe Montana co-op insured 22,000 Montanans this year and has also expanded into Idaho, where it insures another 20,000 people. In Montana, only Blue Cross and Blue Shield has sold more individual policies since 2013.\n\nYet the Montana co-op has still lost money: About $3 million in 2014 and a projected $40 million this year.\n\nThree-fourths of this year\u2019s losses are because the federal government welched on promised payments to offset co-op losses \u2013 after Congress undercut the funding.\n\n\u201cThe co-ops that did the best are the ones who did not rely heavily on (this) payment,\u201d said John Morrison, a Helena attorney and member of the board overseeing the co-op. \u201cBut the ones who relied on it, it did them in.\n\n\u201cIn Montana, we\u2019ve been very conservative. We\u2019ve kept our overhead very low and we\u2019ve made no assumptions about the federal government reliability when it comes to giving us additional funds.\u201d\n\nThe Co-op, Blue Cross and PacificSource are the three health insurers selling policies on Montana\u2019s online marketplace. All three have lost money \u2013 and all three raised their rates substantially for 2016 policies.\n\nDworak said with the price increases, the co-op has projected it will break even or be slightly profitable next year.\n\nThe co-op got started with $8 million from the federal government and another $78 million operating loan. Both are long-term loans the co-op doesn\u2019t have to start paying back for several years yet.\n\nDworak said he expects Montana\u2019s expanded Medicaid program will pick up about 4,000 of the co-op\u2019s customers next year, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. Many of those customers tend to be less healthy and more expensive to cover, he said.\n\nBoth Morrison and Dworak argued that co-ops have introduced more competition into the marketplace and ultimately saved consumers money. Dworak said without the co-op, Montana would have only two competitors selling on the online marketplace.\n\n\u201cTake a look at the premiums here versus Wyoming, where there is only one (competitor),\u201d Dworak said. \u201cI do think we\u2019ve served the citizens of Montana very well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "So far this year, a dozen health insurance cooperatives created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act have failed \u2013 but the co-op in Montana says it\u2019s relatively healthy, and not in danger of closing.", "author": "Mike Dennison - MTN News", "og": {"url": "http://www.krtv.com/story/30699876/montana-health-co-op-is-one-of-the-survivors-despite-losses", "image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/9419108_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "So far this year, a dozen health insurance cooperatives created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act have failed \u2013 but the co-op in Montana says it\u2019s relatively healthy, and not in danger of closing.", "title": "Montana Health Co-op is one of the survivors, despite losses"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/9419108_G.jpg", "description": "So far this year, a dozen health insurance cooperatives created by the 2010 Affordable Care Act have failed \u2013 but the co-op in Montana says it\u2019s relatively healthy, and not in danger of closing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Montana Health Co-op is one of the survivors, despite losses"}, "wnreadableurl": "montana-health-co-op-is-one-of-the-survivors-despite-losses", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KXLH", "fb": {"app_id": 161591973908016}, "date": "2015/12/08", "KEYWORDS": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS23", "news_keywords": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS"}, "article_summary": "The Montana co-op insured 22,000 Montanans this year and has also expanded into Idaho, where it insures another 20,000 people.\nYet the Montana co-op has still lost money: About $3 million in 2014 and a projected $40 million this year.\nDworak said without the co-op, Montana would have only two competitors selling on the online marketplace.\n\u201cIn Montana, we\u2019ve been very conservative.\nThree-fourths of this year\u2019s losses are because the federal government welched on promised payments to offset co-op losses \u2013 after Congress undercut the funding."}
