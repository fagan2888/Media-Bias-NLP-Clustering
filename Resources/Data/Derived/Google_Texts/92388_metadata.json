He dropped out of Coral Gables Senior High in the 10th grade, eager to chase a career as a heavy metal musician.\n\nThough he never achieved rock \u2019n\u2019 roll fame, Perez struck gold as an educational entrepreneur. He founded Dade Medical College in 1999, and in the lucrative world of for-profit colleges, Perez\u2019s own lack of education wasn\u2019t an obstacle. The college grew quickly to include multiple campuses, and the now-wealthy Perez became politically active and influential.\n\nBut Perez, 45, resigned as president/CEO last Tuesday, hoping to distance the school from a slew of recent problems. He faces criminal charges, lingering ethical questions about his political activities, and a backlash from angry students who describe his school as a rip-off. He remains the company\u2019s majority owner.\n\nAmong the issues dogging Perez and his college:\n\n\u2022 Early this year, two of Dade Medical\u2019s nursing programs \u2014 Miami and Hollywood \u2014were placed on state probation because graduating students have such a poor record of passing their required licensing exam.\n\n\u2022 In August, Homestead Mayor Steve Bateman was arrested on corruption charges. The charges did not involve Perez, but the arrest highlighted Perez\u2019s unusually close ties to Bateman. Perez hired the mayor\u2019s wife as his real estate broker, and he did so at the same time that he was trying to push through a controversial land deal with the city. The transaction, which is still pending, would sell a cluster of downtown Homestead properties to Dade Medical at a huge discount \u2014 Perez would pay less than 40 cents on the dollar. The Miami-Dade state attorney\u2019s office is scrutinizing Perez\u2019s ties to the now-former mayor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "@MrMikeVasquez On the surface at least, Ernesto Perez seemed to be a most remarkable South Florida success story.
