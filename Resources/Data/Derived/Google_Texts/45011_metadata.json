Raul Labrador (R-ID) said during a Capitol Hill panel discussion.\n\nHe and several other members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus sent a letter to Boehner on Tuesday stating they would not support any funding resolution that contained money for Planned Parenthood.\n\nRelated: Billions in Unfinished Business as Congress Heads Out for Vacation\n\nThe size of the group ensures that GOP leaders would have to attract some measure of support from Democrats to keep the government running after September 30.\n\nLabrador said that if leaders are \u201cunwilling to stand up on\u201d topics like the Iran nuclear deal and the funding for Planned Parenthood, \u201cwe do need new leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a distinct difference between new leadership and better leadership and I think that\u2019s what has to be determined,\u201d Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) said.\n\nRep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS), who voted against Boehner in the last two speakership elections, said the problem with GOP leadership is that it \u201calways assumes we\u2019re going to lose.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Boehner is downplaying the possibility of revolt among the rank and file.\n\n\u201cWe've got widespread support in the conference, and -- and I appreciate that,\u201d the Ohio lawmaker told reporters after a House GOP conference meeting.\n\nRelated: Buffett Is Backing Hillary Clinton, but Praises Trump and Sanders, Too\n\nBoehner and other Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of looking like they are ignoring the conservatives. To that end, they will hold a series of \u201clistening\u201d sessions this week with members in the hopes of coming up with a solution to the looming spending impasse.\n\nThe power of the rank and file was on full display Wednesday afternoon, when leaders decided to delay a procedural vote to begin debate on the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nMembers want the Obama administration to share the so-called \u201cside deals\u201d between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency to Congress before they cast their vote.\n\nMany opponents of the agreement contend the clock on congressional consideration of the deal hasn\u2019t started until the side bargains are turned over.\n\nInstead of moving forward on a resolution of disapproval for the deal, the GOP conference will gather for a second time Wednesday afternoon to discuss strategy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Not only will the next few weeks determine whether or not the federal government closes its doors for the second time in two years, they might also determine the fate of House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).", "title": "A Conservative Rebellion Is Brewing on Capitol Hill", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/09/Conservative-Rebellion-Brewing-Capitol-Hill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12122014_John_Boehner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/09/Conservative-Rebellion-Brewing-Capitol-Hill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12122014_John_Boehner.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Not only will the next few weeks determine whether or not the federal government closes its doors for the second time in two years, they might also determine the fate of House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH).", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce1c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ll wait to see what happens this month,\u201d Rep.
