It was the steepest one-month decline for the index since November 2008.\n\nThe purchasing managers\u2019 index from the Institute of Supply Management fell to 55.9% from 59.1%. Economists polled by MarketWatch had expected a reading of 57.5%.\n\nAny reading over 50% signals expansion, and ISM\u2019s index has stuck near high levels in recent months. But many of the sub-components also sank in November. The gauge of business activity fell 4.8 points to 58.2%, and new orders, a proxy for future activity, fell 4.5 points to 57.5%.\n\nEven employment, which has been steady, declined. It fell 4.2 points to 55.0%. The employment measure in ISM\u2019s November manufacturing index, released Tuesday, was the only bright spot in that index, which tumbled to a 6-year low.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve\u2019s December policy meeting looming ahead, analysts are scrutinizing economic data, particularly about jobs, even more carefully than usual.\n\nWith job gains averaging over 200,000, and following strong signals from most Fed officials, economists expect policymakers to enact the first interest rate rise in nearly a decade in December.\n\nThe Labor Department will release employment figures for November on Friday, the last such report before that meeting.\n\nThe Fed has been close to raising rates for some time, but one economic headwind after another stayed its hand. The plunge in the price of oil capped inflation and has buffeted the manufacturing sector as energy firms slash their capital budgets.\n\nBut growth in the more insulated services sector, which includes everything from retail to health care, has stayed sturdy throughout the year.\n\nISM\u2019s survey respondents mostly pointed to growth in November, but also noted some concerns. \u201cCustomers\u2019 outlook on their revenues is softening,\u201d one said. A health care representative said the Affordable Care Act was pressuring revenues.\n\nYet another noted that retail expectations for the fourth quarter were \u201chigh,\u201d while a respondent from the Finance and Insurance industry said, \u201cConditions are holding steady for a profitable year and fourth quarter.\u201d\n\nIan Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients that he expected ISM\u2019s report to rebound. \u201cThe ISM non-manufacturing headline often moves in line with the short-term growth rate of real core retail sales. We expect sales to rebound in Q4, so the ISM index should not fall further,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Service sector growth pulled back in November, according to data from the ISM.", "creator": "@ARiquier", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DP934_starbu_ZG_20150713104212.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Andrea Riquier", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Service sector growth pulled back in November, according to data from the ISM.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-service-sector-growth-moderates-ism-says-2015-12-03", "author": "Andrea Riquier", "parsely-title": "U.S. service sector growth moderates, ISM says", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-03T11:16:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Service sector growth pulled back in November, according to data from the ISM.", "title": "U.S. service sector growth moderates, ISM says", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-service-sector-growth-moderates-ism-says-2015-12-03", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DP934_starbu_ZG_20150713104212.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DP934_starbu_ZG_20150713104212.jpg"}, "article.id": "45421FEE-99D0-11E5-BA90-DF38D5FFE78B", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Any reading over 50% signals expansion, and ISM\u2019s index has stuck near high levels in recent months.\n\u201cThe ISM non-manufacturing headline often moves in line with the short-term growth rate of real core retail sales.\nBut growth in the more insulated services sector, which includes everything from retail to health care, has stayed sturdy throughout the year.\nA closely-watched gauge of service sector activity eased more sharply than expected in November, a small red flag amongst a recent spate of stronger economic data.\nThe gauge of business activity fell 4.8 points to 58.2%, and new orders, a proxy for future activity, fell 4.5 points to 57.5%."}
