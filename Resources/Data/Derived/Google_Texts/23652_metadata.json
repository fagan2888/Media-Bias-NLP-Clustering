Jesus was friendly. Vitter is friendly and even admits to a \u201cvery serious\u201d but vague episode of \u201csin.\u201d But to be honest, the whole prostitution thing is only the beginnings of his troubles: He is way behind in the polls, and now events the other day show he is nowhere at their end.\n\nThe New York Times reported yesterday that Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne, \u201cone of Mr. Vitter\u2019s Republican rivals in the primary,\u201d has endorsed Democrat John Bel Edwards, saying,\n\n\u201cWhen are we as Louisianans going to stop tolerating the embarrassment that too many of our elected officials have heaped upon this state. Honor, integrity, truthfulness, openness and ethical behavior are the most important traits in public services. John Bel is the candidate who exemplifies these traits.\u201d\n\nDardenne obviously doesn\u2019t want to see another Bobby Jindal at the helm of state is Louisiana. With Edwards already leading at the polls, the sudden endorsement from one of the state\u2019s leading Republicans, isn\u2019t designed to help Vitter but to tip him into the dustbin of history, where he belongs.\n\nRNC Chair Reince Preibus, who isn\u2019t doing so well himself lately trying to put diapers on a dozen or so presidential hopefuls, called Dardenne\u2019s endorsement \u201cextremely disappointing and act of betrayal to the Republican party,\u201d saying \u201cYou cannot claim to be a conservative for Louisiana principles and\u2026endorse an Obama liberal like Mr. Edwards.\u201d\n\nLAGOP (say that five times in a row really fast), the Republican Party of Louisiana\u2019s website, tells us that\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and Republican Party of Louisiana Chairman Roger Villere sent the below letter to Lieutenant Governor Jay Dardenne regarding his endorsement of liberal democrat John Bel Edwards for Governor. Following the release of the letter, Chairman Villere issued the following statement: \u201cToday, Jay Dardenne became the Nick Saban of Louisiana Politics,\u201d Republican Party of Louisiana Chairman Roger Villere said. \u201cAfter decades of using the Republican Party and its members for his benefit, Jay has decided to end his political career by supporting a candidate who opposes every public policy position that he once espoused. We have a clear choice between John Bel Edwards, a liberal legislator who has a 29 percent lifetime record with Louisiana business or a proven conservative in David Vitter. It is sad that Jay allowed his personal feelings to cause him to betray his party and state. The Republican Party stands firmly behind Senator Vitter, \u201d Villere concluded.\n\nLouisiana principles\u2026of corruption? Of hypocrisy in preaching family values while visiting prostitutes? Prostitute frequenting, diaper wearing, family values touting Republican David Vitter represents Louisiana principles? If so, Louisiana is in a heap of trouble.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget either that Vitter has said, \u201cGod bless the Koch brothers\u201d at a townhall event, and is the author of the Vitter Amendment of 2013, which would have screwed employees of congress by creating a government exemption to the Affordable Care Act. And it isn\u2019t like he visited prostitutes only in Washington in 2007. He was keeping them employed in Louisiana years before that.\n\nYes, Louisiana principles. I think that was Dardenne\u2019s point: that Louisianas have seen enough of such \u201cprinciples\u201d and that John Bel Edwards is the remedy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reince Priebus says David Vitter is the exemplar of Louisiana principles; Lt.
