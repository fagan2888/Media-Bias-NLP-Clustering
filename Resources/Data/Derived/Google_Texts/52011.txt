Yes, the “Hitler Becomes Engraged By Something Something” video meme is an oldie. But it’s a goodie.

It’s especially fun in this version (below), in which Hitler goes ballistic because the ship sent to the Antarctic to prove man-caused global warming got … well … stuck in the ice. (NOTE: There is fake captioned profanity in the video, and the “Chris” referenced in the video is Chris Turney, an Australian climate alarmist scientist.)

BTW: With the help of Heartland Senior Fellow James M. Taylor, I reworked up our own version of this meme in February 2010, titled “Hitler Learns of Global Warming Collapse.” Let’s just say James and I were a bit ahead of the curve, and our captions very much apply today.

I’ve embedded Heartland’s vid below the newest one from our Australian friends. Enjoy both.
