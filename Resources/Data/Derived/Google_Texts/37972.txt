I first saw the rumor in a tweet from Kenny Keil, a writer at Mad Magazine:

Of all the things to be creeped out about with Ted Cruz, I'm finding the 2 watches thing to be the most unsettling pic.twitter.com/boZ4ut6Mmt — Kenny Keil (@kennykeil) February 1, 2016

Scroll through the pictures, examine them, and when you’re done quivering, ask yourself: Does Ted Cruz, the victor of the Republican Iowa caucuses, really wear two watches?

I had to find out.

Before we consider that question, though, permit a short interlude. In the grand scheme of things, it does not matter. Cruz’s plans to abolish the Internal Revenue Service or repeal the Affordable Care Act are far more consequential than his choice of radiocarpal accessory. But elections encompass far more than policy, however radical or horrifying; they are also cultural and aesthetic spectacles. Not for nothing was George W. Bush’s main inauguration-night gala dubbed the Black Tie and Boots Ball.
