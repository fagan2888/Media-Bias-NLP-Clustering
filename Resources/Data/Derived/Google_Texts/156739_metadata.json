Over what, you ask? Well, the good reverend is furious about the omnibus spending bill passed last week in in Congress, which \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 continues to fund Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn a rambling Facebook post, Graham unloaded on the GOP:\n\n\u201cShame on the Republicans and the Democrats for passing such a wasteful spending bill last week. And to top it off, funding Planned Parenthood! A Huffington Post article called it \u2018a big win for Planned Parenthood.\u2019 I call it a big loss for America. After all of the appalling facts revealed this year about Planned Parenthood, our representatives in Washington had a chance to put a stop to this, but they didn\u2019t. There\u2019s no question\u2014taxpayers should not be paying for abortions! Abortion is murder in God\u2019s eyes. Seeing and hearing Planned Parenthood talk nonchalantly about selling baby parts from aborted fetuses with utter disregard for human life is reminiscent of Joseph Mengele and the Nazi concentration camps! That should\u2019ve been all that was needed to turn off the faucet for their funding. Nothing was done to trim this 2,000 page, $1.1 trillion budget. This is an example of why I have resigned from the Republican Party and declared myself Independent. I have no hope in the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, or Tea Party to do what is best for America. Unless more godly men and women get in this process and change this wicked system, our country is in for trouble. I want to challenge Christians, even pastors, across the country to pray about running for office where they can have an impact. We need mayors, country commissioners, city council members, school board members who will uphold biblical values.\u201d\n\nA couple of things: First, \u201cthe appalling facts revealed this year about Planned Parenthood\u201d weren\u2019t facts. Graham is referring to the leaked Planned Parenthood videos suggesting that the organization was pawning baby parts on the black market. As everyone now knows, those videos were deliberately edited and part of a massive anti-abortion propaganda campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Falling for their \"baby parts for sale\" lie, Franklin Graham quits GOP for not nixing Planned Parenthood's funding", "title": "Oh, the irony: GOP loses support of top evangelist because he bought their lies", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Falling for their \"baby parts for sale\" lie, Franklin Graham quits GOP for not nixing Planned Parenthood's funding", "title": "Oh, the irony: GOP loses support of top evangelist because he bought their lies", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/24/oh_the_irony_gop_loses_support_of_top_evangelist_because_he_bought_their_lies/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/franklin-graham-billy-graham-ministries.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Falling for their \"baby parts for sale\" lie, Franklin Graham quits GOP for not nixing Planned Parenthood's funding", "title": "Oh, the irony: GOP loses support of top evangelist because he bought their lies", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/franklin-graham-billy-graham-ministries.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Christianity, Franklin Graham, Planned Parenthood, Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "I have no hope in the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, or Tea Party to do what is best for America.\nA Huffington Post article called it \u2018a big win for Planned Parenthood.\u2019 I call it a big loss for America.\nGraham is referring to the leaked Planned Parenthood videos suggesting that the organization was pawning baby parts on the black market.\nTopics: 2016 Elections, Christianity, Franklin Graham, Planned Parenthood, Republican Party, Elections News, News, Politics NewsThe second-generation religious entrepreneur Franklin Graham announced this week that he\u2019s quitting the Republican Party.\nThis is an example of why I have resigned from the Republican Party and declared myself Independent."}
