Gen. Vincent Stewart, head of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, said in a recent report to the House Committee on Military Affairs that \u201cwe fully anticipate major unrest and we\u2019re worried about the elections and what that would mean in terms of increased violence and civil rights violations.\u201d\n\nStewart\u2019s concerns were echoed by 1987 Nobel Peace Prize winner Oscar Arias, a former president of Costa Rica, who in a recent letter said, \u201cno other country in recent years has had more resources, but yielded more disastrous results. There is no international conspiracy to explain lines to buy flour or soap that last two days.\u201d\n\nVenezuela\u2019s plight has been under the global spotlight since Feb. 12, when students rallied in Caracas, the capital, only to be beaten down by security forces. Opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was arrested on Feb. 18 and charged with treason.\n\nThe decline of the country\u2019s economy and repression of the political opposition are wearing down supporters of the socialist movement in Venezuela, who have noted that poverty overall has declined there since 2000 as access to basic necessities has increased. They say the current uprising is led largely by wealthy individuals who once held much of the power in the oil-rich country.\n\nIn the weeks after the first uprising, Machado was ousted from her seat in the National Assembly but she has remained at the forefront of the opposition, touring the country alongside Lopez\u2019s wife, Lilian Tintori, to rally supporters.\n\n\u201cFeb. 12 was a key day, a historic day. It was a day that showed the world a firm, a clear picture of the people\u2019s will to rebel against the oppression and it was also a day when it became clear to the world just how cruel and violent Maduro\u2019s regime really is,\u201d Machado said.\n\nMachado\u2019s rise in Venezuela\u2019s political picture began in 2004 when the civil organization she led with Alejandro Praz began a campaign to recall then-president Hugo Chavez. She was deemed a traitor by the Chavez regime and charged with conspiracy and treason. The trial was suspended in 2006.\n\nIn 2010, she launched her campaign for the National Assembly and was the top vote getter on the ballot. She was removed from office March 21 after traveling to a meeting of the Organization of American States to denounce human rights violations by the Maduro government.\n\nNational Assembly president Diosdado Cabello labeled her actions treason and used a party-line vote to oust her. Machado\u2019s passport was revoked in June.\n\nHer continued opposition has drawn threats against her and her family.\n\n\u201cIn just the last couple of hours I\u2019ve been receiving threatening messages,\u201d she told CENTRO Tampa. \u201cThey write me to tell than I\u2019m going to attacked or that my children are going to be killed. The intimidation is constant because somehow they thing we\u2019re going to back down. But on the contrary, every day we have more hope, more optimism and more strength.\u201d\n\nMachado said the opposition will note yield because \u201cour commitment is to free this country. We know that if things continue the way they are, we will have a humanitarian crisis that will generate grave social conflicts and unrest. We\u2019re seeing that now.\u201d\n\nMachado said thatthe message is getting through.\n\nShe said that on Jan. 14, during a procession in the city of Barquisimeto, she was being accompanied by soldiers when one turned to her almost in tears.\n\nShe quoted him as saying, \u201cI beg you, don\u2019t give up, don\u2019t give up.\u2019\n\n\u201cSeeing that, seeing a soldier get to that point, that touched me.\u201d\n\nmwarren@centrotampa.com\n\n(813) 259-8037", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 08 Feb 2015 15:16:03 -0400", "Description": "Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado isn\u2019t backing down from a fight even as the struggle in Venezuela escalates into what she sees as a fight for the country\u2019s life.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado isn\u2019t backing down from a fight even as the struggle in Venezuela escalates into what she sees as a fight for the country\u2019s life.", "title": "Venezuela in a fight for it\u2019s life, opposition leader says", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/venezuela-in-a-fight-for-its-life-opposition-leader-says-20150208/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150208/ARTICLE/150209329/EP/1/2/EP-150209329.jpg", "height": 2667}, "updated_time": "2015-02-08T15:19:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado isn\u2019t backing down from a fight even as the struggle in Venezuela escalates into what she sees as a fight for the country\u2019s life.", "title": "Venezuela in a fight for it\u2019s life, opposition leader says", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150208/ARTICLE/150209329/AR/0/AR-150209329.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-08T15:16:03Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-08T15:19:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Opposition leader Maria Corina Machado isn\u2019t backing down from a fight even as the struggle in Venezuela escalates into what she sees as a fight for the country\u2019s life.\nOpposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was arrested on Feb. 18 and charged with treason.\nNational Assembly president Diosdado Cabello labeled her actions treason and used a party-line vote to oust her.\nIn 2010, she launched her campaign for the National Assembly and was the top vote getter on the ballot.\n\u201cThey write me to tell than I\u2019m going to attacked or that my children are going to be killed."}
