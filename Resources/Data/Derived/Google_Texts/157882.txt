If you thought society was bottoming out the last time you heard Donald Trump was rising in the polls, you thought wrong. There is no floor to this well.

According to a new poll conducted by Public Policy Polling, 30% of Republicans are in favor of bombing the city of Agrabah. If you aren’t familiar with this region of the world, do not fret.
