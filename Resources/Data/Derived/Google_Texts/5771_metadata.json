Pixabay Public Domain\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease is one of the few conditions we still can\u2019t figure out how to prevent, stop, or reverse. We have some techniques for managing the disorder, but its cause still baffles scientists. However, some scientists argue that new evidence has emerged that could change the way we treat Alzheimer\u2019s and other neurological conditions \u2014 and that it\u2019s not getting the attention it deserves.\n\nIn a groundbreaking editorial, an international group of senior scientists and clinicians has argued there are two specific types of bacteria and one virus that cause Alzheimer\u2019s. The team said that published research on the disease suggests a link between the condition and herpes type 1 virus, chlamydia, and spirochetes.\n\n\"We are saying there is incontrovertible evidence that Alzheimer\u2019s disease has a dormant microbial component, and that this can be woken up by iron dysregulation. Removing this iron will slow down or prevent cognitive degeneration \u2014 we can\u2019t keep ignoring all of the evidence,\" said one of the editorial\u2019s authors, Professor Douglas Kell of the University of Manchester\u2019s School of Chemistry and the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, in a statement.\n\nThe editorial is a major call to action, summarizing data that implicates the microbes \u2014 data that has long been ignored or deemed controversial. Proposals for the funding of clinical trials have been refused, despite the lack of evidence to counter the microbial component theory and some 400 unsuccessful clinical trials based on other concepts.\n\nResearchers who suggested that viruses cause certain types of cancer faced similar opposition a few years ago by. Their idea ultimately proved true and lead to successful clinical trials and the development of treatment options.\n\nThe researchers say microbes can remain latent in the body and can be found in the blood.\n\n\"The microbial presence in blood may \u2026 play a fundamental role as a causative agent of systemic inflammation, which is a characteristic of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\" said Professor Resia Pretorius of the University of Pretoria, who also worked on the editorial.\n\nThe paper highlights the fact that viruses and bacteria are common in the brains of elderly people, and that the herpes virus in particular is damaging to the central nervous system and the limbic system in the brain. This system is associated with memory, cognitive processes, and personality, all of which are affected by Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThough the editorial researchers write that there is a great need for further research, some unassociated scientists aren\u2019t convinced the microbial theory holds any water.\n\n\"This is a minority view in Alzheimer research,\" Professor John Hardy, a geneticist and molecular biologist from University College London, told The Telegraph. \"There has been no convincing proof of infections causing Alzheimer disease. We need always to keep an open mind but this editorial does not reflect what most researchers think about Alzheimer disease.\"\n\nSource: Itzhaki R, Lathe R, Balin B, Ball M, Bearer E, Braak H, et al.
