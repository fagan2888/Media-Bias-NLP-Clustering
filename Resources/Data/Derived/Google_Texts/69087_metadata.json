Liemba.\n\n\u201cWe are thanking God for leaving Burundi. Now we are in Tanzania we are safe,\u201d the women sing in Kirundi, Burundi\u2019s official language, after they boarded the ferry.\n\nThey are among a group of about 600 Burundi refugees evacuated by the U.N. refugee agency Saturday from a makeshift refugee camp at the fishing village of Kagunga, Tanzania.\n\nThe small town has hosted thousands of refugees crossing over from Burundi and now has been hit by a cholera outbreak. The refugees are being taken to Kigoma where they will be bused further inland to Nyarugusu, a camp with better facilities, said Celine Schmitt, a spokeswoman for the U.N refugee agency.\n\nTens of thousands of Burundians are escaping political turmoil triggered by President Pierre Nkurinziza\u2019s bid for a third term in office in the June 26 elections.\n\nBurundi recently experienced a civil war from 1993 to 2003 which killed at least 250,000 people.\n\nBujumbura, Burundi\u2019s capital, has had four weeks of street protests in which 20 have died and 431 injured. The protests started after it was announced that Nkurunziza will run for another term, which many say is against the constitution.\n\nThe protests boiled over last week when a section of the army attempted a coup, which was crushed in 48 hours.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joyful Burundi refugees leave disease-stricken camp", "title": "Joyful Burundi refugees leave disease-stricken camp", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Joyful Burundi refugees leave disease-stricken camp", "title": "Joyful Burundi refugees leave disease-stricken camp", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/joyful_burundi_refugees_leave_disease_stricken_camp/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/tanzania-burundi-refugee-crisis.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joyful Burundi refugees leave disease-stricken camp", "title": "Joyful Burundi refugees leave disease-stricken camp", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/tanzania-burundi-refugee-crisis.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Odula", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They are among a group of about 600 Burundi refugees evacuated by the U.N. refugee agency Saturday from a makeshift refugee camp at the fishing village of Kagunga, Tanzania.\nThe small town has hosted thousands of refugees crossing over from Burundi and now has been hit by a cholera outbreak.\nNow we are in Tanzania we are safe,\u201d the women sing in Kirundi, Burundi\u2019s official language, after they boarded the ferry.\nThe protests started after it was announced that Nkurunziza will run for another term, which many say is against the constitution.\nBurundi recently experienced a civil war from 1993 to 2003 which killed at least 250,000 people."}
