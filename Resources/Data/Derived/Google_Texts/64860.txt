Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” talk show host Herman Cain, a candidate for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination, dismissed the so-called “Stop Trump” movement and argued that if the effort to stop Trump continues, it could break up the GOP and lead to a Hillary Clinton presidency.

“The anti-Trump movement – they are still insanely delusional that they can stop Trump,” Cain said. “The voice of the people is being heard. You can’t come back now and say, ‘OK, I don’t like Trump so I’m not going to get behind the nominee. I think that is foolish and if they break up the Republican Party by continuing to push back, they will be responsible for a Hillary presidency, not the people screaming that they want a leader, a winner and a fighter.”
