For a silver plan, a 40-year old Moda customer in Portland will pay $245 a month, up from $221 last year. But they will be able to find four insurers with better premiums, running as low as $222 from Lifewise.\n\nLast year, federal changes to expand coverage of pre-existing conditions caused many rates to go up in the individual market even as insurers cut back on benefits.\n\nIn Oregon, one of the most competitive insurance markets in the nation, 2014 rate hikes did not hit consumers as badly as expected. In part that's because Moda came in with low rates - so low that some accused the insurer of underpricing to more than double its market share. Moda officials denied it.\n\nFor 2015, other insurers have made aggressive moves to cut rates, which were largely approved by state regulators. Providence Health Plan rates, for example, will drop 14 percent in the individual market.\n\nInsurance Commissioner Laura Cali credited new rules that require plans to adopt standard plan designs and propose rates at the same time, with the final rates posted on the coveroregon.com website and elsewhere online.\n\n\"Consumers can now compare plans side by side,\" she said. \"I think that's overall a good thing.\"\n\nOpen enrollment begins again Nov. 15.\n\nModa had requested a 12.5 percent hike, but Oregon Insurance Division regulators cut back that request as well as those of other insurers. Kaiser Health Foundation of the Northwest saw its request for a slight rate hike denied, with its premiums cut by 4.1 percent instead.\n\nState regulators were persuaded to make a 2-percent across-the-board premium cut by testimony during rate review hearings. The OSPIRG Foundation said insurers failed to take into accounts the reforms' expansion of Medicaid, which cut hospital costs by reducing the number of uninsured.\n\nThe state reined in some efforts to cut rates as well, notably that of Oregon's Health CO-OP, one of two new consumer-operated insurers set up with federal loans last year.\n\nThe CO-OP had sought to cut its premiums by 21 percent, but instead the state approved only a 9.9 percent cut after questioning the calculations the insurer used to justify the cut.\n\nThe CO-OP's CEO, Ralph Prows, said the firm has already asked for a re-hearing and review to address what he said was information that bolstered the insurer's case.\n\n\"We worked with Milliman -- the best outside actuaries in the country -- every week since last October, and we scraped every corner of the cupboard to find every half percent, every quarter percent we could find to pass on to consumers,\" Prows said.\n\nCali, the insurance commissioner, said her division has to ensure rates aren't too low or too high. If rates don't cover costs, \"they may not be able to pay claims, they may not be able to be sustainable.\"\n\nShe said she hadn't decided whether to give Prows a re-hearing.\n\nLast year the CO-OP had sought to cut its rate request after seeing Moda's rates. The state told the CO-OP it wasn't allowed, although other insurers were allowed to cut their rates.\n\nModa officials say their plans offer other benefits that make up for their 2015 premium hikes.\n\n\"This is not about a price war,\" said Robert Gootee, CEO of Moda Health, in a prepared statement. \"What Oregonians need \u2013 what Oregonians deserve \u2013 is a value comparison, one that balances cost with their need for access to affordable high quality care.\"\n\nSmall business rates are also tighter. Health Republic, which led the 2014 market with ts 40-year old silver plan employee rate, boosted its rates while other insurers cut theirs in the small group market.\n\nInsurance agents and consumer advocates note that there's more to picking a plan than premiums. Different plans offer different networks, rules and fine print.\n\nThe individual market was considered crucial to federal efforts to boost coverage, and in Oregon enrollment jumped from about 150,000 in 2013 to nearly 200,000 as of April.\n\nThe rates released are for plans that comply with the Affordable Care Act. But in response to an outcry last fall over premium hikes and plan changes, federal and state officials allowed some non-ACA plans to survive, offering lower rates. Rate changes to those plans in Oregon can be found here.\n\nTo download a PDF of the ACA rate decisions, click here.
