The upper chamber could move for final passage of the legislation Wednesday, but it\u2019s dead on arrival in the House of Representatives.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said yesterday he has no intention of bring the Senate\u2019s version of the legislation before the lower chamber.\n\nInstead, House Speaker John Boehner told Republican members today the House will vote on a three-month extension of the Highway Trust Fund this week. Members are set to head home Thursday for August recess, and their departure will force the Senate to pass the short-term patch.\n\n\u201cThis is a good path forward, and we should be able to do our work,\u201d Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster, R-Penn., said. \u201cIt will give us enough time for our committee to do our work, get something on the board and go to conference.\u201d\n\nThe House\u2019s three-month highway funding bill would give Congress until Oct. 29 to come to a long-term agreement on the Highway Trust Fund\u2019s financial future.\n\n\u201cI want a long-term highway bill that\u2019s fully paid for. That\u2019s been the goal all year,\u201d Boehner told reporters this morning. \u201cIt\u2019s time to get it across the finish line.\u201d\n\nNot only would a short-term extension give members of Congress time to craft a longer-term deal, but it would also leave Ex-Im\u2019s charter expired through at least September, as the legislation wouldn\u2019t include a measure to revive the highly contested agency.\n\nEx-Im provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign countries and companies for the purchase of U.S. products. Its charter expired June 30, but Democrats and some Republicans\u2014with the support of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2014tried to revive the agency through an amendment to the Senate highway bill.\n\nConservatives in both chambers have been pushing for Ex-Im\u2019s expiration for more than a year, and debate over the agency intensified over the last few months.\n\nOpponents of the bank, including McCarthy, argue that Ex-Im serves as an engine of corporate welfare and cronyism. Supporters say it creates jobs in the U.S. and helps small businesses break into global markets.\n\n>>> Mike Lee Secured a Commitment From GOP Leadership to Repeal Obamacare With a Simple Majority.
