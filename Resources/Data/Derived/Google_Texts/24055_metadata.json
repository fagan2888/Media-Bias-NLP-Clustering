That cash-and-stock offer was worth $54 billion, including debt. The Journal reported that Anthem's latest offer rose to $188 a share.\n\nNeither company could immediately be reached for comment late Wednesday.\n\nThe merger would cap weeks of frenzied dealmaking in the health insurance industry.\n\nAetna Inc. reached a $37-billion deal for Humana Inc. this month. And Woodland Hills insurer Health Net Inc. agreed to be acquired by Medicaid insurer Centene Corp. for $6.8 billion.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has spurred much of this activity.\n\nCompanies are looking to bulk up to better take advantage of rising revenues from the health law and the growing privatization of Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nHealth insurers are hoping consolidation enables them to squeeze out more costs and negotiate better prices with hospitals, doctors and drugmakers.\n\nThe tie-up of Anthem and Cigna would create a company with about $115 billion in annual revenue and 53 million members. That would make it the largest U.S. health insurer in terms of membership, ahead of industry leader UnitedHealth Group Inc.\n\nAetna and Humana combined would have about 33 million members, rounding out a dominant big three in the health insurance sector.\n\nAntitrust authorities are expected to closely scrutinize this new industry landscape.\n\nSome health-policy experts and consumer advocates have expressed alarm about this increasing consolidation.\n\nThey worry that this will create powerful new healthcare giants that will limit the negotiating power of government health programs and employers to hold down prices.\n\nThe potential impact on consumers will vary by region, depending on the overall number of heath plan choices.\n\nThe talks between Anthem and Cigna spilled into public last month when Anthem expressed frustration with Cigna's demands. Cigna shot back at the time and criticized Anthem's bid and tactics.\n\nAnthem is California's largest for-profit health insurer and also sells Blue Cross policies in 13 other states. Anthem's shares were up 3% in after-hours trading Wednesday.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Cigna shares jump as rival Anthem reportedly nears deal", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Shares of Cigna Corp. soared late Wednesday on a report that rival Anthem Inc. was nearing a deal for the health insurer after a months-long pursuit.", "title": "Cigna shares jump as rival Anthem reportedly nears deal", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-anthem-cigna-deal-20150722-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55b03783/turbine/la-fi-anthem-cigna-deal-20150722", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp15.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "anthem, cigna, health insurance, mergers", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84055456", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-22", "Description": "Shares of Cigna Corp. soared late Wednesday on a report that rival Anthem Inc. was nearing a deal for the health insurer after a months-long pursuit.
