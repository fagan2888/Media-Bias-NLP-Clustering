Given those concerns, she recommended to Health and Human Services officials in September that the ATO -- a document required for the HealthCare.gov\u2019s launch -- should not be signed. HHS officials overruled her recommendation and issued a temporary, six-month ATO.\n\nWhen HealthCare.gov launched on Oct. 1, its major technical problems were exposed, though Fryer and other government officials noted Thursday that there haven\u2019t been any successful attacks on the site.\n\n\n\nSince the site\u2019s launch, security testing has continued -- and is conducted on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cGiven the positive results of the recent security control assessments... I would recommend [HealthCare.gov] be given a new authority to operate\u201d when the current ATO expires, Fryer told the committee. While noting that one can \u201cnever guarantee any system is hack-proof,\u201d she noted that \u201cthe protections we have put in place have successfully prevented attacks.\u201d\n\nCommittee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., in his opening remarks was nevertheless skeptical. He said given all the problems with HealthCare.gov -- which serves as the Obamacare portal for 36 states -- the website is \u201cstill questionable in its security.\u201d\n\nThe risk of vulnerabilities on the health care website is very serious, the congressman said, given that it has \u201ctentacles to some of the most personal information\u201d on databases belonging to multiple government agencies like the Social Security Administration and the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nTo illustrate the enormity of the risk, Issa pointed out the severity of the security breach that hit the retail chain Target, affecting tens of millions of people.\n\n\u201cThe difference between Target and other companies who dealt with hackers is that we don't have to deliver that information -- we have the choice of paying cash, we have the choice of not registering,\u201d he said, contrasting that with the mandate under the Affordable Care Act to obtain insurance.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the top Democrat on the committee, countered that the committee ought to be holding hearings into the Target breach -- rather than hearings about a government website that\u2019s never been successfully attacked. He pointed out that the Oversight Committee has held 22 hearings on this issue.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent more time on this one issue over the past three years than any other topic,\u201d he said. While acknowledging that the security of HealthCare.gov is important, Cummings said the hearings continued because \u201cRepublicans are still obsessed with killing this law [and] scaring people away from HealthCare.gov.\u201d\n\nCummings accused Republicans with \u201ccherry-picking partial information to promote a political narrative that is inaccurate.\u201d\n\nHe stressed that the site has now undergone full, end-to-end testing and that government officials have put a strong mitigation plan in place to respond to attacks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government official tells Congress about earlier security concerns but says Obamacare site is now sufficiently secure", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/security-chief-healthcaregov-has-passed-security-testing/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/25/99749f49-4097-4e51-90ad-299f67032cf7/thumbnail/1200x630/619a8ecf14e0ed66e8715d926f9453b1/AP106902674308.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Government official tells Congress about earlier security concerns but says Obamacare site is now sufficiently secure", "title": "Security chief: HealthCare.gov has passed security testing"}, "twitter": {"description": "Government official tells Congress about earlier security concerns but says Obamacare site is now sufficiently secure", "title": "Security chief: HealthCare.gov has passed security testing", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/security-chief-healthcaregov-has-passed-security-testing/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/security-chief-healthcaregov-has-passed-security-testing/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/security-chief-healthcaregov-has-passed-security-testing/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@http://twitter.com/stephcondoncbs", "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/25/99749f49-4097-4e51-90ad-299f67032cf7/thumbnail/1200x630/619a8ecf14e0ed66e8715d926f9453b1/AP106902674308.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/security-chief-healthcaregov-has-passed-security-testing/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/security-chief-healthcaregov-has-passed-security-testing/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/Political-Hotsheet/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb4c\"", "article_summary": "A top HealthCare.gov security officer told Congress Thursday that the Obamacare website passed security testing in December, and she would recommend that its official Authority to Operate (ATO) be extended when the current ATO expires in March.\nTeresa Fryer, the chief information security officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), told members of the House Oversight Committee that before HealthCare.gov launched, she wasn\u2019t as confident about its security.\nI would recommend [HealthCare.gov] be given a new authority to operate\u201d when the current ATO expires, Fryer told the committee.\nSince the site\u2019s launch, security testing has continued -- and is conducted on a regular basis.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spent more time on this one issue over the past three years than any other topic,\u201d he said."}
