(Iva Kay Horner/News-Tribune)\n\nIt also defines the football game which found two 12-0 teams fighting to earn the title of 2A State Champions.\n\nAnd while it was a tough battle at times, it was the Brush Beetdiggers that came out on top, defeating the Kent Denver Sun Devils 14-6.\n\nThis was the 13th consecutive play-off appearance for the 'Diggers, who brought their \"A\" game to Beetdigger Stadium on Saturday, fending off the Sun Devils in not one, but two, goal line stands during the game.\n\nThis also was the 'Diggers first state title in 20 years, their fifth in Brush High School history. The last state title was won under Coach Larry Mills in 1994, when the 'Diggers defeated St. Mary's, 20-9. Beetdigger Coach Randy Dreitz received congratulations from former coach Larry Mills following Saturday s 2A State Championship game. This was the Diggers first state win in 20 years with the last state title earned in 1994 under Coach Mills. (Iva Kay Horner/News-Tribune)\n\nIt was a game of powerful and smart football with emotion filling the stands as the 'Diggers played to a packed house, bringing their season to a perfect 13-0.\n\nOn the opening kick by Sun Devil Wyllis McKissick, it was 'Digger senior Kyle Rosenbrock who ran the ball back for close to a 36-yard gain, bringing the 'Diggers to a second and seven. On the third and nine from the 42-yard line, a Rosenbrock pass to Alec Petterson gained the Beetdiggers another 14 yards of field advantage.\n\nA few plays later, the 'Diggers fumbled but recovered at the 29-yard line for a gain of eight yards. The 10th play of the drive found junior Clay Shaver scoring a touchdown from 15 yards out on a Rosenbrock pass, pushing the Beetdiggers to a 6-0 lead over the Sun Devils. Advertisement\n\nA successful field goal by sophomore Jeron Petterson put the'Diggers up 7-0.\n\nThe 'Diggers continued tough play, but on a Kent Denver third and fourth from the 35, it was a Zander Ellis pitch to fellow senior Jaden Franklin and a 65-yard run that put the Sun Devils on the score board. Conor Dooley's field goal attempt was unsuccessful, leaving the score at 7-6 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nSecond quarter action began with Kent Denver at their own 30-yard line on their first and 10, but consecutive tackles by 'Diggers Mikey Gutierrez and Niko Guzman, brought the Sun Devils to a third and two at their own 43-yard line. A Beetdigger blitz resulted in a near turnover, and on a fourth and three, a punt by Sun Devil Rob Casey rolled to the 18-yard line, leaving the 'Diggers 83 yards to work with.\n\nIn their next run, Petterson earned a first down on a 41-yard run, a gain of 23 yards for the senior. However, the 'Diggers were called for holding, with the play moved back for a first and 14. A few plays later, on a second and long 10 at their own 18-yard line, Guzman ran the ball up the sideline for 49 yards and the first down.\n\nWith 6:44 left in the second quarter, Kent Denver gained 18 yards on their first play, and another 13 on a pass from Ellis to Joe Rassenfoss. A tackle by 'Digger Joe Carwin on Kent Denver's first and 10, led to a second and eight for an incomplete pass from 36 yards out.\n\nThe Sun Devil's eighth play of the drive resulted in a Carwin interception for the first turnover of the game, but they shut down the 'Diggers' first 3 attempts forcing the Beetdiggers to punt. Gutierrez returned the favor by bringing down the Sun Devil returner.\n\nKent Denver was plagued with incomplete passes from there with Cameron Alexander knocking down a pass to end the movement.\n\nTaking over at the 44, two Rosenbrock passes were incomplete, but on a fourth and seven from their own 47-yard line, Rosenbrock rolled to the right, running along the sideline for a first down. The joy was short-lived as the run was nullified on a holding penalty of 15 yards against Brush.\n\nThe Beetdiggers showed why they were playing for the Gold Ball during the third quarter, with another touchdown and field goal, moving the score to 14-6.\n\nWhile Kent Denver kept reaching for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, the Beetdiggers turned the game into what 1010KSIR sports announcer John Beltran referred to as \"a physical smashmouth\" game by stopping the Sun Devils in their tracks on their first run.\n\nOn a third down and \"inches\", and a hand-off from Arnoldo \"Baby\" Maltos-Garcia, Rosenbrock gained enough yardage for a first down on the Beetdiggers' own 25-yard line. Another Maltos-Garcia hand-off to Rosenbrock resulted in a gain of 14 for the 'Diggers and a first and 10. The Sun Devils were able to get the 'Diggers to a fourth and six, with Rosenbrock punting for 47 yards.\n\nOn the Sun Devil's second possession, Franklin, who is one of the top running backs in the state's history, gained 11 yards before being brought down by Rosenbrock. A pass by Ellis, on a first and 10 at the 28, was incomplete, with the next pass by Ellis caught by Franklin. A tackle by Rosenbrock resulted in Franklin dropping the football.\n\nWith under 3:20 left in the game, Ellis again passed, this time to Rassenfoss who was brought down at the 40-yard line, for a gain of seven yards. Brush responded on the next play with 'Digger Randy Woodward bringing down Ellis for a loss of one yard.\n\nOn Kent Denver's ninth play of the drive, and with 2:38 left in the fourth quarter, it was a Carwin sack that caused the Sun Devils a loss of eight yards. An interference call and 15-yard penalty against the 'Diggers moved the Sun Devils to a fourth and four at the 33-yard line. A screen to McKissick measured short, giving the Beetdiggers the ball for the final 1:55 minutes of the game.\n\nA first and 10 at their own 30, had Maltos-Garcia handing off to Rosenbrock, gaining five yards on the play. A second and five earned the 'Diggers another yard, with Kent Denver calling their final time out.\n\nAlthough the next play found Rosenbrock downed at the 45 and dragged back to the 43 yard line, it was on the second and 11 at their own 43-yard line, and with 42 seconds left in the game, that the 'Diggers took the victory formation. Maltos-Garcia took the snap and then his knee, calling it a win for the Brush Beetdiggers.\n\n\"There's no better way to end it,\" Kyle Rosenbrock said after the game. \"I'll remember this for the rest of my life.\" The Beetdigger had a total of 44 touchdowns this season. The senior ran for 112 yards on 20 carries on offense, as well as threw for 108 yards and a touchdown in Saturday's game.\n\nMike Gutierrez, who ran for over 1,000 yards this season, said, \"I wanted to work harder than anyone else and prove I deserved to be out here with all these amazing athletes\u2026everyday I try to work harder and harder. We knew we had to work defensively and I worked to be the best that I could.\"\n\nFor Alec Petterson, \"This was dream ending. We had this since day one\u2026it is what we envisioned. We got to this point and relayed we had something to do. We had a game plan and knew we had tough tasks\u2026we had many tough tasks this year but we stepped up. When you have a player like Kyle, to be able to play with him is such an honor. To be able to play next to him is an honor.\"\n\nJunior teammate Clay Shaver commented, \"It's been a lot of fun working with these guys. They gave me a lot of support and made me the player I am this season. I am glad to have them with me.\"\n\nNiko Guzman stated, \"We knew it was going to be a battle. We play discipline and knew we needed to stick to our assignments, act as a team and play as a team. We hunkered down and stopped them.\"\n\n\"I thought Randy did a heck of a job coaching, great play calling, great drama, a great goal line stand,\" exclaimed Larry Mills. \"It was satisfying and for all the alumni that was here, it was a great feeling. I couldn't be happier for him. It is well deserved. It's awesome, an awesome feeling and I am so proud of Coach Dreitz. It was a long time coming.\"\n\nFollowing the game and celebration, the Brush Volunteer Fire Department led a parade through the City of Brush for the newly crowned 2A State Champs.\n\nPerfect is probably the best way to describe Saturday's weather.It also defines the football game which found two 12-0 teams fighting to earn the title of 2A State Champions.And while it was a tough battle at times, it was the Brush Beetdiggers that came out on top, defeating the Kent Denver Sun Devils 14-6.This was the 13th consecutive play-off appearance for the 'Diggers, who brought their \"A\" game to Beetdigger Stadium on Saturday, fending off the Sun Devils in not one, but two, goal line stands during the game.This also was the 'Diggers first state title in 20 years, their fifth in Brush High School history.
