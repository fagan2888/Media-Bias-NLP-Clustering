This year, the Internet was rife with vile gossip and wild beliefs; I couldn\u2019t even possibly list all the wacky new chemtrail and illuminati theories in just one article. And let\u2019s just quickly drive a stake through the rumors that Ebola victims are rising from the dead, reptilians disguised as humans run the U.S. government, and Pharrell, Keanu Reeves and Madonna are actually vampires.\n\nI\u2019ve found that the conspiracy theories spread most widely \u2014 and the ones that seem plausible to many, unfortunately \u2014 are those based on current headlines and often propagated by public figures such as politicians, celebrities and media figures. They travel by word-of-mouth at light speed and become \u201ca known fact.\u201d These theories are often believed by those who assume there must be a coherence behind world events and occurrences don\u2019t just happen randomly. Using that as our criteria, here are the most insidious conspiracy theories of 2014.\n\n1. MH370 landed at a U.S. military installation. The continuing lack of firm evidence about the fate of the missing Malaysian Airways jetliner has conspiracy theorists wagging their tongues. Speculation ranges from alien abduction to the airplane entering into a lost dimension. This speculation has been, in part, spurred by the inexplicable sequence of flight events leading to the plane\u2019s disappearance and the nonstop coverage of the story by the news networks, particularly CNN, whose anchors even began to entertain wild theories on the air while there was little news to report.\n\nIronically, CNN conducted a poll months after MH370 disappeared from radar in March. It found that some 10% of Americans believe that \u201cspace aliens, time travelers or beings from another dimension\u201d played a part in the airliner\u2019s disappearance. Moreover, 21% of poll respondents believe that at least some of the people on the flight survived and they may have landed or crash-landed in some remote area.\n\nOne of the more popular theories is that the plane landed on Diego Garcia, a small British atoll in the Indian Ocean where the U.S. operates several strategic military facilities. Conspiracy theorists have long contended that the site has been used by the CIA for \u201cblack ops\u201d missions, including the detainment, interrogation and torture of terrorists and political enemies.\n\nInspired by conspiracy blogger Jim Stone, theorists continue to insist that MH370 was diverted to Diego Garcia because some \u201chigh-value\u201d targets were on the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Some believe the plane was diverted to keep 20 employees of Freescale Semiconductor from arriving in Beijing, because they held U.S. intelligence secrets the CIA feared would fall into the hands of the Chinese government. Other versions of the conspiracy theory say that the Freescale employees had been working on a drone smaller than a housefly that could used in biochemical warfare.\n\nConspiracy theorists, however, cannot seem to agree on the ultimate fate of the plane\u2019s crew and passengers. Some speculate they have all become permanent detainees on the island, while others claim that only the high-value targets on the plane were spared and could even be secretly working on U.S. defense projects from Diego Garcia.\n\nTo further solidify their Diego Garcia theory, conspiracy theorists quickly acknowledged a claim found on the Internet that an American passenger, Philip Wood, sent GPS coordinates and an image over a cellphone text message, proving the plane had landed on the atoll. Not long after the Philip Wood theory was introduced it was quickly debunked by numerous tech-savvy Internet users who now believe the origin of the text was likely some tomfoolery by users of 4Chan, an Internet subculture site.\n\n2. MH370 and MH17 were the same airplane. Unhappy that the Diego Garcia theory didn\u2019t pan out, other conspiracists were quick to jump on the notion that MH17, the Malaysian Airways airliner widely assumed to be shot down over the Ukraine by Russian-backed separatists in July, was actually MH370 and the passengers on that plane were actually the corpses from the missing plane.\n\nThis theory took hold on Twitter only minutes after news broke of the Boeing 777\u2019s mid-air explosion and crash and later spread like wildfire on YouTube. The theory is that the first Malyasian airliner was hijacked and taken to a secret destination for storage, where it was rigged with explosives. It was then flown over the Ukraine/Russian border where it was blown up to implicate one party in the ongoing civil war. Some speculate that the CIA was behind this elaborate \u201cfalse flag\u201d plot, while others point to the New World Order \u2014 a shadowy power elite that secretly controls the world \u2014 as staging this to instigate a third world war.\n\nWhile both planes were Boeing 777s, MH17 was built in 1997 and MH370 five years later, and there are subtle differences in the designs of the planes. Proponents of the idea that the planes were switched say the photographs they saw of MH17 show a newer version of the Boeing 777 with an extra window behind the second exit.\n\nThe theory was further promoted by pro-Russian rebels who told the media that the bodies they saw in the wreckage soon after the crash had been dead for many days. The separatists also claimed their passports were \u201cpristine\u201d and looked like they had been planted on the bodies.\n\nAviation bloggers, many of them pilots themselves, were quick to debunk the extra window theory, and the pro-Russian separatists have not been the most trustworthy sources with other information about the shooting down of the MH17, making their claims dubious at best.\n\nConspiracy theorists are fond of arguing that it\u2019s na\u00efve to accept coincidences. It seems more na\u00efve to assume that any organization or government would have the necessary resources and competence to steal an airplane without a leaving a trace, keep it hidden for four months during a massive search operation, and later substitute it for another plane many witnesses saw take off from Amsterdam earlier that day after being boarded by its passengers.\n\n3. The feds blanketed the South with fake snow. After the Polar Vortex created uncharacteristically Arctic-like conditions in the South in the early months of the year, several websites and YouTube videos pushed a conspiracy theory that the white stuff falling from the sky was not snow, but a plastic impostor engineered by the federal government for nefarious reasons that were never really explained.\n\nA spate of videos cropped up in January and February showing people unsuccessfully trying to melt this snow with their butane lighters. Instead of becoming water, the snow changes to a gas with the remaining solid becoming tinged with black. In some of the videos, the video bloggers claim the snow gives off a toxic smell. They insist it\u2019s not real snow, but a chemical geo-engineered by the government and dumped on southern states for nefarious reasons.\n\nExcept it wasn\u2019t. Meteorologist Mike Stone, who works for CBS affiliate WTVR, explained that what the video bloggers reported was nothing unusual.\n\n\u201cWhen you heat something like this, it goes from a solid to a gas. It\u2019s called sublimation. It doesn\u2019t go from a solid to a liquid, i.e. melting,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, other YouTube users posted their own videos debunking the fake snow reports.\n\n\u201cBottom line, if you don\u2019t want to waste five minutes watching this video, butane burns dirty. The smell is not from the snow, the black on the snow is not because it\u2019s plastic; it\u2019s because of the butane,\u201d said one video blogger.\n\nMany of the videos attempting to expose the snow conspiracy have either been taken down or made private since we first reported this in February, but geo-engineering conspiracy sites are still promoting the myth of plastic snow.\n\n4. The Ebola outbreak is a government plot. Conspiracy theorists like to blame President Obama for a lot of crazy things, but this one takes the cake. Soon after the Ebola outbreak in Africa began to make headlines in August, websites were quick to accuse the Obama administration of all sorts of crazy things that would together lead to some totalitarian dystopia for the U.S. It was an amazingly intricate plot: First the government would use misinformation about Ebola to lull the American public into a false sense of security; then they would use the disease for deliberate population control, impose martial law and the survivors would be given a mandatory Ebola vaccine that would contain an RFID chip to track everyone\u2019s whereabouts. The only thing that seems to be missing from this string of theories is President Obama\u2019s Nehru jacket and Persian cat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From MH370 speculation to Ebola hysteria, it's been a banner year for tin-foil hat wearers across the country", "title": "The 5 most insidious conspiracy theories of 2014", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From MH370 speculation to Ebola hysteria, it's been a banner year for tin-foil hat wearers across the country", "title": "The 5 most insidious conspiracy theories of 2014", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/09/the_5_most_insidious_conspiracy_theories_of_2014_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/oreilly_ebola.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From MH370 speculation to Ebola hysteria, it's been a banner year for tin-foil hat wearers across the country", "title": "The 5 most insidious conspiracy theories of 2014", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/oreilly_ebola.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Cliff Weathers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, ebola, Keanu Reeves, Madonna, MH370, pharrell", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6f3\"", "article_summary": "Using that as our criteria, here are the most insidious conspiracy theories of 2014.\nThe continuing lack of firm evidence about the fate of the missing Malaysian Airways jetliner has conspiracy theorists wagging their tongues.\nConspiracy theorists like to blame President Obama for a lot of crazy things, but this one takes the cake.\nI\u2019ve found that the conspiracy theories spread most widely \u2014 and the ones that seem plausible to many, unfortunately \u2014 are those based on current headlines and often propagated by public figures such as politicians, celebrities and media figures.\nConspiracy theorists are fond of arguing that it\u2019s na\u00efve to accept coincidences."}
