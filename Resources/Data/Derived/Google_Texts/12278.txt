BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — Kanye showed off his new kicks to admirers. Rihanna braved the rain sans umbrella. Willow Smith danced to the music, and Beyonce gave out hugs and took pictures with well-wishers.

There were starry sights everywhere you looked at Jay Z’s annual Roc Nation pre-Grammy brunch Saturday. The event was held once again at a posh mansion in Beverly Hills, but this year, intermittent rain put a damper on the glamourous outdoor garden setting.

Event planners were prepared, however, to shield the likes of Nicki Minaj, Diplo, Childish Gambino, other celebrities and VIP industry guests with tents, where most guests remained huddled during the four-hour event. Other guests included Michael Bolton, who was seen bopping his head to hip-hop, plus Demi Lovato, Janelle Monae, Kelly Rowland, Nicki Minaj, Miguel, Diplo, J. Cole, Nick Jonas and Keke Palmer.
