Harris-Perry\u2019s \u201copen letter\u201d this Saturday was directed squarely at Washington writer Michelle Cottle, who penned a cover story for this week\u2019s POLITICO magazine titled \u201cLeaning Out: How Michelle Obama became a feminist nightmare.\u201d Harris-Perry offered up a fierce defense of the first lady, asking Cottle, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven how simplistic your piece is, let me make this very simple: you are wrong,\u201d Harris-Perry said, as she attempted to sysmatically explain who unrealistic it would be for Michelle Obama to \u201ccome roaring out of the White House battling for reproductive rights.\u201d While Cottle dismissed some of the first lady\u2019s signature projects as \u201cfluff,\u201d Harris-Perry emphasized the importance of \u201cfighting childhood obesity, one of the biggest public health crises of our time.\u201d\n\nHowever, it was the racial implications in Cottle\u2019s piece that drew the most criticism from Harris-Perry. \u201cYou seem to think she is steering clear of the \u2018Angry Black Woman\u2019 stereotype,\u201d she said to Cottle. \u201cBut when she calls herself mom-in-chief, she is rejecting a different stereotype\u2013-the role of Mammy.\u201d She added, \u201cSo that can be your feminist nightmare, but it is my black motherhood dream.\u201d\n\nHarris-Perry drew a line in the sand between the white and black versions of feminism, and even hinted at how that divide could impact the 2016 presidential race if Hillary Clinton decides to jump in. \u201cBefore we enter the 2016 election cycle and the feminists come asking black women for our support for your candidate,\u201d she said, \u201cyou might want to read up a bit on black women and our feminism.\u201d\n\nWatch
