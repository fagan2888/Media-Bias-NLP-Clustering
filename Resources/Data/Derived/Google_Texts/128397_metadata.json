Country Club Rd. An employee told police, thieves have been stealing beer from the store. The employee recognized one of the suspects, who had stolen beer from the day before, and called police.\n\nAn Ada police officer happened to be in the parking lot, and she approached the suspect as he left the store. Police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Cordell Tebee.\n\nPolice say Tebee ran from the officer, jumped inside a truck, and yelled at the female driver to take off. The driver did not, so Tebee pushed her out of the truck and got behind the wheel.\n\nSources tell News 9, Tebee tried to run over the officer, and she fired at him. An off-duty Roff reserve officer was also nearby and fired one shot at the getaway car.\n\nOfficers chased after Tebee until one of the truck\u2019s tires went flat from being struck by a bullet. Tebee then ran from the vehicle but was quickly apprehended three blocks away from the store.\n\nTebee was arrested for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and felony eluding. Three other suspects were also arrested and booked into jail.\n\nPolice found stolen steaks inside the car, as well as stolen beer in the Wal-Mart parking lot.\n\nThe names of the other three suspects and the officers involved have not been released.\n\nAlthough no one was injured, the Ada Police Department has requested the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to investigate the incident.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Four people were arrested after an officer-involved shooting in Ada on Friday.", "author": "Joleen Chaney", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26000906/four-people-arrested-after-officer-involved-shooting-in-ada", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4191429_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Four people were arrested after an officer-involved shooting in Ada on Friday.", "title": "Four People Arrested After Officer-Involved Shooting In Ada"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4191429_G.jpg", "description": "Four people were arrested after an officer-involved shooting in Ada on Friday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Four People Arrested After Officer-Involved Shooting In Ada"}, "wnreadableurl": "four-people-arrested-after-officer-involved-shooting-in-ada", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/07/11", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS18", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95f6\"", "article_summary": "Police say it happened in the Wal-Mart parking lot, located at 1419 N.
