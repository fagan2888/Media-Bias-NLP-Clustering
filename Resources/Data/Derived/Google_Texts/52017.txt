SOUTH BEND — It’s been more than a year since a playground at Harrison Primary Center was set on fire and destroyed by three young children.

Today, the burned-out and broken remains are cordoned off by a fence.

The students who previously used the playground switch on and off using another one designed for older students at the west-side school. But, the logistics of that arrangement mean kids more often have to play in a field or have recess indoors, Assistant Principal David VanDyke said Monday.

The school corporation’s property insurance has a $100,000 deductible per incident, spokeswoman Sue Coney said. So, the entire cost of rebuilding the playground must be borne by the corporation and the school.

On Monday, Coney said lowering or eliminating those deductibles has not been considered because to do so would drive up the cost of premiums.

Initial cost estimates to replace the playground were more than $95,000, but a smaller alternative plan has been pegged at about $18,000.

Officials have said the district will pay $7,500 toward that if Harrison can raise the rest.

So far, the school has $1,000 toward that goal. But efforts are still underway, the assistant principal said.

A special fundraising event called “Restore Our Playground” will begin at 6 p.m. Friday at the South Bend Eagles at 61601 S. Ironwood Drive.

It’ll feature food, drink, a silent auction and the music of The VanDyke Revue, Assistant Principal VanDyke’s own band. Tickets can be obtained at the door, if the event is not sold out, or in advance by calling 574-235-7325. Anyone wishing to contribute to the silent auction or toward the playground restoration fund, can call the school at 574-283-7300 to do so.

School officials hope to have a new playground installed by the time the 2015-16 school year begins in August.

For Harrison students, 94 percent of whom come from backgrounds of poverty, VanDyke said, it’ll undoubtedly be a welcome sight.
