Maybe they\u2019ll want a young coach.\u201d\n\nAnderson is 67, with a career mark of 601-413 in 36 seasons, all at Williamsfield.\n\nJason Lydic is head coach at ROWVA.\n\nWilliamsfield and ROWVA also will form a co-op this spring in baseball, softball and track and field. Those schools and Galva will continue as co-op partners in football.\n\nBACK IN THE DAY: Princeville on Saturday night recognized its 1984-85 team that advanced to the Class A state finals in Champaign, and finished 28-3 after a quarterfinal loss to Providence St. Mel.\n\nGarth Yess was a junior and led the Princes in scoring that season, under coach Jim Yauornik. Other team members included Chris Delbridge, now the baseball head coach at Princeville.\n\nIN AND OUT: The 2014 Princeville tournament is the first in more than 30 years without Dan Sullivan in attendance. The former Princes coach, athletics director and recently-retired teacher is a first-year assistant with Mike Reynolds and Galesburg, part of the Taylorville tournament. Former Sullivan assistant Jeff Kratzer is in his sixth season as coach. \u2026 Marv McAdams was interim coach for North Fulton in its loss to Henry. Wildcats head coach Brad Shaeffer is expected back for Monday\u2019s consolation semifinal against Lowpoint-Washburn.\n\nLonnie Schwindenhammer can be reached at 686-3214 or lschwindenhammer @ pjstar.com.
