But the year\u2019s most closely watched cases may prove even more important in shaping Americans\u2019 attitudes toward the court itself \u2014 inspiring confidence or contempt toward the legitimacy of the judicial function.\n\nIt may be wishful thinking, but the justices would best serve their institution and the nation if they could resist both of the alluring temptations before them and deliver a double-dose of restraint \u2014 declining both the invitation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, on the one hand, and the invitation to torpedo Obamacare, on the other.\n\nEach of these judicial power plays is being pushed by one of America\u2019s ardent ideological tribes. Social progressives and economic conservatives have each so far been unable to get exactly what they want through the political process \u2014 at least, as quickly as they want it \u2014 in these heartfelt and incendiary disputes.\n\nBut the court has solid grounds to refuse to trump the democratic system for either of these frustrated bands of true believers.\n\nRest assured that the proper, limited role of courts in a republic will be eloquently described by conservatives in the coming weeks \u2014 if the court rules against traditionalists on same-sex marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, should Obamacare\u2019s defenders suffer defeat at the court, they will doubtless deliver a similarly illuminating tutorial on the importance of judicial modesty.\n\nAnd the losers in either of those circumstances will be right (if perhaps hypocritical) when they say that the correct role for a democratic court is not to decide what policy should be, but to give effect to the will of the people, as expressed in laws duly enacted through the political system.\n\nThe important exception is in situations where the people, through supermajorities, have guaranteed in their constitutions certain individual rights by decreeing that certain kinds of laws may not be made by ordinary majorities.\n\nGay-marriage advocates, of course, argue that just that kind of exception-making injustice lurks in state laws limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples. Such restrictions deny gay and lesbian couples the constitutionally guaranteed \u201cequal protection of the laws,\u201d it\u2019s said.\n\nBut it\u2019s a stretch to discover this evolving social innovation in constitutional bedrock.\n\nThere are basically two schools of constitutional interpretation. One says constitutional provisions mean what they meant to people at the time they were adopted; the other says their meaning changes in step with society\u2019s changing attitudes.\n\nNobody supposes that \u201cequal protection\u201d meant recognizing gay marriage to Americans in the 19th century, when the 14th Amendment was adopted. And while attitudes about gay marriage clearly are changing, nothing prevents states from expressing new attitudes in their laws through ordinary political means.\n\nIn fact, a number of states, including Minnesota, have done just that though legislation or referendums. But most have not; voters in more states have directly enacted same-sex marriage bans.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s judges\u2019 attitudes that have most completely and emphatically changed. Same-sex marriage has become legal in most of the country largely through court decree.\n\nTo now finish the job, the high court will have to decide that there is no \u201crational basis\u201d whatsoever in the reluctance of some states and some Americans to jettison gender as a factor in the definition of marriage.\n\nIf the justices do that, it probably won\u2019t change the ultimate evolution of marriage customs in our society. But it will confirm millions of Americans in believing that the court is an instrument of ideology more than of law.\n\nThe same unhealthy message will undermine the court\u2019s credibility with an entirely different set of Americans if the court\u2019s conservatives succumb to temptation in the Obamacare case that will similarly electrify debate later this month.\n\nIn that case the court is being urged to rule that the health insurance subsidies provided under federal health care reform cannot be offered in the 30-plus states that have decided not to create their own health insurance \u201cexchanges,\u201d but rather to rely on the federal version.\n\nThe language of the law only authorizes subsidies in connection with exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d\n\nBut surely there can be no meaningful sense in which the Congress that summoned the political will to enact Obamacare intended to deny the majority of Americans that program\u2019s central benefit \u2014 subsidies that, combined with a \u201cmandate,\u201d would broaden health insurance coverage.\n\nPretty clearly, they made a mistake in writing the statute \u2014 perhaps a political mistake in underestimating resistance in state capitols to setting up local exchanges.\n\nBut the Obama administration\u2019s fixing of that flaw by widening access to the subsidies beyond the literal language seems a more reasonable effort to give effect to what was meant to be enacted than a rigid reading that would destabilize the whole reform structure.\n\nThose determined to repeal or transform Obamacare can, of course, keep trying through the political branches.\n\nBut it\u2019s another case where the court simply doesn\u2019t have a good enough reason to sweep democratic processes aside.\n\nD.J.
