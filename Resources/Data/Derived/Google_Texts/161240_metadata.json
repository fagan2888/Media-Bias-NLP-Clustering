Picking up part of the tab: Charles and David Koch.\n\nThe billionaire industrialists are working to patch a gaping hole in the GOP coalition that could spell a generation of irrelevance if Republicans cannot build some credibility with Hispanic voters, who typically shun the GOP.\n\nThe fast-growing group could have tremendous sway in American politics for years to come. Party elders have acknowledged their struggles to win over Hispanic voters, who as recently as 2004 were roughly split in party preference.\n\nEnter the Libre Initiative, an organization that has collected millions from the Kochs' political network. Libre, which is pronounced LEE'-bray and means \u201cfree,\u201d pushes a message of limited government and economic freedom between lessons on how to build family-run businesses and prayer breakfasts with Hispanic pastors. Its organizers pitch conservative ideals while offering tutorials on U.S. immigration law, support for overhauling the broken immigration system that stops short of campaigning for the Senate's bipartisan bill and collecting donations for the unaccompanied children crossing the United States-Mexico border illegally.\n\nIn effect, it is a shadow GOP \u2014 one with a gentle emphasis on social services and assimilation over a central party often seen as hostile to immigrants and minorities.\n\n\u201cWe've gone to areas that other conservative organizations don't typically go,\u201d said Libre's Texas director Rafael Bejar, who helped distribute candy-packed Easter baskets at a San Antonio elementary school.\n\nTucked in with the sweets: a pamphlet in English and Spanish noting that the national debt is approaching $17 trillion. It's a subtle approach, for sure, when compared to other groups' sometimes angry rhetoric.\n\nWhile some conservatives are staging protests over the waves of immigrant children pouring into the United States, Libre is working with a Tucson, Arizona, church to collect donations for the children being held at federal sites. A similar effort in Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the epicenter for the immigration surge, is on deck.\n\nIt's merely the latest effort of the Koch-backed pitch to Hispanic voters and the effort to shape the future of the Republican Party and American politics.\n\nIn June, the United Negro College Fund, which provides scholarships to students attending historically black colleges, announced a $25 million donation from Koch Industries and the Charles Koch Foundation.\n\nLibre now has operations in eight states in the hope Hispanics will repay conservatives with their votes.\n\nOrganizers already have 3,000 Texas volunteers, and similar undertakings in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico and Virginia. Libre is but one piece of the Koch brothers' sprawling and effective network of conservative groups. Alongside the grassroots-focused Americans for Prosperity and the youth-oriented Generation Opportunity, Libre began courting Hispanic voters in 2011.\n\nOn a recent, sweltering Thursday, Pastor Marcus Burgos wore a blue T-shirt stenciled with \u201cBeLibre as\u201d he helped distribute food in a rough corner of northwest San Antonio. Needy families picked up cartloads of tortillas, watermelons and frozen pizzas -- along with bilingual Libre pamphlets.\n\n\u201cMy belief is that their prosperity, when it comes, will benefit the entire community,\u201d said Burgos, whose Abundant Life Church of God offers services in English and Spanish and occupies a former supermarket inside a strip mall.\n\nOne of those taking home food was 45-year-old Elda Guevara, a mother of three and a loyal Democrat. She said she wasn't ready to switch parties -- but some of what she saw made sense. \u201cIf they support immigration changes so that more people can get their papers in order, then I'm with them,\u201d said Guevara, on medical leave from her job as a cook.\n\nIn 2004, Hispanic voters were 8 percent of the electorate. By 2012, they represented 10 percent of all voters. At the same time, they became friendlier to Democrats.\n\nRepublican President George W. Bush's re-election bid captured 44 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004, while Democrat Barack Obama won 71 percent eight years later.\n\nAn internal Republican National Committee report after the 2012 elections urged the party to consider more inclusive language about immigrants and Hispanics. The RNC paid for Hispanic operatives in California, Florida, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. In Texas, that means $50,000 per month to the state party, allowing it to hire seven organizers focused on finding and recruiting Hispanics, especially those registered to vote. But progress is slow and frustration is growing, especially with the influx of unaccompanied children, mostly from Central America, crossing the border.\n\n\u201cPeople, they tell me that, \u2018I see Republicans as rich old men handling everything,\u2019\u201d said 23-year-old Crystal Rodriguez, who represents the Texas GOP in heavily Democratic El Paso. \u201cBut then they meet me, and they learn that's not true.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Libre is trying to turn the conversation to Democrats\u2019 health care law. Hispanics historically lack health insurance but haven't enrolled under new programs. Looking to capitalize on the skepticism toward what critics call \u201cObamacare,\u201d Libre has run ads against Rep. Pete Gallego, a Texas Democrat who represents the San Antonio and El Paso suburbs and whose district is 71 percent Hispanic.\n\nIn Arizona, Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick is being criticized for voting in favor of the health care law, and Libre has similarly blasted Rep. Joe Garcia of Florida with Spanish-language television ads. Not everyone is convinced.\n\nAbundant Life Church of God volunteer Dora Cantu was wearing a Libre T-shirt as she handed out food and clothing -- but said she had no use for its conservative ideology.\n\n\u201cIf you put God first,\u201d Cantu said, \u201cthere's little room for politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1899291.1407767944!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/article-koch-0811.jpg", "description": "Looking to make inroads with the rising number of Hispanic voters, conservative activists are offering English classes, health checkups and courses to help Spanish-speakers earn high school diplomas.", "parsely-title": "Koch Brothers help GOP reel in Hispanic voters", "twitter": {"description": "Looking to make inroads with the rising number of Hispanic voters, conservative activists are offering English classes, health checkups and courses to help Spanish-speakers earn high school diplomas.", "title": "Koch Brothers help GOP reel in Hispanic voters", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/koch-brothers-gop-reel-hispanic-voters-article-1.1899231", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1899291.1407767944!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/article-koch-0811.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-08-11T10:15:14-0400", "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "sailthru.title": "Koch Brothers help GOP reel in Hispanic voters", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1899291.1407767944!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/article-koch-0811.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "nydn_section": "Politics", "parsely-section": "Politics", "sailthru.credits": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS", "parsely-type": "article", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-11T14:15:14", "sailthru.description": "Looking to make inroads with the rising number of Hispanic voters, conservative activists are offering English classes, health checkups and courses to help Spanish-speakers earn high school diplomas.", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Looking to make inroads with the rising number of Hispanic voters, conservative activists are offering English classes, health checkups and courses to help Spanish-speakers earn high school diplomas.", "title": "Koch Brothers help GOP reel in Hispanic voters", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/koch-brothers-gop-reel-hispanic-voters-article-1.1899231", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1899291.1407767944!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/article-koch-0811.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/koch-brothers-gop-reel-hispanic-voters-article-1.1899231"}, "article_summary": "Party elders have acknowledged their struggles to win over Hispanic voters, who as recently as 2004 were roughly split in party preference.\nLooking to make inroads with the rising number of Hispanic voters, conservative activists are offering English classes, health checkups and courses to help Spanish-speakers earn high school diplomas.\nThe billionaire industrialists are working to patch a gaping hole in the GOP coalition that could spell a generation of irrelevance if Republicans cannot build some credibility with Hispanic voters, who typically shun the GOP.\nAlongside the grassroots-focused Americans for Prosperity and the youth-oriented Generation Opportunity, Libre began courting Hispanic voters in 2011.\nIn 2004, Hispanic voters were 8 percent of the electorate."}
