Michael Pachter, Wedbush Securities and Jason Del Rey of Re/code join the Closing Bell panel to weigh in on Amazon Air drone delivery.

It's been a big week for Amazon, who used the major shopping week after cyber Monday to show off innovative new ways to deliver packages.

Yet in one analyst's opinion, the Internet retailer should get its head out of the clouds and keep its eyes on the road.

Almost exactly two years ago, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced the company would test delivery via unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones. The next stage of Bezo's vision for drone delivery took flight Monday morning, when Amazon released a video of a drone completing a test delivery with "Amazon Prime Air." On Friday, the retail giant said it would move to build up its own fleet of "several thousand" semi trucks to deliver orders around the country.
