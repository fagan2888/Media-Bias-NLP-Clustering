Paul Laxalt, served in the Navy and spent time in Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n\nIn his remarks, Laxalt took the opportunity to recall his grandfather\u2019s early support of Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential ambitions which came to fruition in 1980. Reagan\u2019s election ushered in a new era of freedom and liberty, he said.\n\n\u201cI am running for attorney general because we are again at these crossroads,\u201d Laxalt said. \u201cAmerica has been weakened by bad ideas, and our democracy\u2019s temptation to toy with those bad ideas.\n\n\u201cThis is exacerbated by the quality of people we have in elected office. The type of people that believe in survival and polling, not in leadership. It\u2019s time for accountability. It\u2019s time for real leadership.\u201d\n\nIn response to questions after his announcement, Laxalt acknowledged Miller has had a huge head start in campaign fundraising, but said there is plenty of time until the November general election.\n\nLaxalt said he has not yet begun to fund raise. Miller reported collecting about $900,000 for his campaign so far.\n\nLaxalt, born in Reno, only returned to Nevada to reside full time in 20111. Law school and his military service kept him from returning sooner, he said. Laxalt has taken a leave of absence from his position as an attorney at the Lewis Roca Rothgerber law firm to pursue his campaign.\n\nMiller, who was attending a meeting of the Board of Examiners on Monday, welcomed Laxalt to the race. But Miller emphasized he is the longtime Nevadan.\n\n\u201cFrom what I understand he has been in the state only a short time,\u201d said Miller, a lifetime resident except for his college years and time as a White House intern.\n\nHe noted he already has a lot of support from Republicans, including several members of Laxalt\u2019s family.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a spirited campaign,\u201d Miller said.\n\nGOP Gov. Brian Sandoval, who is running for a second term as governor, said he is endorsing Laxalt.\n\n\u201cHe has a good legal background,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cHe has good leadership qualities.\u201d\n\nSandoval, who is a former attorney general, said he has met Laxalt but does not have a long-term relationship with him.\n\nLaxalt is a former lieutenant in the Navy. Trained by the Navy as a prosecutor and legal adviser, he served as a judge advocate general for five years.\n\nHe graduated magna cum laude from Georgetown University and also graduated from the Georgetown University Law Center. Laxalt and his wife, Jaime, live in Henderson with their daughter, Sophia, and their dogs, Hoya and Buckley.\n\nCapital Bureau Chief Ed Vogel contributed to this report.
