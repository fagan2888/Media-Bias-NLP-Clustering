So when politicians and beltway operatives say things like \u201cObamacare is the law and people need to accept that,\u201d I\u2019m bitterly disappointed. I\u2019m angry and I know that the person uttering those words has probably never written a personal check for his or her health insurance premiums.\n\nAs someone who does pay for her own premiums, I like to think we can do better than suffer the type of extortion that I am experiencing as a self-employed American.\n\nIn 2015, my husband and I (both of us are self-employed) will pay $733 each month for our \u201cBronze\u201d level health insurance plan. Yes, Bronze is the lowest (and the cheapest) of three levels of Affordable-Care-Act-qualified plans.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nOur family deductible is $11,000. That\u2019s very high. Here\u2019s a reminder of what a deductible is, courtesy of healthcare.gov:\n\nDeductible: The amount you owe for health care services your health insurance or plan covers before your health insurance or plan begins to pay. For example, if your deductible is $1,000, your plan won\u2019t pay anything until you\u2019ve met your $1,000 deductible for covered health care services subject to the deductible. The deductible may not apply to all services.\n\n\n\nBefore the Affordable Care Act, there was an inverse relationship between deductibles and premiums. If you, as an individual, wanted a low premium (say $100 or $200 a month), you chose a high deductible (usually around $10,000) plan. If you wanted a low deductible (like the enviable $1,000 mentioned on healthcare.gov), you paid more for your premiums.\n\nNow the relationship between premiums and deductibles has changed. Because the health care law requires all health insurance plans to meet unnecessarily high standards \u2014 with benefits exceeding what many people want or need \u2014 high-deductible plans also come with high monthly premiums. It\u2019s a bitter pill for the self employed in particular because we also do not have the benefit of buying insurance as a group (where economies of scale and risk pools can lead to more reasonable premiums).\n\n\n\n[SEE: 2014: The Year in Cartoons]\n\nIn other words, individuals who bought their own insurance used to be able to choose to the Motel 6 of plans; now they have to choose a Hilton.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s fairly likely that my husband and I won\u2019t ever meet our $11,000 deductible. We\u2019ll pay the \u201cHilton\u201d price of $733 each month (that\u2019s $8,796 for the year) to comply with a law that forces us to purchase health insurance, but we\u2019ll also pay out-of-pocket for our health-care costs with the exception of a few basics (i.e. an annual physical).\n\nNot a great deal, right? Not \u201caffordable.\u201d And also not a choice. It\u2019s the law. If we chose to go uninsured and pay out of pocket for doctor\u2019s visits and medication, we\u2019d be in violation of federal law. We\u2019d be forced to pay a fine.\n\nPay up or become a lawbreaker. It\u2019s a serious threat, which feels a lot like extortion.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Barack Obama]\n\nI believe in the importance of having insurance, of protecting myself against worst-case-scenarios. It\u2019s why homeowners\u2019 insurance and car insurance make sense. But each of those cost me and my husband less than $1,000 per year.\n\nHealth insurance, of course, isn\u2019t like most insurance. We shouldn\u2019t even call it insurance, honestly. It\u2019s more like a payment plan \u2014 where we give our hard-earned money to a big company so that they can then pay our very personal health care bills (an inherently creepy system if you think about it).\n\nAnd that\u2019s what gold level insurance plans do. They have low or no deductibles, so in exchange for a high monthly premium, your big insurance company will pay for all your medical needs. How lovely \u2014 especially if someone else (your employer or the government) pays your premiums.\n\n\n\n[READ: Was Obamacare a Mistake for Democrats?]\n\nBut those of us in bronze? Not so much. Our payments keep Uncle Sam away; they don\u2019t buy us much else.\n\nThis is what the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate feels like to every self-employed person in America. We\u2019re being forced to buy something that is very expensive \u2014 so expensive that it may not be in our economic best interest to purchase it.
