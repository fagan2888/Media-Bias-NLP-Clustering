NBC chiefs wanted Jon Stewart to host “Meet the Press,” and would have offered him virtually “anything,” a new report reveals.

Before deciding on new host Chuck Todd, NBC News President Deborah Turness held negotiations with Stewart, New York Magazine’s Gabriel Sherman reports.

One source told the magazine that NBC was prepared to offer Comedy Central host Stewart virtually “anything” to bring him over. It quoted the source as saying, “They were ready to back the Brinks truck up.”

Sherman added, “It makes sense that NBC would make a run at Stewart. The comedian-cum-media-critic possesses something that broadcast executives covet: a loyal, young audience … Though not a traditional journalist, Stewart can be a devastatingly effective interrogator, and his ‘Meet the Press’ might have made a worthy successor to Tim Russert’s no-bulls— interviews. During the home stretch of the 2012 campaign, Stewart grilled Obama for his wan presidential debate performance, asking: ‘Do you feel you have a stronger affirmative case for a second Barack Obama presidency or a stronger negative case for a Romney presidency?’ And last October, Stewart’s clinical dissection of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius laid bare the disaster of the Obamacare rollout, from which Sebelius never recovered.”

While NBC did not comment on this report, it explains in some part why they took so long to announce Todd as David Gregory‘s successor in the anchor chair at “Meet the Press.”

This Sunday marks Todd’s one-month anniversary as the moderator, and while he enjoyed good ratings for his exclusive sit-down interview with President Obama in his opening show, the program has settled back into third place behind ABC’s “This Week” and CBS’ “Face The Nation.”
