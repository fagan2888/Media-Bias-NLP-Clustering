(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nEDITOR: Remember when spring\u2019s splendor was marked by the flowering hopa trees? Many of us on the Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification miss this spectacular spring show, so we decided to hold a community tree sale to bring them back.\n\nWe are offering flowering crabapple trees for sale, which will bloom in early spring like the hopa trees. You can purchase these trees for your own yard or for designated areas in our city. These are 6-foot bare root trees for $55 each. They include red splendor, golden raindrops and profusion crabapple.\n\nIf you want to order a tree for yourself or for the community, contact Sue Winch at swinch9@gmail.com or call Sue at 715-213-1747. There are a limited number of trees available, so order yours now. All orders must be in by April 30.\n\nTrees make a wonderful living memorial to people we have loved and lost or to celebrate the birth of a new baby. The hopa trees may be gone, but the hope they represented endures.\n\nSue Winch,\n\nGloria Kubisiak,\n\nMembers of the Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wrtnews.co/1yxTGof", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification holding flowering crabapple tree sale.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Tribune Media", "description": "Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification holding flowering crabapple tree sale.", "title": "Sale aims to bring back splendor or hopa trees", "url": "http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/opinion/2015/04/16/crabapple-tree-sale-beautification-wisconsin-rapids/25867839/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wisconsinrapidstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification holding flowering crabapple tree sale.", "creator": "@wrtribune", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fd0adf6d4f6d89cb108a12342022dd7d94a44364/c=638-0-3193-2555&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/WisconsinRapids/2015/04/16/B9316992958Z.1_20150416085011_000_GJAAGVN9U.1-0.jpg", "title": "Sale aims to bring back splendor or hopa trees", "site": "@wrtribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=885558265", "fb": {"app_id": 132335483492709}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06c9\"", "article_summary": "We are offering flowering crabapple trees for sale, which will bloom in early spring like the hopa trees.\n(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)EDITOR: Remember when spring\u2019s splendor was marked by the flowering hopa trees?\nThe hopa trees may be gone, but the hope they represented endures.\nMany of us on the Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification miss this spectacular spring show, so we decided to hold a community tree sale to bring them back.\nThe Mayor\u2019s Council on Beautification is selling flowering crabapple trees."}
