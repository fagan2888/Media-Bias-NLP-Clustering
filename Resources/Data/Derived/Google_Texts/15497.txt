The Gila County Sheriff's Office announced late Saturday, April 9, that a Tucson woman who had been missing since April 3 on the White Mountain Apache Reservation was found and rescued earlier that evening.

Sheriff J. Adam Shepherd posted on the GCSO Facebook page that Ann Charon Rodgers, 72, was located around 5:45 p.m. in the Canyon Creek area to the west of the reservation.

An Arizona Department of Public Safety helicopter was able to reach her and transport her to a local hospital to be evaluated, Shepherd wrote.

Charon Rodgers went missing on April 3, which is the day the sheriff's office received a call around 8 p.m. from the White Mountain Apache Rangers asking for help to find her. Rescuers believed her travel destination may have been the Phoenix area.
