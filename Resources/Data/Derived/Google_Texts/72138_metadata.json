(Jim Weber/The Commercial Appeal)</p>\n\nWhen the moment arrived, when Jonathan Cole was asked to serve as coach of the varsity soccer team at Sheffield High School, he had two primary reservations about taking the gig.\n\n\u201cI had never coached anything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I knew nothing about soccer.\u201d\n\nOther than that, he was perfect for the job! Perfect, in that he was upright, and breathing, and he worked as an English teacher at Sheffield High.\n\n\u201cThe coach from last year couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d Cole said. \u201cThe team didn\u2019t have a coach. I was told that if I couldn\u2019t do it, we might not have a team.\u201d\n\nSo Cole thought about the offer. He thought about how preposterous it was. It\u2019s not that Cole had never played soccer. It\u2019s just that the last time he played he was nine, and in some youth league, and the coach put him in goal, and Cole got bored because the action was all at the other end of the field, and so he started fiddling with the net, and got his foot caught, and then the play came flying back to his side of the field, and young Cole freed himself just in time to get hit smack in the face by the ball.\n\n\u201cI spent the second half eating oranges,\u201d said Cole. \u201cI was not qualified to be a soccer coach.\u201d\n\nExcept, he knew the kids. He knew them from his English class. He knew they were from Mexico and Senegal and Guinea and Mauritania. He knew they were skilled players, beautiful players, and he knew they needed a team.\n\nSo he said, \u201cYes.\u201d Because what else was he going to say?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I could look at them every day coming into my English class and know that they didn\u2019t have a soccer team because I didn\u2019t want to get off my butt to do something to help them out.\u201d\n\nA teacher story\n\nThis is a story about a teacher. And it begins with a story about another teacher, a decade earlier, doing what the best teachers do.\n\n\u201cShe changed my life,\u201d said Cole, 39. \u201cNow I can\u2019t even remember her name. Miss Edwards? Miss Rogers?\u201d\n\nSee what a thankless job teachers have?\n\nCole had decided to go back to school in his late 20s. He was weary of selling cell phones as his life work. He was going to start a career in music production, but then he stumbled into an English Class at Motlow State Community College, and that was that.\n\n\u201cI loved it,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved the literature in the class. But I really loved the way she taught the literature in the class.\u201d\n\nNext thing you know, Cole was teaching literature himself. And coaching soccer. Because someone had to do it, right?\n\n\u201cI went home and started Googling,\u201d said Cole. \u201cLuckily, soccer doesn\u2019t have a lot of rules.\u201d\n\nFirst challenge: Try-outs. How do you pick the best players if you don\u2019t know anything about the sport?\n\n\u201cThat was awkward,\u201d said Cole. \u201cI wound up picking 26 players, which is a lot more than most teams. But a lot of them would say, `I can only practice these three days, because I have to work or babysit or something else.\u2019\u201d\n\nNext challenge: The first game. It was at St. Benedict.\n\n\u201cWe go over there, and see this beautiful field, and I\u2019m intimidated,\u201d Cole said. \u201cAnd then there was their coach. He looks like a coach, you know? I\u2019m a skinny guy with a big grizzly beard. You look at me and you think, `No. He\u2019s not right. Where did they find this dude?\u2019\u201d\n\nSheffield beat St. Benedict that day, 5-3. Did I mention that the Sheffield kids are skilled?\n\nIndeed, you could make the argument that they deserved a more experienced coach than Cole. Cole says this himself, all the time. But then, they deserved a practice field that wasn\u2019t swamped by water from the school\u2019s air conditioner. They deserved decent soccer balls and cleats.\n\n\u201cI had one player, Abdoulaye Thiam, ask me if I could help him find some cleats,\u201d said Cole. \u201cI said, `What size do you wear?\u2019 He said, `I can wear anything from a size nine to a size 12.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis is life in our stratified America. So many learn to do with less. One of Cole\u2019s buddies, John Beckham, helped out with strategy. Cole\u2019s wife, Meridith, started a GoFundMe campaign to help pay for travel and equipment. But when Sheffield went to Memphis University School the third game of the year and managed a 0-0 tie, Cole started telling the team they could make it to the state playoffs.\n\n\u201cWe were having a dream season,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, honestly, I can\u2019t even think of the words to explain everything that hit us all at once.\u201d\n\nAlpha Diallo, one of the team\u2019s younger players, lost everything in a fire at his family\u2019s apartment.\n\nTwo days later, Dada Dia -- the sister of Ibrahima Dia, one of the team\u2019s star players \u2013 was killed in a car accident on the way to a game.\n\n\u201cWe went straight from the game to The Med,\u201d said Cole. \u201cAs you can imagine, it was devastating.\u201d\n\nAnd here I could tell you that Ibrihimia played in the next game \u2013 the game to qualify for the state tournament -- because that\u2019s what his sister would have wanted. And I could tell you that the team\u2019s inspired run to the state semifinals gave this story the happy ending any screenwriter would require.\n\nBut who knows about the ending of any of this? Who knows what will happen to any of these kids?\n\nThe real happy ending may have unfolded Friday night at Sheffield, when 13 senior soccer players graduated. All of them, in one way or another, thanked Cole for getting off his butt to help out.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you do it,\u201d said Cole, speaking for teachers everywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s not for the money, that\u2019s for sure. Looking back, I made almost twice as much money selling cell phones. But how do you compare that to this?\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s to all the teachers who could be making more money selling cell phones. Here\u2019s to all the Miss Edwards and Miss Rogers out there, quietly and anonymously changing lives. And here\u2019s hoping that on this, the first weekend after the end of school, they are taking a well-deserved break.\n\nAs for Cole?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking of joining an adult soccer league,\u201d he said. \u201cI've got to get better if I\u2019m going to keep doing this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Geoff Calkins: A story about soccer, teachers and getting off your butt", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/columnists/geoff-calkins/geoff-calkins-a-story-about-soccer-teachers-and-getting-off-your-butt-ep-1096523007-324393711.html", "image": {"width": 625, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/0521_masp_fling1_1432403992804_18734741_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "type": "article", "description": "When the moment arrived, when Jonathan Cole was asked to serve as coach of the varsity soccer team at Sheffield High School, he had two primary reservations about taking the gig.", "title": "Geoff Calkins: A story about soccer, teachers and getting off your butt"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/memphisnews", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/0521_masp_fling1_1432403992804_18734741_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "When the moment arrived, when Jonathan Cole was asked to serve as coach of the varsity soccer team at Sheffield High School, he had two primary reservations about taking the gig.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Geoff Calkins: A story about soccer, teachers and getting off your butt"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ca-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The real happy ending may have unfolded Friday night at Sheffield, when 13 senior soccer players graduated.\nAll of them, in one way or another, thanked Cole for getting off his butt to help out.\n\u201cI was not qualified to be a soccer coach.\u201dExcept, he knew the kids.\nHe knew they were skilled players, beautiful players, and he knew they needed a team.\nBut how do you compare that to this?\u201dSo here\u2019s to all the teachers who could be making more money selling cell phones."}
