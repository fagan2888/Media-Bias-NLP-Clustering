She said even though she wasn\u2019t elected, those campaigns were a great learning experience.\n\nThe Riverview seat will be vacated by Coun. Len Isleifson, who plans to run provincially for Brandon East MLA.\n\nHamilton lives in Riverview, and believes she is the right fit for the ward.\n\n\"The question I got at the doorstep was, \u2018Do you live in the ward?\u2019 \u2026 They want somebody local, they want somebody who\u2019s down the street, their neighbour to connect with,\" she said.\n\nOne of the main concerns in the ward is infrastructure \u2014 filling potholes, grading back lanes, drainage issues. Hamilton said there are some safety concerns with narrow streets.\n\nHamilton said it will be important to ensure there are opportunities for residents to voice their concerns, and says regular ward meetings will be of \"utmost importance.\"\n\nKeeping property taxes reasonable will also be a top priority for Hamilton.\n\n\"Property taxes go up so much, then (property owners) have to cut somewhere else,\" she said. \"They have to make decisions \u2014 do I have to cut on healthy food, do I not fill my prescription for a month just to balance the \u2026 budget.\"\n\nWhen it comes to affordable housing, Hamilton said the city needs to pay attention to the amount of resources that go into developing strategies versus taking action.\n\n\"What I find is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money is when we spend a lot of resources \u2026 developing this document, going out and doing focus groups with residents \u2026 and not doing anything about it, and shelving it,\" she said.\n\nHamilton said an issue she would like to bring up around the council table is regulating e-cigarettes.\n\n\"I think the next council needs to look at that and devise a bylaw to protect families and children,\" she said.\n\nProfile of Vanessa Hamilton\n\n\u2022 Age: 41\n\n\u2022 Marital status: Divorced, three children\n\n\u2022 Occupation: Healthy living facilitator with Prairie Mountain Health\n\n\u2022 Quote: \"They may not be at different tables when there's consultations being made, so I just want to make usre that their voices are heard, too!\"\n\n\u00bb jaustin@brandonsun.com\n\n\u00bb Twitter: @jillianaustin", "article_metadata": {"description": "Longtime east end resident Vanessa Hamilton vows to stand up for seniors who \u201cget lost in the ... - Local - Brandon Sun.", "og": {"article": {"author": "Jillian Austin"}, "image": "http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/designimages/squaresun_web+(1).jpg", "title": "Hamilton wants action on affordable housing"}, "twitter": {"domain": "brandonsun.com", "description": "Longtime east end resident Vanessa Hamilton vows to stand up for seniors who \u201cget lost in the shuffle\u201d if she is elected to city council.", "title": "Hamilton wants action on affordable housing", "image": {"src": "http://media.winnipegfreepress.com/designimages/squaresun_web+(1).jpg"}, "site": "@thebrandonsun", "card": "summary"}, "publish-date": "2014-10-18 01:00:00 CDT", "keywords": "Brandon Sun, Local, breaking news, local weather, Local comments, Brandon newspaper, Manitoba, Canada", "google-site-verification": "aC1Kwe8KQoQebztH-UzCg06caQ4uIw3bBZdTxAeNbtY"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdee\"", "article_summary": "When it comes to affordable housing, Hamilton said the city needs to pay attention to the amount of resources that go into developing strategies versus taking action.\n\"They were very concerned that council wasn\u2019t really addressing affordable housing as it could be, and I agree,\" she said.\nLongtime east end resident Vanessa Hamilton vows to stand up for seniors who \"get lost in the shuffle\" if she is elected to city council.\nAs part of her campaign, Hamilton met with members of the Western Manitoba Seniors Non-Profit Housing Co-operative.\nHamilton said an issue she would like to bring up around the council table is regulating e-cigarettes."}
