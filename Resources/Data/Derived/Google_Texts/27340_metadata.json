After a great regular season, the Lions went 1-2 on the day to put an end to their season. (Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nThe Mountain View softball team has made it to the state tournament each of the past six years, and eight of the past 11.\n\nAnd if there were ever a season you could pencil the Mountain Lions into the 4A bracket, this would've been it. MVHS had an incredible regular season, beginning the year 14-0 before finishing 17-2.\n\nBut as coach Randy Felton will tell you, making it through regionals is never easy \u2014 and the Lions found out the hard way Saturday at Barnes Softball Complex.\n\nEverything went according to plan to begin the day for the eighth-seeded Lions, who behind a strong pitching effort by Lilly Meza made quick work of Holy Family with a 4-0 victory.\n\nNeeding just one more win to advance, the Lions fell victim to some tough pitching by Erie's Rio Sanchez and some clutch fielding by Air Academy, as Felton's team dropped a 3-2 contest to the Tigers in the regional title game before suffering a season-ending 7-5 loss to the Kadets.\n\nThe Lions had more than their fair share of bad luck, with several hard-hit balls going for outs in both losses. But they also had their chances, leaving the potential tying run on base in the final at-bat in both surprising defeats.\n\n\"Regionals and state are different seasons than the regular season. Ball falls right, ball gets hit hard,\" Felton said. \"We didn't get all the balls to bounce our way. They got big hits. Both teams beat us. I'm not giving excuses at all. But it's tough. It's tougher to get to state than you think.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a bittersweet end to 2014 for the Lions, specifically for their group of four seniors of Jerhen Montez, Gianna Melaragno, Courtney Baeckel and Taylor Seely. Each has started for the program since they were freshmen \u2014 and none ever imagined this would've been the only year their season ended without a trip to state, especially not after the way the Lions played for much of the season, outscoring opponents by an average of eight runs a game before Saturday.\n\nMountain View's Izzy Griego slides into second base safely as Holy Family's Natalie Gardon tries to tag her out. (Jenny Sparks / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\"I think that's what makes it hurt even more, we were doing so good,\" Seely said. \"We were just dominating over everyone, and we were placed so high in state, so I think that's why everyone is just shocked by it that we didn't pull through today.\"\n\nAfter trailing Erie 1-0 through four innings, Mountain View got the spark it needed in the fifth from freshman Izzy Griego, who hit a home run to center to tie the game. The Loins then took the lead later in the inning on an RBI groundout by Baeckel to score Tara Shadowen.\n\nBut in the next frame, Erie retook the lead for good on a run-scoring double by Sanchez and an RBI single by Katie Kovets.\n\nKendra Seely led off the seventh with a single and advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt by Griego to represent the tying run, but Sanchez was able to retire Shadowen and Melaragno in back-to-back at-bats to send the Lions to a do-or-die game against Air Academy.\n\nThe 24th-seeded Kadets jumped out to an early 4-0 lead in the third thanks to back-to-back home runs by Payton Romines and Julia Elbert. But the Lions answered with three in the bottom half of the third with runs scored by Shadowen, Melaragno and Seely.\n\nMVHS even tied it in the fifth on a run-scoring single by Alyssa McWilliams to score Seely, but the Lions could never take the lead.\n\nWith the teams tied going into the seventh, the Kadets strung together four straight singles to score three and take a three-run lead.\n\nThe Lions again made it interesting in the bottom half of the seventh when Montez hit a one-out double before coming around to score on a hit by McWilliams. MVHS had the tying run on base after a single by Kaley Barker, but Griego was called out on strikes to end it.\n\nAll season the Lions overpowered teams with their balanced, high-powered offense. But against some unfamiliar pitching, their bats weren't nearly as effective. The two runs scored against Erie represented a season-low and the five against Air Academy were a far cry from the 11 they averaged in the regular season.\n\n\"We hit the ball hard today, just when you play better teams like that, they're going to make more defensive plays. Air Academy had really good plays defensively. They deserve that 100 percent,\" Baeckel said. \"Erie, they're just good all around.\n\n\"I just think that we didn't get our hits early enough. It just didn't click for us today. It was like Frederick last year when they didn't even make it to state, and it's us this year. It's just a bummer, especially senior year.\"\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Sports Writer Sean Star at 970-669-5050 ext. 512, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/rhpreps\n\nTigers 3, Mountain Lions 2\n\nAt Barnes Softball Complex\n\nErie\n\n010 002 0 \u2014 3 7 0\n\nMountain View\n\n000 020 0 \u2014 2 5 0\n\nW \u2014 Rio Sanchez.
