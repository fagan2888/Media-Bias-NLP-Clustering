Isn\u2019t that whole \u201cwe have to pass it\u201d mentality, he asks, and the subsequent big rush job to do so on which zero Republicans voted yes, kind of the whole problem behind this gigantic mess right now? And now as a result, the administration and Democrats are running around trying to deal with the consequences, many of which were foreseen by Republicans?\n\nI\u2019m not sure I even understand her answer, but shorter Pelosi: No way.\n\nWhat I was saying there is we are House and the Senate. We get a bill. We go to conference or we ping-pong it, and then you see what the final product is. However, I stand by what I said there. When people see what is in the bill, they will like it. And they will. And so, while there\u2019s a lot of hoop-di-doo and ado about what\u2019s happening now \u2014 very appropriate. I\u2019m not criticizing. I\u2019m saying it took a great deal for us to pass this bill. I said if we go up to the gate and the gate is locked, we\u2019ll unlock the gate. If we can\u2019t do that, we\u2019ll climb the fence. If the fence is too high, we\u2019ll pole vault in. If we can\u2019t do that, we\u2019ll helicopter in, but we\u2019ll get it done. We had to pass the test of the courts, and we did. The first rollout in the first part of the first year of the implementation went very smoothly. The website did not work; that has caused problems complicating people transitioning from those policies to the other. But, again, this is never thought to be easy. And the fact is, it doesn\u2019t matter what we\u2019re saying here: What matters? What happens at the kitchen table of the American people.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Obviously.", "title": "Pelosi: Of course I stand by my \u201cwe have to pass it so you can find out what\u2019s in it\u201d remark", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/18/pelosi-of-course-i-stand-by-my-we-have-to-pass-it-so-you-can-find-out-whats-in-it-remark/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-18T13:41:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-18T15:17:40+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, Congress, House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8ac\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m saying it took a great deal for us to pass this bill.\nI said if we go up to the gate and the gate is locked, we\u2019ll unlock the gate.\nAnd so, while there\u2019s a lot of hoop-di-doo and ado about what\u2019s happening now \u2014 very appropriate.\nI\u2019m not sure I even understand her answer, but shorter Pelosi: No way.\nWe go to conference or we ping-pong it, and then you see what the final product is."}
