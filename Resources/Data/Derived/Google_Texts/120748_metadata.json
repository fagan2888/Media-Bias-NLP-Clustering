Reports that 40 veterans died from preventable conditions at a VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, because they had to wait too long for treatment have raised questions about similar conditions at the 152 VA medical centers across the country.\n\nPresident Barack Obama is professed to be \u201cmadder than hell\u201d about the mistreatment of veterans, an issue he campaigned on during his first run for president. First lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, have also made considerable efforts on behalf of veterans. White House Spokesman Jay Carney said the White House has confidence in Shinseki and the administration is not currently seeking his resignation. \u201cOn the broader issue of accountability, we are of the view that the kinds of allegations that we have seen need to be investigated rigorously \u2026 The investigation needs to continue and needs to be completed, and then we can assess what the facts are,\u201d Carney said. \u201cAnd once we know all the facts, it is absolutely appropriate that accountable individuals ought to be held to account.\u201d\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nRon Christie of the Daily Beast said Obama should be worried by the bipartisan outcry in response to the allegations of mismanagement at the VA. He notes that House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla., sent Obama a letter a year ago asking the president to act in response to the lack of accountability in the VA health care system. \u201cFor a president who seems to have endless amounts of time to talk about the miseries of those living on the minimum wage, Obama\u2019s seeming indifference to the severity of the problems faced by our returning veterans seeking care at VA facilities is shocking,\u201d Christie wrote.\n\nBut Obama isn\u2019t to blame, wrote Matt Lewis of the Daily Caller, because the VA has long experienced a backlog of veteran claims. \u201cThe truth is, this has more to do with problems endemic to very large bureaucracies \u2014 where (due to union contracts) it\u2019s virtually impossible to fire anyone \u2014 than to recent mismanagement,\" he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s high time for Congress to radically rethink how we should be taking care of our veterans, and to radically restructure the V.A.,\u201d Lewis continued. \u201cWith so many facets of big government to manage, things must go dramatically wrong in any given area before our leaders have either the inclination or the political capital necessary to take dramatic steps (such as are now obviously needed).\u201d\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nRepublicans are likely to try investing some of that political captital by making the VA scandal an election issue, and by drawing comparisons with Obamacare, wrote Noah Rothman of Mediaite. \u201cIn a heated election year, and with the added pressure associated with the [Affordable Care Act], Democrats can be forced to go on record opposing much of the excessive bureaucracy, which medical professionals in the VA system are blaming for poor care,\u201d Rothman wrote. \u201cNot only should Republicans make the VA\u2019s problems a campaign issue, they should ignore the disingenuous scolds who will emerge from the woodwork to chide Republicans for daring to criticize the intolerable conditions America\u2019s vets face.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic love of big government hasn\u2019t been enough to fix the problems at the VA that have been around for decades, wrote Jonah Goldberg at National Review's The Corner. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a mess because such messes come with the territory when you put bureaucrats in charge,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCriminality, as alleged, may not be inevitable (though I\u2019m not so sure). But rationing, incompetence, bloat, waste, rent-seeking and a sort of legal corruption certainly are.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Veterans Affairs' Health Care Backlog Causes a Scandal, Commentators React", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "What caused the problems and who can fix them?", "title": "Views You Can Use:&nbsp;Veterans Health Care Backlog Sparks a Scandal", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/05/20/veterans-affairs-health-care-backlog-causes-a-scandal-commentators-react", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c3/5dff9d9fae40239a547e4d975dde69/media:ec89c24600ef497f98051e438b14eca0VeteransMedicalCare.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What caused the problems and who can fix them?", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Veterans Affairs' Health Care Backlog Causes a Scandal, Commentators React"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "May 20, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Teresa Welsh,Obama, Barack,Affordable Care Act,government,politics,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "What caused the problems and who can fix them?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3af3\"", "article_summary": "President Barack Obama is professed to be \u201cmadder than hell\u201d about the mistreatment of veterans, an issue he campaigned on during his first run for president.\nAllegations of delays in care and manipulation of waiting lists at veterans' hospitals across the country have spurred an investigation into the Department of Veterans Affairs and calls for the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.\nFirst lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, have also made considerable efforts on behalf of veterans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s high time for Congress to radically rethink how we should be taking care of our veterans, and to radically restructure the V.A.,\u201d Lewis continued.\nHe notes that House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla., sent Obama a letter a year ago asking the president to act in response to the lack of accountability in the VA health care system."}
