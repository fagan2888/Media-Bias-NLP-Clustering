With almost a year left of campaigning in Georgia's 2014 race to replace retiring Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), Rep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) has tied a heavy promise to his candidacy.

Gingrey released a 30-second video statement on Tuesday, reinvigorating his stance on Obamacare. As an OB-GYN with 26 years of practicing experience, Gingrey touts how as a doctor, he "took an oath to do no harm."

Thanks to the Senate, dozens of attempts to repeal or defund the "harmful" Obamacare law fell through. And that's where Gingrey's new U.S. Senate pledge comes in.

"Iâ€™ll help repeal Obamacare in my first term, or go home, because you deserve a senator who gets the job done or gets out of the way," Gingrey said. "Repeal or go home. That's my pledge to you."

Gingrey's bid to fulfill that pledge is a crowded one. Joining him in hopes of procuring the Republican nomination are fellow Reps. Paul Broun (R-Ga.) and Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, former Dollar General CEO David Perdue and minister Derrick Grayson.

HuffPost Pollster's latest compilation of six publicly available polls showed Gingrey holding a six-point edge over Broun in the primary race.
