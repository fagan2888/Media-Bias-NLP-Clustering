Some experts believe the best way to get fit is to go back to nature and hoist a boulder, jump a stream or climb a rock.\n\nNatural movement is at the heart of MovNat, an international fitness system that reclaims hunter-gatherer skills to achieve strength, flexibility and power.\n\n\u201cOriginally, we humans were all able to run, catch and jump, but then we turned it into specialized sports,\u201d MovNat founder Erwan Le Corre said.\n\nLe Corre bemoaned an exercise culture that limits physical movement to sessions spent manipulating modern machines.\n\n\u201cHow would you train a panther to be fit?\u201d he said. \u201cNot on a treadmill.\u201d\n\nMovNat has certified more than 2,000 trainers worldwide who lead clients on retreats, workshops or online courses. In indoor sessions, they use medicine balls to replace stones and balance beams instead of fallen tree trunks.\n\nLe Corre, a French native who lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico, says people have strayed from their evolutionary abilities and need to be brought back to their own natural movement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a learning curve involved in turning innate abilities into mindful skills,\u201d he said.\n\nKaty Bowman, a Seattle-based biomechanist, crawled, jumped, hoisted and tossed her way through a MovNat workshop earlier this year.\n\n\u201cWe spent significant time just going from being seated to getting up off the ground without using the hands,\u201d said Bowman, author of the book \u201cMove Your DNA.\u201d\n\nThe group practiced balance, throwing and jumping combinations. At the end was a two-hour trek.\n\nBowman said while everyone should be able to do these movements, most people must adapt gradually.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do them sloppily,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want to work towards them in a physiologically intelligent way, the same way you don\u2019t throw on minimal shoes and run 10 miles.\u201d\n\nDr. Derek Ochiai, an orthopedic surgeon specializing in sports medicine, said MovNat appeared to exercise the whole body. He added that even elite athletes can have inefficiencies in muscles groups they do not use in an optimal way.\n\n\u201cI look at this (MovNat) as an extreme form of cross-training,\u201d said Ochiai, of the Nirschl Orthopedic Clinic in Arlington, Virginia.\n\nLe Corre said when it comes to natural movement, no one starts from scratch.\n\n\u201cLook at what kids do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stand and crawl and jump and climb and lift and throw stuff. They don\u2019t do bicep curls.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/08/1003299969-FL_SAR_HFFIT04.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7f3\"", "article_summary": "Le Corre bemoaned an exercise culture that limits physical movement to sessions spent manipulating modern machines.\nSome experts believe the best way to get fit is to go back to nature and hoist a boulder, jump a stream or climb a rock.\nNatural movement is at the heart of MovNat, an international fitness system that reclaims hunter-gatherer skills to achieve strength, flexibility and power.\nKaty Bowman, a Seattle-based biomechanist, crawled, jumped, hoisted and tossed her way through a MovNat workshop earlier this year.\n\u201cOriginally, we humans were all able to run, catch and jump, but then we turned it into specialized sports,\u201d MovNat founder Erwan Le Corre said."}
