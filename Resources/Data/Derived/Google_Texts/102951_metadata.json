The federal share of expansion costs is set to taper to 90 percent by 2020.\n\nFederal funding for traditional Medicaid recipients \u2014 pregnant women, poor families, the disabled and the elderly \u2014 is far less, as high as 74 percent in some states and as low as 50 percent in others.\n\nWesterman estimates that if the feds quit paying extra for Obamacare expansion, $15 billion per year could be added to the Highway Trust Fund and another $150 billion would be saved over a 10-year period.\n\nWhile outside the scope of Westerman\u2019s bill, reforms cutting Highway Trust Fund spending and returning most responsibility for infrastructure to the states would save federal taxpayers even more.\n\nWesterman\u2019s plan would not repeal the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, but would take away a key incentive for states to participate.\n\n\u201cThe enticement premium was put in place to lure states to expand Medicaid,\u201d he said. \u201cCutting the lure off the line will make states think long and hard about expanding their programs or staying in their expansion programs.\u201d\n\nBACKGROUND: Red states still grasping at Obamacare Medicaid cash\n\nCompeting proposals to address Highway Trust Fund shortfalls would do so by increasing taxes. In April, Republican Congressman Jim Renacci introduced a bill that would raise the gas tax.\n\n\u201cWhile it is true that a small group of Republicans have voiced support for raising the gas tax, the reality is that a gas tax just adds more revenue to the largest tax coffer in our history without exercising fiscal responsibility or taking an honest look at our spending priorities,\u201d Westerman said.\n\n\u201cThat is why my bill is a solid alternative to the proposed increase in the gas tax.\u201d\n\nWesterman\u2019s bill would take effect Jan. 1, 2017, if passed, giving states that have embraced Obamacare expansion \u201ctime to find alternatives or leave the expansion altogether,\u201d Westerman said.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s unpopular health insurance law will be taking another big hit if the coming Supreme Court ruling on King v. Burwell shuts down federally run Obamacare exchanges. How might that affect votes on Westerman\u2019s bill?\n\n\u201cI do not believe that King v. Burwell will factor into a lawmaker\u2019s support or opposition to this bill,\u201d Westerman said. \u201cI think it simply comes down to education.\u201d\n\nWesterman said many of the people he talks to about Obamacare expansion don\u2019t realize federal taxpayers are picking up the full cost of Medicaid benefits for able-bodied, working-age, childless adults.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, how might Westerman\u2019s plan to bolster the Highway Trust Fund by reducing the Obamacare expansion\u2019s Federal Medical Assistance Percentage get past Obama\u2019s veto pen?\n\n\u201cThe key is reminding the president and members of his own party that he actually proposed rolling back the FMAP rates before he reversed course,\u201d Westerman said.\n\n\u201cAnd since the president has made the proposal before, I suspect that this legislation would have a good chance of being signed into law should it pass the House and Senate. Plus, he has made it no secret that he would like to see long-term infrastructure funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis would be his opportunity,\u201d Westerman concluded.\n\nThe president is calling on Congress to back his $478 billion six-year infrastructure plan, which would pay for increased spending with a hefty tax on overseas corporate profits.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are Republicans willing to increase taxes or cut infrastructure spending to keep federal taxpayers on the hook for Obamacare expansion?", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Are Republicans willing to increase taxes or cut infrastructure spending to keep federal taxpayers on the hook for Obamacare expansion?", "title": "Obamacare expansion cash could fill huge highway funding gap - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/fhwa-flickr-2013-02-01.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-22T09:36:30+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/219897/obamacare-highway-funding/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Are Republicans willing to increase taxes or cut infrastructure spending to keep federal taxpayers on the hook for Obamacare expansion?", "title": "Obamacare expansion cash could fill huge highway funding gap - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/fhwa-flickr-2013-02-01.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Arkansas", "published_time": "2015-05-21T08:19:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T09:36:30+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "obamacare expansion, medicaid expansion, highway trust fund, bruce westerman, jim renacci, gas tax, infrastructure spending, federal medical assistance percentage"}, "article_summary": "Westerman\u2019s plan would not repeal the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, but would take away a key incentive for states to participate.\nBy Jason Hart | Watchdog.orgAre Republicans willing to increase taxes or cut infrastructure spending to keep federal taxpayers on the hook for Obamacare expansion?\n\u201cI do not believe that King v.
