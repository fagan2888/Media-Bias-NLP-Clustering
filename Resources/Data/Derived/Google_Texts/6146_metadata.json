Dan Lipinski will continue to fight for his position as Democratic Party incumbent for the 3rd Congressional District of Illinois as he faces a new challenger, Sharon Brannigan.\n\nLipinski has served as the district\u2019s representative since 2005, preceded by his father Bill Lipinski.\n\n3rd District Race Results\n\nHe will likely run on a history of fighting for jobs, responsibly reducing the deficit and helping middle-class families.\n\nIn the past, he served on the staff of former Minority Leader Richard Gephardt and taught Political Science at the University of Tennessee and at the University of Notre Dame. He serves on the Transportation and Infrastructure, and Science and Technology House committees.\n\nLipinski\u2019s opponent, Brannigan, currently serves as the Palos Township Trustee and owns a small flower shop in Orland Park with her husband.\n\nBrannigan touts her knowledge of small businesses and creating jobs and the importance of education.\n\nShe also criticizes Lipinski for his votes surrounding ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cIf elected, I will work tirelessly to see that this job-killing legislation be repealed in its entirety,\u201d she said in a statement.\n\nThe 3rd District is among the richest congressional districts in Illinois with a median household income of $56, 579.\n\nIt is unlikely that newcomer Brannigan will see a win in the November elections, especially considering Lipinski\u2019s experience in the seat.\n\nThe Rothenberg Political Report considers Lipinski \"safe\" in the upcoming election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
