By increasing the number of days to three for its ninth annual community health fair, and partnering with a mobile healthcare nonprofit, the city brought in a record number – about 2,500 – of patients over the weekend.

Dr. Nitin Shah, the event’s coordinator, said over the last eight years the fairs have seen from 600 to 1,100 patients a day, so he wasn’t surprised by the record number seen from Friday to Sunday at the Anaheim Convention Center.

“However, partnering with Remote Area Medical, who could provide on-site eye glasses along with increased dental capacity of on-site treatment from 14 chairs to 70 chairs made a difference as well,” he said.

Patient Lizbeth Rivera, who attended Friday, said although it was her first time at one of the fairs, she was getting much more medical care than she expected.

“A friend told me about it,” Rivera said. “Now that I’m here, I am getting a general check up and dental care.”

Organizers also did a lot more advertising this year.

“People tend to come for medical aid that is not necessarily covered in the Affordable Care Act,” Team Leader Coordinator Dipak Patel said. “Most people come for eyeglass exams and dental because it is not covered. However, it is something that everyone needs.”

Other offerings included Pap smears and mammograms for women, physical exams, EKGs, chiropractic services and consultations with surgical specialists.

“All these cares are important,” Patel said, “because it is the middle group that suffers the most.”

A significant number of volunteers helped patients navigate the long lines of tables and sections set up for the various testings and consulations.

“I am volunteering for all three days until 5 p.m.,” Colleen Fleming said. “I am a pre-med student, so I thought that it would be a good idea to help out here.”
