University of the Fraser, CC BY 2.0\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if you could enjoy new music endlessly, without any fear of growing tired of it? You could hear an unfamiliar song, one that carries the perfect thrum or lilt or twang, and hits in all the right places, and your brain would never habituate. If so, you\u2019ll probably be jealous of Mr. B.\n\nThe Story Of Mr. B\n\nMr. B is 59 years old. He\u2019s married, and at one point had a severe case of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Now, whenever he undergoes deep brain stimulation (DBS), the only music he wants to hear is the growling, throaty, raw power of Johnny Cash. And every time he does, it\u2019s as if his brain were hearing it for the first time.\n\nAs the sole subject of a recent study conducted by Dutch researchers, Mr. B\u2019s case could represent the immense hidden power of the brain\u2019s nucleus accumbens \u2014 a region behind your forehead that, when stimulated, could be entirely responsible for controlling Mr. B\u2019s sudden fondness for the man in black.\n\nAccording to the case study, Mr. B suffered from an extreme case of OCD, particularly with a focus on compulsions seeking reassurance and hoarding. On the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive scale, which measures obsessive-compulsive tendencies on a scale of 0 to 40, Mr. B scored a 33. This put him in the \u201cextreme\u201d category \u2014 the highest severity possible. Further tests showed he suffered from moderate clinical anxiety and mild depression. And despite \u201cextensive treatment with pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201csymptoms were still overpowering and Mr. B. remained extremely hindered in daily living.\u201d\n\nThen in 2006, Mr. B underwent a procedure that would change his life, and science, indefinitely. Researchers implanted four electrodes in Mr. B\u2019s brain, the deepest of which sat squarely in the middle of brain, directly in front of a region known as the anterior commissure. Extending sensors ran from pockets beneath his collarbone to a stimulator that would send an electronic signal to targeted parts of Mr. B\u2019s brain.\n\nThe main area they targeted was the nucleus accumbens. An area lodged deep behind your eyes, right where the frontal lobe ends, the nucleus accumbens wears a range of hats. It controls laughter, fear, aggression, reward, impulsivity, and addiction. Prior research has shown that depression and anxiety sufferers can experience dramatic declines in symptoms following DBS in this location. It\u2019s in the nucleus accumbens that feelings of reward, be they with food, sex, or drugs, register most viscerally. Music, it turns out, falls into this group.\n\nMusic In The Brain\n\nIn 2005, scientists discovered that music produces verified feelings of reward, whether we\u2019re actively seeking them or not. Neuroscience has known for some time that music produces some profound effects in the brain, but its effect on our emotions has been less studied. Scientists are just beginning to understand why our brains hear pleasant music, even passively, and regard it as something to seek out in the future \u2014 ultimately, until the brain stops sensing the sounds as rewarding, and the song now seems \u201cplayed out.\u201d\n\nOf course, all this leaves the Dutch scientists studying Mr. B, who can\u2019t stop listening to \u201cFolsom Prison Blues\u201d on repeat, scratching their heads. \u201cThere are two remarkable aspects in this clinical observation that may suggest an association between DBS and changed musical preference,\u201d they note.\n\nThe first is your preference in music tends to gel sometime around age 20. Mr. B is unique because he never listened to Johnny Cash growing up, but by age 60, when his DBS was activated, he couldn\u2019t get enough. (However, the team emphasizes that Mr. B\u2019s obsession was not merely a replacement form of OCD, as he exhibited none of the telltale destructive signs.) The second is that the music never got old. He could listen to Johnny Cash for marathon sessions of music-listening and never tire of \u201cRing of Fire.\u201d\n\n\u201cContrary to our normal experiences where repetitive listening to the same music or song eventually results in a habituation to its rewarding properties, in this case, the Johnny Cash songs never started to annoy the patient and kept the enduring capacities of pleasure and reward.\u201d It was only after the researchers turned off the stimulator that Mr. B\u2019s old tastes resurfaced. The conclusion was clear: The nucleus accumbens was the linchpin.\n\nThe Flames Went Higher\n\nPost-DBS, Mr. B fancied himself by a new name; he was now \u201cMr. B II.\u201d He felt more confident, and his new persona was only emboldened by his new taste in music. This isn\u2019t trivial, the researchers assert. Mr. B II liked Johnny Cash because the emotional boost he got from the DBS also compelled him to seek music from a person he could emulate, someone who seemed to feel equally confident in his art.\n\nThe research is a small, though important (and decidedly quirky) step forward in better understanding how the brain responds to deep brain stimulation, and apparently, to the low-pitched tones of a hobbled rock star with a troubled past.\n\nSource: Mantione M, Figee M, Denys D.
