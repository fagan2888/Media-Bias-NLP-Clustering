Hundreds gathered in Hays Sunday evening to remember the lives of the two men who died in a trench collapse on Tuesday.

"We lost some good people and it's very sad, the families, you watch them and their friends and everyone that knows them, even those of us who didn't know them, it's just a loss," said Hays resident Carol Purdy.

The mood was somber and emotional as families, friends and community members gathered around trench that claimed the lives of James "Jake" Jacobs, 66, and Aaron Pfannenstiel, 44.

Jacobs, and Aaron Pfannenstiel, were repairing a sewer line when the trench collapsed. Both are survived by wives and children in attendance at the vigil.

Loved ones held each other extra close as many took one last look at the scene that created such horrible memories less than a week ago.

"It just hit like somebody said, being punched in the stomach," Purdy said. "It was hard to think of anything but sadness."

A third victim was rescued safely soon after the trench collapsed Tuesday.
