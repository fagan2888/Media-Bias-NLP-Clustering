She pulled him to the side and saw his thumb was purple. Westerby took the boy to the closest emergency room, a center called First Choice. In less than two hours, her son saw a doctor, got an X-ray, and had his fractured thumb put in a splint.\n\nThe ER that Westerby visited is one of 145 independent emergency centers that have opened in Texas since 2010, when the state became the first in the U.S. to license ERs with no hospital affiliation. Unlike traditional emergency rooms, they handle only basic cases that don\u2019t require surgery or overnight stays. \u201cIf I thought I was having a heart attack, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d go there,\u201d Westerby says. \u201cBut for minor injuries, I just feel that the whole process is so much quicker.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was supposed to cut emergency visits by giving more patients access to primary care doctors, but a survey released on May 4 by the American College of Emergency Physicians showed the opposite has happened: Seventy-five percent of ER doctors reported an increase in patients over the past year, in part because there aren\u2019t enough primary care doctors to see newly insured patients.\n\n\u201cLots of my colleagues have said, \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to hang up a shingle and do it my way.\u2019 \u201d Dr. Howard Mell, American College of Emergency Physicians\n\nThat\u2019s good news for companies like Adeptus Health, based in Lewisville, Texas, which owns the First Choice Emergency Room chain. Adeptus has 52 emergency centers in Texas and an additional 12 in Colorado affiliated with the University of Colorado Health system. It\u2019s paying lobbyists in other states, including Arizona and Ohio, to push for regulatory changes that would allow it to open ERs there. The company also has lobbyists in Washington. Since 2012 its patient volume has more than doubled and operating revenue has tripled, to about $211 million. \u201cWhen was the last time you had a good experience in a hospital emergency room?\u201d asks Brooks O\u2019Neil, an analyst at Dougherty & Co., a financial research firm.\n\nOutpatient emergency rooms have been around since the 1970s and were conceived largely as a way for hospitals to provide service to medically underserved areas like poor rural regions. Adeptus and other independent ER operators are inverting that model, catering to wealthy suburban patients who, when they run into medical trouble, don\u2019t want to drive to urban hospitals and wait long hours. By law these ERs can\u2019t accept Medicare and Medicaid, and some insurers don\u2019t cover all their services. Many are owned or staffed by former hospital ER doctors weary of bureaucracy and stressful work environments. \u201cLots of my colleagues have said, \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019m going to hang up a shingle and do it my way,\u2019 \u201d says Dr. Howard Mell, a board-certified emergency physician and spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians.\n\nEmergency centers charge prices comparable to those at hospital ERs, including fees that can run as much as $1,000 just for walking in the door, which they say are necessary to cover the cost of staying open around-the-clock and maintaining expensive diagnostic equipment. According to the Texas Association of Health Plans, a trade group that represents health insurers in the state, a typical bill at a free-standing emergency center is about $1,400, compared with about $200 at urgent-care centers, which generally take insurance but handle only minor emergencies such as sprains and cuts that require stitches. Don Nielsen, director of government relations for the California Nurses Association, which opposes independent emergency centers, calls them \u201ca fraud on the public. They like to be able to charge the high reimbursement rates because it\u2019s \u2018emergency care,\u2019 but in fact it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nFirst Choice centers are open 24 hours a day and staffed by board-certified emergency doctors. They have radiology labs and are equipped to handle basic emergency care, such as setting broken bones or stabilizing patients in cardiac arrest. Patients requiring surgery or advanced care are transported to nearby hospitals for treatment. In Texas, First Choice centers have opened in strip malls.\n\nIn June the National Association of Freestanding Emergency Centers, a newly formed trade group representing the industry, will hold its first national conference in Dallas. It was started by Bradford Shields II, an Austin lobbyist who spearheaded the 2009 push on behalf of independent ERs. He says, \u201cOther states are starting to get very curious and calling to say, \u2018If they can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Lauren Etter", "description": "Private chains lobby to open ERs catering to the well-heeled.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Private chains lobby to open ERs catering to the well-heeled.", "title": "The Texas Approach to Emergency Treatment", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-15/the-texas-approach-to-emergency-treatment", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iaCxlfA47RjU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Private chains lobby to open ERs catering to the well-heeled.", "title": "The Texas Approach to Emergency Treatment", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-15/the-texas-approach-to-emergency-treatment", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iaCxlfA47RjU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "Private chains lobby to open ERs catering to the well-heeled."}, "parsely-title": "The Texas Approach to Emergency Treatment", "parsely-tags": "Texas,Independents,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NOE1826JTSEE01", "parsely-author": "Lauren Etter", "date": "2015-05-15T11:00:02.679Z", "keywords": "Texas,Independents", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Texas,Independents", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-15T11:00:02.679Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iaCxlfA47RjU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-05-15/the-texas-approach-to-emergency-treatment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca28\"", "article_summary": "Adeptus has 52 emergency centers in Texas and an additional 12 in Colorado affiliated with the University of Colorado Health system.\nDon Nielsen, director of government relations for the California Nurses Association, which opposes independent emergency centers, calls them \u201ca fraud on the public.\nIn June the National Association of Freestanding Emergency Centers, a newly formed trade group representing the industry, will hold its first national conference in Dallas.\nIt was started by Bradford Shields II, an Austin lobbyist who spearheaded the 2009 push on behalf of independent ERs.\n\u201cWhen was the last time you had a good experience in a hospital emergency room?\u201d asks Brooks O\u2019Neil, an analyst at Dougherty & Co., a financial research firm."}
