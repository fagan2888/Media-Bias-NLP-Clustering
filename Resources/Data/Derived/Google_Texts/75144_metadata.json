Then just wait to see what damage a GOP Senate will do, especially when it comes to climate change.\n\nWell before the midterms, a weary conventional wisdom set in: This is a \u201cSeinfeld election\u201d\u2014an election, like the hit comedy, \u201cabout nothing.\u201d If, as expected, Republicans take control of the Senate, they will try to repeal Obamacare and pass a string of other outlandish bills, all of which President Obama will veto. Or they might block some judgeships but work with the president in a few areas in order to build an agenda to run on in 2016. In other words, we\u2019re told, this election is No Biggie.\n\nThis analysis, which you will hear again tonight on all the networks, ignores the ferocious radicalism of today\u2019s Republican Party. As majority leader, Mitch McConnell might want to cut deals, but he will be dealing with a GOP caucus in the Senate that increasingly resembles the one John Boehner must contend with in the House, not to mention a base that has derailed several attempts to present a more moderate agenda on issues ranging from taxes to immigration.\n\nThe biggest impact of a GOP takeover will be on appointments. Many Obama administration sub-Cabinet positions (e.g. Surgeon General) have gone unfilled because of GOP opposition. Now many will likely remain vacant for another two years. Republicans don\u2019t care. They hate government (except when it gives them a paycheck) and making it run worse just helps them convince the public that Democrats are incompetent.\n\nThe federal bench will be harmed by dozens of vacancies going unfilled, causing a case backlog. Meanwhile, none other than Sen. Ted Cruz is slated to become chairman of the subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee responsible for constitutional rights. Imagine the hearings he will hold. With any luck, the press won\u2019t cover them, but don\u2019t hold your breath.\n\nShould Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (a cancer survivor) or one of the other justices have to step down, all hell would break loose. Republicans would likely block any Obama nominee to the high court, especially for one of the conservative seats, leaving a 4-4 partisan split until early 2017, meaning that important cases would go undecided. Talk about gridlock.\n\nThe worst effect of a Republican takeover would be on the environment. The climate-change denial caucus would likely grow larger and more radical. Take Joni Ernst, a GOP darling now favored to be the next senator from Iowa. Ernst, best known for castrating pigs, doesn\u2019t just want to ease environmental regulation; she favors abolishing the EPA altogether. That\u2019s right\u2014get rid of the agency created under Richard Nixon that has cleaned up the nation\u2019s water and air. And if you think moderate Republicans are shunning her, consider that former President George H.W. Bush has been called in to help her campaign.\n\nModerates and independent voters in states like Iowa, Colorado, and North Carolina who cast their ballots for Republican candidates for the Senate should know that they are contributing greatly to the ascendancy of climate-change denial\u2014a generation of politicians dedicated to burying their heads in the sand.\n\nThe ostrich-in-chief\u2014and proud of it\u2014is a former mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma, who once compared the director of the EPA to Tokyo Rose and the agency to the Gestapo. If Republicans win the Senate on Tuesday, Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, now in his fourth term, is set to become the next chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, a position he held from 2003 to 2007, when the Republicans last held control. He will make it his business to carry water for the fossil-fuel industry, smear climate scientists, and do everything else in his considerable power to prevent the country and the world from confronting the slow motion crisis of climate change.\n\nInhofe is not just a climate-change denier; he is a warrior for corporate-funded half-truths and outright lies. While McConnell and other Republican candidates this year have adopted the mantra, \u201cI\u2019m not a scientist\u201d to dodge pesky climate-change questions, Inhofe charges ahead with an Orwellian argument.\n\nIn his 2012 book, The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future, Inhofe explains how he is a prophet without honor in his time. \u201cFirst I stood alone in saying that anthropogenic [manmade] catastrophic global warming is a hoax,\u201d he writes, launching into an attack on Al Gore. \u201cNow Gore stands alone in his dismissal of reform, openness, transparency and peer-review to ensure good science.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty good encapsulation of how Inhofe will run his committee if the GOP takes control and he succeeds Sen. Barbara Boxer as chairman. Notice how he says it is Gore who rejects \u201copenness\u201d and \u201cpeer review.\u201d It\u2019s the old I\u2019m-rubber-you\u2019re-glue approach. A reader commenting on Amazon put it this way: \u201cWhere are the publications in Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Nobel Prizes in chemistry or physics? None. Zero. Nada. Absolutely nothing. Oldest trick in the bully book: Call the others a hoax so that the bully\u2019s hoax goes unnoticed. This \u2018book\u2019 is a hoax.\u201d\n\nOf course pointing this out won\u2019t stop Inhofe, who will use the gavel to pound away at environmentalists as if they\u2014not the climate-change deniers\u2014are the ones abusing science.\n\nIn the time since Inhofe was last chairman, the deniers received a gift from the gods in the form of what they predictably call \u201cClimategate.\u201d This was a scandal involving the disclosure of emails and documents at the Climate Research Unit at Britain\u2019s East Anglia University that suggest a couple of bad apples among the tens of thousands of scientists who believe climate change is real\u2014scientists who ignored or twisted some data.\n\nInhofe will use his large megaphone to try to convince the world these this 2009 incident is proof of \u201cthe greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American public.\u201d The world\u2019s most eminent climate scientists, who all believe climate change is real, are, according to Inhofe, \u201cin it for the money\u201d and apparently part of the vast conspiracy that he says he will devote the rest of his days to exposing.\n\nActually, Inhofe does a few other things in the Senate, too, like pushing for federal disaster relief funds for the residents of Moore, Oklahoma, which was devastated by a 2013 tornado, while voting to deny such funds for the victims of Hurricane Sandy. Inhofe said the two disasters were different because the hurricane drew so many moochers.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Bush was in the White House and Inhofe reserved most of his barbs for Democrats and the press. In January, if the GOP wins Senate control, he will go after Obama and the EPA with a vengeance.\n\nThe first goal will be to reverse Obama\u2019s recently announced regulation of carbon emissions from coal-fired plants. With the help of McConnell, who is expected to be re-elected in large part on the coal issue despite his continued unpopularity in Kentucky, Republicans could attach a repeal of the rule to the so-called Continuing Resolution.\n\nThat\u2019s the bill\u2014up for consideration either in December or sometime next year\u2014required to keep the government open. If Inhofe and the climate-change deniers have their way, they will force Obama to veto that bill, then blame him for forcing a government shutdown. The resulting negotiation, they hope, would gut the EPA regulation.\n\nInhofe has a record of recklessness that shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. After he landed a private plane at a closed Texas airfield in 2010 and almost killed a group of construction workers, the airport manager was quoted as saying, \u201cI\u2019ve got over 50 years flying, three tours of Vietnam, and I can assure you I have never seen such a reckless disregard for human life in my life. Something needs to be done. This guy is famous for these violations.\u201d\n\nOne advantage of Inhofe taking the gavel is that he might have to start playing defense. We got an indication of that last July when Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse schooled him in a floor debate after Inhofe and other Republicans blocked a resolution declaring that climate change is real. Whitehouse noted that Inhofe charged that government agencies had been \u201ccolluding\u201d to peddle climate-change threats.\n\nDid this include NASA, the U.S. Navy and the National Weather Service? Was Inhofe suggesting we shouldn\u2019t trust those agencies with the lives of astronauts and sailors, or that we should disbelieve weather forecasts? Was he suggesting that Wal-Mart, Pepsi, Mars, Google, Apple and the entire property and casualty insurance business were in on a big lie? Whitehouse concluded by citing surveys showing that even young Republicans believed that only people who were ignorant, out of touch, or crazy rejected climate science.\n\n\n\nHistorians looking back 100 years from now to the early 21th century are likely to conclude the same thing as they chronicle the biggest story of our time: How the United States and other great nations fiddled while the world burned.\n\nOn Sunday, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2014reflecting a consensus of global scientists\u2014issued another dire report, this one warning that temperatures in many regions could grow so hot that it will become difficult for large percentages of the world\u2019s population to work or play outdoors during the hot months of the year. The report repeated warnings of catastrophic food shortages, refugee crises, major cities and even entire countries left underwater by flooding, and mass extinction of plants and animals.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jonathanalter"}, "keywords": "Google, U.S. News,", "publicationDate": 201411041055, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Google, US News", "pageNum": 1, "title": "If You Think D.C.
