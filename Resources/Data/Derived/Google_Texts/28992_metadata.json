Gibson claimed that, after being diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2009 and given just a few weeks to live, she withdrew from chemotherapy and beat the cancer with the help of \u201chealing foods.\u201d She told reporters that she believed her health issues \u2014 which she said also included subsequent diagnoses for cancers of the liver, uterus, spleen, and blood \u2014 stemmed from a bad reaction she had to Gardasil, the vaccine that protects against cervical cancer.\n\nGibson amassed somewhat of a social media empire. Over the past several years, she has gained hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, designed a popular recipe app that was selected to be one of the first few apps featured on the Apple Watch, and landed several book deals. The December 2014 issue of ELLE Australia dubbed Gibson \u201cThe Most Inspiring Woman You\u2019ve Met This Year.\u201d Her cookbook, Whole Pantry, was set to be released in the U.S. and U.K. this month.\n\nBut when an Australian newspaper started calling Gibson\u2019s medical history into question, her story quickly unraveled. First, she claimed she had been misdiagnosed with liver, uterus, spleen, and blood cancers, but maintained that she definitely had terminal brain cancer at one point. Then, she suggested her brain cancer diagnosis was perhaps a medical error. Eventually, she admitted that none of it was true, and said her \u201ctroubled childhood\u201d may have led her to lie about her condition.\n\nThe publishing company that sold Whole Pantry, Penguin Books, has acknowledged that it didn\u2019t fully fact check Gibson\u2019s medical history and has moved to pull her cookbook from the shelves. Apple has also removed her app from the Apple Watch showcase.\n\nBelle Gibson\u2019s cookbook CREDIT: Penguin Books\n\nControversy has swirled around Gibson\u2019s unconventional ideas about cancer for quite some time. Before her admission this week, however, she maintained that her critics were being unfair to her. \u201cIt is unfortunate someone [is] trying to discredit the natural healing path I am on,\u201d she posted on Facebook in 2013. \u201cI have been healing a severe and malignant brain cancer for the past few years with natural medicine, Gerson therapy and foods. It is working for me.\u201d\n\nGibson has also previously said that she feels a connection with Apple founder Steve Jobs, who delayed conventional cancer treatment while he pursued unproven alternative remedies \u2014 including a vegan diet, acupuncture, and herbal remedies \u2014 before eventually having surgery. Jobs succumbed to pancreatic cancer in 2011.\n\nThe unfolding drama over Gibson\u2019s deception comes amid a larger conversation about where to draw the line between \u201ctraditional\u201d medicine and alternative treatments, and who deserves a platform to spread health information \u2014 especially if that information runs counter to what scientists and doctors advocate.\n\nOn the same day as Gibson\u2019s confessional interview with Australian Women\u2019s Weekly will hit newsstands, popular celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, whose TV show draws millions of viewers each day, will air a special episode of his show to respond to his critics. Dr. Oz has recently come under considerable fire from doctors, academics, and members of Congress for promoting ineffective natural health remedies that aren\u2019t grounded in scientific evidence. He maintains, however, that medical professionals need the space to explore alternative treatments that may effectively complement Western medicine.\n\n\u201cI believe unconventional approaches appear to work in some people\u2019s lives,\u201d Oz writes in an op-ed published on TIME on Thursday. \u201cThey are often based on long-standing traditions from different cultures that visualize the healing process in very different ways from our Western traditions. They are aimed at chronic conditions like lack of energy, fogginess, or moodiness \u2014 which are frequently overlooked or under-treated by conventional practitioners.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a framework that appeals to a growing number of people. Alternative medicine, a category that includes nutritional supplements often touted as \u201cnatural systems of healing,\u201d are increasingly popular among the American public, despite the fact that there isn\u2019t persuasive evidence that many of those remedies are effective.\n\nMedical experts are generally open to new therapies that have been proven to work. But many doctors worry about the potentially negative effects of Americans embracing alternative medicine: Since its products and practitioners are not as tightly regulated as \u201ctraditional\u201d medicine, there\u2019s a greater chance that people will get misled by potential misinformation. Health care is an area that\u2019s already well primed for this dynamic. Misinformation about health issues is widespread, and about half of the U.S. population subscribes to at least one medical conspiracy theory.\n\nAnd when it comes to cancer, of course, the stakes are particularly high.\n\nIn its exclusive interview, Australian Women\u2019s Weekly reports that Belle Gibson was emotional throughout the conversation about her faked medical history. \u201cShe says she is passionate about avoiding gluten, dairy and coffee, but doesn\u2019t really understand how cancer works,\u201d the article notes.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A popular wellness blogger's holistic living brand was based on a lie.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A popular wellness blogger's holistic living brand was based on a lie.", "title": "Health Blogger Who Claimed Veggie-Filled Diet Cured Her Cancer Admits She Never Had Cancer", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/04/23/3650275/health-blogger-cancer-diet/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_145891655.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A popular wellness blogger's holistic living brand was based on a lie.", "title": "Health Blogger Who Claimed Veggie-Filled Diet Cured Her Cancer Admits She Never Had Cancer", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_145891655-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_145891655.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shutterstock_145891655.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-23T10:03:53+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Health Blogger Who Claimed Veggie-Filled Diet Cured Her Cancer Admits She Never Had Cancer CREDIT: ShutterstockA popular Australian wellness blogger who rose to fame after claiming she overcome several different types of cancer with a healthy lifestyle alone is now acknowledging that her career is built on a false premise, and she never had cancer in the first place.\nDr. Oz has recently come under considerable fire from doctors, academics, and members of Congress for promoting ineffective natural health remedies that aren\u2019t grounded in scientific evidence.\n\u201cIt is unfortunate someone [is] trying to discredit the natural healing path I am on,\u201d she posted on Facebook in 2013.\nBut when an Australian newspaper started calling Gibson\u2019s medical history into question, her story quickly unraveled.\n\u201cI have been healing a severe and malignant brain cancer for the past few years with natural medicine, Gerson therapy and foods."}
