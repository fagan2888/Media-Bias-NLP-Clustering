Now, with HealthCare.gov finally working, his administration and outside supporters are racing to meet their goal of signing up seven million people by March 31. By the end of January, nearly 3.3 million people had enrolled. To the canvassers, at least, the original goal seems a long way off.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t sweat the small stuff, not in this biz,\u201d Ms. Morwin said, after retreating from a run-down rental property on a modest street lined with palm trees in Hollywood, where she was once again informed that the person on her list no longer lived there. \u201cYou see the challenges I have?\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe canvassers\u2019 lists are derived from data created at Enroll America\u2019s offices in Washington by some of the same computer programmers who churned out the statistical models for Mr. Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns. Using commercially available information, the data experts generate lists of people with rankings that indicate their likelihood of needing health insurance. The typical uninsured is younger, male and either low-income or unemployed.\n\nPeople are scored from zero to 100, with those at the top most likely to be uninsured. By using an uninsured score of just 20 or higher, Planned Parenthood is casting a wider net to improve the chance that its door-knockers find people without insurance. In Broward County, home to 1.39 million people, the Enroll America data lists 284,000 such targets between the ages of 18 and 45.\n\nIn Florida, Planned Parenthood has turned the data into \u201cheat maps\u201d of the uninsured, with neighborhoods colored in varying intensities of red to indicate where most of the targets live.\n\n\u201cI like to think about it as a compass,\u201d said Matt Saniie, Enroll America\u2019s data specialist and a former member of Mr. Obama\u2019s re-election team. \u201cIt gives you a direction.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut on the ground, Mr. Saniie\u2019s lists are far from perfect and offer the canvassers little more than a rough road map. There are no signs in front yards that proclaim, \u201cI don\u2019t have health insurance.\u201d Some people were embarrassed and unwilling to admit they were not covered.\n\nOthers approached by the canvassers were immediately suspicious.\n\n\u201cWhy do you have my name?\u201d asked one woman in a house on Polk Street in Hollywood.\n\nBut the canvassers said that some of the uninsured were eager to sign up.\n\nAfter more than an hour canvassing Hollywood for Planned Parenthood, Alberonick Valsaint, 42, had yet to sign up anyone for health insurance. But then he approached a small three-room house where Yersson Llabreras, 35, was putting on his McDonald\u2019s uniform and getting ready for work.\n\nMr. Llabreras said that his 9-year-old son was asthmatic and that he had tried in vain late last year to sign up for coverage on the government\u2019s health care website. \u201cFor real, we need it,\u201d he said.\n\nSo for more than half an hour, Mr. Valsaint walked Mr. Llabreras through the process of creating an account on HealthCare.gov so he could select an insurance plan. When Mr. Llabreras had to leave for his job, Mr. Valsaint continued with Mr. Llabreras\u2019s wife, Diana Camacho, who took a break from \u201cCaso Cerrado,\u201d a popular Spanish-language show similar to \u201cThe People\u2019s Court.\u201d The family of four is now on its way to getting health insurance.\n\nContribute to Our Reporting The Times would like to hear from Americans who have signed up for health care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe day before, Ms. Morwin, the canvasser for Planned Parenthood, met Francisco Padilla, 42, in a mobile home park. Mr. Padilla\u2019s job as a forklift mechanic pays $375 a week but does not offer health insurance. Married with three children, Mr. Padilla had tried to sign up on HealthCare.gov, with no success.\n\n\u201cThey told me I qualify for Medicaid, but I\u2019ve been trying, trying, trying, nothing,\u201d he told Ms. Morwin, who took his name and telephone number and promised that someone from Planned Parenthood would follow up.\n\nBy the end of her shift, Ms. Morwin had knocked on 115 doors and talked to 16 people about enrolling. Not one of them signed up.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn some cases, problems with the health care website are still frustrating the canvassers\u2019 best efforts.\n\nRyanbo Morales, 27, a Planned Parenthood worker and a former campaign volunteer for Mr. Obama, searched for the uninsured one recent day with the same zeal he brought to looking for voters during the president\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign. But when he finally found Chrystal Rhodes, 24, who said she did not work enough hours at JetBlue to qualify for its health insurance, his efforts to help her sign up on his Samsung tablet were stymied when she kept getting an enrollment error.\n\n\u201cThis is really unfortunate,\u201d Mr. Morales said.\n\nCanvassers attend brief orientation sessions before they head out. In Florida, a team of Enroll America workers recently held one in Judy Cloutier\u2019s home in Boynton Beach. \u201cSpeak in plain terms, don\u2019t get too complicated,\u201d Florence French, 49, an organizer, told the group.\n\nNear the end of the day, Jack Laplanche, 63, one of the canvassers, found Lafortune Louis, 56, a Haitian immigrant who hurt his back in 2007 and lost his job laying underground pipes. He and his family have not had insurance since.\n\n\u201cIf you get someone coming to your door, it really helps you,\u201d Mr. Louis told Mr. Laplanche as he signed up for an enrollment event in Delray Beach.\n\nNicholas Duran, Enroll America\u2019s Florida director, said his group plans to be even more aggressive before the March 31 deadline.\n\n\u201cThe intensity is definitely ramping up,\u201d he said, comparing the efforts to reach the uninsured to candidates\u2019 efforts to reach voters. \u201cThey are going to hear from us multiple times between now and the end of March until they tell us they have insurance. It\u2019s just like a campaign.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ad-sponsor": "Canvasser", "tone": "news", "ptime": 20140218211907, "twitter": {"description": "Canvassers deployed by groups supporting the Affordable Care Act are searching door to door for people who lack health coverage, with little success.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Vote-Getting Tactics Struggle to Find the Uninsured", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/us/proven-models-break-down-in-search-for-the-uninsured.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002701207"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "shearm", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/19/us/JP-CANVASS/JP-CANVASS-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/us/proven-models-break-down-in-search-for-the-uninsured.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002701207", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/19/us/proven-models-break-down-in-search-for-the-uninsured.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "hdl_p": "Obama\u2019s Vote-Getting Tactics Struggle to Find the Uninsured", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 18, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Enroll America", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Obama  Barack,Planned Parenthood Federation of America,HealthCare.gov,Medicare,Canvasser,Enroll America", "news_keywords": "HealthCare.gov,Medicare", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael D.
