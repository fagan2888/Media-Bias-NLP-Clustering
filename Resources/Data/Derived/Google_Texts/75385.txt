The Senate Special Committee on Aging will depose the CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals next week, rather than begin proceedings to hold him in contempt today.

Valeant CEO Michael Pearson will attend a deposition on Monday, Sens. Susan Susan Collins (R-Maine.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), the committee’s leaders, said today in a joint statement. The two had scheduled a business meeting for today to consider opening contempt proceedings against Pearson after he did not attend a deposition he had been subpoenaed for last week.

“The deposition has been scheduled for Monday April 18th and we look forward to hearing Mr. Pearson’s testimony,” they said in a joint statement. “This deposition and investigation are about better understanding the dramatic price increases we’re seeing for decades old prescription drugs and how those prices are affecting consumers—and we’re committed to being thorough in that pursuit.”

Pearson has also been subpoenaed to appear for a hearing before the full committee on April 27.
