It\u2019s hard to out-eeyore the big A, but when I\u2019m beat, I\u2019m man enough to admit it. Well played, Sean Trende. Very well played.\n\nHe\u2019s not saying it\u2019s likely to happen, mind you, just that there\u2019s a slim but not insignificant chance. His point is that, while it may seem like this year\u2019s Senate races don\u2019t matter \u2014 Obama will still be in the White House next year and Republicans will still control the House, so nothing\u2019s getting passed either way \u2014 they matter a lot in determining who\u2019ll control Congress when a new president\u2019s inaugurated in 2017. The Democrats have a bunch of weak incumbents in purplish states up for reelection this year and they\u2019ll have a bunch more in 2018. But in 2016 it\u2019s Republicans who\u2019ll be playing defense in Senate battlegrounds, an especially dangerous prospect given that turnout is always higher in a presidential election year and there are more registered Democratic voters nationally than Republican ones. As such, it\u2019s highly likely that the GOP will lose seats in 2016, says Trende, just as it\u2019s highly likely that they\u2019ll win some this year. The money question is whether they can win enough in 2014 to ensure that they\u2019ll still control the chamber after shedding a few seats two years from now.\n\nHow many constitutes \u201cenough\u201d? Well, after running several thousand simulations of the 2016 Senate elections, Trende finds it\u2019s more likely than not that Democrats will win four seats that year. Which means, to give themselves a fair shot at holding the chamber into 2017, the GOP would need to win 10 seats this year, creating a temporary 55/45 advantage. Is that possible? Actually, yes \u2014 depending upon how dismal Obama\u2019s job approval is this November. If it\u2019s still stuck in the 40-43 percent range, a Democratic bloodbath on election day is a distinct possibility. And what if O\u2019s job approval rebounds and the GOP performs much worse than expected? Then it\u2019s \u2026 hard-liquor time:\n\nThe 2016 Senate landscape is so difficult for Republicans that, even if they win eight (eight!) seats this year and do well enough in 2016 to recapture the White House, Trende still thinks it\u2019s more likely than not that the Dems will retake the Senate two years from now. Meanwhile, if the GOP underperforms this year and wins only, say, three seats, then not only is it virtually certain that Democrats will retake the Senate in 2016 but they\u2019ll have a very outside chance of getting to 60 \u2014 a filibuster-proof majority,. How\u2019s that for tonight\u2019s nightmare fuel? President Hillary plus a Reid-led Senate that can rubber-stamp any Supreme Court nominee she wants. Dude, I\u2019m nervous.\n\nOne big question, though: How likely is it that the filibuster will still exist in 2016, regardless of which party controls the Senate? If Democrats hold the chamber this year and a SCOTUS vacancy opens up next year, Reid will nuke a bit more of the filibuster and confirm the nominee with a simple majority. If the next president comes from the same party that controls the Senate in 2016, it\u2019s a cinch that the majority leader will nuke the rest of the filibuster by eliminating the 60-vote threshold for cloture on legislation too. A \u201cfilibuster-proof majority\u201d won\u2019t matter soon; to the extent it does, it only means that Reid wouldn\u2019t need to nuke the rest of the filibuster to pass Hillary\u2019s agenda. But he\u2019ll do it eventually, or the new GOP majority leader will. The reason to worry about Senate seats beyond the 51-vote threshold needed for control is, of course, because it gives you a margin for error. If Republicans end up with 51 next year, that\u2019s nice, but no one thinks Collins, Murkowski, Kirk, and the rest of the RINO nucleus will hold the line against an Obama Supreme Court nominee. Fifty-one is important for keeping Democratic bills off the floor, but to make the majority RINO-proof, you need something in the mid-50s so you don\u2019t have to worry about RINOs voting against you. Which is why even conservatives disgusted with the party leadership, especially on amnesty, will be sorely tempted to turn out this year.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Dude?", "title": "Coming in 2016: Another filibuster-proof Democratic majority in the Senate?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/23/coming-in-2016-another-filibuster-proof-democratic-majority-in-the-senate/", "image": {"width": 515, "identifier": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/st.jpg", "height": 257}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-23T21:41:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-23T20:32:12+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, Democrats, filibuster, Harry Reid, Sean Trende, Senate,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3de5\"", "article_summary": "Coming in 2016: Another filibuster-proof Democratic majority in the Senate?\nThen it\u2019s \u2026 hard-liquor time:The 2016 Senate landscape is so difficult for Republicans that, even if they win eight (eight!)\nThe reason to worry about Senate seats beyond the 51-vote threshold needed for control is, of course, because it gives you a margin for error.\nBut he\u2019ll do it eventually, or the new GOP majority leader will.\nWell, after running several thousand simulations of the 2016 Senate elections, Trende finds it\u2019s more likely than not that Democrats will win four seats that year."}
