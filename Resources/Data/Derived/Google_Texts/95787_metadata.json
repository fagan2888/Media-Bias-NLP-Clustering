Video by Ernie Garcia/The Journal News\n\nALBANY - Bank-owned, foreclosed properties in Westchester, Dutchess and Putnam counties have decreased property values by $2 million in the region, according to a new report.\n\nThe report by the Senate Independent Democratic Conference and Sen. Terrence Murphy, R-Yorktown, examines zombie and bank-owned properties in the 40th Senate District, which Murphy represents and includes parts of Westchester, Dutchess and Putnam counties.\n\nDATABASE: Lower Hudson Valley real estate transactions\n\nMOUNT VERNON: Zombie lots could become pocket parks\n\nMORE: 'Zombie' homes still haunting local communities\n\nVIDEO: Mt. Vernon urged 'zombie' home owner to act for years\n\nWithin the district, there were 49 bank-owned properties as well as 91 zombie properties, which are abandoned properties not yet foreclosed upon by banks. Overall, in Dutchess and Putnam counties, the report contends that zombie properties contributed to a decline of $3.3 million in property values.\n\nBuy Photo The foreclosed home at 69 Springbrook Rd in Nanuet on June 16, 2014.

Jeff Klein, D-Bronx, who covers parts of lower Westchester, said. \u201cUnfortunately, even towns and villages outside of [New York City] are also footing the bill and forcing homeowners to lose property value because of foreclosure prices,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nThe conference then issued its first report in a series titled, \u201cThe Next American Bank Robbery,\u201d which looked at issues arising from zombie and bank-owned properties in Westchester County.The IDC first looked at problems arising from zombie and bank-owned properties in New York City.\n\nThe second report in the series specifically looks at Murphy\u2019s district and is slated to be released Monday at a press conference in Carmel, Putnam County. Klein heads the IDC, which has a working relationship with Senate Republicans. Murphy is a freshman Republican senator seeking a second term in November.\n\nThe examination of property values is intended to see if banks are following a 2009 law sponsored by Klein that requires banks to maintain foreclosed properties.\n\nBut banks are still not tending to the foreclosed properties they own, Klein charged.\n\nIndependent Democratic Conference Leader Jeff Klein, D-Bronx, listens as Senate Majority Leader John Flanagan, R-Smithtown, talks to media members outside Gov.

The properties are located in Brewster, Carmel, Mahopac and Patterson and resulted in surrounding property value to drop by $367,888, according to the report.\n\nIn Murphy\u2019s portion of Westchester, there are 15 bank-owned properties decreasing the value of surrounding properties by $464,939. The properties are in Mount Kisco, Peekskill, Cortlandt, Tarrytown and Yorktown Heights.\n\nThe analysis showed that 177 privately owned homes within a 300-foot radius of a bank-owned property in Murphy\u2019s Senate district saw a depreciation of $846,033.\n\nDutchess County has seven zombie properties all located in Pawling resulting in $30,814 in property value depreciation.\n\nThese zombie properties located in Murphy\u2019s Senate district resulted in a total property value deprecation of $1.38 million in the district and a $2.6 million drop in property values throughout Dutchess County.\n\nBuy Photo The former home of ex- basketball player Latrell Sprewell which in is the middle of a long foreclosure at 4340 Purchase Street in Harrison on June 16, 2014. (Photo: Ricky Flores/The Journal News)\n\nTo further ensure banks take care of foreclosed properties, the IDC and Murphy are recommending the state Department of Financial Services create a registry of bank owned-properties to share with municipalities as well as with non-government entities through Freedom of Information Law requests.\n\nThey also recommend that the attorney general should be able to impose fines of up to $1,000 if banks fail to maintain properties.\n\nThe IDC and Murphy also propose the creation of a community reinvestment program, financed from the fines issued to banks, to allow mortgage holders to refinance their mortgages to keep them in their properties.\n\nThe money would also be used to acquire properties from federal distressed asset stabilization programs and convert them to affordable housing.\n\nAs for zombie properties, the IDC and Murphy are urging the state Legislature to pass Klein\u2019s zombie property legislation, which would require all banks and loan servicing companies to maintain properties as soon as they are discovered abandoned.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s happening is banks clearly don\u2019t want to completely foreclose because they know they\u2019re going to be responsible to maintain these properties,\u201d Klein explained. \u201cI think they don\u2019t actually foreclose as quickly as they should and they turn these properties into zombie properties.\u201d\n\nThe bill would also create a registry of zombie properties and a hotline for community members to report any properties they believe to be abandoned to the attorney general.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/26H6uWS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Bank-owned, foreclosed properties have decreased property values locally by $2 million.", "og": {"site_name": "lohud.com", "description": "Bank-owned, foreclosed properties have decreased property values locally by $2 million.", "title": "Report: 'Zombie' homes drop property values $2M", "url": "http://www.lohud.com/story/news/politics/politics-on-the-hudson/2016/05/01/report-shows-impact-zombie-homes/83709698/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lohud.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bank-owned, foreclosed properties have decreased property values locally by $2 million.", "title": "Report: 'Zombie' homes drop property values $2M", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d510585b587ebcf1cb6d6102efa1331cb66606dc/c=172-0-854-682&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Westchester/Westchester/2014/07/10/1405018405000-TJN-0621-ZOMBIEHOMES-SECONDARY.jpg", "creator": "@lohud", "site": "@lohud", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600070416", "fb": {"app_id": 169889109713077}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "westchester zombie homes, westchester housing, rockland zombie homes, rockland housing, lower hudson valley real estate, westchester real estate, putnam real estate,"}, "article_summary": "Overall, in Dutchess and Putnam counties, the report contends that zombie properties contributed to a decline of $3.3 million in property values.\nThese zombie properties located in Murphy\u2019s Senate district resulted in a total property value deprecation of $1.38 million in the district and a $2.6 million drop in property values throughout Dutchess County.\nThe analysis showed that 177 privately owned homes within a 300-foot radius of a bank-owned property in Murphy\u2019s Senate district saw a depreciation of $846,033.\nDutchess County has seven zombie properties all located in Pawling resulting in $30,814 in property value depreciation.\nDATABASE: Lower Hudson Valley real estate transactionsMOUNT VERNON: Zombie lots could become pocket parksMORE: 'Zombie' homes still haunting local communitiesVIDEO: Mt."}
