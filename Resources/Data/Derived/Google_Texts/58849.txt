Former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz appeared on Fox News Sunday today to talk about their foreign policy-focused book that includes lots of criticisms of President Obama in this particular arena.

However, as they discussed Iran with Chris Wallace, Wallace highlighted how the Bush administration dealt with Iran, pointing out how Iran went from zero centrifuges in 2007 to over 5000 in 2009. He asked, “In fairness, didn’t you leave––the Bush-Cheney administration leave––President Obama with a mess?”

Cheney rejected that assertion and pointed to the removal of Sadaam Hussein as a blow against Iran. Wallace brought up the centrifuges again, and Cheney said that was “under Obama’s watch, not under our watch.”

Wallace again point out this happened between 2007 and 2009.

He moved on to Iraq, which the Cheneys have criticized Obama over, especially regarding the removal of U.S. troops in 2011. Wallace pointed out the original status of forces agreement was negotiated under George W. Bush. Liz Cheney pushed back a bit and pushed more of the onus to Obama.
