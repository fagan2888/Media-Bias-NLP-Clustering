Current state law establishes well setbacks at 500 feet.\n\nInitiative 92 would give local governments the authority to limit or prohibit oil and gas development within their jurisdictions. The measure proposes that if state and local laws conflict, the more restrictive laws would govern drilling.\n\nCOLORADO ENERGY MEASURES: Expected to attract big names, deep pockets\n\nBoth initiatives would be amendments to the Colorado constitution, making them harder to overturn than statutory amendments.\n\nBoth also are backed by U.S. Rep. Jared Polis, D-Boulder.\n\nThe two initiatives approved last week for signature-gathering are among 11 seeking to get on the ballot that would tighten state regulations on energy development or give more control to local governments.\n\nTo make it to the ballot, backers must gather at least 86,105 valid signatures for each initiative. Backers have said they will gather signatures for one local-control measure and one setback measure.\n\nInitiative 75, one of the most sweeping measures that would give local governments authority over oil and gas drilling or any other types of businesses, received the go-ahead for petitions last month.\n\nBusiness groups are fighting the measures, saying they could have severe repercussions on the economy. Among the opponents is Coloradans for Responsible Reform, or CFRR, a coalition of business advocates.\n\n\u201cThese bans are job killers and CFRR is preparing to aggressively fight them,\u201d said Dan Hopkins, a spokesman for the group.\n\nBackers of the initiatives contend that cities and counties are best suited to regulate oil and gas drilling, taking into account local impacts that are not addressed in state laws.\n\nGov. John Hickenlooper is working to build support for compromise legislation that would head off the ballot initiatives.Polis has said that if compromise legislation can be passed he would withdraw support for the ballot measures.\n\nColoradans for Safe and Clean Energy, which is promoting the initiatives, has received $1.45 million from a Polis-backed group Coloradans for Local Control.\n\nThe draft bill would give local governments the ability to negotiate setbacks beyond the state requirement, inspect local oil and gas operations and adopt health and safety rules more stringent than state requirements.\n\nIt would also limit the time a local government can take in evaluating a permit, reinforce the right of oil and gas companies to access their reserves and limit the use of moratoriums to stop drilling.\n\n\u201cI personally would love to see the legislature go much further than the proposed draft that is being circulated by the Governor\u2019s office,\u201d Polis said in a statement.\n\n\u201cDespite the draft not being perfect, I stand ready and willing to support the compromise and I appreciate all the work that has been done to craft this bill,\u201d Polis said. \u201cMy constituents need relief now and local control is the best solution.\u201d\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado initiatives for local control of drilling OK\u2019d for signatures", "title": "Colorado initiatives for local control of drilling OK\u2019d for signatures", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/16/colorado-initiatives-for-local-control-of-drilling-okd-for-signatures/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140610__oil-and-gas-drillingp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140610__oil-and-gas-drillingp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-16T11:50:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:15:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaea2\"", "article_summary": "Two more ballot initiatives that could limit oil and gas drilling have been approved for gathering of petition signatures by the Colorado Supreme Court.\nInitiative 92 would give local governments the authority to limit or prohibit oil and gas development within their jurisdictions.\nThe measure proposes that if state and local laws conflict, the more restrictive laws would govern drilling.\nColoradans for Safe and Clean Energy, which is promoting the initiatives, has received $1.45 million from a Polis-backed group Coloradans for Local Control.\nInitiative 88 would require new oil and gas wells to be located at least 2,000 feet from the nearest occupied structure."}
