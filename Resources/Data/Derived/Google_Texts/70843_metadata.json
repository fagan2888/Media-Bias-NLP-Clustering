After all, the disease is terrible, highly contagious, and Sovaldi promises a cure rate of above 90 percent.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, hepatitis C is so widespread that nearly 1,900 people were diagnosed with it last year. Florida\u2019s Medicaid program is aware of over 20,000 recipients living with hepatitis C.\n\nBut making Sovaldi available to everyone on Medicaid who needs it now would cost the state over $1.6 billion, and so it\u2019s restricted.\n\nBlame greed. Greed from the drug industry, and greed from members of Congress who are so beholden to pharmaceutical industry campaign cash that they won\u2019t consider allowing Medicare Part D plans to negotiate for better drug prices, as other countries do. Medicare\u2019s rates become the basis for everyone else\u2019s rates, and so this drives up health costs across the spectrum.\n\nIn the United States, a 12-week course of Sovaldi costs $84,000. But in Canada or Europe, it\u2019s only $55,000. In Egypt, it\u2019s just $900.\n\nThat\u2019s according to testimony from Dr. Steven Miller, chief medical officer for pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts, speaking at a June 11 Congressional hearing.\n\nThis bit of corporate welfare is the legacy of President George W. Bush\u2019s Medicare Part D plan, and President Obama\u2019s bad bargain to win the drug industry\u2019s blessing of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSovaldi is a true medical breakthrough. It prevents the hepatitis C virus from replicating, resulting no detectable virus for most people. It was discovered at a New Jersey biotechnology company, Pharmasset, which was bought by Gilead Sciences, of Foster City, CA.\n\nThe drug industry warns that setting Medicare free to negotiate prices could kill such drug discovery innovation. But Miller convincingly argues that saving Medicare money could allow more to be spent on government-funded research for cures.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus is spread through IV drug use, pre-1992 blood transfusions, dirty tattoo techniques and in some cases, sex. It now kills more people in the United States than AIDS.\n\nThe virus causes scarring, cirrhosis, and cancer of the liver, making it a leading reason for liver transplants.\n\nGilead Sciences has priced Sovaldi at what it believes the market will bear, apparently comparing it to the cost of needing a liver transplant.\n\nThis strategy has worked beautifully for the company in the short term. In the first three months of 2014, Sovaldi broke all records by earning Gilead $2.3 billion.\n\nBut Gilead\u2019s short-term gain may become the entire drug industry\u2019s pain. Perhaps it will be a wakeup call.\n\nWhat do you think?
