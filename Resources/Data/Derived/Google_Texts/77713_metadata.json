Much in the same way the network put all of its focus into the crisis in Ukraine the week prior, CNN has been ignoring most other stories to report on the missing flight even when no new information is coming in and it seems like speculation is the only option.\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to address these concerns, Chris Cuomo, who was filling in for Ashleigh Banfield during the 12 noon ET hour Wednesday, defended CNN\u2019s coverage of the story by stressing that it\u2019s just as important to ask questions as it is to give answers when something like the disappearance of the plane carrying 239 people occurs.\n\nBelow is the transcript of Cuomo\u2019s remarks:\n\n\u201cOften in a situation like the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the job is to have more questions than there are answers, because simply not enough is known. So if it seems like we\u2019re nibbling around the edges, it\u2019s because we are. If it seems like you\u2019re trying to avoid the suggestion of speculation, it\u2019s because you have to. Because the facts often will lead you in the right direction and until you have them, you can just be as scattershot as the theories and ideas that we\u2019re hearing about where this plane may be. But the bottom line is the authorities and those who are supposed to know simply do not. So we monitor the situation as best we can, learning it what we can as we go along. One way to do that is being everywhere the story is, and that\u2019s what CNN is doing on this and every story.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Cuomo introduced yet another segment that \u201cnibbled around the edges\u201d of the story without revealing any further concrete developments. Judging by CNN\u2019s ratings during its Ukraine coverage and this week with the Malaysia Airlines focus, the strategy of \u201cbeing everywhere\u201d on one specific story appears to be paying off, at least to some degree.\n\nWatch video below, via CNN:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[h/t Erik Wemple]\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Perhaps in an attempt to address these concerns, Chris Cuomo, who was filling in for Ashleigh Banfield during the 12 noon ET hour Wednesday, defended CNN's", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-12-at-2.35.33-PM.png", "title": "Why Is CNN Spending So Much Time on Missing Malaysia Airlines Flight?"}, "twitter": {"description": "Perhaps in an attempt to address these concerns, Chris Cuomo, who was filling in for Ashleigh Banfield during the 12 noon ET hour Wednesday, defended CNN's coverage of the story by stressing that it's just as important to ask questions as it is to give answers when something like the disappearance of the plane carrying 239 people occurs.", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2014-03-12-at-2.35.33-PM.png", "title": "Why Is CNN Spending So Much Time on Missing Malaysia Airlines Flight?", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "tv", "date": "2014-03-12T17:40:59+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf91d\"", "article_summary": "If you have been watching CNN over the last several days, you may have noticed the network\u2019s near wall-to-wall coverage of the mystery surrounding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370, which disappeared somewhere near Southeast Asia last Friday.\nBelow is the transcript of Cuomo\u2019s remarks:\u201cOften in a situation like the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, the job is to have more questions than there are answers, because simply not enough is known.\nJudging by CNN\u2019s ratings during its Ukraine coverage and this week with the Malaysia Airlines focus, the strategy of \u201cbeing everywhere\u201d on one specific story appears to be paying off, at least to some degree.\nSo we monitor the situation as best we can, learning it what we can as we go along.\nIf it seems like you\u2019re trying to avoid the suggestion of speculation, it\u2019s because you have to."}
