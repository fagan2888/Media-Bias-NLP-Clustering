But his victory was short-lived.\n\nFor the past two years, the U.S. Marshals Service has hunted Thompson as a fugitive \u2014 wanted for skipping a court date to explain to investors what happened to the riches. The rise and fall of the intrepid explorer is the stuff of storybooks, a tale receiving renewed attention amid a new expedition begun this year to the sunken ship.\n\n\u201cI think he had calculated it, whatever you want to call it, an escape plan,\u201d Marshals agent Brad Fleming said. \u201cI think he\u2019s had that for a long time.\u201d\n\nAround 1983, Thompson grew obsessed with tracking down the SS Central America. When the ship went down off the South Carolina coast in 1857, 425 people drowned and gold worth millions was lost.\n\nThompson, an oceanic engineer at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, convinced 161 people to invest in his quest, raising $12.7 million. On Oct. 1, 1988, he finally found the treasure, which he would later describe as \u201cotherworldly in its splendor.\u201d\n\nBut his joy faded fast. Thirty-nine insurance companies sued Thompson, claiming they had insured the gold in 1857 and that it belonged to them. In 1996, Thompson\u2019s company was awarded 92 percent of the treasure, and the rest was divided among some of the insurers. Four years later, Thompson\u2019s company netted $50 million after selling 532 gold bars and thousands of coins to a gold marking group.\n\nYet his legal troubles weren\u2019t over.\n\nBy 2005, Thompson\u2019s investors still hadn\u2019t been paid, and two sued \u2014 a now-deceased investment firm president who put in some $250,000 and the Dispatch Printing Company, which publishes The Columbus Dispatch newspaper and invested about $1 million. The following year, nine members of Thompson\u2019s crew also sued, saying they, too, were promised some proceeds.\n\nThompson went into seclusion, moving into a mansion in Vero Beach, Florida. After that, his behavior turned bizarre.\n\nThompson refused to use his real name on his utility bills, telling realtor Vance Brinkerhoff that his life had been threatened and asking him, \u201cHow would you like to live like that?\u201d Brinkerhoff recounted the exchange in a court deposition.\n\nIn another deposition, maintenance worker James Kennedy recalled once going to the house and seeing Thompson on the pool deck wearing only socks, shoes and dirty underwear. \u201cHis hair was all crazy,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAfter that, me and (a friend) referred to him as the crazy professor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feds chase treasure hunter turned fugitive", "title": "Feds chase treasure hunter turned fugitive", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Feds chase treasure hunter turned fugitive", "title": "Feds chase treasure hunter turned fugitive", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/13/feds_chase_treasure_hunter_turned_fugitive/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/treasure-hunter-fugitive.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Feds chase treasure hunter turned fugitive", "title": "Feds chase treasure hunter turned fugitive", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/treasure-hunter-fugitive.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Lee Myers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In 1996, Thompson\u2019s company was awarded 92 percent of the treasure, and the rest was divided among some of the insurers.\nThirty-nine insurance companies sued Thompson, claiming they had insured the gold in 1857 and that it belonged to them.\nThompson went into seclusion, moving into a mansion in Vero Beach, Florida.\nWhen the ship went down off the South Carolina coast in 1857, 425 people drowned and gold worth millions was lost.\nFour years later, Thompson\u2019s company netted $50 million after selling 532 gold bars and thousands of coins to a gold marking group."}
