Doctors no longer need written consent to give patients an HIV test in health care settings, like doctor\u2019s offices and hospitals.\n\nThe law could have a big impact in Florida, which has more new HIV infections than anywhere else in the country.\n\nJesse Fry is a policy analyst with the AIDS Institute in Tallahassee. He said an estimated 18,000 Floridians have HIV and don\u2019t know they have the virus, according to the institute.\n\n\u201cWe make this part of the routine now,\u201d Fry said. \u201cYou\u2019re scheduled for a cholesterol test and a complete blood count analysis and oh, by the way, I\u2019m gonna schedule you for an HIV test.\u201d\n\nPatients can still opt out of the test.\n\nThe law is based on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations, and was co-sponsored by Florida state Sen. Geraldine Thompson.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter for WMFE in Orlando.
