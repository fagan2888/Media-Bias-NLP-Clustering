And the good news is the answer is pretty straightforward\u2014at least, for now.\n\nBottom line: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires insurers to pay for annual mammograms starting at age 40, with no deductibles or co-insurance. A small number of grandfathered health plans sold prior to 2010 are the sole exception. \u201cBut the vast majority of insurers cover it. We cover it,\u201d says Russell Vinik, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of University Health Plans. \u201cInsurance isn\u2019t going to jump into the debate. It\u2019s really an individualized decision.\u201d\n\nSome experts, however, fear this could change. The ACA\u2019s coverage mandates are tied to recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which in 2009 gave a poor grade to mammography before the age of 50. Congress intervened with an amendment to the ACA protecting breast cancer screening coverage for women in their forties, according to The New York Times, which, in the wake of the screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society, editorialized in favor of continuing the coverage. The society\u2019s guidelines aren\u2019t legally binding, but added confusion to debate over when to start screening (at 40 versus 50) by recommending that women with average risk start screening at age 45.\n\nPutting aside the uncertain future of mammogram coverage, there\u2019s another financial consideration for women: Paying for diagnostic services when women are called back for further testing. Generally, if a doctor orders an ultrasound or biopsy to follow-up on an abnormal mammogram, the procedure is considered a treatment, not a preventive benefit, and is therefore not covered at 100 percent, says Vinik. \u201cSo there would normally be a copay. And if a woman hasn\u2019t met her deductible, she could be on the hook for some or all of the cost.\u201d\n\nThis is an increasingly common reality for consumers given the rise of high deductible health plans, and it puts the risk calculus of whether to get a mammogram in the first place squarely in the consumer\u2019s lap, Vinik says. In 2014, almost half (48 percent) of the nation\u2019s employers offered health benefits with high deductibles, up from 38 percent in 2013, a recent survey showed. And about 10 percent of mammograms result in the need for additional testing, says Vinik.\n\n\u201c[High deductible] plans are designed to make consumers think twice about how they spend their health care dollars. But probably a lot of women get screened for breast cancer without taking into consideration the possibility that they\u2019ll need a biopsy, or that they might have to pay for it because they haven\u2019t met their deductible,\u201d Vinik said. According to Healthcare Bluebook, the going rate for a surgical biopsy is $3,100 and for a needle biopsy, $500\u2014and some deductibles are as high as $2,500 or even $7,000.\n\nOf course, finances are only one factor in making health decisions. Vinik says, nine out of 10 times, after additional diagnostic testing breast lesions are found to be benign. False positives can be stressful to a woman and importantly false positives are more common in younger women, which is what makes the debate so complicated, he says.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important for women to make these decisions with their doctor, and taking into account their family histories, symptoms and personal health profiles and goals, Vinik concludes. \u201cNo insurer wants to dissuade women from appropriate screening. Women should take time to fully inform themselves of the benefits and risks associated with screening.\u201d\n\nAbout the author:\n\nKirsten Stewart is a Communications Specialist in the Office of Public Relations.
