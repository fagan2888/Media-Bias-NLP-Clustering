The Harvard University Native American Program sponsored the 20th Annual Harvard Powwow on the Radcliffe Lawn on May 3, the first truly spring-like day of the year in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The university was founded in 1636 to train ministers. In the late 1640s, the English Society for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Natives in New England granted funds for Indian education at Harvard. The Indian College building was constructed in Harvard Yard in 1655.
