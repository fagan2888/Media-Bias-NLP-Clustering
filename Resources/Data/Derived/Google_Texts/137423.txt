"When I was about to get into the car, I said I don't know if we're gonna make this," Elizabeth said.

Baby Born In Moving Car On Illinois Tollway

A suburban mother has a memorable story to tell about the birth of her third son. Her husband was driving as she was going into labor on the Illinois Tollway, but their bundle of joy couldn’t wait. NBC 5’s Lee Ann Trotter has their story. (Published Thursday, July 3, 2014)

The couple left their Edison Park home around 4 a.m. and got onto the Edens Expressway at Touhy, but they didn't make it very far.

"At that point it was very obvious I was going to deliver a child on the shoulder of the road," Elizabeth said.

Daniel, who works as a paramedic, delivered the baby girl in the front seat of the minivan, then drove his wife and child to Evanston Hospital.

"Including this baby, this is the first one i've ever delivered," Daniel said.

The couple named the baby girl Mary, who was born healthy and weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces.

This is baby number five for the family -- and likely their last.

"We're done. We went out with a bang with her," Elizabeth said.
