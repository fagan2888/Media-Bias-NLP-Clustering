Match these descriptions \u2014 most friendly, least friendly, best food, worst food \u2014 to the corresponding countries: Egypt, Italy, Spain, Turkey.\n\nAnswers:\n\nTurkish food, with its fresh fruits and vegetables, savory lamb, and honey-kissed desserts, bests most countries\u2019 cuisine.\n\nWorst food goes to Spain, where I managed to have nine bad meals in three days, albeit washed down with exceptional wine. The sample size was too small to make a final judgement, but the salty potatoes, salty pork, and salty soup left a bad taste.\n\nLeast friendly are the Italians, who seem adept at ignoring the millions of American tourists who flock to their famous sites. I don\u2019t blame them; I was the same when I lived in a tourist destination.\n\nEgyptians, on the other hand, are not only friendliest and most hospitable of the aforementioned, but of all 30 countries I\u2019ve visited. In fact, Arab countries are the only places I\u2019ve visited where strangers, poor strangers at that, gave me gifts simply because I was a visitor to their shores.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t traveled to these countries, these (certainly subjective) descriptions may seem counterintuitive. Depictions in entertainment, news and social media often suggest the opposite is true, especially of Egypt. And just as my unfortunate culinary experience in Spain does not represent the whole of Spanish food, limited exposure can leave a false impression. Knowing a little means knowing just enough to be dangerous. Distortions endure because people often seek information that confirms their beliefs while avoiding contradictory information. Thus confirmation bias protects stereotypes and false narratives.\n\nConsider two such statements pronounced by some in the aftermath of recent atrocities: \u201cMuslims don\u2019t denounce Islamic extremism\u201d and \u201cPro-lifers don\u2019t condemn violence at abortion clinics.\u201d Both are false.\n\nIndividually and through their representative organizations, Muslims condemned the violence done in the name of their religion. Likewise, pro-lifers, who are by definition anti-killing, denounced violence done in their name. But like a tree that falls in the forest, one must be present to hear the sound. People who do not know Muslims or pro-lifers hear only silence and make assumptions.\n\nUnfortunately, widening political divisions within the American public make it easier to avoid contact with alternative viewpoints. Pew Research Center polling data show that Americans have become more consistently right or left of center in their beliefs. Over the past 20 years, the percentage of politically engaged Democrats who hold consistently liberal views has risen from 8 percent to 38 percent. A third of politically active Republicans are consistently conservative, up from a quarter in 2004.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with ideological consistency so long as one is always seeking new information. The same polling data, however, show that consistent liberals and conservatives are more likely to surround themselves with like-minded people. Add to this trend, the ideological polarization of cable news and alternative media. One can simply avoid all contact with opposing viewpoints and the people who hold them. What one does know of the other side is likely to be a distortion, rather than a real argument or a real person. Red state or blue state then becomes a state of mind and no one dares cross the border into a land inhabited by mean and nasty strawmen.\n\nThe new year promises to be politically contentious. The only way to keep an open mind is to intentionally interact with people who are different than us. Breaking bread together can open minds.
