Bob Dylan has received France’s highest honor for his cultural contribution to that country and the world.

Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti said that he was a hero for young people who wanted independence and justice.

The minister was enthusiastic in her praise, saying that Dylan’s music spoke to the heart of the French people.

The BBC said that Dylan has always shied away from being a spokesperson for causes.

Being presented with the award at the small ceremony in Paris he said that he was “proud and grateful.” He, however, looked uncomfortable during the ceremony.

Dylan is scheduled to play three concerts in Paris this week.
