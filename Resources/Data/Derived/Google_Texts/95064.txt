"I need your vote tomorrow. I need you to go out and work for me," Hillary Clinton yelled to the crowd over loud cheers.

Hillary Clinton asking for support just one day before the primary election.

She spent time in Bowling Green discussing several issues including improving the Affordable Care Act.

"We're going to get the cost down, copays, deductibles, premiums, prescription drug costs," said Clinton.

For several voters, it was a chance to see the person they support or to make a decision on who to vote for.

"Everybody's had their ups and downs. She does have have experience dealing with other nations," said Ricky Bibb, Hillary Clinton supporter.

"Obviously, Hillary is a woman, and I really do think it's time for a woman president for the United States," said undecided voter Paige Dale.

"She's got all the experience we need right now," said Hillary Clinton supporter Janet Schwarzkopf.

Recent controversial coal comments have drawn ire from people like Bowling Green resident Sen. Rand Paul, but Hillary Clinton said she's the only one with a plan to help coal country.

She wants to invest $30 billion into coal areas.

"We need to take coal country, coal miners and their families with us and not leave them behind," said Clinton.

It's not clear who will win the primary, but recent projections show a close race between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Now for Sanders, he needs a big win tomorrow to help his cause. For Clinton, a victory in Kentucky all but clinches the nomination for her.

The polls are open from six a.m. to six p.m. tomorrow.
