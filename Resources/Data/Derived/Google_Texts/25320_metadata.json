REUTERS/Brian Snyder\n\nWhile thousands streamed into a football stadium Friday evening in Mobile, Alabama to see Donald Trump, a much smaller crowd of committed conservatives unwound at a bar and mused over the good, the bad and the unknown of the unlikely Republican presidential front-runner.\n\nThey were volunteers and staff for Americans for Prosperity, a non-profit group funded by industrialist billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, two of the most effective conservative activists in U.S. politics.\n\nAccording to AFP, 3,600 people came to this year\u2019s annual Defending the American Dream Summit from around the country Friday and Saturday, taking in appearances by a handful of the 17 Republican presidential candidates. Trump was not invited.\n\nOn the national level, Trump is dominating the contest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and widened his lead over the crowded field in a Reuters/Ipsos poll on Friday, with 32 percent of those surveyed saying they backed the billionaire.\n\nBut among this self-selected group of politically engaged conservatives, his popularity has yet to solidify. Trump the phenom dazzles, but Trump the candidate is getting the same scrutiny as the other 16 Republicans.\n\nThe apparent reticence among this influential grouping plays into one of the big political questions of the moment: Can Trump turn his strength in the polls and undeniable attractiveness to a slice of voters into victories in Republican primary elections early next year?\n\nIn the mid-term 2014 elections, AFP achieved a 95 percent success rate in the election races where it spent money. As a non-profit, it cannot advocate for specific candidates, but it runs ads to defeat candidates who it believes are not doing a good job on specific issues.\n\n\u2018THE MAN\u2019S A JACKASS\u2019\n\nAFP President Tim Phillips told Reuters on Saturday the group would keep its \u201claser\u201d focus on advocating for issues like tax reform, repealing the Affordable Care Act and fighting environmental regulations, no matter who is elected.\n\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio were among the scheduled speakers. When it came to choosing candidates to invite to the summit, Phillips said \u201cWe talked to people who had records that for the most part were philosophically aligned with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want a cattle call,\u201d he added, while noting that Trump had appeared at past AFP events.\n\nAFP officials don\u2019t mince words about politicians they dislike and Phillips recalled how AFP was critical of Cruz during the government shutdown two years ago.\n\nSummit attendees did advocate for candidates, wearing preferences on t-shirts, buttons and hats, supporting the likes of Cruz and another candidate, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.\n\nThough it wasn\u2019t hard to find people who said they liked Trump, the fervor that has driven the brash New York businessman to the top of the polls was a more reserved admiration here, an approval of the voice in the abstract rather than the candidate.\n\n\u201cIt really frustrates me when he bashes other candidates \u2013 and they\u2019re really cheap personal shots,\u201d said Althea Cole, 31, a Republican from Cedar Rapids, Iowa who is a county chairwoman there for Carson\u2019s campaign. Still, she had some admiration for Trump\u2019s success.\n\n\u201cThe man\u2019s a jackass, but you don\u2019t get to be a billionaire by making friends,\u201d she said.\n\nA group of college students in a Republican club at Augustana College in South Dakota felt he was too much of a bully.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s mocking it with his presence,\u201d said Cara Beck, 20, as she stood with five male students between 19 and 21 years of age. Their picks were Bush, former Ohio Governor John Kasich, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and Rubio.\n\nAmong a group of young Tennesseans, Trump garnered mixed reactions \u2013 plaudits for his business acumen, and boos for the reality TV star\u2019s showmanship.\n\n\u201cBoth my parents love Donald Trump but I can\u2019t stand him,\u201d said Michael Stooksbury, 18, who likes Paul best. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any experience, he\u2019s just an entertainer.\u201d\n\nBut Thomas Parham, 29, said the country could benefit from Trump\u2019s business background.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather us be a financial empire than an empire of war,\u201d he said, \u201cthat way we can take over country after country, territory after territory, without firing a single shot.\u201d\n\n(Editing by Mary Milliken)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/tag_reuters.com2015_binary_LYNXNPEB7L0J8-VIEWIMAGE-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Trump met with lukewarm support at Koch-backed summit: \u2018The man is a jackass\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a news conference before a campaign town hall meeting in Derry, New Hampshire August 19, 2015.\nTrump the phenom dazzles, but Trump the candidate is getting the same scrutiny as the other 16 Republicans.\nAccording to AFP, 3,600 people came to this year\u2019s annual Defending the American Dream Summit from around the country Friday and Saturday, taking in appearances by a handful of the 17 Republican presidential candidates.\n\u201cBoth my parents love Donald Trump but I can\u2019t stand him,\u201d said Michael Stooksbury, 18, who likes Paul best.\nAmong a group of young Tennesseans, Trump garnered mixed reactions \u2013 plaudits for his business acumen, and boos for the reality TV star\u2019s showmanship."}
