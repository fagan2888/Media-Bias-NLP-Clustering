Today, History.com reports there are more than 70 million fathers in the United States. Sure, fatherhood conjures images of men hoisting children up on their shoulders, of soccer games and dance recitals, and otherwise unwavering care and support \u2014 but what does fatherhood mean, physiologically?\n\nReduced high-risk behavior\n\nResearchers from Oregon State University (OSU) assessed more than 200 at-risk boys starting at age 12 through age 31, measuring for men\u2019s crime, tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use over the 19-year study period. When controlling for the aging process, \u201cfatherhood was an independent factor in predicting decreases in crime, alcohol and tobacco use,\u201d said David Kerr, lead study author and assistant professor of psychology at OSU, in a press release.\n\nWhen men in their 20s and early 30s became fathers, they showed greater decreases in crime and alcohol use in comparison to those who had their first child in their teens or early 20s. Kerr speculated \u201chaving children at a more developmentally-expected time could have been more able or willing to embrace fatherhood and shed negative lifestyle choices.\u201d\n\nLowered testosterone levels (which is a good thing)\n\nA study out of Northwestern University found men are biologically wired to care for their offspring, and when they become a father, their testosterone levels drop (among other hormonal changes). Researchers cited testosterone is what boosts a male\u2019s tendency to compete for a mate, so if levels remained high, so would their \u201cmating-related activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cFatherhood and the demands of having a newborn baby require many emotional, psychological, and physical adjustments,\" study author Lee Gettler said in a press release. \"Our study indicates that a man's biology can change substantially to help meet those demands.\" Moreover, Gettler\u2019s research revealed lowered levels of testosterone may also protect men from certain chronic diseases.\n\nWeight gain (which is another good thing)\n\nSlate cited a study published in the journal Biology Letter that found male mammals, like primates, can\u201cgain as much as 20 percent of their body weight,\u201d when their mate is pregnant. The idea is with more weight, males will have more energy to expend when their new baby arrives. These are what researchers also call \u201csympathetic pregnancy symptoms\u201d \u2014 and they don\u2019t just include weight gain.\n\n\u201cSympathetic pregnancy symptoms in men are referred to as \u2018couvade\u2019 (derived from the French \u2018to incubate or hatch\u2019), indicating that men share some of their mate's pregnancy symptoms,\u201d they wrote in the study\u2019s discussion. \u201cThese symptoms include weight gain, nausea, headache, irritability, restlessness, backache, colds, and nervousness.\u201d\n\nImproved brain\n\nIn the same Slate article, authors cite separate research conducted on male mammals that found soon-to-be-fathers experience enhancements in their brain\u2019s prefrontal cortex. This cortex is located in the very front of the brain, and it plays a role in abstract thinking and thought analysis, which also helps regulate behavior.\n\nThe study in question saw \u201cafter childbirth, the neurons in this region showed greater connectivity, suggesting that having young children could boost the part of the brain responsible for planning and memory, skills parents need when having kids gives them more to keep track of.\u201d Live Science found, too, that childcare behavior can increase dad\u2019s oxytocin levels, otherwise known as the love hormone. It\u2019s no wonder that some scientists believe oxytocin could one day be used to treat brain disorders.\n\nMore improved brain changes after the baby is born\n\nJames Swain is a psychiatrist at the University of Michigan, and his research studies the brain\u2019s response to a baby\u2019s cries. He told NBC News when a baby cries, the \u201cbrain activity patterns don\u2019t change as quickly for fathers as they do mothers,\u201d which he jokes is why fathers are so quick to roll over three weeks post-birth.\n\nBut, Swain found after four months, the father\u2019s patterns were more like the mother\u2019s; they catch up, neurologically. He also found this effect is stronger for stay-at-home dads, which then suggests this proximity to children (recognizing and responding to the baby\u2019s cries) fosters a stronger father-baby bond.\n\n\"Fathers seem to be particularly important in modern developed Western nations like the U.S., because there are so many people who are living in isolated nuclear families, largely separated from their extended family,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThat limits the number of potential helpers out there. ... It's really important that fathers step up.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fathers, day, 2015, what, physiologically, happens, men, after, they, become, father", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Studies show becoming a father reduces men's risky behavior and testosterone levels, while enhancing parts of their brain.", "title": "How Fatherhood Changes A Man, According To Science", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fathers-day-2015-what-physiologically-happens-men-after-they-become-father-339174", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/19/fatherhood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Studies show becoming a father reduces men's risky behavior and testosterone levels, while enhancing parts of their brain.", "title": "How Fatherhood Changes A Man, According To Science", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fathers-day-2015-what-physiologically-happens-men-after-they-become-father-339174", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/19/fatherhood.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/19/fatherhood.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-06-19T17:08:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-19T17:08:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Studies show becoming a father reduces men's risky behavior and testosterone levels, while enhancing parts of their brain."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe084c\"", "article_summary": "Sure, fatherhood conjures images of men hoisting children up on their shoulders, of soccer games and dance recitals, and otherwise unwavering care and support \u2014 but what does fatherhood mean, physiologically?\nMoreover, Gettler\u2019s research revealed lowered levels of testosterone may also protect men from certain chronic diseases.\n\u201cSympathetic pregnancy symptoms in men are referred to as \u2018couvade\u2019 (derived from the French \u2018to incubate or hatch\u2019), indicating that men share some of their mate's pregnancy symptoms,\u201d they wrote in the study\u2019s discussion.\nThe idea is with more weight, males will have more energy to expend when their new baby arrives.\nBut, Swain found after four months, the father\u2019s patterns were more like the mother\u2019s; they catch up, neurologically."}
