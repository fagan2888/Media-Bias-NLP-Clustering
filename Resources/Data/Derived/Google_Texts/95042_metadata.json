The former secretary of state made stops in Nashville and Memphis Sunday ahead of Super Tuesday as she looks to build support in traditionally red states and edge out Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic race.\n\nWhile campaigning, Clinton spoke about continuing important programs passed under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, including the Affordable Care Act, her desire to support small business owners and reform the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry that your state did not extend Medicaid to 200,000 working Tennesseans,\u201d Clinton said at Meharry Medical College, the Tennessean reported. \u201cI\u2019m going to do whatever I can as president to convince governors and state legislatures \u2014 it\u2019s a pretty big deal.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Haslam threw his support behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio last week, arguing that Trump would not be able to win the general election.\n\n\u201cIt is time for Tennessee Republicans who do not want the party of Lincoln and Reagan taken over by Donald Trump to rally around Marco Rubio. It is clear Marco is the only candidate who can beat Trump,\u201d Haslam said in a statement.\n\nDespite campaign stops by Rubio, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Trump came in with a commanding win in the Volunteer State. During a Saturday rally in an airplane hanger in Millington, Trump told a crowd of approximately 10,000 people that \u201cwe're going to win everything,\u201d the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported.\n\nBoth Clinton and Trump led in Tennessee going into Super Tuesday. Trump held 40 percent support compared to Rubio with 22 percent, while Clinton had 60 percent support, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "election, 2016, president, super tuesday, tennessee, winner, loser, presidential election, democrat, republican, donald trump, primary, hillary clinton, bernie sanders, ted cruz, marco rubio, volunteer state", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Despite support from the state's governor, Florida Sen.
