Last year's drug spending report showed an increase of 13 percent, and did not include the impact of rebates.\n\nBrand name drug average prices rose 16.2 percent in 2015, and one-third of brand-named drugs had price increases greater than 20 percent, Express Scripts said. Specialty medicines accounted for 37 percent of drug spending in 2015.\n\nDrug price increases, part of an overall rise in healthcare spending, have become a national issue as consumers push back on higher bills. Drug spending has risen to become a talking point for the 2016 presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton.\n\nLooking ahead, Express Scripts said that it expects drug spending to increase 6.8 percent this year, 7.3 percent in 2017 and 8.4 percent.\n\nExpress Scripts said that spending on prescription drugs for members with the individual health plans created by the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, rose 14.6 percent. Use of prescription drugs increased 8.6 percent and costs rose 6 percent, it said.\n\nThe rate of utilization of traditional medicines among these Obamacare members increased 8.7 percent, while cost was up 0.7 percent. Use of specialty medicines rose 4.7 percent while prices increased 15.8 percent, Express Scripts said.\n\n(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline Humer", "Author": "Caroline Humer", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. spending on prescription drugs rose 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of rebates, driven by an 18 percent increase in specialty drugs, Express Scripts Holding Co said on Monday.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "title": "Express Scripts says U.S. drug spending rose 5.2 percent in 2015", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - Markets", "sailthru.tags": "US, EXPRESSSCRIPTS, PRICING", "DCSext.ChannelList": "healthNews;ousivMolt;vbcSmallBusiness;everything;AllianzInvestments;Allianz;verizonmm;davosBackup;cfaglobal;aa48hours;shipping;ubs;Intel;Fidelity2014;bjdevtest;CathayPacific_US;MOC_US_2015-16;USWire", "keywords": "US,EXPRESSSCRIPTS,PRICING,Drug Retailers (TRBC),United States,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Consumer Credit,Corporate Events,Health / Medicine,Company News,Science,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC)", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "description": "U.S. spending on prescription drugs rose 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of rebates, driven by an 18 percent increase in specialty drugs, Express Scripts Holding Co said on Monday.", "DCSext.ContentID_ousivMolt": "USKCN0WH03T", "WT.cg_n": "Markets", "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "ousivMolt", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-15T01:30:39+0000", "sailthru.title": "Express Scripts says U.S. drug spending rose 5.2 percent in 2015", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Express+Scripts+says+U.S.+drug+spending+rose+5.2+percent+in+2015", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKCN0WH03T", "WT.cg_s": "Markets", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "news_keywords": "US;EXPRESSSCRIPTS;PRICING;Drug Retailers (TRBC);United States;Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC);Consumer Credit;Corporate Events;Health / Medicine;Company News;Science;Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC)", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Caroline Humer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "sailthru.description": "U.S. spending on prescription drugs rose 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of rebates, driven by an 18 percent increase in specialty drugs, Express Scripts Holding Co said on Monday.", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/business/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-ousivMolt", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "U.S. spending on prescription drugs rose 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of rebates, driven by an 18 percent increase in specialty drugs, Express Scripts Holding Co said on Monday.", "title": "Express Scripts says U.S. drug spending rose 5.2 percent in 2015", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-expressscripts-pricing-idUSKCN0WH03T", "article": {"section": "Markets", "tag": "US,EXPRESSSCRIPTS,PRICING,Drug Retailers (TRBC),United States,Generic and Specialty Pharmaceuticals (TRBC),Consumer Credit,Corporate Events,Health / Medicine,Company News,Science,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Research (TRBC)", "published_time": "2016-03-15T01:30:39+0000", "modified_time": "2016-03-15T01:30:39+0000", "author": "Caroline Humer"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Tue Mar 15 01:30:39 UTC 2016", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "article_summary": "Express Scripts said it included rebates in its annual drug spending report for the first time, which shaved 2.7 percentage points off spending growth.\nNEW YORK U.S. spending on prescription drugs rose 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of rebates, driven by an 18 percent increase in specialty drugs, Express Scripts Holding Co said on Monday.\nLooking ahead, Express Scripts said that it expects drug spending to increase 6.8 percent this year, 7.3 percent in 2017 and 8.4 percent.\nUse of specialty medicines rose 4.7 percent while prices increased 15.8 percent, Express Scripts said.\nLast year's drug spending report showed an increase of 13 percent, and did not include the impact of rebates."}
