He's got very strong skills with the ball and on top of that he's improved during the course of the tournament.\"\n\nNo longer directing play from the classic number 10 playmaker role, Ozil is being asked to provide the creativity from the flanks and is covering much more ground than he did under the old system.\n\n\"We're very satisfied with Mesut,\" Flick said. \"He brings a lot of confidence with the ball into our game and is always ready for a pass.\"\n\nOzil's creativity has sometimes been stifled during some of the more physical matches in Brazil but he showed he can flourish when the pressure is on by scoring in Germany's 2-1 extra-time win over Algeria and helping keep his team on track with solid ball control and precise passing.\n\nFlick also noted that Ozil had needed some time to get back to full speed after picking up an injury at club side Arsenal.\n\n\"You've got to remember that he was injured at Arsenal and he wasn't able to get quite back to the level that he has played at,\" he said. \"But we're satisfied and if the coaches are satisfied, that's the important thing.\"\n\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Erik
