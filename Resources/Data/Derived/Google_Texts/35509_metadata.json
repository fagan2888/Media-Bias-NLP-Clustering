Is it any wonder that the stress from all this, known as diabetes distress, sometimes looks like depression?\n\nWhile roughly one in 10 Americans does indeed suffer depressive symptoms, chronically known as Major Depressive Disorder, researchers are increasingly finding that not all co-occurring symptoms necessarily reflect co-morbid diseases. More often than not, treating only the symptoms of diabetes distress also works to correct what physicians initially thought was depression.\n\n\"Because depression is measured with scales that are symptom-based and not tied to cause, in many cases these symptoms may actually reflect the distress that people are having about their diabetes, and not a clinical diagnosis of depression,\" said Dr. Lawrence Fisher, lead author of a recent study on diabetes distress and Professor of Family and Community Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, in a statement.\n\nFisher\u2019s study, presented at the American Diabetes Association's 74th Scientific Sessions, demonstrated the intervention methods designed to treat diabetes distress specifically, as opposed to more general treatment programs to address depressive symptoms. Participants were divided into three groups: an online diabetes self-management program, an individual assistance program to solve diabetes distress-related issues, and an informational program where subjects received educational material about diabetes through the mail.\n\nFisher and his colleagues found that all three groups reduced their distress over the 12-month period. Relying on the Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ8), which scores depression between 10 (moderate) and 27 (maximum), the team found that 84 percent of participants above 10 fell below the threshold by the end of the trial.\n\nRoughly 29.1 million people, or 9.3 percent of the U.S. population, have diabetes. Some 90 percent of those cases involve type 2 diabetes, a form of the disease marked by insulin\u2019s deficiency, rather than its absolute absence in type 1 diabetics. Type 2 diabetics must monitor their blood sugar levels and receive insulin injections manually, as a person\u2019s own pancreas doesn\u2019t produce enough insulin on its own. The hormone serves to regulate glucose levels.\n\nWhile researchers have long known that depression and diabetes were linked, the specific relationship wasn\u2019t well understood. Fisher\u2019s study, along with another unrelated study involving type 1 diabetes patients that found depressive symptoms predict early death rates, suggest the need for a more well-rounded system for evaluating diabetics\u2019 mental health.\n\n\"What's important about this is that many of the depressive symptoms reported by people with type 2 diabetes are really related to their diabetes, and don't have to be considered psychopathology,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cSo they can be addressed as part of the spectrum of the experience of diabetes and dealt with by their diabetes care team.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "depression, or, diabetes, distress, disease, related, moodiness, could, receive, false", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A laundry list of responsibilities to manage their disease causes many diabetics to express symptoms that doctors mistake for depression.", "title": "For Diabetics, Distress Looks An Awful Lot Like Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/depression-or-diabetes-distress-disease-related-moodiness-could-receive-false-diagnosis-288388", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/16/diabetesdistress.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A laundry list of responsibilities to manage their disease causes many diabetics to express symptoms that doctors mistake for depression.", "title": "For Diabetics, Distress Looks An Awful Lot Like Depression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/depression-or-diabetes-distress-disease-related-moodiness-could-receive-false-diagnosis-288388", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/16/diabetesdistress.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/16/diabetesdistress.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-06-16T11:15:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-16T11:30:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A laundry list of responsibilities to manage their disease causes many diabetics to express symptoms that doctors mistake for depression."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc014\"", "article_summary": "Is it any wonder that the stress from all this, known as diabetes distress, sometimes looks like depression?\nMore often than not, treating only the symptoms of diabetes distress also works to correct what physicians initially thought was depression.\nFisher\u2019s study, presented at the American Diabetes Association's 74th Scientific Sessions, demonstrated the intervention methods designed to treat diabetes distress specifically, as opposed to more general treatment programs to address depressive symptoms.\nWhile researchers have long known that depression and diabetes were linked, the specific relationship wasn\u2019t well understood.\nA laundry list of responsibilities to manage their disease causes many diabetics to express symptoms that doctors mistake for depression."}
