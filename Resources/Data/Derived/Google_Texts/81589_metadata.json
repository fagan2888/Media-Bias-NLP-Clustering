Without much social interaction outside the morning pleasantries exchanged between customer and barista, people can get pretty isolated in their 9-to-5 routines. Psychology, thankfully, has a remedy for that.\n\nA new study from the American Psychological Association finds that achieving a sense of awe can help people escape their own egos. Faced with large-scale wonders like a towering set of Redwood trees or a vast overlook into the Grand Canyon, or even a low-budget science experiment conducted in the kitchen, our sense of self tends to shrink. We realize how (literally) awesome the world can be, and for a moment we feel part of something larger.\n\n\u201cWhen experiencing awe, you may not, egocentrically speaking, feel like you're at the center of the world anymore,\u201d said Paul Piff, assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine, and the study\u2019s lead author.\n\nPiff and his colleagues recently conducted five experiments to test the theory that awe-inspiring sights get people to act more altruistically. The first involved a questionnaire issued to more than 1,500 people across the country that gauged how predisposed they were to feelings of awe. After collecting the results, the researchers had them play a game in which they were given 10 raffle tickets and had to decide if they wanted to share any of the tickets with someone who didn\u2019t have any. By and large, the people who were more predisposed to awe gave away more tickets.\n\nThe other four experiments confirmed the theory perhaps more compellingly. In several different scenarios, ranging from watching a drop of colored dye fall into milk in slow-motion to seeing negative images of tornadoes and other natural disasters, subjects all stuck to the first experiment\u2019s conclusion. Awe-inspiring experiences promoted what psychologists call \u201cpro-social behaviors,\u201d or those that involve some degree of self-sacrifice so that others may prosper.\n\n\u201cBy diminishing the emphasis on the individual self,\u201d Piff said, \u201cawe may encourage people to forgo strict self-interest to improve the welfare of others.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just conventional wisdom that argues Americans are becoming more self-absorbed. The research seems to back it up. In 2013, for example, a study published in Psychological Science found European American students\u2019 desire to work together and ask for help fell far below Asian Americans\u2019, not only in prevalence but in outcome. When primed to think about working together, the European American students performed worse on a task. When primed to stand alone, they flourished.\n\nBut selfies and social media might not tell the whole story. Young Americans \u2014 Millennials, as they\u2019re better-known \u2014 are known for their steadfast support of corporate conscience. They strive for social equality in nearly all matters, including sexuality, gender, race. On small-scale measurements, the focus on the self is clear. But on these macro issues people seem to have broader interests at heart.\n\nGiven the new research, it may be the case that younger people, the most connected generation in history, have greater access to the world\u2019s wonders, big or small. Suddenly, the woman standing up to street harassers in New York doesn\u2019t feel so far away to the young girl in Seattle. And protests in Baltimore ignite a flame in a boy watching from afar in Texas. With more cause to be awe-inspired, younger generations seem more compelled to act.\n\n\u201cMight awe cause people to become more invested in the greater good, giving more to charity, volunteering to help others, or doing more to lessen their impact on the environment?\u201d Piff said. \u201cOur research would suggest that the answer is yes.\u201d\n\nSource: Piff P, Dietze P, Feinberg M, Stancato D, Keltner D.
