ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Minnesota coach Jerry Kill suffered a seizure and did not accompany the team to its game Saturday afternoon at Michigan.

Sources said Kill "did not feel well" Friday night and did not travel with the Gophers, intending to meet the team on Saturday. But then Kill suffered a seizure early Saturday morning. Kill was not hospitalized and is resting at home, a spokesman for the school said.

The players were told after arriving at Michigan Stadium about 1 p.m. Saturday.

This is Kill's fifth seizure-related episode since he took the job at Minnesota in 2011. The latest was last month just after halftime of the New Mexico State game. Kill has had a history of seizures in his coaching career going back to 2000.

Kill's coaching staff took a business-as-usual approach Saturday. Defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys will serve as acting head coach from the press box as he did at the New Mexico State game.

"I'm not going to speculate on what's down the road," Minnesota AD Norwood Teague said. "More important, there's the here and now and how to manage it [the seizures] better."

Kill, who has epilepsy, has become an advocate recently for those with the affliction.
