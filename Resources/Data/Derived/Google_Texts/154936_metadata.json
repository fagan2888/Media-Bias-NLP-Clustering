Also, Lee Corso fights with swords and it doesn't end well.\n\nHey, Lee Corso picked USC. Let's give him Trojan gear and see what happens!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnnnnnd he's bleeding. Great. Onto to the signs.\n\n(via bubbaprog)\n\nOh, bravo. Why doesn't Brent have his own betting website or newsletter or whatever? He would dominate the market. Is it because he's not very good at betting? Because I would absolutely believe that too. Like, if you saw a report that says \"Musburger loses $1500 a week on betting, doesn't care,\" would you even bat an eye?\n\n\"DO YOU EVEN LIFT?\" #GameDaySigns pic.twitter.com/GvPx4gMB6K \u2014 ParadigmShift35 (@NAWTADIGM) November 16, 2013\n\nOf COURSE a USC fan brings that sign. That's basically the most USC sign possible. Also in the middle, an \"I WIPE WITH TREES\" sign. Really? Really? Do you wipe with trees? Because that sounds horrendous.\n\nThey won't let us take our signs in bc we're in the Coke Zero section!

We approve so, so much.\n\nSPORTS pic.twitter.com/sv69FiEIcm \u2014 ParadigmShift35 (@NAWTADIGM) November 16, 2013\n\nIs that... is that Luna Bars shade? What the hell is wrong with Luna Bars?!\n\n(via bubbaprog)\n\nOK, there's a lot going on, so let's go left to right.\n\nCORSO ASKS JEEVES: That's good. And the only reason I don't believe it's true is that it's just ask.com now. There's no Jeeves. I know, sad.\n\nFIRE KIFFIN: DO IT AGAIN I DON'T CARE\n\nDAVID SHAW BOWLS WITH BUMPERS: This is low-key brilliant. Like, what's the last acceptable age for bowling with bumpers? Six? Seven?\n\nSTANFORD SUPPORTS OBAMACARE: I mean, politics should generally stay out of sports\u2014it doesn't end well\u2014but when something the government does is its own punchline, yeah, go for it.\n\nKEVIN HOGAN WEARS A SIZE 7 SHOE: I love this because it always feels creepy and gross whenever announcers are like, \"[Player X] has a size 15 shoe! You should see his wingspan!\" Uh, okay? Why not just slap him on the butt and compliment his sturdy hindquarters?\n\nThat book is huge!\n\n\"FOOTBALL IS NEAT\" pic.twitter.com/kvc1tGc0OA \u2014 ParadigmShift35 (@NAWTADIGM) November 16, 2013\n\nI mean it is.\n\nCorso! u look good bb!\n\nTopical! And yet... you can totally see Kiffin as a Blockbuster manager, can't you? Like you're making six dollars an hour in 2002, miserable as all get out in your blue polo, and up walks Lane Kiffin saying something like, \"gotta be pushing those Jujyfruits, really need to hit our goals on that.\" Classic Kiffin.\n\nGeorge Clooney Dies In Gravity is sneaky my favorite sign pic.twitter.com/tvmUsamAyh \u2014 Kmarko (@Kmarkobarstool) November 16, 2013\n\nOH COME ON BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\n\nAnd then these. Apparently there's a significant obsession with Stanford's female students at USC. I don't know how else to put it.\n\n9 out of 10 California girls are hot. The 10th goes to Stanford! #GamedaySigns pic.twitter.com/X5Xnnd55ZH \u2014 Kari Van Horn (@KariVanHorn) November 16, 2013\n\nStanford girls are so bad Tiger left college early! #GamedaySigns pic.twitter.com/RLI9ibDF3B \u2014 Kari Van Horn (@KariVanHorn) November 16, 2013\n\nWay to go?", "article_metadata": {"outbrainsection": "college-football", "description": "USC fans take aim at Stanford and talk smack about breakfast bars.
