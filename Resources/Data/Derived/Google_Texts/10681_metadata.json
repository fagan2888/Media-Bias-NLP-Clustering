The health-care reform bars insurers to discriminate against the elderly and those with preexisting conditions by charging them higher premiums.\n\nPurpura says insurers stand to benefit from younger, healthy people renewing their plans, but this demographic might be better off going to the exchanges. Some consumers may be eligible for subsidies or may find lower-priced plans on state-exchanges, he says, which is why shopping around during open enrollment is key.\n\n\u201cOpen enrollment is exactly that\u2014open enrollment,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can still shop around or apply for any plan that you want. Even if you take the early-renewal option, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t shop during the open enrollment period.\u201d\n\nPurpura says that open enrollment begins on Oct. 1 and ends on March 31, 2014\u2014so consumers can change and update their plans during this time. Those who do not have health insurance may be confused as to whether they should enroll next month or wait until 2014, when coverage will actually kick in, he says.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf you need insurance right away, how do you fill in that gap?\u201d he says. \u201cSome people will have the chance to apply for a non-reform plan, then renew their old plan, and shop multiple times over the next few months.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-10 06:04:57 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Some insurers are reportedly trying to get healthy policyholders to renew their plans ahead of Obamacare\u2019s exchange launch on Oct. 1.
