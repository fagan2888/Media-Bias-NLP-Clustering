O\u2019Hara was coaching the Rattlers.\n\nChris Bocklet and former University of Denver Pioneers standout Eric Law had two goals for Denver, which got on the scoreboard first with an unassisted goal from Bocklet, then surrendered five straight tallies to Rochester and trailed 5-1 at the end of the first period.\n\nDenver tightened its defense in the second quarter, allowing only one goal while getting scores from Domenic Sebatiani, Grant and a power-play goal from Bocklet, assisted by Law, to trail 6-4 at halftime.\n\nRochester scored the first two goals after the break, while Law and Jeremy Sieverts scored unassisted goals for Denver. Still, the Outlaws were outscored 4-2 in the third and trailed 10-6 entering the final quarter.\n\nGrant scored two unassisted goals and assisted on a score by Law as the Outlaws drew within one, then, after a Rattlers\u2019 score, Sieverts scored an unassisted two-pointer to tie the game, setting up Snider and Pennington\u2019s heroics.\n\nIt was Denver\u2019s fifth MLL Championship appearance in nine years as a franchise. The Outlaws are the only MLL franchise to make the playoffs in each year of existence.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Outlaws win 2014 Major League Lacrosse championship", "title": "Denver Outlaws win 2014 Major League Lacrosse championship", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/23/denver-outlaws-win-2014-major-league-lacrosse-championship/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140823__lax-outlawsp1.jpg", "height": 459}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140823__lax-outlawsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-23T20:47:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:02:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd06e7\"", "article_summary": "Rochester scored the first two goals after the break, while Law and Jeremy Sieverts scored unassisted goals for Denver.\nThe Outlaws are the only MLL franchise to make the playoffs in each year of existence.\nStill, the Outlaws were outscored 4-2 in the third and trailed 10-6 entering the final quarter.\nGrant scored two unassisted goals and assisted on a score by Law as the Outlaws drew within one, then, after a Rattlers\u2019 score, Sieverts scored an unassisted two-pointer to tie the game, setting up Snider and Pennington\u2019s heroics.\nIt was Denver\u2019s fifth MLL Championship appearance in nine years as a franchise."}
