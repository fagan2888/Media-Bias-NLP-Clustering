It was supposed to be an insult, but now she's embracing it.\n\nThat's because Clinton-the-presidential-candidate has made the Affordable Care Act \u2014 or Obamacare \u2014 the center of her health care plan.\n\nShe's not looking to be a revolutionary like her opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. He wants to replace private health insurance with a universal health care system in which the government pays the bills.\n\nInstead, Clinton has gone all in with Obamacare, embracing the controversial health law and promising to defend and expand it.\n\n\"I am a staunch supporter of President Obama's principal accomplishment, namely the Affordable Care Act,\" she said in a debate in Milwaukee on Feb. 11.\n\nHer plan to expand Obamacare consists of a slew of wonky measures that together are intended to cut costs and improve coverage for patients.\n\n\"There are as many as 20 separate proposals and none of them by themselves are giant proposals. Each one is an incremental step,\" says Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"But taken together it actually is a significant package of what I think of as beyond the ACA, consumer-oriented proposals.\"\n\nAmong the ideas:\n\nCreate a tax credit for people whose out-of-pocket costs amount to more than 5 percent of their income.\n\nGuarantee three sick visits a year to a doctor without having to meet a deductible.\n\nEliminate drug companies' ability to deduct marketing costs from their taxes. No more discounts for all those TV ads hawking pills.\n\nRequire a minimum investment by pharmaceutical companies in research and development.\n\nMake it harder for health insurance companies to merge.\n\nAltman says Kaiser Family Foundation polls show voters are frustrated because they keep paying more for health care. Employers are shifting more and more of their health care costs onto employees. As a result, deductibles have more than tripled in the past 10 years and copays are also on the rise.\n\nClinton's proposals are designed to reduce those out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\"Her bona fides as knowledgeable on health insurance really are beyond question whether you agree with her proposals or not,\" says Henry Aaron, a health care economist at the Brookings Institution. \"And she understands that a lot of the changes are down in the weeds.\"\n\nBut this smorgasbord of tweaks doesn't generate huge applause like Sanders does when he promises free health care for everyone.\n\nAnd many in the health care industry \u2014 including drug manufacturers \u2014 are gearing up to oppose her proposals to reduce costs by putting tighter regulations on how they do business.\n\n\"Putting in place onerous regulations and mandates that make it harder to develop new treatments and cures for patients is the wrong approach,\" says Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the lobbying group for the drug industry.\n\nZirkelbach says medications hold down health costs because they keep people out of the hospital, which is far more expensive than almost any prescription drug. Clinton, he says, shouldn't be making drug companies the bad guys.\n\n\"These proposals are being driven by the false notion that medicine spending is what is fueling rising health care costs in this country,\" Zirkelbach says.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Rather than sweeping reform, Clinton's health plan is a collection of tweaks to the Affordable Care Act.
