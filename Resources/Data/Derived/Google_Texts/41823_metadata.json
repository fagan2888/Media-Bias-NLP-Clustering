Midwest states are higher, with 27 percent. No data were available for Michigan.\n\nThose Michigan employers that do nothing to reduce costs expect to see health benefit costs rise 10.2 percent. This year Mercer surveyed more than 100 Michigan companies, including 52 Detroit employers.\n\nNationally, health benefit costs rose only 2.1 percent in 2013, a dramatic decline from 4.1 percent in 2012. Cost increases also declined to 6.1 percent in 2011 from 6.9 percent in 2010, Mercer said.\n\n\u201cA good portion of the decline (nationally) is the small employers\u201d that were very aggressive in using consumer-driven health plans to reduce costs, Konal said.\n\nWhile all employers experienced savings on their health benefit plans this year, cost savings were strongest for employers with 10 to 499 employees.\n\nAverage costs for smaller employers rose only 1 percent while increasing 3.7 percent for employers with 5,000 or more workers, Mercer said.\n\nIn addition, \u201cWe are also seeing (cost reductions) from health management,\u201d Konal said, \u201cA high percentage of employers are using health management to control costs.\u201d\n\nHealth management tools include workplace wellness programs, health risk assessments and tobacco-use surcharges.\n\nBut Konal said Mercer thinks small employers expect those health benefit costs to spike upward in 2014. And nationally, all employers expect cost increases to jump up to 5.2 percent next year.\n\n\u201cMany groups have hit the wall,\u201d Konal said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have much more room to shift the costs.\u201d\n\nIn Michigan, here are some other highlights\n\nIn 2013, 37 percent of respondents offered a consumer-directed health plan with an account feature \u2014 health savings account or health reimbursement account.\n\n72 percent of all employees covered in respondents\u2019 health plans are enrolled in a preferred provider organization or point-of-service plan, 15 percent in health maintenance organizations and 14 percent in consumer-driven health plans.\n\nThe average employee contribution amount for employee-only coverage is $103 monthly for a PPO/POS plan and $118 monthly for an HMO plan. The Detroit figure was statistically insignificant for consumer-driven health plans, but across Michigan, the average employee-only contribution is $69.\n\nMercer also surveyed employers on whether they plan to terminate their medical plans within the next five years after the state health insurance exchanges offer individuals coverage options through healthcare.gov.\n\nEleven Some 11 percent of Detroit companies said they are likely or very likely to terminate coverage, compared with 6 percent of large employers nationally and 31 percent of small employers nationally.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s triggering these employers is continued cost increases,\u201d Konal said. \u201cThey are saying they are likely or very likely, but it is not absolute. They will carefully look at the market and the increase at rates. Can they continue? Many will because they have to be competitive.\u201d\n\nMercer also said the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, could boost spending next year, depending on how many employees choose to be covered.\n\nFor example, Konal said, many employers anticipate spending more to cover more employees in 2014. Obamacare requests most people to obtain health insurance by March 31 or face a first-year penalty of at least $95.\n\nMercer said 22 percent of an average employer\u2019s eligible employees waive coverage for themselves \u2014 because they have coverage through another plan or because they choose to be uninsured.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of unknowns when it comes to enrollment,\u201d Konal said. \u201cA big question is how many employees will enroll for the first time, given that the tax penalty for not obtaining coverage is relatively small.\u201d\n\nKonal said an employer might wind up covering more dependents if others in the area have made changes to discourage their employees from enrolling dependents.\n\nEmployers are also expected to continue the trend to increase employee contributions for dependent coverage (18 percent) or employee-only coverage (10 percent).\n\nSome employers already impose a surcharge on premium contributions for spouses who have other coverage available (9 percent of large employers) or even make them ineligible for coverage (7 percent of large employers), Mercer said.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Michigan\u2019s total health benefit costs for active employees increased 5.1 percent in 2013 to an average of $11,151 per employee, compared with a 5.4 percent increase for 2012 respondents, according to Mercer\u2019s 2013 National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Michigan\u2019s total health benefit costs for active employees increased 5.1 percent in 2013 to an average of $11,151 per employee, compared with a 5.4 percent increase for 2012 respondents, according to Mercer\u2019s 2013 National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans.", "title": "Switch to high-deductible plans to help curb employer health benefit costs, survey finds", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20131120/NEWS/131129983/switch-to-high-deductible-plans-to-help-curb-employer-health-benefit", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/Assets/rwd/C-Block_RWD.png?v=201503291736", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Health care reform", "published_time": "2013-11-20T15:25:11-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-20T15:28:00-05:00"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb23e\"", "article_summary": "Switch to high-deductible plans to help curb employer health benefit costs, survey findsMichigan\u2019s total health benefit costs for active employees increased 5.1 percent in 2013 to an average of $11,151 per employee, compared with a 5.4 percent increase for 2012 respondents, according to Mercer\u2019s 2013 National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans.\nThose Michigan employers that do nothing to reduce costs expect to see health benefit costs rise 10.2 percent.\nNationally, health benefit costs rose only 2.1 percent in 2013, a dramatic decline from 4.1 percent in 2012.\nBut for 2014, Michigan employers project employee benefit costs to increase 5.7 percent as companies continue to change benefit plans, primarily going to lower-cost, high-deductible plans.\nThe Detroit figure was statistically insignificant for consumer-driven health plans, but across Michigan, the average employee-only contribution is $69."}
