The deadline for enrollment is March 31, 2014. The center is located at 2900 S. Harbor Blvd, Santa Ana, CA 92704. Quote Selection invites anyone who needs help enrolling to contact the center directly at (800) 707-8581 to explore the various options at no cost.\n\nGeorge Balteria, CEO of Quote Selection Insurance Services states, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to go to the Covered California website on your own and spend hours trying to learn and figure everything out, then being able to successfully navigate the site, and lastly but most importantly, enrolling correctly (with no mistakes) so there are no hold-ups or coverage denials. It\u2019s another to use a licensed professional who has done this hundreds of times in a face-to-face environment, someone who can truly help people decide which options meet their needs, budget and lifestyle. In addition, having someone available who can assist with future questions or concerns is a huge benefit.\u201d\n\nThe staff at the Enrollment Center are committed to making the somewhat stressful task of fully understanding and successfully enrolling with Covered California into a painless, easy, and fun experience. Individuals who are having trouble contacting California\u2019s state exchange, navigating the Covered California website, or who need clarification or reassurance regarding The Affordable Care Act, should contact the center today.\n\nAdam Tolin, CFO of Quote Selection Insurance Services insists, \u201cWith the deadline of March 31, 2014 quickly approaching, those of us at the Enrollment Center here in Santa Ana are doing everything in our power to help educate, assist, guide, and enroll as many individuals as possible before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Adam has been a health insurance professional for the 13 years and currently owns and operates an insurance brokerage in Orange County, CA.\n\nAbout Quote Selection\n\nQuote Selection Insurance Services, Inc is a business-to-consumer insurance agency that delivers various insurance products to individuals, families and small businesses.
