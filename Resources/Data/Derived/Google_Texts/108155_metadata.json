(Photo: Jason Davis, Getty Images)\n\nThis is one way to spend your summer vacation: Vice President Joe Biden, ensconced at a South Carolina resort, was calling old friends and potential allies to discuss the possibilities and problems of jumping into the Democratic presidential race after most pols assumed the field was complete.\n\nIf he did, what would it mean for him, for Hillary Clinton, for the Democratic Party \u2014 and for the Republican opposition?\n\nHistory says he\u2019s likely to run. \u201cSince 1940, only three of those elected as vice president did not either run for president or become president: Alben Barkley, Spiro Agnew and Dick Cheney,\u201d Democratic strategist Peter Fenn notes.\n\nBut Fenn adds that today\u2019s politics are cautionary: \u201cIt will be a hard slog for Biden on many fronts \u2014 money, organization, articulating a compelling reason for getting in late.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 political landscape for Democrats has been shaped by the assumption that Clinton is the all-but-certain nominee, even in the face of a rising challenge by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. If Biden ran, that landscape would shift.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden's entrance would completely alter the Democratic primary fight,\u201d says Democratic strategist Joe Trippi, campaign manager of Howard Dean\u2019s presidential campaign in 2004. \u201cSanders needs someone else to split the establishment party vote with Hillary Clinton. Right now he is on the losing end of a 60-40 or 65-35 split in the party. Even if Biden got in and only took 15 or 20 points, most of that would come from Clinton. Suddenly a 45-40-15 or 40-35-20 race would be a problem for Clinton and a boost for Sanders.\u201d\n\nIt would be, as the vice president famously whispered to Obama after the Affordable Care Act was signed, \u201ca big (bleeping) deal.\u201d\n\nHere are four reasons why.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) on USA TODAY's Capital Download (Photo: Jeff Franko, USAT)\n\n1. For Democrats: Establishment voters and donors who are uneasy about Hillary Clinton would have a place to go, or an excuse to wait.\n\n\u201cBiden offers political antacid for the Clinton indigestion,\u201d says veteran Republican strategist Ken Khachigian.\n\nThe former secretary of State remains in a commanding position, despite controversies about Clinton Foundation fundraising and her use of a private email server while at the State Department. A record number of Democratic elected officials already have endorsed her, and national polls show a majority of likely Democratic voters continue to support her.\n\nThat said, questions about and investigations into her emails are fueling concerns even among some allies about whether these and other controversies down the road could undermine her ability to win the White House.\n\n\"We are going to follow the facts wherever they go,\" South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Benghazi Committee, said on Fox News Sunday. \"If that impacts people's perception of her fitness to be commander in chief, so be it.\" Clinton is scheduled to testify before the committee on Oct. 22.\n\nA bid by Biden \u2014 call it the Democrats\u2019 Plan B \u2014 could offer a credible alternative, albeit at the risk of a more divisive campaign.\n\n\u201cIn case of party emergency, here\u2019s Joe,\u201d political scientist Dante Scala of the University of New Hampshire puts it, though he\u2019s not convinced the modern political process makes that a feasible scenario. \u201cThat worked 50 years ago for Hubert Humphrey, but of course party elites controlled the process (then) in a way they don\u2019t now.\u201d\n\nA Gallup Poll released last week found Democrats split down the middle on whether Biden should run: 45% in favor, 47% against.\n\n\u201cYou can take that as a glass half-full or half-empty for Biden,\u201d Democratic pollster Margie Omero says. Still, \u201cBiden would need to find a non-Clinton/non-Sanders base. I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a sizable group of low-hanging fruit waiting for him.\u201d\n\nSanders promised \"an issue-oriented campaign\" if Biden does run. Asked on NBC's Meet the Press whether the vice president's entry would help or hurt his own campaign, the senator demurred. \"We'll let the political pundits determine that,\" he said.\n\nPresident Obama golfs on Aug. 15 on Martha's Vineyard (Photo: Steven Senne, AP)\n\n2. For President Obama: It would put him in a political pickle.\n\nA Biden campaign would pit Obama\u2019s vice president against his former secretary of State. Where would Obama\u2019s loyalties lie?\n\nWhen Clinton announced her campaign last spring, Obama praised her as \u201ctalented, tenacious\u201d and \u201ca friend of mine\u201d who \u201cwould be an excellent president.\u201d But White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he wouldn\u2019t endorse her because Biden and others were still considering running.\n\nJoshua Alcorn, a senior adviser to Draft Biden 2016, said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union Sunday that one of the group\u2019s main goals is to \u201cremind people\u201d about \u201chis close relationship with the president.\u201d\n\nObama isn\u2019t on the ballot in 2016, but the coalition he forged \u2014 African-Americans, young people, women and Hispanics \u2014 will be crucial for any Democratic candidate to hold.\n\n\u201cNo one currently in the race can mount much of a challenge to Hillary Clinton among African-American voters\u201d once the primaries move past the opening contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trippi says. \u201cJoe Biden, as vice president to Barack Obama, would present a viable challenge to her in the African-American community, and the winner of that fight would probably emerge as the nominee.\u201d\n\nThe outcome of the 2016 election is crucial for Obama\u2019s own legacy. If a Democrat wins the White House, Obama wouldn\u2019t have to worry about a Republican successor trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act or reverse the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to do. Only once since World War II has a party managed to hold the White House for a third consecutive term. But the election of George H.W. Bush in 1988 was one factor in solidifying Ronald Reagan\u2019s record as a conservative icon who changed the nation\u2019s political direction.\n\nHillary Clinton at the Iowa State Fair Saturday.

For Hillary Clinton: Bad news at first, but perhaps good news over time.\n\nA primary contest between Clinton and Biden would be a contrast in persona, not policy. The two espouse similar positions on most issues, but they offer very different strengths and weaknesses on the campaign trail: A disciplined candidate with the baggage of controversies (Clinton) vs. a happier warrior prone to gaffes (Biden).\n\nAlcorn, a former campaign aide to Biden\u2019s son, Beau, calls the vice president \u201cthe original authentic candidate.\u201d Biden\u2019s off-color comment to the president as Obamacare was signed in 2010 captures the strengths and risks that entails.\n\n\u201cThe very things that make Biden likable as vice president \u2014 his penchant for off-the-cuff, ill-conceived remarks \u2014 make him difficult to see as presidential,\u201d Scala says.\n\nFor Clinton, beating Biden in the primaries could demonstrate her ability to dispatch a formidable opponent.\n\n\"She benefits from a perception that she withstood tough challenges,\u201d Omero says.\n\n\"In the first few weeks, Biden would be a drag on her,\u201d Khachigian predicts. \u201cBut if he can\u2019t get funding, is unwilling to throw some punches and doesn\u2019t have organization, then HRC outlasts him with staying power, and \u2014 perversely \u2014 beating back his challenge could strengthen her.\u201d\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on Aug. 14 after a speech in New York. (Photo: Bryan Thomas, Getty Images)\n\n4. For Republicans: A generational contrast.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and others in the Republican field have been arguing they represent a new generation in American politics \u2014 a jibe directed in part at former Florida governor Jeb Bush but also at Clinton.\n\nThe 2016 election \u201cis a generational choice,\u201d Rubio said when he announced his campaign in April.\n\nBiden, who is 72, would reinforce the image of the Democratic field as reflecting an older generation. Clinton is 67; Sanders is 73. If he runs, the average age of the six Democratic candidates would be 66. The only one under 60 \u2014 indeed, the only one younger than Obama \u2014 is former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, 52.\n\nThe average age of the 17 Republican candidates is 58. Four of them are in their 40s: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Rubio and Walker.\n\nBut Biden\u2019s age may be a factor that encourages him to run.\n\n\u201cWhether Joe gets in depends on one thing: If he didn\u2019t give it one last shot, how would he feel when he sees the new president inaugurated in January 2017?\u201d Khachigian says.\n\nThe clock is ticking. If Biden decides to run, he\u2019ll have to scramble to raise millions of dollars, create a campaign infrastructure in the early states and begin to meet primary filing deadlines in November in New Hampshire, South Carolina and several other states.\n\nPlace your bets: The first real deadline may be announcing in time to participate in the first Democratic debate, hosted by CNN on Oct. 13 in Nevada.\n\nFollow @SusanPage on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TKTsn6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "This is one way to spend your summer vacation: Vice President Joe Biden, ensconced at a South Carolina resort, is calling old friends and potential allies to discuss the possibilities and problems of jumping in the Democratic presidential race after", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "This is one way to spend your summer vacation: Vice President Joe Biden, ensconced at a South Carolina resort, is calling old friends and potential allies to discuss the possibilities and problems of jumping in the Democratic presidential race after", "title": "Four ways Biden could upend the 2016 race for everyone", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/16/biden-decision-obama-clinton-2016-change-bush/31814067/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This is one way to spend your summer vacation: Vice President Joe Biden, ensconced at a South Carolina resort, is calling old friends and potential allies to discuss the possibilities and problems of jumping in the Democratic presidential race after", "title": "Four ways Biden could upend the 2016 race for everyone", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7ff9c70416611d0a7398abbf0295d3409fb8320/c=448-0-2635-2187&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635753260129363915-GTY-484141050-75158554.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/University of New Hampshire", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/University of New Hampshire", "title": "Four ways Biden could upend the 2016 race for everyone", "author": "Susan Page", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/64cb4ace71ba1248a7b8f76c18cdd35619bc621e/c=967-0-2607-2187/local/-/media/2015/08/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635753260129363915-GTY-484141050-75158554.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffbf69d2bd336891c575088cdb9902991ef44f77/c=448-0-2635-2187/local/-/media/2015/08/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635753260129363915-GTY-484141050-75158554.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8bd6b3c7f1adfc7db22411dc66a6a86b73add763/c=63-0-2972-2187/local/-/media/2015/08/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635753260129363915-GTY-484141050-75158554.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bdc405dd1680a27f07190515dc77ec4aa16e2d19/c=0-145-2998-1839&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635753260129363915-GTY-484141050-75158554.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-08-16T19:26:44.670000-04:00", "shorthed": "Four ways Biden could upend the 2016 campaign", "articleid": 31814067, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f872ffb8657b60b60f5ecadcc7666d7f088f1b5d/c=0-145-2998-1839/local/-/media/2015/08/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635753260129363915-GTY-484141050-75158554.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c9c4709c9d8eac45ad806f229a69b844d96d75fc/c=930-0-2155-2187/local/-/media/2015/08/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/635753260129363915-GTY-484141050-75158554.JPG"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ec1\"", "article_summary": "Vice President Joe Biden speaks in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Aug. 15.\n\u201cYou can take that as a glass half-full or half-empty for Biden,\u201d Democratic pollster Margie Omero says.\nA Biden campaign would pit Obama\u2019s vice president against his former secretary of State.\nIf he did, what would it mean for him, for Hillary Clinton, for the Democratic Party \u2014 and for the Republican opposition?\n\u201cThe very things that make Biden likable as vice president \u2014 his penchant for off-the-cuff, ill-conceived remarks \u2014 make him difficult to see as presidential,\u201d Scala says."}
