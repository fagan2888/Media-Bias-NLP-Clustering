Spencer Green An enrollment counselor helps Jerome Davis Jr. 36, sign up for Medicaid in Chicago.\n\nBy the end of Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period, six million additional low-income Americans were enrolled in public insurance programs compared to the period before the health law\u2019s coverage expansion, according to a new report from the Health and Human Services Department. The new enrollees were most highly concentrated in the states that agreed to expand their Medicaid programs.\n\nThose six million people \u2014 who include enrollees in both Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) \u2014 are in addition to the eight million Americans who signed up for private plans on Obamacare\u2019s state level insurance markets between October and April. Government officials are cautioning that the number of new public insurance enrollees may actually be even higher than that, since not every state has reported their data yet. And unlike the open enrollment period for the private marketplaces, people can enroll in Medicaid year round.\n\nHowever, those gains aren\u2019t being shared equally across states. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen for months, growth was more pronounced in states that adopted the Medicaid expansion: Enrollment in those states rose by 15.3 percent compared to the average enrollment from July through September 2013 while states that have not expanded reported only a 3.3 percent increase in enrollment during that same time period,\u201d health officials explained in a blog post.\n\nThe disparity between the expansion and non-expansion states isn\u2019t surprising. For months, the uninsurance rate has been falling faster in the states that have embraced the central tenets of Obamacare, including the expansion of Medicaid coverage to additional low-income residents. Meanwhile, thanks to GOP lawmakers\u2019 continued resistance to this aspect of health reform, some of the poorest Americans have been locked out of health reform altogether.\n\nNot every person who signed up for Medicaid over the past six months was a direct beneficiary of Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the program. Some of them were likely simply re-enrolling in coverage. Others, such as the new enrollees in the states that didn\u2019t agree to expand Medicaid, may have already been eligible for coverage, but didn\u2019t sign up until the news coverage around Obamacare made them more aware of their health care options. Health policy analysts call that the \u201cwoodwork effect.\u201d\n\nStill, the Department of Health and Human Services notes that Obamacare is playing a big role. \u201cBecause of the Affordable Care Act, many consumers now have access to new, affordable, private health insurance options in the Health Insurance Marketplace, while many others are now eligible for their state\u2019s Medicaid programs,\u201d officials write.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "But there would be even more new enrollees if GOP-led states agreed to expand Medicaid.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "But there would be even more new enrollees if GOP-led states agreed to expand Medicaid.", "title": "Since Obamacare Enrollment Began, 6 Million More People Have Gained Public Insurance", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/06/04/3444995/obamacare-medicaid-six-million/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP49671921375.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But there would be even more new enrollees if GOP-led states agreed to expand Medicaid.", "title": "Since Obamacare Enrollment Began, 6 Million More People Have Gained Public Insurance", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP49671921375-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP49671921375.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP49671921375.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-04T14:37:11+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fb9\"", "article_summary": "Health Since Obamacare Enrollment Began, 6 Million More People Have Gained Public Insurance CREDIT: AP Photo/M.\n\u201cBecause of the Affordable Care Act, many consumers now have access to new, affordable, private health insurance options in the Health Insurance Marketplace, while many others are now eligible for their state\u2019s Medicaid programs,\u201d officials write.\nAnd unlike the open enrollment period for the private marketplaces, people can enroll in Medicaid year round.\nBy the end of Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period, six million additional low-income Americans were enrolled in public insurance programs compared to the period before the health law\u2019s coverage expansion, according to a new report from the Health and Human Services Department.\nThose six million people \u2014 who include enrollees in both Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) \u2014 are in addition to the eight million Americans who signed up for private plans on Obamacare\u2019s state level insurance markets between October and April."}
