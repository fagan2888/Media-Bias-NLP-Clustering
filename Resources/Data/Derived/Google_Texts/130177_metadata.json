Anyone disagree? No country spends like we do: 17 percent of our gross domestic product the past four years, in fact, according to the World Bank. No other country\u2014rich, poor, big, small, frozen, tropical, whatever\u2014comes close. (OK, except for the tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu. Really.)\n\nNow here come biosimilars. They\u2019re lower-priced copycat versions of some of the world\u2019s most lucrative drugs, and in the next few years, they\u2019re aiming squarely to take market share from flagship biotech products such as adalimumab (Humira), bevacizumab (Avastin), filgrastim (Neupogen), and several others that have never seen an off-patent challenge. Even a small bite out of the projected $200 billion-plus in sales of biologic drugs by the end of this decade would help.\n\nSix years after the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, provided the framework to allow biosimilars in the U.S., the first one was finally approved in March: filgrastim-sndz (Zarxio). (I\u2019ll explain the name later.)\n\nIt\u2019s Novartis\u2019s knockoff version of Amgen\u2019s white blood cell booster filgrastim, which the FDA approved all the way back in 1991. Two weeks ago an appeals court gave Zarxio a green light to come to market after a challenge from Amgen delayed it by a few months. Novartis will start sales at a price 15 percent lower than filgrastim, according to Reuters.\n\nSo the gate is now officially open. But how quickly will competitors come rushing through?\n\n\u201cThe underlying challenge is much much much more difficult than anyone thought,\u201d says Coherus BioSciences CEO Dennis Lanfear, taking pains to emphasize his point. Coherus (NASDAQ: CHRS), of Redwood City, CA, is one of just a few venture-backed biotechs to start whole-cloth as a biosimilar maker. It had raised $220 million\u2014about half through private equity sales, and half through collaboration fees and milestones\u2014before going public last November.\n\nIt\u2019s to Lanfear\u2019s advantage to keep competition away, so it\u2019s not surprising he would talk up the difficulty of the business. But other indicators suggest Lanfear is right. One of the early entrants into the business, Merck (NYSE: MRK), curtailed its BioVentures group four years after its ballyhooed launch.\n\nAnother small biotech making biosimilars, Cambridge, MA-based Momenta Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: MNTA), advanced its business in late 2011, announcing a potentially wide-ranging deal with Baxter International (NYSE: BAX). The collaboration could have held up to six programs; instead they\u2019ve settled on one, an adalimumab biosimilar, and are aiming for launch in Europe in 2018, according to recent Momenta filings. (CEO Craig Wheeler did not respond to a request for comment. Early Momenta investor Polaris Partners, which now employs former Momenta CEO Alan Crane, deferred questions to Wheeler.)\n\nIn Europe, where biosimilars have been on the market for nearly a decade, sales have been disappointing. In a few countries, there are scattered successes; in Germany, for example, biosimilars have 55 to 60 percent of the market share for erythropoetin\u2014the red blood cell booster that once helped Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN) become an industry powerhouse\u2014according to Simon Goeller, a McKinsey & Co. partner who specializes in generics and biosimilars. But overall, Goeller says, \u201cpredictions about the growth of the market have been grossly wrong.\u201d\n\nThere are several reasons for the slow uptake. One is physicians\u2019 caution when switching patients who have been on a \u201cbranded\u201d drug to a biosimilar, Goeller says. That caution isn\u2019t likely to dissipate soon, because more and more biosimilars will be monoclonal antibodies, proteins that play a key role in the immune system. Even slight variations, to be expected in biosimilars, can alter the patient\u2019s immune response and cause issues ranging from safety problems to less effective treatment (because the patient\u2019s immune system breaks down the drug before it can help the patient).\n\nWith that, then, I decided after the Zarxio news to ask two questions: How much will biosimilars really help the U.S. reduce its healthcare costs; and how many small, privately-backed companies like Coherus will be able to compete with the big, multinational companies that have already laid significant foundations in the space?\n\nAs I began to ask the first question, I expected optimism. After all, the powerful drug buyer Express Scripts (NYSE: ESRX), which has been out front in the fight to whittle costs of new drugs for hepatitis C and cholesterol reduction, jumped on the biosimilar bandwagon two years ago with predictions that just 11 biosimilar products could generate $250 billion in U.S. savings over 10 years.\n\nBut I immediately got pushback. Sure, biosimilars must save money to catch on, but \u201clet\u2019s be cautious about expectations\u201d about overall healthcare savings, says Goeller. As of 2013, prescription drug sales accounted for slightly less than 10 percent of overall U.S. healthcare costs, according to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nConventional generics have come to dominate the volume of drug prescriptions in the U.S. since the generic drug age began in earnest in 1984; they\u2019re now up to nearly 90 percent. The generic drug trade association, GPHA, says the U.S. saved $239 billion in 2013 by using generics (out of a total prescription drug spend of $271 billion).\n\nBut they are only a slight brake on healthcare costs. The past two decades, overall U.S. healthcare expenditures per capita have risen 240 percent, according to the World Bank.\n\nAdding to the tempered expectations for biosimilars as cost-cutters is the fact that they won\u2019t be as cheap or easy \u2026 Next Page \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Xconomy", "description": "Americans need to spend less on healthcare.
