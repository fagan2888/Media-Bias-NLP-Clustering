NASHUA, N.H.—Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., outlined his vision for “a new American century” during his first visit to New Hampshire since announcing his presidential campaign.

“I believe with all my heart that America’s greatest days are right around the corner,” said Rubio at today’s First in the Nation Leadership Summit.

Rubio said America should remain a place where hard work and freedom result in opportunity and prosperity.

Americans must understand they’re in a “global completion for investment, for innovation and for talent,” Rubio said, and that a burdensome tax code his “crushing innovation and holding people back.” He said Obamacare must be repealed and replaced, and that America’s energy policy must be reformed so that we can utilize more of our natural resources.

“These are our challenges, they are also our opportunities,” said Rubio.

He said fixing these issues would result in better-paying jobs.

The 2016 election, according to Rubio, is a “referendum on our identity.”

“The fundamental question before us is: What kind of country do we want to be? Do we want to remain special or are we prepared to become just like everybody else?” he asked.

“I believe with all my heart that America’s greatest days are right around the corner,” says @MarcoRubio.

Rubio also poked fun at potential Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.

“Scott Brown tonight let me know that Hillary Clinton is going to raise $2.5 billion,” said Rubio. “That’s a lot of Chipotle, my friends.”

Asked by an audience member which Democrats he gets along with, Rubio responded, “Well, I think I get along personally with everyone, even with people that call me a loser.”
