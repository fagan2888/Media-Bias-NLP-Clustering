Robert Latour testified Wednesday that Berry recalled the conversation with her sister during three interviews spanning approximately seven hours \u2013 at first crying so hard he could barely understand her.\n\nBy the third interview, however, \"she became progressively clearer. She became more detailed. She became more consistent,\" he said. \"She had to get it off her chest and tell the truth. It looked like it had weighed on her.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-02-06 05:05:00", "description": "Laura Ackerson's dismembered remains were in such bad condition that North Carolina's chief medical examiner was unable to determine just how the 27-year-old Kinston mother of two died when authorities say she was killed inside the Raleigh apartment of her ex-boyfriend more than three years ago.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-02-06 14:02:34", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13363259|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Laura Ackerson's dismembered remains were in such bad condition that North Carolina's chief medical examiner was unable to determine just how the 27-year-old Kinston mother of two died when authorities say she was killed inside the Raleigh apartment of her ex-boyfriend more than three years ago.", "title": "Testimony: Exact cause of Ackerson's violent death uncertain :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/testimony-exact-cause-of-ackerson-s-violent-death-uncertain/13363259/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/02/05/13363291/13363291-1391640717-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "keywords": "Amanda Hayes, Grant Hayes, Laura Ackerson", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-06T05:05:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Laura Ackerson's dismembered remains were in such bad condition that North Carolina's chief medical examiner was unable to determine just how the 27-year-old Kinston mother of two died when authorities say she was killed inside the Raleigh apartment of her ex-boyfriend more than three years ago.", "title": "Testimony: Exact cause of Ackerson's violent death uncertain :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/testimony-exact-cause-of-ackerson-s-violent-death-uncertain/13363259/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/02/05/13363291/cfl-radisch-725x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8a5\"", "article_summary": "\"In my opinion, this was a death due to external means, and that the external means were intentionally inflicted, but I cannot tell you for sure what the cause of death was,\" she told jurors.\nAmanda Hayes murder trial testimony (Day 7)\"My opinion as to the cause of death in this case was undetermined homicidal violence,\" Dr. Deborah Radisch testified Wednesday in the trial of Amanda Smith Hayes, 41, who is accused of first-degree murder and accessory after the fact to murder in the July 13, 2011, death.\nGrant Hayes, 34, was convicted of the crime in September and is serving life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nThe sister, Karen Berry, who led Raleigh police to the creek when they showed up knocking on her door, testified Wednesday that Amanda Hayes also admitted to killing Ackerson during an argument.\n\"She had to get it off her chest and tell the truth."}
