Both smashed their heads against the dash leaving them concussed and the rest of the story very foggy.\n\n\"He got out and was walking around, had blood coming out of his eyes,\" Klusener said.\n\nNow that both are out of the hospital and have had time to reflect, the couple realizes how close they came to losing it all while Dell did everything he could to prevent the emergency landing from harming others.\n\n\"It's fortunate that no one else got hurt,\" he said.\n\n\"He did his job and that's how we're alive right now,\" Klusener said.\n\nDell says his two years of flying experience helped him keep calm during a frightening ordeal. They are still waiting for the results of the ongoing FAA investigation as to what went wrong with the rental plane's engine.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Christian Dell and Nicole Klusener say they're thankful to be alive as a pilot's greatest fear came to life.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Christian Dell and Nicole Klusener say they're thankful to be alive as a pilot's greatest fear came to life.", "title": "Andover teens reflect on emergency landing", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Andover-teens-reflect-on-emergency-landing-372887901.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/B69/75F/B6975F729C7F494BA9B2962433647DE5", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/24F/9BE/24F9BE4FC8A14A21817A7E4231AC012D.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Christian Dell and Nicole Klusener say they're thankful to be alive as a pilot's greatest fear came to life.", "title": "Andover teens reflect on emergency landing", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Andover-teens-reflect-on-emergency-landing-372887901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/plane+crash+tallgrass.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Andover teens reflect on emergency landing", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Andover teens reflect on emergency"}, "article_summary": "The Andover teens crashed a private plane onto Tallgrass Country Club after the aircraft's engine gave out Friday afternoon.\nDell and Klusener were getting close to their landing point at Jabara Airport when something went horribly wrong.\nMore Video...Christian Dell and Nicole Klusener say they're thankful to be alive as a pilot's greatest fear came to life.\nThey are still waiting for the results of the ongoing FAA investigation as to what went wrong with the rental plane's engine.\nThe rental plane's engine gave out as the couple was making their decent."}
