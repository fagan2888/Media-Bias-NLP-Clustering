The good news is it could be worse.

While a monster of a nor'easter is expected to develop early this week, recent forecast data suggests the storm will remain far enough off the East Coast to spare New Jersey from its worst impacts.

"It looks like it's going to remain well off-shore, so that's good news for people who don't like snow," said Sarah Johnson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Mount Holly office. "Right now it looks like a rain/snow mix changing over to mostly snow Tuesday and Tuesday night ... But it looks like more of a glancing blow."

Still, it does appear New Jersey will face at least one more bout with winter weather. Temperatures are expected to remain unseasonably cold for much of the week and Johnson said current forecast guidance suggests up to 4 inches of snow could fall in New Jersey as the storm passes the state.

The forecast remains somewhat uncertain, however, and if the storm tracks farther west, the impacts for New Jersey could be greater.

"Rapidly intensifying storms need to be respected," wrote Gary Szatkowski, meteorologist-in-charge at Mount Holly on his personal Twitter account this morning. "Even small shifts of the track closer to coast will mean significant forecast changes."

For the winter weather-weary, it appears more good news will follow the storm. Temperatures are expected to crest into the 60s in some places by Friday and the 8 to 14-day forecast (typically fairly accurate for temperatures) predicts the state will see above average temperatures in the coming weeks.

Johnson would not rule this week's bout with cold and snow to be the end of winter weather for the state, but said with each passing day that becomes more and more likely.

"I'm not so bold as to say this is the last time we'll see snow — we've had snow in April before — but eventually spring will come," she said.
