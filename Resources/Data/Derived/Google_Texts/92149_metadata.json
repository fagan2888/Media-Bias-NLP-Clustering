Facebook: Ruth Iorio\n\nWhen Ruth Fowler Iorio decided to document her home birth on social media for family and friends, she probably didn\u2019t predict that the photos would cause a media firestorm. But now, just three weeks after giving birth to a healthy baby boy, her photos have gone completely viral and spurred an interesting discussion. Was she oversharing, or are we as a society too sensitive?\n\nIn December, Iorio went into labor with her son and documented the whole thing in a series of posts on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Her thoughts and photos were uncensored because she wanted to document her birthing experience in a way that felt authentic, The Huffington Post reported. Iorio cursed, she pooped, she bathed, and eventually she gave birth \u2014 all in front of her social media friends. After finally meeting her bouncing baby boy, she found that her photos had been flagged and her account was temporarily taken down. \u201cI\u2019ve had a few people, crazy horrible trolls, [who] keep reporting my photos as pornography, so they\u2019ve actually cancelled my Facebook account,\u201d she said.\n\nFacebook Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook Facebook\n\nIt feels counterintuitive to say that planned home births are a growing trend because women gave birth in their homes with the help of midwives for centuries before going to hospitals became the norm \u2014 but they are. Though home births give mothers the comfort of wearing their own clothes, being in a familiar environment, and controlling their labor position, most women opt to deliver their babies in a hospital for the security of knowing there\u2019s a full staff that can handle any medical complication that may occur. Culturally, mothers who opt for natural birth are stereotyped as being anti-medication and anti-hospital, a generalization that Iorio acknowledges.\n\n\"In the U.S., the natural home birthers are divided into the crunchy-granola-munchers, and then there are the epidural lot who don't question going to hospital. I don't fit either of those stereotypes. I'm somewhere in the middle,\" Iorio told The Telegraph. \u201cI know homebirth isn\u2019t for everyone, but we need to question what\u2019s happening. The U.S. is basically trying to get rid of midwives.\u201d\n\nIorio\u2019s message is clear and her photos show both the beauty and the pain of childbirth.
