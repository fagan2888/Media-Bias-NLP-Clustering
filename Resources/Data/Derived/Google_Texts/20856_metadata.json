Anyone who needs health insurance can purchase coverage here. If you are not sure how to get started, run through our free interactive online tool, HealthLawHelper, which will point you in the right direction.\n\nOnce you register on the marketplace, you can find out whether you qualify for a financial help with your premiums, and out-of-pocket costs. You can then shop for and compare different plans and enroll in the plan of your choice right then and there. Learn more about selecting the right plan for you.\n\nDo I have to go without insurance until the next open enrollment period?\n\nNo, you can get new insurance right away.\n\nIt is true that under normal circumstances you can\u2019t purchase insurance on your own unless it\u2019s open enrollment season, which this year runs from Nov. 15, 2014, through Feb. 15, 2015.\n\nBut if you are in any of the situations described above (plus several more), you can purchase replacement coverage on the marketplace at any time of year. What to do: log into or create an account on your state\u2019s marketplace, then ask for what\u2019s called a Special Enrollment Period. Once it\u2019s confirmed, you\u2019re free to shop for new health coverage.\n\nWhat kinds of situations entitle you to this Special Enrollment Period?\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of \u201cqualifying life events\u201d that allow you to purchase new health insurance any time of year.\n\nLosing coverage from a job (quit or were laid off, doesn\u2019t matter).\n\nExpiration of your current health plan, including COBRA.\n\nComing to the end of your current plan\u2019s contracted \u201cplan year.\u201d\n\nAging off your parent\u2019s plan when you turn 26.\n\nLosing coverage through a spouse because of death or divorce.\n\nLosing your student plan when you graduate.\n\nMoving to a new location outside your current plan\u2019s service area.\n\nGetting out of jail.\n\nMoving back to the U.S. after having lived abroad.\n\nBecoming \u201clawfully present\u201d in the United States. In general this means you are allowed to live in the United States on something other than a temporary tourist visa. Here\u2019s a more detailed definition.\n\nGetting kicked off of Medicaid or CHIP because your income has gone up.\n\nHaving a baby, adopting a child, or becoming a foster parent.\n\nIf I leave or lose my job, can\u2019t I take COBRA?\n\nYes. For those who don\u2019t know, COBRA is a law from the 1990s that requires most employers to allow departed employees (and their dependents) to stay on their old workplace health plans for another 18 to 36 months. Your COBRA plan will be the exact same plan you had at your old job.\n\nThe downside is you must pay the entire cost of the plan while on COBRA, including the part the employer used to pay. It can easily run to $700 a month or more for an individual and more than $1,000 a month for a family.\n\nStarting from the day your regular employer coverage ends (it\u2019s usually the last day of the month you left your job, but check to be sure), you have up to 60 days to decide whether or not to take COBRA. If you sign up at any point during that period, your coverage will be retroactive, provided you pay the back premiums.\n\nWhich is better, COBRA or buying my own marketplace plan?\n\nIt depends. During your 60-day grace period you should definitely check out your options on the marketplace to see what kind of financial help you can get, and select some plans you think you might like. When you give your income information to the marketplace, you will also find out whether you may qualify for Medicaid for yourself or CHIP for your children. Then you can compare your marketplace options to the COBRA plan.\n\nIn most situations the marketplace plan will probably be cheaper than COBRA. But there are other things to consider, too:\n\nIf it\u2019s later in the year, you may have met your work plan\u2019s deductible, whereas if you start a new plan, you\u2019ll have to meet the new deductible from scratch. Be sure to take this into consideration when you run the numbers.\n\nIf you are in the middle of treatment for a serious condition, check to see whether your providers take part in any marketplace plans.\n\nCan I take COBRA and pick up a marketplace plan later?\n\nOnce you start COBRA, you have to keep it until the next open enrollment period or until the COBRA plan runs out, whichever comes first. So if you start COBRA in, say, March, you will have to keep it until open enrollment comes around. At that point you can replace it with a marketplace plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you lose your health insurance, Consumer Reports' health insurance experts tell you what to do.", "Title": "Losing Health Insurance - Consumer Reports News", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/2014/09/losing-your-health-insurance-what-to-do/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/1349101126998.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Losing Health Insurance - Consumer Reports News"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2014-09-29T16:15Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2014-10-02T20:24Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: Losing Health Insurance - Consumer Reports News", "keywords": "lost your health insurance, losing health insurance, need health insurance, Obamacare, special enrollment opportunity, state health insurance marketplace, Health, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance", "contenttag": "Ask Our Health Insurance Expert"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4338\"", "article_summary": "You can find it through your state health insurance marketplace.\nHere\u2019s the full list of \u201cqualifying life events\u201d that allow you to purchase new health insurance any time of year.\nAnyone who needs health insurance can purchase coverage here.\nNo, you can get new insurance right away.\nOnce it\u2019s confirmed, you\u2019re free to shop for new health coverage."}
