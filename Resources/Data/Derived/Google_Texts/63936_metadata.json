By creating competition where there wasn\u2019t competition before, insurers are now eager for business and are lowering premiums to give customers more choice.\u201d\n\nIowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, who chairs the committee, made the same point before introducing Tavenner.\n\n\u201cEveryone should take a deep breath,\u201d Harkin said. \u201cThis is, after all a website. It\u2019s a machine that can be fixed. \u2026 The promise of the ACA is more than just a website.\u201d\n\nEver since Healthcare.gov was launched on Oct. 1, the website meant to be a portal for millions of Americans to purchase newly regulated and subsidized health insurance has instead been a political and public relations disaster, with consumers facing frequent outages and difficulties even signing up to shop for possible insurance options. Officials all the way up to Obama himself have acknowledged the problem, and the administration has promised the site will be working properly by the end of November. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius directly apologized for the website launch during testimony before a House committee last week, saying Americans \u201cdeserve better.\u201d\n\nTennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, the ranking Republican on the Senate committee, reiterated GOP opposition to the law before Tavenner spoke Tuesday.\n\n\u201cObamacare is the wrong direction because it expands the health care delivery system that we already knew costs too much,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A top Obama administration official overseeing the bungled roll-out of the new health care law said Tuesday that the law is already working well and that it's about more than the problem-plagued website causing embarrassment for the White House.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Obama administration official says the health care reform law is already working", "title": "Health Care Official: It\u2019s Not Just a Website | TIME.com", "url": "http://nation.time.com/2013/11/05/tavenner-obamacare-senate-hearing/", "image": "https://timemilitary.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/03936945-copy.jpg?w=600", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Headlines, Stories, Video from Around the Nation", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nation.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/c065f7f4495e21fd12fbfa8af086eafd?s=16", "application-name": "U.S.", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "keywords": "national,", "google-site-verification": "RuBIxOwStTsi-KOuQpMhdd-F4UmaxCoOJAOJ8D2hh8Y", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "national,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd388\"", "article_summary": "\u201cObamacare is the wrong direction because it expands the health care delivery system that we already knew costs too much,\u201d he said.\nMarilyn Tavenner, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told lawmakers that the troubled health insurance exchange website Healthcare.gov is quickly being fixed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the [Affordable Care Act] is more than just a website,\u201d Tavenner said.\n\u201cWe know that the initial consumer experience on healthcare.gov has been frustrating for many Americans,\u201d she said while testifying Tuesday mroning before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\nBut Tavenner and Democrats supportive of the politically divisive law, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature domestic achievement, urged Americans to keep the high-profile technical problems with the website in perspective."}
