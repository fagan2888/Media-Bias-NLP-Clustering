I had hoped to write about “Duck Dynasty” this week, but that will have to wait. I have too much Kwanzaa shopping left to do. (Is it just me, or is Kwanzaa getting way too commercialized?)

Contrary to pundits sniping about Ted Cruz’s campaign to repeal Obamacare, even the most boneheaded liberal ideas never “collapse on their own,” which is why we still have public schools and President Obama. If nothing is done, Kwanzaa will join these horrors in the firmament of American life.

It is a fact that Kwanzaa was invented in 1966 by a black radical FBI stooge, Ron Karenga — aka Dr. Maulana Karenga — founder of United Slaves, a violent nationalist rival to the Black Panthers. He was also a dupe of the FBI.

In what was ultimately a foolish gambit, during the madness of the ’60s, the FBI encouraged the most extreme black nationalist organizations in order to discredit and split the left. The more preposterous the group, the better.

By that criterion, Karenga’s United Slaves was perfect. In the annals of the American ’60s, Karenga was the Father Gapon, stooge of the czarist police.
