The study, published online as a research letter in JAMA Internal Medicine, is accompanied by an editorial recommending that the goal should be nothing short of a \u201ccultural transformation\u201d in how pain is managed.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced the opening of a docket to obtain public comment on the draft CDC Guideline, which summarizes scientific knowledge about the effectiveness and risks of long-term opioid therapy, and provides recommendations for when to initiate or continue opioids for chronic pain; opioid selection, dosage, duration, follow-up, and discontinuation; and for assessing the risk and addressing the harm of opioid use. The draft Guideline also identifies important gaps where more research is needed.\n\nTo develop its recommendations, CDC says it conducted a systematic review of the benefits and harms of opioids and developed the draft Guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. The agency then drafted recommendations and consulted with experts on the evidence to inform the recommendations, hosting webinars in September 2015 and also providing opportunities for stakeholder and peer review of the draft.

The Guideline is not intended to apply to patients being treated for active cancer, is not a federal regulation, and adherence will be voluntary.\n\n\u201cChiropractic physicians are well positioned to play a vital role in the conservative management of acute and chronic pain. They offer complementary and integrative strategies, as well as guidance on self care, that can provide needed relief for many who suffer from pain,\u201d Hamm wrote in the ACA\u2019s letter of formal comment.\n\nAn ACA release notes that the comments submitted by Hamm on behalf of the ACA are part of the chiropractic profession\u2019s ongoing efforts to educate the public about the value of non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical treatments for pain management and health enhancement before moving on to higher risk options.\n\nThe ACA notes that this healthcare model encourages, when appropriate, use of more cost-effective and safer approaches as an alternative to potentially addictive medications, surgery, and other invasive procedures for pain management and health enhancement.\n\nThe ACA observes that healthcare quality watchdog organizations have begun to recognize the value of this conservative approach, noting that in 2015, the Joint Commission, which certifies more than 20,000 healthcare organizations and programs in the U.S.,, revised its pain management standard to include chiropractic services. They report that more than 33.6 million Americans sought chiropractic care in 2014, compared to a previously reported estimate of 20.6 million in 2012.\n\nHamm says in his letter that the ACA strongly believes that federal government healthcare policy should encourage the use of \u2014 and provide access to \u2014 conservative, non-drug, non-surgical chiropractic services. Specifically, he said:\n\n\u2022 Outdated statutory language in Medicare should be changed to allow chiropractic physicians to practice and\n\nbe reimbursed to the fullest extent of their licensure, training and competencies.\n\n\u2022 Doctors of Chiropractic should be appointed as officers in the commissioned Regular Corps and the Ready Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service.\n\n\u2022 Make clear the intent of Sect. 2706 in the Affordable Care Act, to allow patients to see the provider of their choice when seeking treatment for pain and other musculoskeletal conditions.\n\n\u2022 Expand access to chiropractic services in the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense healthcare systems.\n\n\u2022 Expand access to chiropractic services in all other federal health programs, including research programs related to pain management.\n\nComments received by the CDC from the ACA and other groups will be used by the agency to ensure scientific quality and feasibility of the recommendations.\n\nInterested parties may submit comments, identified by Docket No. CDC-2015-0112, by either of the following methods:\n\nFederal eRulemaking portal : http://www.regulations.gov.
