The report indicates that Jindal \u2014 a prospective Republican Presidential candidate \u2014 is facing opposition from a \u201cbig tea party gun.\u201d That opposition is Debbie Dooley, who the article names as one \u201cof the 22 organizers of the first nationwide tea party protests in 2009.\u201d Dooley believes, the paper claims with great excitement, \u201cthat conservative philosophies are not monolithic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should be consistent and not just favor one energy source,\u201d Dooley said. As the chairwoman of Conservatives for Energy Freedom, Dooley has led similar protests against rolling back solar power in Georgia and Florida. [See here and here.] And in a couple of weeks, she\u2019s coming to Louisiana to help in what this state\u2019s solar industry promises will be a full-court press to protect a tax credit it says is instrumental to installing about 15,000 systems that transform the sun\u2019s rays into electricity in individual homes and small businesses, creating about 1,200 jobs along the way. All of that will end, the industry claims, if Gov. Bobby Jindal succeeds in ratcheting back the tax credit, which is due to expire in 2017, as a way to raise revenues.\n\nWell my goodness. The Tea Party is stepping in to save the day by stopping a corporate-owned governor from turning on the little guy. What a romantic story. Thank goodness there are no ulterior motives that have been conveniently left out. Right?\n\nThe Advocate \u2014 and no doubt Dooley\u2019s PR team \u2014 would have us believe that she\u2019s an out of the box, right-thinking tea party \u201cbig gun\u201d who is fighting corporate cronyism. And to prove this, she presents as one of her many credentials the group she founded in 2013 called the Green Tea Coalition. The group is supposedly a conservative, tea party, free market group that happens to support alternative power and sustainability issues (get it? \u201cGreen\u201d). The group is a coalition, which counts among its members no less illustrious tea party names as the Tea Party Patriots, Dooley\u2019s group out of Atlanta, and\u2026 well that\u2019s it. For Tea Partiers anyway.\n\nYou might, however, recognize the names of some of the other members of the coalition: The Sierra Club, Georgia Watch (a pro-Obamacare group), the NAACP, and, oh yeah we forgot, \u2026 OCCUPY ATLANTA.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Dooley\u2019s \u201cGreen Tea\u201d Tea Party-based group for Tea Party values counts organizations like Occupy Atlanta and the AFL-CIO, that have systematically sought to undercut legitimate Tea Party organizations and positions.\n\nIn the coming days, expect to hear a lot from Dooley and her crowd about the lack of \u201ctransparency\u201d of groups that support Governor Jindal\u2019s position. But don\u2019t be fooled. Transparency isn\u2019t something Dooley and her backers are particularly interested in following through on themselves. For example, last year \u2014 in their effort to do work on behalf of Tea Party values \u2014 the Green Tea Coalition made a donation to\u2026 an Occupy protester. Beyond that, Dooley\u2019s financials arrangements have not been much more transparent than that. Still, it does say Tea in the name and everything, so it must be on the \u201cright\u201d side of the issue.\n\nWe\u2019ll be following this story in the coming days\u2026\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7b4\"", "article_summary": "Dooley\u2019s \u201cGreen Tea\u201d Tea Party-based group for Tea Party values counts organizations like Occupy Atlanta and the AFL-CIO, that have systematically sought to undercut legitimate Tea Party organizations and positions.\nFor example, last year \u2014 in their effort to do work on behalf of Tea Party values \u2014 the Green Tea Coalition made a donation to\u2026 an Occupy protester.\nThe Tea Party is stepping in to save the day by stopping a corporate-owned governor from turning on the little guy.\nThe group is a coalition, which counts among its members no less illustrious tea party names as the Tea Party Patriots, Dooley\u2019s group out of Atlanta, and\u2026 well that\u2019s it.\nAnd to prove this, she presents as one of her many credentials the group she founded in 2013 called the Green Tea Coalition."}
