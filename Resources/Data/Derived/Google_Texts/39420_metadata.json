My parents have lived even farther away from most of their grandchildren. According to AARP\u2019s 2012 grandparent study, we are not alone: 43 percent of grandparents have to travel 200-plus miles to see the grandchildren who live farthest from them. It was a challenge, but we spent most of our vacations with my grandparents. They also wrote us letters, and we talked regularly on the phone. These days, I know they would have been even more involved grandparents through the magic of technology.\n\n>> 12 Ways to Cyberproof Your Smartphone\n\nIf you are a long-distance grandparent, yes, you have a disadvantage in that you simply can\u2019t spend as much time with your grandkids. But the secret to bonding with grandchildren is shared experiences, and you can still have those from a distance. Keep these things in mind:\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximize the in-person visits you do have: Create shared memories, have new adventures, interact at your grandchild\u2019s level, and find activities that light up their faces. Follow up with online scrapbooking together and discussions of the experiences you shared.\n\nCreate shared memories, have new adventures, interact at your grandchild\u2019s level, and find activities that light up their faces. Follow up with online scrapbooking together and discussions of the experiences you shared. Use technology to supplement in-person visits: Use video chat (such as Skype, Facetime or Tango) to keep the visuals going and show each other what you\u2019ve been up to, to read books to your grandkids, to \u201cattend\u201d their school programs or extracurricular activities, and to send pictures and videos about your life. Text or use social media with older grandchildren, and take advantage of online games and other apps that cater to grandparents. If you feel uneasy using new technology, try online or in-person technology training (or ask your grandkids to teach you).\n\nUse video chat (such as Skype, Facetime or Tango) to keep the visuals going and show each other what you\u2019ve been up to, to read books to your grandkids, to \u201cattend\u201d their school programs or extracurricular activities, and to send pictures and videos about your life.

Stay up on grandchildren\u2019s activities: Parents hold the keys to this kingdom, so be sure to make it easy for them to inform you of events in your grandchildren\u2019s lives. An online family calendar or website can help you keep up so you can wish your grandkids good luck before a ball game or congratulate them after a piano recital.\n\nParents hold the keys to this kingdom, so be sure to make it easy for them to inform you of events in your grandchildren\u2019s lives.

Go retro: A telephone call is still a good option. And try sending a letter or card via snail mail. Kids don\u2019t get mail very often these days, so it\u2019s extra special. I still have a letter from my grandfather \u2014 written on a piece of birch tree bark he had gathered at our farm.
