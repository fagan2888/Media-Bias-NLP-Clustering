It replaces what was the Samaritan Health Clinic House Raffle, which was established 21 years ago to help provide vital medical and emergency dental services to individuals and families in financial need.\n\nNearly 5,000 tickets were sold in the raffle.\n\n\u201cWe are so grateful for everyone\u2019s dedication,\u201d said Holly Brenner, Agnesian HealthCare Foundation president. Even with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, Brenner said, there is a continued need in the community for services provided by the Samaritan Health Clinic.\n\nMore than 10,000 Fond du Lac County residents and more than 7,900 Dodge County residents are uninsured, Brenner said. As a result, charity care programs, which provide free or low-cost health care to individuals not eligible for affordable health insurance, will continue to play an important role in the healthcare system.\n\nOther prize winners include: second prize, $15,000: Rob Rusniaczek, Fond du Lac; third prize, $10,000: Jeff Grebe, Mount Calvary; fourth prize, $5,000: Linda Marcoe, Fond du Lac; fifth prize, $4,000: Nina Sera, Slinger; sixth prize, $3,000: Laura Launders, Fond du Lac; and seventh prize, $2,000: and Kristina Thalacker, Beaver Dam.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1Tbx03y", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Julie Moyer\u00a0of Fond du Lac\u00a0is the grand prize winner of the Agnesian HealthCare Foundation\u2019s Samaritan $100,000 cash raffle.", "og": {"site_name": "Action Reporter Media", "description": "Julie Moyer\u00a0of Fond du Lac\u00a0is the grand prize winner of the Agnesian HealthCare Foundation\u2019s Samaritan $100,000 cash raffle.", "title": "FDL woman wins $100,000 Samaritan cash raffle", "url": "http://www.fdlreporter.com/story/news/2016/05/11/fdl-woman-wins-100000-samaritan-cash-raffle/84237416/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/fdlreporter.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Julie Moyer\u00a0of Fond du Lac\u00a0is the grand prize winner of the Agnesian HealthCare Foundation\u2019s Samaritan $100,000 cash raffle.", "title": "FDL woman wins $100,000 Samaritan cash raffle", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6c60e95ab015229a57e6a494a0f7c32fd3dfd05/c=1000-0-5000-4000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/11/WIGroup/FondduLac/635985780423595464-Julie-Moyer-Winner-Photo-with-Holly-Brenner.jpg", "creator": "@fdlreporter", "site": "@fdlreporter", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884281456", "fb": {"app_id": 175275349169565}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "The Reporter, Action Reporter Media, Fond du Lac Reporter, Agnesian HealthCare, Samaritan Health Clinic"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd303c\"", "article_summary": "Julie Moyer of Fond du Lac is the grand prize winner of the Agnesian HealthCare Foundation\u2019s Samaritan $100,000 cash raffle.\nJulie Moyer, right, of Fond du Lac, is this year\u2019s grand prize winner of $100,000 in Agnesian HealthCare Foundation\u2019s Samaritan Cash Raffle.\nOther prize winners include: second prize, $15,000: Rob Rusniaczek, Fond du Lac; third prize, $10,000: Jeff Grebe, Mount Calvary; fourth prize, $5,000: Linda Marcoe, Fond du Lac; fifth prize, $4,000: Nina Sera, Slinger; sixth prize, $3,000: Laura Launders, Fond du Lac; and seventh prize, $2,000: and Kristina Thalacker, Beaver Dam.\nHolly Brenner, Agnesian HealthCare Foundation president, presented her with the check.\n\u201cWe are so grateful for everyone\u2019s dedication,\u201d said Holly Brenner, Agnesian HealthCare Foundation president."}
