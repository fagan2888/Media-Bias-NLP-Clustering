A new airline featuring nonstop flights—and free Evian water—has taken to the skies.

OneJet’s nonstop flight service began April 6, flying from Indianapolis to Milwaukee, and the airline will add service to Pittsburgh to its list in early May. Its flights are all direct, and plus, there’s complimentary Evian and newspapers.

The company uses three seven-seat Hawker 400 aircraft to service the three airports, USA Today reports, and only schedules a flight if passengers book tickets.

The highest fare prices will be “two to three times the lowest coach fares” for connecting flights on other airlines, said OneJet CEO Matthew Maguire.
