Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) declared Wednesday that all of the "horror stories" being told in relation to the federal health-care law are false.

"Despite all that good news, there's plenty of horror stories being told," Reid said on the Senate floor. "All of them are untrue, but they're being told all over America."

Reid referred to ads being run by conservative groups featuring the stories of people affected bythe Affordable Care Act. Several of these claims have come into question (including an Americans for Prosperity ad that received two Pinocchios from our own Glenn Kessler).

"Those tales turned out to be just that -- tales, stories made up from whole cloth," Reid said, accusing the Koch brothers of "trying to buy America."

In response to Reid's remarks, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) office sent out dozens of local media clips featuring people whose premiums increased or had other problems related to Obamacare.

Update 1:08 p.m.: Koch spokesman Philip Ellender has released the following statement, noting that the AFP ad features a woman suffering from leukemia:

"While Charles Koch and David Koch were not responsible for the advertisement in question, we believe it is disgraceful that Senator Reid and his fellow Democrats are attacking a cancer victim as part of their campaign against Charles Koch and David Koch."

Update 4:22 p.m.: Reid has now softened his statement -- albeit slightly. He said on the Senate floor: "I can't say that every one of the Koch brothers' ads are a lie, but I'll say this: Mr. President, the vast, vast majority of them are."
