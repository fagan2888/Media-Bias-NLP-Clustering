HHC will take over a three-year $126.6 million contract.\n\nThe end of the Corizon deal, announced Wednesday, was accompanied by a scathing report from the city\u2019s Department of Investigation, which cited poor oversight, disciplinary problems and neglect that may have led to the death of two inmates. It also reflected Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s conviction that basic public services should not be entrusted to for-profit contractors.\n\nBut in moving to assert local control, New York was doing more than simply replacing a vendor that has come under fire. It was joining a trend to streamline care before, during, and after incarceration.\n\n\u201cA substantial portion of folks in Rikers get their care at HHC facilities\u201d when they are not in jail, said Steven Rosenberg, president of Community Oriented Correctional Health Services (COCHS), an Oakland-based non-profit, and an advisor to the New York City Task Force on Behavior Health and Criminal Justice System. \u201cOnce you have a fully integrated system you\u2019re able to create continuity of care so that what happens behind the wall follows up on what happens in the community and what happen in the community follows up on what happens behind the wall,\u201d he said.\n\nThis was not the case under Corizon. Every suspect who entered the Rikers system was treated from scratch, beginning with the post-arraignment physical, even if the person had recently been diagnosed by a community-based doctor or treated in an emergency room. And upon release, the patient started over again.\n\n\u201cThe better integrated prisoner medical care is with community medical care, the better it\u2019s going to be,\u201d said Dr. Robert Cohen, who sits on the New York City Board of Correction and was the medical director at Rikers during the 1980s. \u201cHHC comes at it from a healthcare perspective, and not from a corrections perspective,\u201d he added.\n\nContinuity in care between jail and the community has become much more relevant since the passage of the Affordable Care Act last year. Prior to the act an estimated 90 percent of jail inmates were uninsured. Now many are eligible for insurance under Medicaid. Jails across the country are making efforts to enroll inmates.\n\n\u201cWe have an essential responsibility to provide every individual in our City\u2019s care with high-quality health services \u2013 and our inmates are no different,\u201d said Mayor de Blasio in a written statement. \u201cThis transfer to HHC will give our administration direct control and oversight of our inmates\u2019 health services \u2013 furthering our goal of improving the quality and continuity of healthcare for every inmate in City custody.\u201d\n\nUnder HHC the city will be able to provide better coordination between hospital and jail-based services, the mayor\u2019s statement said. The city also promised closer integration of physical and behavioral health services, as well as stricter accountability.\n\nIn a written response, Corizon said it was sorry to lose the contract, adding: \u201cAs the Mayor\u2019s Office itself noted in December, the \u2018provision of health services in the NYC jail setting has become significantly more difficult over the past year.\u2019 Yet despite ongoing challenges, including an increase in the percentage of inmates suffering from mental illness and rising rates of violence against healthcare workers, we have made many improvements.\u201d\n\nSince 2012 Corizon has lost statewide contracts in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Pennsylvania and has come under pressure in Florida.\n\nNew York City joins a national trend of bringing jail health care closer to systems in place in the community. Earlier this week The Los Angeles Times reported that county supervisors there had voted to transfer health care from the sheriff\u2019s office to the department of health in order to coordinate care in the county\u2019s jails with services available before and after incarceration. Washington D.C. recently rejected a bid by Corizon to serve its county jail; city council members cited continuity of care in choosing to retain its current provider, non-profit Unity Health Care, the largest primary care provider in the area.\n\nProviding health care behind bars is a daunting challenge. As many as 43% of inmates have at least one chronic condition according to a recent report from the Vera Institute of Justice in New York City, and in many cities jails have become virtual mental hospitals.\n\nDebroah Golden, director of the DC Prisoners\u2019 Rights Project, which lobbied to reject Corizon\u2019s bid there , argued that the company \u2014 based in Brentwood, Tennessee and operating in 27 states \u2014 lacked local roots. \u201cI think that Corizon has a terrible track record because they\u2019re not oriented to the community,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t provide good care unless it\u2019s tethered to the community somehow.\u201d\n\nUnlike prisons, jails are, at least in theory, for short-term detention while awaiting trial or for serving sentences of less than a year. Only four percent of people in jail go on to prison, and the rest return home.\n\n\u201cIf you look at how we\u2019ve thought about corrections traditionally we send people off to islands \u2014 Alcatraz, Devil's Island, Australia, Rikers island \u2014 and we had this traditional philosophy that folks involved in the criminal justice system needed to be isolated from the communities,\u201d said Rosenberg. But, he added, \u201cWhat we learned over time that is a fallacious assumption.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Marshall Project", "description": "It\u2019s not just the big profits and dead inmates.", "title": "Why New York Dropped Corizon", "url": "https://www.themarshallproject.org/2015/06/11/why-new-york-dropped-corizon", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tmp-uploads-1/social/mp-fb-og.png", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheMarshallProject.org", "published_time": "2015-06-11T14:07:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T15:33:36Z"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/tmp-uploads-1/social/mp-tw-og.png"}, "description": "It\u2019s not just the big profits and dead inmates.", "site": "@MarshallProj", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why New York Dropped Corizon"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc1af\"", "article_summary": "New York City joins a national trend of bringing jail health care closer to systems in place in the community.\nPrior to the act an estimated 90 percent of jail inmates were uninsured.\nBut in moving to assert local control, New York was doing more than simply replacing a vendor that has come under fire.\nThe city also promised closer integration of physical and behavioral health services, as well as stricter accountability.\nProviding health care behind bars is a daunting challenge."}
