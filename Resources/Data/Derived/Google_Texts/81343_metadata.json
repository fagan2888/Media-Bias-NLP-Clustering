(Photo: The Enquirer/ Amanda Rossmann)Buy Photo\n\nCOLUMBUS \u2013 John Kasich likes Obamacare\u2019s expansion of Medicaid to more low-income Americans.\n\nHe wants to ensure insurance coverage for people who have pre-existing conditions. He likes insurance exchanges. And he thinks everyone should have health insurance \u2013 even young, healthy people who need an incentive to sign up.\n\nYet he says he\u2019d push to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law and replace it with something else \u2013 something better, he says \u2013 if his presidential campaign were to prove successful.\n\nThe \u201crepeal\u201d position is essential for Kasich\u2019s GOP candidacy. Indeed, many in the party are skeptical of his support for Medicaid alone. Candidates in Fox News\u2019 bottom-seven debate this month even fielded questions about why Kasich \u201cgot it wrong\u201d in expanding Medicaid in Ohio. Kasich had to defend his Medicaid move in his first question in the prime-time debate.\n\nKasich\u2019s ideas about health care illustrate the difficulty the Ohio governor may have distancing himself from a law that so many of his fellow Republicans detest. Because a lot of what the governor wants to do is already part of Obamacare.\n\nRelated:John Kasich 2016 campaign coverage\n\nThrough several rounds of inquiry from an Enquirer reporter \u2013 to which Kasich once responded, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go back to this question for the 50th time?\u201d \u2013 Kasich dribbled out some definites.\n\nThe common theme: accomplish many of the goals of Obamacare, sometimes by similar means, but without many of the federal mandates. The Ohio governor says he would have to \u201cbalance\u201d policy priorities with an ethic of less government control.\n\n\u201cWe want to be a lot more creative,\u201d he says.\n\nMedicaid: standing firm; business mandates: no\n\nSo, what does his version of health care reform look like?\n\nFirst, Kasich isn\u2019t backing off his support for expanding Medicaid.\n\nAs a governor, he\u2019s consistently said he was bringing Ohio taxpayers\u2019 money back into the state to help provide health care for Ohioans who are poor or have mental illnesses or drug addictions. As president, that \u201ctaxpayer money\u201d from each state would become his responsibility, especially since he\u2019s vowed to find ways to balance the federal budget.\n\nKasich has insisted he wouldn\u2019t cut back on the expansion of Medicaid to more low-income Americans. Instead, he says, he\u2019d want to send the federal money back to states, with more freedoms on how to implement the program. (Think the waiver Indiana got to charge Medicaid participants monthly premiums, which Kasich essentially wants to replicate in Ohio.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have fewer strings,\u201d Kasich said last month. He implied states might be able to cover the same population on Medicaid for less money. Ohio\u2019s Medicaid spending, after all, cost $2 billion less than estimates in the fiscal year that ended in June.\n\nAs a governor, \u201cI don\u2019t care if they give me a little less money, but I\u2019d like to have the ability to apply it and keep people healthy the way I want to do it,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI\u2019d rather have the states be empowered.\u201d\n\nProbably the biggest change to Obamacare that Kasich has clearly endorsed: He\u2019s all but said he\u2019d scrap the controversial (and, thus, delayed) mandate that businesses with at least 50 employees provide coverage for their full-time employees.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very, very difficult to do something like that,\u201d he told The Enquirer this summer. \u201cWhat we really need to do is make it easier for businesses to group together, to offer insurance.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s clear: Discomfort with any kind of mandate\n\nFrom there, it gets a little vague, except for Kasich\u2019s clear discomfort with the idea of mandating just about anything.\n\nTake his least controversial stance: Kasich praises the concept of ensuring that people with pre-existing conditions can get coverage, but stops short of using the word \u201cmandate.\u201d\n\nThat leaves an opening for a solution such as Marco Rubio\u2019s suggestion that the federal government support high-risk insurance pools, which existed in many states before Obamacare.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Kasich often shares a list of values he thinks the U.S. needs to re-emphasize. Chief among them? Personal responsibility.\n\nSo surely he endorses the mandate that everyone get insurance, especially young, healthy people who historically hadn\u2019t paid their share and whose mishaps therefore ate up emergency room costs?\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like it.\n\n\u201cThere is an element of personal responsibility. If you\u2019re a young person, and you get in a motorcycle accident, and you don\u2019t have insurance, we\u2019re all paying for it,\u201d Kasich told The Enquirer. But \u201cif in fact there was a mandate, I have no idea how it would be enforced. Is the government going to come around, go into everybody\u2019s office asking?\u201d\n\nKasich also thinks people should be able to shop for health insurance on an exchange, promoting the free-market concept of competition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to have a federal exchange to do that,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIt would be fine for the private sector to be able to list all the insurance that\u2019s available.\u201d\n\nWhen Obamacare passed, however, Kasich\u2019s administration declined to pursue establishing a state exchange. Officials said the law didn\u2019t allow them to customize it enough for their liking.\n\nBut isn\u2019t this Obamacare?\n\nTell Kasich this sounds remarkably like Obamacare, and he demurs.\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Kasich told The Enquirer. \u201cInsurance costs have been going up, they have disrupted a very robust market here, and I just don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any answer (in Obamacare). The biggest issue is cost, and it doesn\u2019t deal with it.\u201d\n\nIn Ohio, some insurance prices have increased. The state insurance department reports an 80 percent increase in the average cost of individual and small-group insurance policies from 2013 to next year\u2019s proposed prices.\n\nNationally, Obamacare generally has pushed up the costs of insurance for young, healthy people and made coverage more affordable for those who are older or sicker, said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health-policy analysis group.\n\n\u201cIf you allow people who are sick to get insurance, someone has to pay for it,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that brings up one more salient point.\n\nAnalysts and leaders on all sides agree Americans aren\u2019t getting a good value for their health care money. Kasich proposes brokering agreements between insurers and hospital systems so they agree to share profits and loss.\n\nFewer hospital visits from children with asthma, for instance, would lead to higher profits for insurance companies and bigger losses for hospitals. That model is in place at the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Kasich says.\n\nDoctors should be paid based on how their care contributes to their patients\u2019 good health, the governor says, not on how many office visits or tests they rack up. Kasich officials point to a characteristic of Ohio\u2019s Medicaid payment system that incentivizes health care companies\u2019 hitting benchmarks for quality care or patient health.\n\nKasich returns to the premise that a deregulated market, or individual states, should be the vehicle for establishing the facets of Obamacare that he likes, with difficult agreements brokered by a hypothetical Kasich administration, but not mandated by law.\n\nProviders doing well; Gov: \u2018So what?\u2019\n\nBut scrapping the system in place \u2013 thanks to Obamacare \u2013 and relying on the free market seems impractical to some. \u201cI don\u2019t know that the health care industry wants a return to the pre-(Affordable Care Act) world,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cInsurers and hospitals have both been doing quite well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what?\u201d Kasich told The Enquirer, in response to a similar statement by a reporter. \u201cI\u2019m not opposed to challenges. I\u2019d rather have a better system than what we have now.\u201d\n\nStill, Kasich\u2019s health care talk opens him up to attacks by more conservative Republican candidates. (His approach resembles that of his moderate policy rivals. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, like Kasich, expanded Medicaid. Jeb Bush points to cost-saving reforms in Medicaid when he was Florida governor and says he\u2019d push for fewer mandates.)\n\nStill, the implication from conservatives: Can you really trust Kasich to get rid of the hated Obamacare?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to hear the phrase \u2018Obamacare-lite,\u2019 \u201d said John Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College and former research director for the Republican National Committee.\n\nFor instance, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker used the point to hit Kasich Thursday in an interview with WMUR, a TV station in early-primary New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t take the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s important to a lot of Republicans \u2013 that I didn\u2019t further Obamacare.\u201d\n\nStill, Pitney said, Kasich\u2019s pledge to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare is probably good enough for most Republican voters, even if his solution ends up resembling Obamacare in many ways. For starters, elements of Obamacare \u2013 such as the mandate to cover people with pre-existing conditions \u2013 are popular.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to do away with it entirely. It\u2019s already taken root,\u201d Pitney said. \u201cObamacare is a pre-existing condition.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1TNGDZn", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "John Kasich\u2019s ideas about health care illustrate his difficulty distancing himself from a law that so many Republicans detest", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "John Kasich\u2019s ideas about health care illustrate his difficulty distancing himself from a law that so many Republicans detest", "title": "Kasich-care: Priorities like Obamacare, without mandates", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/08/17/john-kasich-medicaid-obamacare-republican-presidential-campaign/31745793/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Kasich\u2019s ideas about health care illustrate his difficulty distancing himself from a law that so many Republicans detest", "title": "John Kasich's health care ideas: Priorities like Obamacare without mandates", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/800630dd5c616c29b25d84b5459b406cf02d6db4/c=960-0-4800-3840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/14/Cincinnati/B9318442141Z.1_20150814181802_000_GAJBKMD2J.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "chrissie.thompsonfink"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Events/John Kasich  2016 Presidential Campaign", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Events/John Kasich  2016 Presidential Campaign", "title": "Kasich-care: Priorities like Obamacare, without mandates", "author": "Chrissie Thompson", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c72fc348fa6bc2747180f692a2131f99b9f734f5/c=1440-0-4320-3840/local/-/media/2015/08/14/Cincinnati/B9318442141Z.1_20150814181802_000_GAJBKMD2J.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98bf8e596c32510f94f4c1c778ff11fda8fbcb3a/c=960-0-4800-3840/local/-/media/2015/08/14/Cincinnati/B9318442141Z.1_20150814181802_000_GAJBKMD2J.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f2ce35cb0bc3c3f1fa72c1a12fd6c099318b932a/c=320-0-5440-3840/local/-/media/2015/08/14/Cincinnati/B9318442141Z.1_20150814181802_000_GAJBKMD2J.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f58cd65e1ebc537e90e0572c38e1c9187a60894/c=0-300-5760-3540&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/08/14/Cincinnati/B9318442141Z.1_20150814181802_000_GAJBKMD2J.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-17T06:21:23.140000-04:00", "shorthed": "Kasich-care: Like Obamacare, no mandates", "articleid": 31745793, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/421b078e32ec24dfbab35e78c8c4cec779ade847/c=0-300-5760-3540/local/-/media/2015/08/14/Cincinnati/B9318442141Z.1_20150814181802_000_GAJBKMD2J.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/48df83f7285729a6166f4a8d36f71b4cd1d569c0/c=1800-0-3960-3840/local/-/media/2015/08/14/Cincinnati/B9318442141Z.1_20150814181802_000_GAJBKMD2J.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "John Kasich, JohnKasich.com, JohnKasich.us, Obamacare, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, President Obama, Medicaid, Kaiser Foundation"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo John Kasich likes many of the priorities in Obamacare, but is uncomfortable with the mandates.\nThe common theme: accomplish many of the goals of Obamacare, sometimes by similar means, but without many of the federal mandates.\nAnalysts and leaders on all sides agree Americans aren\u2019t getting a good value for their health care money.\nMedicaid: standing firm; business mandates: noSo, what does his version of health care reform look like?\nAnd he thinks everyone should have health insurance \u2013 even young, healthy people who need an incentive to sign up."}
