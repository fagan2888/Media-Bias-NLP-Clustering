As we end another week (raise your hand if you're happy that January is now over half over), here's a quick snapshot of economy/money headlines, good and bad, we flagged this week:\n\n\n\n> U.S. back at helm of global economy\n\n> Job openings rise 2.9 percent, most since Jan. 2001\n\nAlso: December showed an uptick in\n\ngeneric money-related stock photos.\n\n> December retail sales down 0.9 percent\n\n> Consumer prices down 0.4 percent in December\n\n> Arctic explorers retreat as oil prices take a dive\n\n> Texas braces for another oil bust\n\n> GM sets global sales record\n\n> Obamacare has fewer people struggling with medical costs\n\n> U.S. airlines eager to fly to Cuba\n\n> Foreclosures fell in 2014 to levels before housing bust\n\n> Obama pushes for paid sick/parental leave for workers\n\nAnd in product tie-in news:---the cleverest kids flick I've seen in a long time--- got snubbed for an Oscar nomination in the animation category. WTF? For that I wish upon the Academy the worst pain imaginable: stepping on Legos in the dark at three in the morning.\n\nCHEERS to the Big Appall. Over at Talking Points Memo, Josh Marshall reports that New Yorkers say they still love the NYPD in general, but not their tantrums:\n\n\n\nIt doesn't help that they turned\n\nto face a Dunkin' Donnuts\n\nNew York City voters disapprove of police officers turning their backs on the Mayor at police funerals by 69% to 27%. 77% think police union President Pay Lynch's \"blood on his hands\" remarks were \"too extreme\" and no racial or gender subset of the population considers the comments \"appropriate.\" Though there are big differences across the city's racial groups 47% of New Yorkers say [Mayor Bill] de Blasio's actions since he began his run for Mayor show he supports the city's police. 37% say the opposite.\n\nAnd 98 percent of New Yorkers also say, hey, leave some doughnuts for us.\n\nJEERS to messing with The Precious. On January 16, 1919, the tenacious temperance twits in Wyoming became the last ones necessary to ratify Prohibition, which went into effect on January 16, 1920:\n\n\n\nYe can teek me freedom, but\n\nye can't teek me daiquiris!!!\n\nMany Prohibition groups, called \u201cdries\u201d, were church-based, mainly Protestant denominations. The anti-Prohibition groups, or \u201cwets\u201d, tended to be mostly Roman Catholic, Episcopalian and Lutherans from Germany. Both major political parties had wet and dry factions. [W]hen Congress convened in January, 1917, the mandate was clear: regardless of party, dries outnumbered wets in Congress by 2-to-1.\n\nThe result: a huge spike in organized crime. The stock market crash of 1929 led to the eventual repeal of the 18th amendment on the premise that reviving the legit liquor industry would create jobs. So you might say that in a weird way the banksters toppled the gangsters. Then again, that's the way they topple everything.\n\nCHEERS to feeding the liberal agenda. A reminder that Netroots Nation is now accepting proposals for panels at the 10th annual convention (Phoenix, July 16-19). Says Raven Brooks:\n\n\n\nEach year, we ask for your help in developing and organizing the sessions you\u2019ll attend at Netroots Nation. Your submissions help us create an inclusive agenda for our conference each year while also helping shape the national dialog for progressives in the coming months. Our goal is to highlight the work you are doing around the country, from national campaigns to issue organizing in your home state, as well as to shine a light on things happening in our host state of Arizona.\n\nDeadline for submissions is February 18. Click here for the guidelines and submission form. By the way, if all the hotel rooms sell out, you can shack up at whichever of the four Arizona homes owned by John McCain doesn't have a Studebaker in the driveway.\n\nJEERS to turning a deaf ear. On tomorrow's date 54 years ago, during his farewell address in 1961, President Eisenhower warned us all against the rise of the \"military-industrial complex.\" Every year, as his warning appears ever more prescient, I believe this speech ranks right up there with Lincoln's Gettysburg Address or FDR's Four Freedoms speech:\n\n\n\nWe must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\"\n\ndid\n\ndid\n\ndid\n\nnot\n\nSunday Sunday SUNDAY!\n\nLet's see how that's working out: Welet the weight of this combination endanger our liberties and democratic processes. Wetake it for granted. And we the ignorant and apathetic citizenrycompel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty are now fighting like rabid dogs.

Kite.\n\nFor having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being obliged, by better information or fuller consideration, to change opinions, even on important subjects, which I once thought right but found to be otherwise. ... When you're finished changing, you're finished.\n\nto Ben Franklin. The Founding Father , publisher, diplomat, philosopher, and the only American to invent more things than Ron Popeil turns 306 today. He has a few words for the wreck that has become the Republican party:More like Founding Hippie.\n\nHave a great weekend!
