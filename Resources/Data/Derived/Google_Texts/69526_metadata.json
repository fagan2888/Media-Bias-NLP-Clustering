Health records firm Epic raises profile\n\nThe U.S. government is spending $30 billion to encourage the health care system to go digital. Now, the founder and chief executive of the country\u2019s largest vendor of digital medical records is fighting back against what she calls incorrect perceptions that her company is creating obstacles to creating a national system where health records can be shared.\n\nThe sharing of health records is a critical but elusive goal, one that\u2019s getting the attention of policymakers and K Street, as well as the health care industry. Some critics say industry giant Epic Systems is part of the problem.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEpic\u2019s CEO Judy Faulkner is now ready to engage.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t speak up, people will believe what others say about us, and an unanswered accusation becomes seen as the truth if you don\u2019t respond,\u201d Faulkner told POLITICO in a rare interview. \u201cWe\u2019re now in a position where we have to.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: What can D.C. get done in Obama's last two years?)\n\nHer Verona, Wisconsin-based company has ridden high on the wave of federal incentives, transforming itself from a company with revenue measured in the tens of millions in the 1990s to an estimated $1.5 billion a year today.\n\nWith success has come attention, much of it negative.\n\nEpic has become the lightning rod for everything that doctors and IT experts don\u2019t like about electronic health records. While industry ratings have ranked Epic above many other EHRs in terms of physician usability, critics charge the company fails to easily share patient records and throws its weight around in the market.\n\nIn health care markets where large EHR vendors like Epic make it difficult or expensive for users of other systems to share data, smaller hospitals and doctor doctors\u2019 offices may feel pressure to get the same software \u2014 or to join the larger networks.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Christie: CDC behind on Ebola)\n\nRep. Phil Gingrey (R-Ga.) singled out Epic during a July hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, saying it\u2019s possible \u201cthat fraud is being perpetrated on the American people.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission recently said it would monitor the EHR vendors to spot any that impede progress toward \u201cinteroperability,\u201d industry jargon for sharing patient records electronically. Other reports, including one by the RAND Corp. this summer, have called the company a \u201cclosed system.\u201d\n\nThrough all of this, Epic has kept a low public profile. But the issue of sharing medical records is becoming more visible. Records that can be accessed by all of a patient\u2019s doctors or hospitals are a staple of health reform and the Affordable Care Act. That\u2019s one reason these programs are garnering attention of from Congress and federal regulators.\n\nEpic is getting some of that scrutiny.\n\nFaulkner, a self-described introverted computer software developer and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest self-made businesswomen, hasn\u2019t talked much about the criticisms of the company she built. She has kept her focus on her product and her customers.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Reid's daughter undergoing surgery)\n\nBut Epic \u2014 unavoidably \u2014 keeps drawing attention. It started in 1979 as three half-time workers in an apartment building basement. Now it has more than 7,400 employees occupying a sprawling 1,000-acre campus outside Madison. Epic\u2019s software touches the lives of about half the people in the U.S.\n\nEpic has mostly declined comment \u2014 until now.\n\n\u201cLots of other things we simply haven\u2019t attacked. And now, in retrospect, I wish we had,\u201d said Faulkner, 71. \u201cWe\u2019ve just shrugged and said, \u2018Well, forget it.\u2019 And moved on. Now, we\u2019re not doing that, and I\u2019m actually glad we\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nFaulkner called her company\u2019s name drop by Gingrey at that House hearing a \u201cshock\u201d and \u201crealization we can\u2019t hide anymore.\u201d\n\nEpic hired lobbyist Brad Card in early August, after never having a lobbying presence in Washington before. Card has met with various congressional offices in the past few months, talking up the company\u2019s track record, which he says doesn\u2019t reflect its reputation.\n\nDuring a 90-minute interview last week, Faulkner frequently mentioned a recent report from KLAS, a market research firm that produces influential annual surveys on interoperability.\n\nThe report listed Epic as the top vendor for interoperability in 2012 and 2013. KLAS graded Epic this year as having the highest score for health information exchange among EHR vendors.\n\nThe concept of openness and ability to freely share information was a quality baked into Epic when she was just writing its code, Faulkner says. \u201cThe whole concept of being open and allowing users \u2026 to be able to use the exits to do whatever they want was in there from the very, very start,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The CEO says the company is not creating obstacles to a national health records system.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The CEO says the company is not creating obstacles to a national health records system.", "title": "Health records firm Epic raises profile", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/epic-systems-digital-health-care-system-112288.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/28/141028_judy_faulkner_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Health Care,Technology,Judy Faulkner,Epic Systems", "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/arthurallen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23d1\"", "article_summary": "Health records firm Epic raises profileThe U.S. government is spending $30 billion to encourage the health care system to go digital.\nThe sharing of health records is a critical but elusive goal, one that\u2019s getting the attention of policymakers and K Street, as well as the health care industry.\nEpic has become the lightning rod for everything that doctors and IT experts don\u2019t like about electronic health records.\nThe government is spending $30 billion to encourage the health care system to go digital.\nKLAS graded Epic this year as having the highest score for health information exchange among EHR vendors."}
