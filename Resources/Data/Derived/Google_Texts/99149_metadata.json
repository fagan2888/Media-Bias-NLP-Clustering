Simmons\n\n\u2022 See Gallery\n\nRev. Earl Simmons said Terrell Hampton\u2019s act was a tough one to follow.\n\nSimmons wasn\u2019t kidding.\n\nHampton gave a stirring dramatic interpretation of the Martin Luther King Jr. speech, \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d. The Beck Academy student received a standing ovation for his portrayal of the icon of the civil rights movement.\n\nWhat Hampton did was warm up the capacity turnout at Greer City Hall who came to celebrate the birthday of King, traditionally the third Monday in January.\n\nSimmons\u2019 message was \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet\u201d reminding the audience of current events bringing into question equal treatment for minority races. \u201cIt\u2019s symbolic of Dr. King\u2019s dream, but we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still pursuing the dream.\u201d\n\nWayne Griffin, Greer city councilman, who organized the 12th MLK Celebration in Greer, emphasized the participation of youth. The dramatic interpretations have been a hallmark of Griffin\u2019s programs.\n\n\u201cWe want to inspire our youth and that\u2019s one of the things I wanted to do with this program,\u201d Griffin said. His nieces led the Pledge of Allegiance to begin the program. LeAndra Sligh and Tymetrious Bolden gave interpretations of Maya Angelou poems \u201cStill I Rise\u201d and \u201cPhenomenal Woman\u201d.\n\nSammy Dotson, Program Director at Phillis Wheatley Association, provided music with his associates.\n\nStephania Talley-Priester was the recipient of a Samaritan Award for her contributions to the community through New Horizons, explaining the Affordable Care Act, hosting a show on a gospel network and working with youth through her Jazzy Fashion business.\n\nGriffin recognized City Administrator Ed Driggers for spearheading the city\u2019s contributions supporting MLK Celebrations and other events and programs. Griffin tried to keep the recognition a secret, going as far as leaving Driggers off the program.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even ask if Mr. Driggers would be here because I knew he would,\u201d Griffin said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "GreerToday.com", "description": "\u2022 Hear Rev.
