(Jafe Parsons)\n\nTanielle Childers was born in Loveland but went to elementary school in Milliken.\n\nThe school had old-fashioned hot water radiators, the kind that knocked when air was trapped in the pipes. When she was in the first grade, her teacher asked the students to draw something that they thought made that sound. Childers drew a monster and won first place with a prize of one penny.\n\nIn second grade, Childers was in a Castle Rock school. The students were given the challenge to do a contour drawing, and her teacher was very impressed with Childers' work. At her teacher's insistence, Childers was sent to the teacher's lounge where she showed off her drawing.\n\nChilders is now an accomplished artist selling her work at a variety of outlets including the Lincoln Gallery, Canyon Acoustics west of Loveland, Da Bean in Berthoud and Indigo Sky Trading in Berthoud.\n\nHer first sale was at a show at the Lincoln Gallery, and it sold the minute it went up. The painting was called \"Realistic Imagination\" and was a whimsical dragonfly with white mountain peaks.\n\n\"My art comes from a magical place that words fail to describe,\" Childers says. She continues, \"My painting usually begin with flashes of a vision, and then I paint intuitively and with emotion bringing my art to life.\" As she paints, she listens to music, but the selection depends on her mood at the time. In her words, \"While I paint, I find that happy place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChilders depends on spontaneity without any preliminary sketches.\n\nAfter working for 13 years at the Quick Print Shop in Loveland and also taking graphic design classes at Aims Community College, she has honed her skill as an artist.\n\nShe likes intense colors and uses diluted acrylic paint in multiple layers.\n\nAs for her future plans, she simply states, \"More art -- it is the air I breathe and part of my right arm. I never see giving it up -- it is my therapy.\"\n\nHer work can be seen at Facebook.com/TanielleART, Tanielle-Childers.artistwebsites.com and Redbubble\n\n.com/people/Tanielle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/loveland-art/ci_24790918/loveland-native-tanielle-childers-paints-find-happy-place", "modificationDate": "2014-01-04T19:08:54-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1224/20131224__25RHABART~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Kenneth Jessen  For the Reporter-Herald", "description": "Tanielle Childers was born in Loveland but went to elementary school in Milliken. \n\nThe school had old-fashioned hot water radiators, the kind that knocked when air was trapped in the pipes.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:24790918:view"}, "startDate": "2014-01-04T19:08:44-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/loveland-art/ci_24790918/loveland-native-tanielle-childers-paints-find-happy-place", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1224/20131224__25RHABART~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tanielle Childers was born in Loveland but went to elementary school in Milliken. \n\nThe school had old-fashioned hot water radiators, the kind that knocked when air was trapped in the pipes.", "title": "Loveland native Tanielle Childers paints to find a 'happy place'"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Tanielle Childers was born in Loveland but went to elementary school in Milliken. \n\nThe school had old-fashioned hot water radiators, the kind that knocked when air was trapped in the pipes.", "title": "Loveland native Tanielle Childers paints to find a 'happy place'", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/loveland-art/ci_24790918/loveland-native-tanielle-childers-paints-find-happy-place", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1224/20131224__25RHABART~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-04T19:08:44-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2024-01-04T19:08:44-0700", "sailthru.title": "Loveland native Tanielle Childers paints to find a 'happy place'", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Art", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Kenneth Jessen", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1224/20131224__25RHABART~3.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-01-04T19:10:56-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald art theater dance music classical visual events"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda012\"", "article_summary": "The students were given the challenge to do a contour drawing, and her teacher was very impressed with Childers' work.\n(Jafe Parsons)Tanielle Childers was born in Loveland but went to elementary school in Milliken.\n\"My art comes from a magical place that words fail to describe,\" Childers says.\nChilders drew a monster and won first place with a prize of one penny.\nIn her words, \"While I paint, I find that happy place."}
