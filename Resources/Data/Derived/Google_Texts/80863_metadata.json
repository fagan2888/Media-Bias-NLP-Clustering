In this country, the LGBT movement is on a roll.\n\nLegalized same-sex marriage is rapidly spreading among the states, and the U.S. Supreme Court is on the verge of declaring it a constitutional right.\n\nTransgender accommodation in many forms is the latest thing. Public acceptance of the LGBT lifestyle is at an all-time high, especially among the young, who have been conditioned by public education, the liberal media and the entertainment world to be fully approving.\n\nAccording to the most recent\n\nNational Health Interview Survey, 96.6 percent of adults self-identify as heterosexual, 1.6 percent as gay or lesbian, 0.7 percent as bisexual and 1.1 percent as \u201csomething else.\u201d For a tiny fraction of the population, the LGBT cohort has been remarkably successful in shaping popular culture and public policy.\n\nSo why the massive overreaction to the temperate attempt by defenders of religious freedom to carve out a little protection for individual rights under various state versions of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act? This law has been on the books since 1993, signed by President Clinton after winning near-unanimous approval in Congress. The calls for a boycott of Indiana for adding its approval to that of other states is positively absurd. There\u2019s nothing in the federal or state RFRAs that remotely threatens LGBT rights.\n\nAt play here is a heavy-handed political strategy to kill this RFRA flea with a nuclear bomb as a shot across the bow to any who would defy LGBT political correctness. It is compounded by an incorrect notion that discrimination under any and all circumstances is flatly illegal. That\u2019s simply not true. There\u2019s wiggle room for reason and common sense. Anti-discrimination laws identify \u201cprotected classes\u201d subject to special scrutiny. Among the characteristics of those classes are race, color, religion, sex, age and disability. Let\u2019s consider some hypothetical situations.\n\nAge: An 80-year-old woman applies for a job as a server a Hooters. The company\u2019s business model regards servers also as entertainers for a mostly male audience. It hires young, attractive, buxom women. That hiring profile doesn\u2019t arbitrarily or illegally discriminate.\n\nDisability: A paralyzed man applies for a job as a Denver Broncos tight end. Do I need to elaborate?\n\nReligion: A Muslim who has publicly called for \u201cdeath to all infidels\u201d applies for a job at a Jewish synagogue.\n\nThen there are laws prohibiting discrimination at places of \u201cpublic accommodation,\u201d including restaurants, hotels, theaters and retail stores.\n\nA black man wants to rent a standard tuxedo from a retail clothier. He can\u2019t legally be denied because of his race. A Grand Dragon of the KKK demands that a black tailor make him a custom white robe with images of blacks being lynched. You make the call.\n\nA photographer in his shop asked to shoot a passport photo for a gay man and his partner can\u2019t legally refuse because of his religious objection to that sexual preference. But can\u2019t he refuse, as a matter of freedom of disassociation, to take a job shooting photos at a gay wedding?\n\nRegardless of the law on same-sex marriage or anything else, people are free to disapprove based on their beliefs \u2014 religious or otherwise. This is not a criminal offense in a free society. All kinds of people approve or disapprove of all kinds of things. Some militant gays and lesbians have even defamed heterosexuals as \u201cbreeders.\u201d Should we call out the thought police? Tolerance is a two-way street.\n\nThe LGBT crowd needs to be more gracious in victory.\n\nFreelance columnist Mike Rosen\u2019s radio show airs weekdays from 1 to 3 p.m. on 850-KOA.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rosen: LGBT overkill on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act", "title": "Rosen: LGBT overkill on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/10/rosen-lgbt-overkill-on-the-religious-freedom-restoration-act/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150410__20150412_Z00_OP12C_ROSENp1.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150410__20150412_Z00_OP12C_ROSENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-10T10:36:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T04:54:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "So why the massive overreaction to the temperate attempt by defenders of religious freedom to carve out a little protection for individual rights under various state versions of the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act?\nDisability: A paralyzed man applies for a job as a Denver Broncos tight end.\nBut can\u2019t he refuse, as a matter of freedom of disassociation, to take a job shooting photos at a gay wedding?\nReligion: A Muslim who has publicly called for \u201cdeath to all infidels\u201d applies for a job at a Jewish synagogue.\nA photographer in his shop asked to shoot a passport photo for a gay man and his partner can\u2019t legally refuse because of his religious objection to that sexual preference."}
