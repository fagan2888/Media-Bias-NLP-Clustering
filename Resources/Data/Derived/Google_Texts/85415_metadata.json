Guns and ammunition can be bought for cheap in the conflict areas and then marked up by as much as 500 percent for sale in Kyiv and western Ukraine.\n\nAccording to volunteer battalion members who asked not to be named due to security concerns related to upcoming combat deployments, the current price for an AK-74 assault rifle on the black market in the conflict-ridden Donetsk and Luhansk regions is about $500, while the same weapon can be resold in Kyiv for about $2,500.\n\nThe Ukraine conflict has spawned a black market of military weapons that threatens to further destabilize to ex-Soviet country.\n\n\u201cThe low prices are allowing people to buy weapons in huge quantities and then resell them in central or western Ukraine,\u201d Uchaykin said, according to Korrespondent. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious business for some people.\u201d\n\nThese loose weapons have become a headache for Kyiv.\n\nFor one, a jump in weapons-related crime nationwide has been attributed to weapons smuggled back from the conflict areas.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian General Prosecutor\u2019s Office, there were around 2,000 weapons-related crimes in Ukraine in the first nine months of 2014, compared with 581 during the same period in 2013\u2014a 345 percent increase in one year.\n\nThe 2014 crime data excludes the breakaway region of Crimea and Ukraine\u2019s eastern territories.\n\n\u201cCrimes committed by firearms have increased exponentially since the war began,\u201d said Mykhailo Khiraldo-Ramirez, 31, a Ukrainian lawyer and an instructor with the 318th Kyiv Territorial Defense Battalion. \u201cNow the government is more afraid of armed citizens than of Russians.\u201d\n\nIn addition, a string of bombings and disrupted terrorist plots in government-controlled cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odessa have Ukrainian officials on edge that smuggled arms and explosives will be used for terrorism and sabotage outside the conflict area.\n\nIn October, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) seized a weapons cache in Kyiv, which included portable air defense systems and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. According to a press release on the SBU\u2019s website, the weapons were linked to a terrorist cell that was supported by Russian special forces, and were part of a plot to assassinate a Ukrainian parliamentary candidate.\n\nOn Tuesday, police at a train station in the western city of Lviv, which is about 800 miles from the conflict area, discovered a backpack with an assault rifle, silencers and magazines filled with ammunition.\n\n\u201cIf other countries are threatened by international terrorist groups, mainly associated with Islamists, Ukraine is facing terrorists who are directed, developed and equipped by Russia,\u201d said Olexandr Skypalsky, former deputy head of the Security Service of Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian news agency Gordon.\n\nUkraine, the United States and other NATO countries have accused Russia of sending arms and troops into Ukraine. The Kremlin denies assisting the separatists.\n\n\u2014 \u2022 \u2014\n\nThe biggest sources of illegal weapons are stockpiles left behind by retreating separatists.\n\nThroughout the conflict, advancing government troops and counterterrorism agents have uncovered weapons caches filled with lethal military hardware in areas previously under separatist control.\n\nOn Thursday, the SBU announced it found a weapons cache at an abandoned separatist checkpoint near Donetsk. Among its contents were anti-tank grenade launchers and a flamethrower.\n\nThursday\u2019s discovery came four days after SBU agents found another separatist weapons cache near the eastern Ukrainian town of Artemivsk, which, according to the agency, contained six kilograms of TNT, two anti-tank mines, one anti-personnel mine, 19 F-1 grenades, two portable anti-tank grenade launchers and small arms ammunition.\n\nWeapons left on the battlefields by retreating and killed soldiers also end up on the black market.\n\nWitnesses of the battle for Debaltseve last month observed civilians collecting weapons abandoned by retreating Ukrainian forces.\n\n\u201cThe streets were littered with weapons and ammunition,\u201d said Valentyn Onyshchenko, a reserve lieutenant in the Ukrainian army and journalist who was in Debaltseve during last month\u2019s siege. \u201cYou could take whatever you wanted, and no one would stop you.\u201d\n\nUkraine\u2019s laws for firearms possession are fairly restrictive, leaving guns out of reach for most civilians except for hunters, who usually own shotguns. The punishment for owning an illegal weapon in Ukraine is 5 years to 15 years in prison.\n\nBut Ukraine\u2019s civilian volunteer battalions are a legal grey area, and it remains unclear if Kyiv will demand the groups hand over their weapons when the war is over.\n\nVolunteer battalions\u2014there are now more than 50 in Ukraine\u2014operate outside of the military\u2019s chain of command and regulatory oversight and have played a key role in Ukraine\u2019s war effort, particularly in the early stages of the conflict when pro-Russian separatists consistently outgunned the regular Ukrainian army.\n\nMainly supplied by private donations and online supply drives, the volunteer battalions are well armed and often better equipped with basic supplies than regular army units. Many Ukrainian men drafted into military service choose service in the volunteer battalions over the regular army, which is a legal option.\n\nVolunteer battalion soldiers, however, are not eligible for government pensions or health care, including treatment for post-traumatic stress.\n\nValeriy Krivchach, a reserve lieutenant in the Ukrainian army, said the government in Kyiv is concerned that volunteer battalion veterans won\u2019t be able to reintegrate into civilian life after the war, creating a dangerous mix of thousands of men with combat experience, little hope for a job and access to unregulated military weapons arsenals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s controversial, the volunteer battalions are a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem because when the war is over they can just change their direction, come to Kyiv and lead another revolution.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u2022 \u2014\n\nMasur, meanwhile, is set to return to the front lines with the Aydar Battalion at the end of March. He has become pessimistic about the prospects for peace and is anxious to return to combat.\n\nHe called the Feb. 15 cease-fire a \u201cfarce.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were shooting at us the day the cease-fire went into effect,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that if we don\u2019t stop the separatists in the east, they will come all the way to Kyiv.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if his unit had enough weapons, he replied confidently: \u201cYes. Weapons are no longer a problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Ukraine conflict has spawned a black market of military weapons that threatens to further destabilize to ex-Soviet country.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ukraine conflict has spawned a black market of military weapons that threatens to further destabilize to ex-Soviet country.", "title": "Ukraine Conflict Feeds Black Market of Military Weapons", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150322_BlackMarket_Peterson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-22T10:38:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CbnhTv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Ukraine conflict has spawned a black market of military weapons that threatens to further destabilize to ex-Soviet country.", "title": "Ukraine Conflict Feeds Black Market of Military Weapons", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150322_BlackMarket_Peterson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-03-22T03:01:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-22T10:38:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, Russia, Donbas, Azov battalion, Mariupol, Kyiv, weapons proliferation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd029b\"", "article_summary": "The Ukraine conflict has spawned a black market of military weapons that threatens to further destabilize to ex-Soviet country.\nThis murky environment feeds a growing black market of military weapons that threatens Ukraine\u2019s security and political stability as the country emerges from last year\u2019s revolution and continues its fight against pro-Russian separatists.\nVolunteer battalion soldiers, however, are not eligible for government pensions or health care, including treatment for post-traumatic stress.\nWeapons left on the battlefields by retreating and killed soldiers also end up on the black market.\nSelling weapons on the black market is a lucrative business."}
