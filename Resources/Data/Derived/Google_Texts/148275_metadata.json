Both of those posts, as well as his experience at the helm of the Center for Studying Health System Change, have prepared Ginsburg well for a topic he says will continue to be a huge issue in healthcare.\u201cI believe provider payment reform will be very important,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cACOs, global payments, bundled payments\u2014I see there is such strong interest to get away from the very fragmented payment approaches we've used to motivate the delivery system to coordinate its work and manage chronic disease better,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that is going to be the most important thing.\u201dMeanwhile, he said there is a connection between the evolution of insurance that will be influenced by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the speed with which provider payment reforms are processed. He plans to continue examining all of these areas in the next phase of his career.Ginsburg said word began to spread last month about his departure after he told colleagues of his plans. Those plans will include consulting work and possibly serving on various boards. He said he's also been contacted about possible positions. \u201cMy consulting will focus on helping people understand developments in healthcare markets,\u201d Ginsburg said, \u201cand working with people to analyze different policy approaches.\u201dIn an e-mail to several of his contacts on Sunday, Ginsburg wrote that the Center for Studying Health System Change had received \u201cgenerous core support\u201d from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for many years, and, more recently, funding from the National Institute for Health Care Reform that gave his organization the opportunity to pursue large-scale, high-quality research projects. Without that funding, he noted in the e-mail, the Center for Studying Health System Change can no longer continue its mission.As he completes his tenure, Ginsburg struck a reflective note about the Center's work and accomplishments for nearly 19 years, saying he received about 100 e-mail messages in the last two days from people who told him how valuable that work has been in the healthcare community.\u201cI think the main thing is to celebrate the accomplishments,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to the degree I have a lot of wisdom and experience in healthcare and policy to bring, I'm hoping to continue to bring that,\u201d only in a different way, he added.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Paul Ginsburg, the Harvard-trained economist and health policy expert who founded the Center for Studying Health System Change in 1995, will step down as the organization's president at the end of the year to pursue consulting work and other activities.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Ginsburg to leave Center for Studying Health System Change", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Paul Ginsburg, the Harvard-trained economist and health policy expert who founded the Center for Studying Health System Change in 1995, will step down as the organization's president at the end of the year to pursue consulting work and other activities.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Ginsburg to leave Center for Studying Health System Change", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130916/NEWS/309169965", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20130916/NEWS/309169965/AR/0/AR-309169965.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Paul Ginsburg, the Harvard-trained economist and health policy expert who founded the Center for Studying Health System Change in 1995, will step down as the organization's president at the end of the year to pursue consulting work and other activities.", "title": "Healthcare Reform Update: Ginsburg to leave Center for Studying Health System Change", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20130916/NEWS/309169965/AR/0/AR-309169965.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20130916/NEWS/309169965", "published_at": "2013-09-16", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20130916/NEWS/309169965/AR/0/AR-309169965.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Both of those posts, as well as his experience at the helm of the Center for Studying Health System Change, have prepared Ginsburg well for a topic he says will continue to be a huge issue in healthcare.\u201cI believe provider payment reform will be very important,\u201d Ginsburg said.\n\u201cAnd to the degree I have a lot of wisdom and experience in healthcare and policy to bring, I'm hoping to continue to bring that,\u201d only in a different way, he added.\nThose plans will include consulting work and possibly serving on various boards.\n\u201cWithout that, there was not much reason for me to stay,\u201d he said.\nHe plans to continue examining all of these areas in the next phase of his career.Ginsburg said word began to spread last month about his departure after he told colleagues of his plans."}
