They're forcing America to abandon God's standards of right and wrong, and in consequence our society is becoming increasingly unmoored from reality.\n\nThe progressive war on truth\n\nWhen did lying become accepted practice in public life? Not too long after kids started coming home from college -- and high school -- prattling about \"my truth\" and \"your truth.\"\n\nTruth is, by definition, objective and universal. Rejecting this fundamental principle leads people to do \"what is right in their own eyes,\" as the Bible puts it, and enables them to play fast and loose with the rules.\n\nCraig Livingstone, keeper of the illegally obtained FBI files during the Clinton administration, reportedly told a colleague, \"Haven't you heard? Truth is whatever you want it to be.\"\n\nThe Clintons didn't invent political lying, but they surely brought it to new lows. Nevertheless, there was still some expectation back in the ' '90s that politicians ought to tell the truth.\n\nNot so much nowadays. The nation placidly goes about its business as revelations emerge about the Obama administration lying continuously, almost compulsively, about virtually anything, in pursuit of political advantage. Here is a handful of examples that represent the Obama administration's line on many of the leading public policy issues:\n\nThe Benghazi massacre was a spontaneous event triggered by an obscure video, not a carefully planned Muslim terrorist attack of which we had advance warning.\n\nIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n\n\"Under our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.\"\n\nThe fence between the U.S. and Mexico is \"practically complete.\"\n\nCommon sense voter ID laws constitute \"suppression\" of minority voters.\n\nIt's clear that the present administration views lying as an essential hammer in their political tool chest.\n\nThe progressive war on reality\n\nThe war on truth is rapidly devolving into a war on reality itself. Perhaps it's inevitable that when you abandon the plain black and white of truth and falsehood, you lose the ability to discern what is real and what is not. Never have I seen an administration pursue so many policies that fly in the face of common sense, and even demand that we deny reality that's as plain as the nose on your face:\n\nThe Fort Hood massacre was \"workplace violence,\" not Muslim terrorism.\n\nWe offend our allies deliberately, and kowtow to enemies who intend to destroy us. President Obama just announced that families of hostages will no longer be prosecuted for paying ransom, increasing the odds that more Americans will be kidnapped by terrorists.\n\nWe help Iran obtain nuclear weapons, putting Israel and the rest of the world at risk.\n\nWe withdraw prematurely from Iran and Afghanistan, effectively giving those countries back to the Muslim jihadists.\n\nWe protect Muslims around the world, while allowing Muslims to slaughter Christians throughout the Islamic world.\n\nAt home, police are vilified, and criminals are exalted.\n\nThe government spending spree continues, even as our towering debt promises to deliver us into fiscal Armageddon. Social Security Disability is about to go broke, and Medicare and Social Security are not far behind.\n\nWe pander to troubled people trying to change their sex through hormones and mutilating surgery. In reality, transgender \"women\" are still men, and \"men\" are still women. At best, sex reassignment surgery turns men into eunuchs, and women into God knows what. Facebook now recognizes more than 50 \"genders,\" as if people can declare their sex to be whatever they imagine.\n\nWe virtually eliminate our southern border, handcuff our border agents, and actively foster illegal immigration, when the nation is facing suffocating unemployment. Illegals have become a de facto protected class.\n\nAnd we lie about unemployment statistics, concealing half or more of the actual unemployment.\n\nThe progressive war on resisters\n\nYou'd better think twice before you tell the truth about the emperor's new clothes. Progressives are using the power of government to force society to go along with the insanity.\n\nThis goes on wherever progressives hold power. Politically correct speech codes have been enforced on American college campuses for decades, where conservative and Christian students and faculty are routinely discriminated against and decried as \"haters.\"\n\nNow that progressives have taken over broad swaths of federal and state government, they have greatly enhanced power to enforce their will. Bakers and florists who refuse to participate in same-sex ceremonies are driven out of business, despite the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion.\n\nReligious liberty is under assault in America. People who espouse Judeo-Christian values are being denied entry into graduate schools and driven from their jobs. Just ask Wes Modder, the chaplain who recently was kicked out of the Navy for telling counselees the truth about what the Bible teaches about sexuality, including homosexual behavior.\n\nTraditional American religion \u2013 Judeo-Christian values and practice \u2013 is the ultimate target of the progressives, who must uproot our moral structure and redefine good and evil before they can create their secular utopia.\n\nGod says, \"Woe to those who call good evil, and evil good\" (Isaiah 5:20).\n\nThat's exactly where the progressives are leading America. People who still have a grip on reality need to band together and fight back.\n\nKen Blackwell is the Senior Fellow for Family Empowerment at the Family Research Council.
