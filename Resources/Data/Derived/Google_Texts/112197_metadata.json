PAUL, Minn. \u2014 University of Denver freshman defenseman Blake Hillman is from Elk River, about 40 miles from the Xcel Energy Center. He had about 10 family members in the seats among the sparse crowd Sunday for the NCAA West Regional championship game against unheralded Ferris State. He doesn\u2019t look old enough to drive, plus he came into the weekend with one goal in 36 games this season.In other words, he\u2019s an unlikely pre-tournament guess to be the Regionals\u2019 Most Outstanding Player.\n\nDid he even dream of that?\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cNot a chance.\u201d\n\nYet Hillman had a goal, including the tie-breaker with 4:32 remaining, and two assists and indeed was named the weekend MOP as the Pioneers beat the Bulldogs 6-3 and advanced to the Frozen Four for the first time since winning back-to-back NCAA titles in 2004 and 2005.\n\nThe 25-9-6 Pioneers will meet National Collegiate Hockey Conference rival North Dakota in a 6:30 p.m. semifinal on April 7 at Tampa\u2019s Amalie Arena, the home of the NHL\u2019s Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a dream come true to come back here and play,\u201d Hillman said of St. Paul. \u201cGrowing up in Minnesota, you always dream about coming to the Xcel and playing in the high school hockey tournament. I never made it, but I think I made up for it this weekend.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably an understatement, since he also had a goal in the Pioneers\u2019 7-2 rout of Boston University in the Saturday semifinal and his score was the game-winner Sunday. It helped eliminate the possibility that DU would come up short in a quirky game it mostly dominated against the fourth-place team from the lightly regarded Western Collegiate Hockey Association.\n\nPacific Rim linemates Danton Heinen, Dylan Gambrell and Trevor Moore each had a goal in the Pioneers\u2019 win. Gambrell and Heinen also had two assists.\n\n\u201cThis time of year, you need your great players to play great,\u201d said DU coach Jim Montgomery. \u201cThey did.\u201d\n\nYet it was 3-3 going in to the final minutes, and one bounce could have made the Pioneers rue not putting it away sooner. But Hillman took a pass from Heinen and scored from the top of the slot to put the Pioneers ahead, and Nolan Zajac and Quentin Shore added insurance goals in the final minutes.\n\n\u201c\u2018Heinz\u2019 got it in the corner and made a great play,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cOur coaches were preaching about how the D-men would be wide open, so I just walked in the slot wide open. I just made sure I didn\u2019t hit the guy who was trying to block the shot, and luckily it went in.\u201d\n\nHow quirky was this one? The Pioneers got the first 10 shots of the game and outshot the Bulldogs 15-3 in the first 20 minutes, yet were locked in a 2-2 tie after the opening period. The Bulldogs \u2014 with school president David Eisler, a world-class clarinetist, playing in the pep band tucked in one corner of a lower balcony \u2014 got goals from Gerald Mayhew and Corey Mackin among their three shots. Mayhew\u2019s was on a breakaway after Hammond fell, Mackin\u2019s on a power play when his shot from a tough angle to DU goalie Tainner Jaillet\u2019s left went off Hammond and in. Each of those pulled the Bulldogs into ties, matching the DU goals from Heinen and Gambrell.\n\n\u201cWe just talked about how anything worth winning, you\u2019re going to have to right through adversity,\u201d said Montgomery. \u201cWe weren\u2019t having any puck luck and they were. We just talked about sticking with the process and how we were owning his game and they were fortunate to be in it.\u201d\n\nMoore, sprung for a partial breakaway by a Hillman pass, made it 3-2 early in the second, but Kyle Schempp tied it up again for the Bulldogs at 7:17 of the third, setting up the Pioneers\u2019 three-goal burst in the final minutes.\n\n\u201cThe growth of this team through the year has been incredible,\u201d said Montgomery, in his third season with the Pioneers. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun to be part of something like that and to be able to get to the Frozen Four and to be able to add to the great tradition of Denver hockey is awesome. But we\u2019re only halfway home.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Pioneers advance to Frozen Four with win over Ferris State", "title": "Denver Pioneers advance to Frozen Four with win over Ferris State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/27/denver-pioneers-advance-to-frozen-four-with-win-over-ferris-state/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160327__Heinenp1.jpg", "height": 530}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160327__Heinenp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-27T17:54:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T05:40:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15ae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a dream come true to come back here and play,\u201d Hillman said of St. Paul.\n\u201c\u2018Heinz\u2019 got it in the corner and made a great play,\u201d Hillman said.\n\u201cThis time of year, you need your great players to play great,\u201d said DU coach Jim Montgomery.\nPacific Rim linemates Danton Heinen, Dylan Gambrell and Trevor Moore each had a goal in the Pioneers\u2019 win.\n\u201cThe growth of this team through the year has been incredible,\u201d said Montgomery, in his third season with the Pioneers."}
