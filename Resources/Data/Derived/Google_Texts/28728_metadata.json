It\u2019s often dominated by frank, raunchy sex talk. But she has serious reasons for pushing the graphic anatomical and orgasmic observations.\n\nIn the HBO hour, \u201cLive at the Apollo,\u201d debuting Oct. 17, she tackles her reputation as a \u201csex comic\u201d directly. It\u2019s different for men in the business, she says. \u201cIf a male comedian came onstage holding his penis, people would call him \u2018a thinker.\u2019 \u201c\n\nAfter a particularly crass bit, she finds the humanity in the situation, a trick which applies to her material overall. \u201cI\u2019m just reminding you that we\u2019re all disgusting,\u201d she says.\n\nThe hour, directed by Chris Rock, further cements her status as an all-medium power player.\n\nBy turns coy, insecure, dramatic and challenging, Schumer has the flexibility to make her conversation both intimate and grandstanding. Whether pondering the mysteries of skinny women in Los Angeles or her own urinary tract infection, she laces her observations with bad-girl zings.\n\nJoanne Ostrow: 303-954-1830, jostrow@denverpost.com or @ostrowdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cAmy Schumer: Live at the Apollo,\u201d her first HBO special, hits Oct. 17", "title": "\u201cAmy Schumer: Live at the Apollo,\u201d her first HBO special, hits Oct. 17", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/12/amy-schumer-live-at-the-apollo-her-first-hbo-special-hits-oct-17/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151012__Amy_Schumer_HBOp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151012__Amy_Schumer_HBOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-12T11:32:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T07:49:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Comedy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc79\"", "article_summary": "In the HBO hour, \u201cLive at the Apollo,\u201d debuting Oct. 17, she tackles her reputation as a \u201csex comic\u201d directly.\nHer ascent has been amazingly rapid and politically tinged: at the moment, she is the best spokesperson for an edgy next-wave feminism.\nWhether pondering the mysteries of skinny women in Los Angeles or her own urinary tract infection, she laces her observations with bad-girl zings.\nBy turns coy, insecure, dramatic and challenging, Schumer has the flexibility to make her conversation both intimate and grandstanding.\nThe hour, directed by Chris Rock, further cements her status as an all-medium power player."}
