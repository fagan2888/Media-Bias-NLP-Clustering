Prior left field with a tight left calf.\n\nAnderson had earlier bowled Doolan for 31 and the England paceman finished with 2-20 from his seven overs. Off-spinner Swann (1-27) took the other wicket.\n\nMarsh, who made 27 from 65 balls, and Callum Ferguson (15) were at the crease when the weather intervened for the final time.\n\nAustralia's need for a band of healthy batsmen in reserve, though, lessened a little when coach Darren Lehmann said there was growing confidence all-rounder Shane Watson would be fit for the opening test.\n\nWatson missed the 2006-7 Ashes series with one of string of hamstring injuries that have afflicted him over his career and sustained another in the series-deciding one-day loss in India last week.\n\n\"The reports from our medical team on Shane's recovery from injury are pleasing,\" said Lehmann without elaborating whether the all-rounder would be able to resume bowling.\n\n\"He is making good progress and responding well to treatment. If that continues, we have confidence that he will be fit for the first test.\"\n\nEngland batsman Kevin Pietersen was the first wicket to fall in the match after Cook (154) and Carberry (153) retired to give their team mates some batting practice.\n\nPietersen had made eight runs when a low delivery from Trent Copeland trapped him leg before wicket and Jonathan Trott followed him back to the pavilion soon afterwards with just four runs to his name.\n\nEngland play one more tour match against a New South Wales Invitational XI at the Sydney Cricket Ground next week before the first test begins in Brisbane on November 21.\n\n(Reporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Usman Khawaja fluffed his Ashes audition with a soft dismissal for just three runs as England's rain-disrupted tour match against Australia A in Hobart ended in a draw on Saturday.", "title": "Khawaja fluffs Ashes audition, England tour match drawn", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20131109&t=2&i=810341358&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBRE9A80M6C00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
