Unions and Obamacare: 5 questions\n\nKey parts of organized labor have a case of buyer\u2019s remorse over Obamacare and they\u2019re letting everyone know about it.\n\nThe AFL-CIO at its convention this week passed a resolution calling President Barack Obama\u2019s health law \u201chighly disruptive\u201d to some union insurance plans, \u201csubstantially changing the coverage available for millions of covered employees and their families.\u201d The labor federation did back the sweeping goals of Obamacare \u2014 covering people and restraining costs \u2014but that wasn\u2019t the part of the message that resonated politically.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see those who strongly endorsed the health care law finally recognize its fundamental problems,\u201d the GOP-led House Education and Workforce Committee said in a statement Thursday.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nThe SEIU remains very supportive of Obamacare. It even announced this week that it was pitching in for outreach and enrollment efforts across the country. But that was eclipsed by the disenchantment of the AFL-CIO, the biggest labor federation in the country.\n\nHere are five questions about the brewing conflict between labor and Obamacare.\n\nWhat are \u201cmultiemployer\u201d plans and who is in them?\n\nAbout 20 million people get insurance through multiemployer or Taft-Hartley plans.\n\nInstead of contracting directly with private insurers, these health benefit plans are collectively bargained between unions and multiple employers often in the same industry, like food service or construction.\n\nThe government treats the plans like other employer-sponsored insurance, providing the same generous tax breaks on employer and employee contributions.\n\nOften, industries that use these multiemployer plans don\u2019t employ a long-term, full-time workforce. But the plans are portable \u2014 workers can often take their insurance from job to job among participating employers. A roofer, for instance, can go from job to job, without any interruption in coverage. With a traditional health plan, he\u2019d change insurance each time he changes jobs \u2014 if he even got insurance.\n\nWhy do unions feel these plans are threatened?\n\nThat\u2019s easy. Smaller employers who now pay into these multiemployer plans may look at the deal their employees can get on the new Obamacare health insurance exchanges and decide they would be better off there. The unions are also worried about rising costs.\n\n\u201cThe threat is that employers and in particular small employers are going to say, \u2018I basically have low-income employee[s] who would be better off in the exchange than they would be with my contribution to a Taft-Hartley plan, so I\u2019m going to walk away,\u201d said Tim Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University and expert on the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThat then undermines the Taft-Hartley plans because fewer employers contribute to them, and fewer employees will want them. It\u2019s going to undermine the ability of the unions to have a benefit they can offer their members.\u201d\n\nTim Schlittner, spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said, \u201cThat\u2019s a pressure that\u2019s been created by this law and one of the unintended consequence. I don\u2019t think anyone could have imagined that the ideal outcome of the law would be to cover millions of people by disrupting the good insurance that millions of people already have.\u201d\n\nSome of the other labor complaints are the same ones that conservative critics lodge \u2014 Obamacare is chock full of taxes and fees that will make insurance more expensive. They also worry about a \u201cCadillac tax\u201d \u2014 a tax on the most generous insurance plans starting in 2018 that may affect some unions\u2019 health coverage. The idea is to encourage smarter utilization of health care, but the unions fear it will just erode benefits.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "What does labor want, and how should the administration respond?", "title": "Unions and Obamacare: 5 questions", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/questions-about-unions-obamacare-96738.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2012/06/120627_labor_seiu_ap605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Health Care Reform (2257),SEIU,AFL-CIO,Unions", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "What does labor want, and how should the administration respond?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Unions and Obamacare: 5 questionsKey parts of organized labor have a case of buyer\u2019s remorse over Obamacare and they\u2019re letting everyone know about it.\nThey also worry about a \u201cCadillac tax\u201d \u2014 a tax on the most generous insurance plans starting in 2018 that may affect some unions\u2019 health coverage.\nHere are five questions about the brewing conflict between labor and Obamacare.\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)The SEIU remains very supportive of Obamacare.\nThe idea is to encourage smarter utilization of health care, but the unions fear it will just erode benefits."}
