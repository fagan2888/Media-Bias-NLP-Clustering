(Alejandro Alvarez / Staff Photographer )\n\nThis morning, SportsRadio 94 WIP fleshed out all sorts of details about its annual poultry gorge-athon.\n\nPrizes will be doubly generous with prizes on Jan. 31, since it's Wing Bowl 22.\n\nTickets for the Wells Fargo Center event will go on sale Dec. 10.\n\nAnd for the first time ever, Wing Bowl will have a college division, with the top collegiate eater collecting a car.\n\nMorning Show host Angelo Cataldi also appealed for prospective contestants to start proposing stunts, since a late Thanksgiving and an early Super Bowl mean less time to qualify.\n\nMostly, he focused on what he called the \"sensational\" prizes, worth \"way over $100,000 for eating chicken wings or dressing in a thong.\u201d\n\nThe top prize will be a record $22,000, \"more than any prize in cash in the history of competitive eating in the world,\u201d Cataldi declared.\n\nIt tops the old prize of $20,000, which was also the amount won by Joey Chestnut in July in winning the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest on Coney Island.\n\nTwo cars -- Chrysler 200s -- will be awarded to the top local eater and the top college eater.\n\nTwo motorcycles will go to the top Wingette and to the winner of another category yet to be determined.\n\nThe procession of pageantry that precedes the event will result in six Punta Cana vacations for two going to the top entourage. (See full Wing Bowl prize list.)\n\nMore details about the ticket sale should be released later this week, according to spokeswoman Cindy Webster.\n\nUnclear is whether the event will again be televised on pay-per-view.\n\nWithin minutes of the announcements, \"Uncle Rico\" became the first to propose an eating stunt -- 100 pieces of sushi in 10 minutes.\n\nAfter some debate, cohost Al Morganti, originator and commissioner of Wing Bowl, ruled the time will be decided after they get to see the sushi.\n\nSoon, a pecan pie eating contest started to take shape, with a Wing Bowl berth going to the guy who can finish two off the fastest on Wednesday morning.\n\nIt's two pies, of course, in honor of Wing Bowl 22.\n\nWing Bowl 21 was won won by Jamie \u201cThe Bear\u201d McDonald of Granby, Conn., who wolfed down 287 wings, edging three-time champ Jonathan \u201cSuper\u201d Squibb, who ate 282.\n\nWIP is still updating its Wing Bowl 22 website.\n\nContact staff writer Peter Mucha at 215-854-4342 or pmucha@phillynews.com.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160527, "editdate": "20131202T05:34:00", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Wing_Bowl_format_prizes_ticket_sales_announced.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/wingbowl2013.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Wing Bowl 22: More prizes, new college champ"}, "cg": "news", "keywords": "Peter Mucha", "description": "This morning, SportsRadio 94 WIP fleshed out all sorts of details about its annual poultry gorge-athon. - Peter Mucha, Philadelphia Philly.com", "byline": "Peter Mucha", "contenttype": "Article", "publication": "Philly.com", "title": "Wing Bowl 22: More prizes, new college champ", "livedate": "20131202T05:34:00", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "news_keywords": "Peter Mucha", "contentid": 234054821, "DC.date.issued": "2013-12-02T05:34:00-04:00", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "description": "This morning, SportsRadio 94 WIP fleshed out all sorts of details about its annual poultry gorge-athon.", "title": "Wing Bowl 22: More prizes, new college champ", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/news/Wing_Bowl_format_prizes_ticket_sales_announced.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/wingbowl2013.jpg", "type": "article"}, "searchdate": "2013-12-02", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "sourcepublication": "Philly.com"}, "article_summary": "Prizes will be doubly generous with prizes on Jan. 31, since it's Wing Bowl 22.\nAnd for the first time ever, Wing Bowl will have a college division, with the top collegiate eater collecting a car.\nWing Bowl 21 was won won by Jamie \u201cThe Bear\u201d McDonald of Granby, Conn., who wolfed down 287 wings, edging three-time champ Jonathan \u201cSuper\u201d Squibb, who ate 282.\n(See full Wing Bowl prize list.)\n(Alejandro Alvarez / Staff Photographer )WIP's Wing Bowl 22 will be at the Wells Fargo Center on Jan. 31, 2014."}
