The right is delighted because Emanuel is a prominent overclass Democrat, an enforcer for the last two Democratic presidents, the man who led the midterm \u201cthumping\u201d that undid George W. Bush\u2019s congressional majorities in 2006, and the mayor of a city that\u2019s a case study in one-party misgovernment. The left, meanwhile, is happy to see him fall because Emanuel is a prominent centrist Democrat, whose role in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses involved prodding his bosses to temper their liberalism and tack somewhat to the right.\n\nThe latter critique of Emanuel is offered in a characteristically pungent form by Rick Perlstein, of \u201cBefore the Storm\u201d and \u201cNixonland\u201d fame, in this New Yorker piece. In addition to his inordinate fondness for wealthy donors, Perlstein writes, Emanuel gave Bill Clinton terrible advice on NAFTA (which, \u201cin alienating the Party\u2019s working-class base, contributed to the Democrats losing control of the House of Representatives in 1994\u201d), the \u201994 crime bill (whose draconian elements Clinton has since apologized for) and immigration enforcement. On immigration, fortunately, Clinton didn\u2019t take Emanuel\u2019s advice \u201cto out-Republican the Republicans\u201d on enforcement and border security, leaving the G.O.P. as \u201cthe party solely associated with vindictive immigration policies, which leaves them in the long-term crisis they\u2019re finding themselves in now\u2014identified as anathema by Latinos, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing ethnic group. If Rahm had had his way, that never would have happened.\u201d\n\nThen in the 2000s, Emanuel was back at it: For the 2006 midterm campaign, he \u201caggressively recruited right-leaning candidates, frequently military veterans, including former Republicans.\u201d But many of them lost, \u201csome even lost in their primaries, to candidates backed by liberals,\u201d and the ones who won were party of a \u201crickety\u201d majority:\n\n\u2026 even where Emanuel\u2019s strategy succeeded in the short term, it undermined the party over time. One of his winners, the football star Heath Shuler, of North Carolina, would not even commit to vote for Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House, and was one of many Rahm recruits to vote against important Obama Administration priorities, like economic stimulus, banking reform, and health care. Many are no longer congressmen. Some Democrats now argue that, in the long run, 2006 might have weakened the Party more than it strengthened it. \u201cRahm\u2019s recruitment strategy\u201d was \u201ccatastrophic,\u201d the retired record executive Howie Klein, who helps run a political action committee that funds liberal congressional challengers, said, and it contributed to the massive G.O.P. majorities we have now, the biggest since the nineteen-twenties.\n\nAnd thence to the Obama era itself, when Rahm responded to the Scott Brown upset by urging the White House to scale back Obamacare, \u201calmost to the vanishing point\u201d Perlstein suggests. Fortunately Nancy Pelosi stiffened the president\u2019s spine, and when Obamacare survived its big Supreme Court challenge Emanuel said that he was glad the president hadn\u2019t taken his advice.\n\nThis is an interesting story. But it does seem to ever-so-slightly conflate Perlstein\u2019s policy preferences with political and electoral wisdom. Perlstein\u2019s doesn\u2019t like NAFTA, for instance, so that and that alone gets blamed for \u201calienating the Party\u2019s working-class base.\u201d But many of Emanuel\u2019s other stratagems, from his tough tack on crime and immigration in the 1990s to his 2006 recruitment of socially conservative Democrats in the South, were arguably attempts to shore up that same working class cohort \u2013 something Perlstein doesn\u2019t mention because, well, he doesn\u2019t agree with white working class voters on social questions. The possibility that the Democratic Party\u2019s increasingly monolithic stance on social issues might have contributed a little more than NAFTA to its struggles with downscale whites receives no consideration; the fact that everywhere except the presidential level it\u2019s arguably liberalism, not the G.O.P., that\u2019s now in crisis is likewise brushed away.\n\nSimilarly, Perlstein likes Obamacare\u2019s expansiveness and thinks anything more modest would have been a nothingburger, so the collapse of the Emanuel-built Democratic majority in 2010 gets pinned on its \u201crickety\u201d reliance on social conservatives and other exotic species rather than on, say, the political impact of the Obamacare debate. The possibility that the Democratic majority would have proven less rickety if the White House had been a little more incrementalist, or had pursued further economic reforms before it went all-in on health care, gets no attention. Nor, strikingly, does Emanuel get any credit for the fact that without that rickety majority \u2013 the only congressional majority Democrats have enjoyed in twenty years! \u2014 there would have been no chance at an Obamacare-style bill at all.\n\nUnderlying Perlstein\u2019s analysis is a tendency I\u2019ve written about before, which runs through a lot of liberal commentary in the Obama era: The assumption that the strange political balance of our times, in which Republicans have a big edge in midterm races and Democrats run the table in presidential years and gridlock results inevitably from the combination, is just the Way Things Are, and something that the Democratic Party need to live with until the inevitable demographic momentum Perlstein invokes finally reaches a point where a multicultural coalition can crack the G.O.P.\u2019s hold on Congress.\n\nWhen in reality our current balance is a chosen thing, a consequence of a Republican elite\u2019s preference for the policy mix that makes it hard for the G.O.P. to win in higher-turnout elections and a Democratic elite\u2019s preference for a policy mix that makes it very hard to win the kind of House seats (Southern, Midwestern, working class and white) that the party won in 2006 but hasn\u2019t won since. Or as I put it after the Democrats were thumped in 2014, \u201cboth parties are led by people who find it convenient to sort our political landscape by which kind of individualism, economic or social/sexual, you most favor or most fear. And it\u2019s that sorting has given us the seesaw, in a way that a different sorting might well not.\u201d\n\nRahm Emanuel had, and has, many faults, and I don\u2019t begrudge progressives their disdain for him. But they should be clear on who they\u2019re disdaining: He\u2019s one of the few leaders of either party who\u2019s tried to push our politics of its existing rut, and one of even fewer who can claim that his push\u2019s outcome, however rickety and temporary it proved, had some real and consequential success.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160108102713, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 8, 2016", "article": {"published_time": 1452266833, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T15:32:28-05:00"}, "keywords": "Clinton Bill,Emanuel Rahm,Obama Barack,Illegal Immigration,Law and Legislation,North American Free Trade Agreement,United States Politics and Government,Democratic Party,House of Representatives,Republican Party,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/Rahm and His Party ( 20160108 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Clinton, Bill;Emanuel, Rahm;Obama, Barack", "twitter": {"description": "Rahm Emanuel\u2019s legacy in an age of gridlock.", "title": "Rahm and His Party", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/rahm-and-his-party/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000004132416, "description": "Rahm Emanuel\u2019s legacy in an age of gridlock.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 8, 2016", "org": "Democratic Party;House of Representatives;Republican Party", "utime": 20160108153228, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160108, "pdate": 20160108, "des": "Illegal Immigration;Law and Legislation;North American Free Trade Agreement;United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "Rahm Emanuel\u2019s legacy in an age of gridlock.", "title": "Rahm and His Party", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/rahm-and-his-party/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/rahm-and-his-party/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Rahm and His Party", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "Some Democrats now argue that, in the long run, 2006 might have weakened the Party more than it strengthened it.\nAnd thence to the Obama era itself, when Rahm responded to the Scott Brown upset by urging the White House to scale back Obamacare, \u201calmost to the vanishing point\u201d Perlstein suggests.\nNor, strikingly, does Emanuel get any credit for the fact that without that rickety majority \u2013 the only congressional majority Democrats have enjoyed in twenty years!\nas \u201cthe party solely associated with vindictive immigration policies, which leaves them in the long-term crisis they\u2019re finding themselves in now\u2014identified as anathema by Latinos, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing ethnic group.\nThe fall of Rahm Emanuel, seemingly a political dead man walking because of his alleged role in covering up the video showing Chicago cops shooting a black teenager, has united right and left in schadenfreude."}
