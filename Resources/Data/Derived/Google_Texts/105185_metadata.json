Still, even frozen chicken nuggets have a line, and apparently the addition of plastics to the nuggets' recipe crossed it. Applegate Naturals recalled 15,000 pounds of its frozen chicken nuggets after too many customers complained of finding plastic in their food.\n\nApplegate Natural & Organic Meats, owned by the chicken monopoly Perdue Farms, issued a nationwide withdrawal of its 8-ounce boxes of Applegate Naturals chicken nuggets on Aug. 8, WSB Atlanta reported. The boxes are described as having the establishment number \u201cP2617\u201d and the best before date of 02/02/15. Four days later, the Food Safety and Inspection Service stepped in and formally recalled the nuggets because they \u201cmay be contaminated with extraneous material.\u201d We later learned that this \u201cextraneous material\u201d was actually plastic.\n\nAlthough the nuggets were recalled from all outlets selling them, it is feared that because they are a frozen product customers may still have them packed away in their freezers. As of yet, no injuries or illnesses have been reported. The FSIS advises that if anyone suspects he or she may have been injured after consuming the tainted nuggets to contact a health care provider. There is also a 24-hour virtual representative for the FSIS that customers may contact at AskKaren.gov.\n\nTechnically, accidentally consuming a tiny bit of plastic probably isn\u2019t going to kill you. The most common health risks associated with consuming extraneous material is dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing. Most foreign objects with easily pass through your body without causing any harm. It\u2019s only when one accidentally consumes as especially large object that it becomes a medical emergency. These can get stuck in the digestive tract and damage and even pierce the wall of the gut. But still it\u2019s advised that you do your best to avoid eating plastic, regardless of the risk factor.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "perdue, farms, chicken, nugget, recall, 2014, 15k, pounds, frozen, products, may, have, tiny", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Food Safety and Inspection Service has issued a nationwide recall of Applegate Naturals chicken nuggets after customers found pieces of plastic in the product.", "title": "15K Pounds Of Chicken Nuggets Recalled For Dangerous Secret Ingredient: Plastic Pieces", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/perdue-farms-chicken-nugget-recall-2014-15k-pounds-frozen-products-may-have-tiny-pieces-298072", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/nuggets.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Food Safety and Inspection Service has issued a nationwide recall of Applegate Naturals chicken nuggets after customers found pieces of plastic in the product.", "title": "15K Pounds Of Chicken Nuggets Recalled For Dangerous Secret Ingredient: Plastic Pieces", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/perdue-farms-chicken-nugget-recall-2014-15k-pounds-frozen-products-may-have-tiny-pieces-298072", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/nuggets.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/14/nuggets.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-08-14T11:16:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-14T11:19:00-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Food Safety and Inspection Service has issued a nationwide recall of Applegate Naturals chicken nuggets after customers found pieces of plastic in the product."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09a5\"", "article_summary": "Still, even frozen chicken nuggets have a line, and apparently the addition of plastics to the nuggets' recipe crossed it.\nApplegate Naturals recalled 15,000 pounds of its frozen chicken nuggets after too many customers complained of finding plastic in their food.\nThe most common health risks associated with consuming extraneous material is dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing.\nApplegate Natural & Organic Meats, owned by the chicken monopoly Perdue Farms, issued a nationwide withdrawal of its 8-ounce boxes of Applegate Naturals chicken nuggets on Aug. 8, WSB Atlanta reported.\nFour days later, the Food Safety and Inspection Service stepped in and formally recalled the nuggets because they \u201cmay be contaminated with extraneous material.\u201d We later learned that this \u201cextraneous material\u201d was actually plastic."}
