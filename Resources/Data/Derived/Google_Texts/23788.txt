President Obama is so unpopular that even MSNBC host Chris Matthews is criticizing him.

After the president’s press conference Wednesday afternoon addressing the midterm election results, Matthews complained of Obama’s refusal to compromise with members of Congress, accusing him of “miss[ing] the main point of politics.”

“What bothered me about him [today is] he keeps talking about common ground. Damn it, there’s very little common ground between left and right, but what there is is compromise,” explained Matthews. “You do something for me on minimum wage, I’ll do something for you in corporate tax reform. You give me something on corporate tax reform and I’ll get rid of some of the loopholes or I’ll do something on trade for you.”

“He misses the main point of politics which is to be a politician and to trade,” the MSNBC host continued. “You want this? Okay, you want to take care of people who have been here illegally for 20, 30 years? Here’s what I want. No more illegal hiring, and that’s all in the Senate bill. But he won’t sell the compromise.”

As a result, said Matthews, Obama will likely get into quite a tussle with new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kent.) when the new Congress takes over in January.

“There’s something in this guy that just plays to his constituency and acts like there is no other world out there,” Matthews spat. “And that’s going to be a collision at the end of this year like you haven’t seen. I do believe it will be like waving a red flag in front of the bull. I think Mitch McConnell is headed for a fight with the president.”
