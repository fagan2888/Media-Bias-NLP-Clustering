About a third of these have been uprooted at least three times and placed with new foster families, depriving them of permenancy and a stable environment.\n\nOnly 78 children in foster arrangements were able to be adopted into permanent homes last year and it's hoped the changes will see that number rise significantly, Ms Goward said.\n\nAccording to the her department's figures, there are 715 children on the waiting list for adoption.\n\n\"The number of adoptions are not going up enough,\" she said, adding her target for the future would be \"in the hundreds\".\n\nThe changes will see adoption made a priority in court cases where children are removed from their parents.\n\nUnder the present rules, magistrates are restricted to giving the children back to their parents, a relative or putting them in the care of the Minister until they are 18.\n\nLeading foster carer group Barnados Australia has backed the changes, saying it hoped the moves would make adoption quicker and easier.\n\n\"Previously the Care Act looked at long-term foster care - children were under the care of the minister until they were 18 years old,\" Louise Voigt, CEO of Barnardos, said.\n\n\"That's not a satisfactory situation if you're looking toward adoption.\n\nHurdles to adoption torn down\n\n\"Children in NSW need more access to adoption and this legislation will bring that about.\"\n\nFor couples looking to adopt a child the process involves lengthy assessments by authorities, which are then followed up with formal proceedings in court.\n\nMany cases fail due to the resistance of the birth parents involved, even when they are incapable of raising the children themselves.\n\nThe new scheme will be different because it will focus on \"open adoption\", meaning the child will be raised with another family but their biological parents will always maintain a relationship and connection to them.\n\nMs Goward said there was a stigma around adoption, due to the secrecy and shame of the Stolen Generation, that was only now being broken down.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PARENTS desperate to adopt and foster children in need of stable homes will all be winners under moves to relax adoption laws.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "PARENTS desperate to adopt and foster children in need of stable homes will all be winners under moves to relax adoption laws.", "title": "NSW government adoption fix to save hundreds of children", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/nsw-government-adoption-fix-to-save-hundreds-of-children/story-fni0cx12-1226738907149", "image": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2013/10/12/1226738/907297-f2c4b054-3254-11e3-918a-cfa38c5b7795.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2013/10/12/1226738/907297-f2c4b054-3254-11e3-918a-cfa38c5b7795.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226738907149, "keywords": "foster care, birth parents, span class, PARENTS desperate, adoption laws, government adoption, duplicitous assessment processes, ,,,Australia, Pru Goward, Louise Voigt, tennis tennis, formal adoption papers, foster carers, prospective parents, foster care system, court cases, cases fail, permanent carers, permanent solution, permanent homes, ,,,China", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Oct 12 23:03:58 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sat Oct 12 23:03:58 EST 2013", "author": "YONI BASHAN"}}, "article_summary": "PARENTS desperate to adopt and foster children in need of stable homes will all be winners under moves to relax adoption laws.\n\"Previously the Care Act looked at long-term foster care - children were under the care of the minister until they were 18 years old,\" Louise Voigt, CEO of Barnardos, said.\nHurdles to adoption torn down\"Children in NSW need more access to adoption and this legislation will bring that about.\"\nThere are more than 18,000 children in the foster care system seeking a permanent home.\nThe changes will see adoption made a priority in court cases where children are removed from their parents."}
