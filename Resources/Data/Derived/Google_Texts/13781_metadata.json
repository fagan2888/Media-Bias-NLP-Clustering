And you, too, dear readers\u2013especially those of you who don\u2019t even live in California\u2013may be wondering why a candidate for a decidedly obscure political office is worthy of your attention.\n\nWell, part of it is that Dan Schnur is an interesting guy, a longtime consultant to moderate Republicans like Arnold Schwarzenegger and John McCain. But he isn\u2019t a Republican anymore. He\u2019s running as an Independent. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of marriage equality and lower taxes,\u201d he begins. \u201cI\u2019m tough on crime and pro-choice. I\u2019m for immigration reform and for using test scores as a valuable measure of students\u2019 progress. Yes, the reason that I\u2019m running as an Independent is that neither party will have me.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not exactly accurate. He\u2019s running as an Independent because there were two political reforms enacted during Schwarzenegger\u2019s time as governor of California. They were below the radar but startling, the sort of reforms that are near impossible because incumbent politicians usually block them\u2013but they were passed by public referendum and initiative in 2010, and Schnur was one of those at the heart of the campaign to get them enacted.\n\nThe reforms are ingeniously simple. There is no more gerrymandering in California, no more congressional or state legislative districts tailored to the needs of the incumbents or the majority political party. District lines are now drawn by an independent commission to reflect actual community borders. (The commissioners are forbidden by law from knowing where the incumbents live.) Second, primaries are now multipartisan: the top two vote getters, regardless of party affiliation, face off against each other in the general election. Schnur co-chaired the Voices of Reform project on redistricting. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too involved in the top-two primary reform,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would make much difference \u2026 but I\u2019ve learned: this could be enormous.\u201d Schnur and his colleagues may have actually created an electoral system that favors centrists rather than politicians who play to their party\u2019s base. On June 3, California will go to the polls in what politicos have taken to calling the Jungle Primary.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s Fourth Congressional District is a perfect primer for the curiosities of the Jungle. Tom McClintock, 57, is the three-term incumbent and has long prided himself on his \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d orneriness. He is, in other words, a Tea Party Republican. His district, in the Central Valley and foothills, is very conservative but perhaps not as extreme as McClintock is. He is, for example, in favor of amnesty for Edward Snowden, the NSA leaker, because Snowden helped expose the criminal proclivities of the federal government and \u201cI\u2019d rather have him home talking to us than over there talking to the Russians.\u201d\n\nAt a well-attended Saturday-afternoon meeting in the town of Mariposa, near the entrance to Yosemite National Park, McClintock endorsed a candidate for county supervisor and then addressed the crowd, many of whom wore cowboy hats and sported some elaborate facial hair. They were all het up over the federal government and the \u201cleft-wing environmentalists,\u201d as McClintock described them, calling the federal tune in Yosemite. Some of their complaints sounded reasonable: a local toad was about to be labeled \u201cthreatened,\u201d which would further limit the local water supply (there\u2019s been a terrible drought in California)\u2013but the toads were dying out, according to the locals, because the feds had stocked the lakes with trout, which ate the tadpoles. The feds were also proposing to close down stables and rafting businesses along the Yosemite waterways.\n\nMcClintock is a smart politician who knows the issues, knows what his constituents care about and can make it seem as if he\u2019s as angry as they are. He takes lonely\u2013his opponents say obstructionist\u2013stands against the various agencies of the Department of the Interior. He \u201cspeaks truth to power,\u201d as he told the folks in Mariposa. In the past, he didn\u2019t have many electoral cares; the Democrats have never had much of a chance in either the old or new Fourth District. But now McClintock has to worry about Art Moore, who is also a Republican.\n\nMoore, 36, is a razor-sharp recent combat veteran, an Army major returned to his hometown of Roseville, the most populous community in the Fourth District. He is a graduate of West Point who served tours in both Iraq and Kuwait. He is also, however, a stone-cold neophyte who hasn\u2019t really been to political boot camp yet. He is, he says, \u201ca conservative,\u201d and he checks the appropriate boxes on most conservative issues, like Obamacare\u2013but he also is \u201ca bit more libertarian\u201d than McClintock on social issues like gay marriage and abortion. Most important, though, is his style: he\u2019s the opposite of McClintock\u2019s lone gunslinger. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to sit down and negotiate with those you don\u2019t agree with,\u201d he says. \u201c[McClintock] has a perfect conservative voting record, but what has he got done? He voted to shut down the federal government\u2013to close Yosemite\u2013which really hurt this district. I\u2019m in favor of building coalitions and seeing if we can make some progress on the issues.\u201d\n\nMoore admits that he would not have run under the old system. McClintock has the party base locked up and the power of incumbency. But if Moore can make it into the general election against McClintock, he may be able to access independent and moderate Democratic voters as well as his brand of conservative Republicans. \u201cIn the Jungle Primary, everybody has to run to the center,\u201d says Fred Keeley, a former state rep from Santa Cruz who co-chaired the Voices of Reform project with Schnur, \u201cbecause that\u2019s where the votes are.\u201d\n\nMcClintock claims not to be worried about Moore. He tells me that his \u201cmost substantial opponent\u201d in the Fourth District is an Independent named Jeffrey Gerlach. It\u2019s a lovely tactic to pretend that Moore doesn\u2019t matter and a sign that uniprimary politics can get pretty interesting: a Republican opponent like Moore, who might appeal to moderates in November, when more people are paying attention, is McClintock\u2019s worst nightmare in the Jungle.\n\nIndeed, across the state in Silicon Valley, there has been an outbreak of electoral weirdness in the 17th Congressional District\u2013which, in some ways, is a mirror image of the race in the Fourth: Mike Honda, a traditional labor liberal, is opposed by a more moderate Democratic newcomer named Ro Khanna. Khanna, 37, is an Indian American, an intellectual-property lawyer who worked in Barack Obama\u2019s Commerce Department and has close ties to the President. He has also reportedly raised $3.7 million\u2013far more than Honda\u2013from Silicon Valley tech titans, who are just beginning to flex their political muscles (much as Hollywood did during the Vietnam War). Khanna is an impressive candidate, fluent on every issue and, in some cases, downright courageous: he is willing to challenge the public-employee unions\u2013all of which support Honda\u2013on issues like accountability and pension reform. Most of the major newspapers in the district have endorsed Khanna.\n\nBut the 17th District also has a semiplausible third candidate\u2013a Republican named Dr. Vanila Singh, 43, a young and attractive professor of anesthesiology at Stanford University Medical School. Singh is a neophyte and can seem foggy on the issues, but she has positioned herself cleverly\u2013she\u2019s another social liberal, and she\u2019s willing to negotiate with the Democrats about the Affordable Care Act. In fact, since about 25% of the district votes Republican, she might pose a credible primary threat to Khanna, the Democratic moderate. And so, after she declared her candidacy, there was a sudden flowering of old-style urban ward politics in and around San Jose. Suddenly, Singh had two Republican challengers\u2013one named, confusingly enough, Vanish Singh Rathore (who was eliminated from the ballot because the signatures on his petitions were not remotely plausible); the other, Joel Vanlandingham, offered petitions that included signatures from Khanna supporters.\n\nKhanna denies any hand in this. \u201cI would have to be pretty stupid to get involved in that sort of thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, Vanlandingham was really tough on me in the League of Women Voters debate.\u201d\n\nThere are some who say that the Jungle will cause of lot of rumbling but no real results. \u201cThe rubber meets the road when the moderates go to Congress,\u201d says Samuel Popkin of the University of California at San Diego. \u201cThe evidence suggests they stick with the party line.\u201d The evidence is skimpy, though\u2013just the 2012 election, when the Jungle was brand-new and most politicians weren\u2019t completely aware of its possibilities yet. Some felt the traditional pull of partisan loyalty and chose not to challenge their party\u2019s stalwarts.\n\nKhanna was one such in 2012, when he chose not to challenge the venerable Representative Pete Stark, a devoted liberal and the only admitted atheist in the House. Another young Democrat, Eric Swalwell, made that race and beat Stark, which sent a signal throughout the state that the Jungle was open for business: you could challenge incumbents of your own party and maybe even win.\n\nHonda seems a bit mystified by all that has happened. His is a classic American story. He spent part of his youth imprisoned in a Japanese-American internment camp in Colorado during World War II. He was inspired, not embittered, by the experience. He became a teacher and then a school principal, then commenced a public life that culminated in seven terms in Congress. His campaign office is in a Service Employees International Union hall. He greets me wearing jeans and cowboy boots and a red, white and blue Democratic donkey tie.\n\nHe sees his career as many incumbents do: a list of local projects funded, of ideological battles fought\u2013in his case, the relentless pursuit of social justice and civil rights. He remembers helping get a nanotechnology bill passed in 2003 at the behest of Silicon Valley, but now the techno-wizards have abandoned him in favor of Khanna. \u201cI\u2019m an orchardist,\u201d he says. \u201cThat nanotechnology bill planted the seeds for the trees that are bearing the fruit in Silicon Valley now. But I guess no one remembers those who plant the trees.\u201d\n\nIt is hard not to have sympathy for Honda, but the political orchard he and his generation planted was poisoned over time by partisanship and paralysis, and now it has been replaced by a jungle. We\u2019ll see what sorts of glorious fruits and subtle poisons the Jungle brings forth.\n\nThis appears in the May 26, 2014 issue of TIME.", "article_metadata": {"description": "All bets are off in California's congressional races as multiple candidates from the same party face off", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "All bets are off in California's congressional races as multiple candidates from the same party face off", "title": "California's New Jungle Primary System", "url": "http://time.com/100556/the-jungle-primary/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/mikehondacamidtermelections1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/mikehondacamidtermelections1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "All bets are off in California's congressional races as multiple candidates from the same party face off", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "California's New Jungle Primary System"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2014 election, california, joe klein, politics, primaries, primary campaign", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Joe Klein, Mike Honda, Ro Khanna, California, Jungle Primary"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe379c\"", "article_summary": "In fact, since about 25% of the district votes Republican, she might pose a credible primary threat to Khanna, the Democratic moderate.\nHe is, in other words, a Tea Party Republican.\nOn June 3, California will go to the polls in what politicos have taken to calling the Jungle Primary.\nThere is no more gerrymandering in California, no more congressional or state legislative districts tailored to the needs of the incumbents or the majority political party.\nCalifornia\u2019s Fourth Congressional District is a perfect primer for the curiosities of the Jungle."}
