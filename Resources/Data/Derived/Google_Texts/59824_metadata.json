Anything worth while is going to go through a growing pains period. But this is his legacy and I think it\u2019s a great one because I don\u2019t think that basic health care should be a privilege of the rich. It should be a right to all.\u201d\n\nCranston also applauded the president for using executive orders to get around Congress on some issues, saying that LBJ turned to the unilateral measures when faced with political opposition.\n\nIn fact, he urged Obama to use more executive fiats to push for a higher minimum wage.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
