In exit polls on Election Day, 78 percent of voters said they were worried about the economy, and clearly the Democrats took most of the blame. They learned the hard way that if you have to give speeches to convince people that things are going well\u2014as President Obama tried to do\u2014then things aren\u2019t going well.\n\nThe funny thing, though, is that nearly all the data\u2014including Friday's robust jobs report\u2014 shows that the economy is, in fact, doing well, even if the Democrats aren't. And as the dust clears from Tuesday's battering, trend lines are emerging that could very easily turn this into the Democrats\u2019 economy\u2014and perhaps Hillary Clinton\u2019s\u2014by 2016.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis year\u2019s campaign proved the degree to which our big picture economic indicators simply fail to capture the multifaceted realities of a country with 320 million souls and nearly as many individual distinct experiences. Our economic indicators may be going up, but the mood of voters is decidedly down. As much as we rely on those indicators to frame our discussion, one-size-fits-all economic numbers simply cannot capture the disparity of experiences that see rural America struggling and a metropolis such as Detroit imploding (and perhaps reinventing itself) while other communities ranging from Silicon Valley to Nebraska are enjoying multi-year boom times.\n\nStill, how that \u201cbig picture\u201d economic sentiment develops over the next two years will, in ways big and small, shape the narrative of the 2016 presidential race and leaves a big question looming: Will the Democratic nominee, whether it\u2019s Hillary Clinton or someone else, be boosted or punished by what is widely perceived as Barack Obama\u2019s economy?\n\nEven as President Obama made an effort this fall to defend the economic record of his administration, few seem persuaded. Gallup\u2019s weekly poll of economic conditions continues to show that more than half of those surveyed reject the notion that economic trends are improving. In fact, according to Rasmussen, 44% of Americans still think that we are in a recession. In state after state, race after race, candidates ran on a promise that they would do everything possible to reverse the decline of the American middle class, address the problem of stagnant wages, and above all, depart from economic policies that enjoy bipartisan scorn for failing the middle class. And in state after state, Republicans who made that argument and blamed Obama reaped electoral victory.\n\nYet there is an almost inverse relationship between the political narrative and the actual numbers. Almost every single piece of data that we collectively use to gauge \u201cthe economy\u201d has pointed consistently and steadily up, not just recently, but steadily over recent years. Unemployment is at its lowest level\u2014statistically\u2014in many years. GDP growth may be unexciting, but it has been steady and consistent at about 2.5% annually. Inflation is\u2014statistically speaking\u2014non-existent. Housing prices have recovered much of their 2008-2009 collapse.\n\nNone of this has dented public anger, and the primary explanation is that wage growth has been unimpressive. The ancillary explanation is that the story of unimpressive wage growth has been loudly and consistently told, along with an emphasis on underemployment, long-term unemployment and millions of workers unable to find meaningful jobs.\n\nThe question for the next two years heading into the presidential election is how long will public sentiment remain grimly negative about all things economy?\n\nChart designed by David Foster\n\nIf a majority of Americans continue to view the economic landscape through dark-tinted glasses, it hardly bodes well for a Hillary Clinton or anyone associated with what so many deem \u201cfailed\u201d policies. The Republican narrative is that big government policies epitomized by Obamacare have crippled the middle class, to which Democrats respond somewhat defensively that things are improving under their watch and that better policies are needed to allow those gains to be more widely shared.\n\nThey have a tough sell. No one who is anxious about the morphing employment trends or changing wage landscape is likely to be swayed by a good GDP report, or by a politician or pundit telling them that \u201cthe economy\u201d is doing better. If a plurality of voters are still convinced two years from now that \u201cthe economy\u201d is getting worse, an entire smorgasbord of economic indicators aren\u2019t going to convince them otherwise. After all, if you\u2019re staring down looming bills and fears about your retirement savings, how comforting is it to know that the nation\u2019s \u201ctotal seasonally-adjusted nonfarm payroll employment\u201d has risen steadily over the past 52 months?\n\n***\n\nThis yawning gap between what our numbers say and what most people feel is both extreme and increasingly unprecedented. For much of the 20 th century, when the lattice of economic numbers painted a positive picture, that was reflected in how most people viewed their present and future\u2014not because the numbers shaped their experience but rather because the numbers represented it.\n\nThe crisis of 2008-2009 was sufficiently jarring that it\u2019s understandable that it will take a long time before a majority of the populace feels secure about their economic future. While many people still believe the economy is headed south, fewer people believe it than did last year or the year before or the year before. The gap may still yawn wide between economic perception and statistical reality but it is slowly narrowing.\n\nBut will the lines cross before 2016? Will more people at the end of next year think that the American system is thriving? And what will that do to the election narrative? How does that affect the primaries in the first half of the year, and the general election in November? What happens if those lines cross sometime between when people vote for the nominees and when they vote in the general election?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "The next election might hinge on whether voters can start to believe the good news.", "title": "Whose Economy Will It Be in 2016?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/2016-elections-economy-obama-112500.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/04/hillarychart_1104_2.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Economy,2016 Elections,Hillary Clinton,Jobs,Politics,Unemployment", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "The next election might hinge on whether voters can start to believe the good news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The question for the next two years heading into the presidential election is how long will public sentiment remain grimly negative about all things economy?\nOur economic indicators may be going up, but the mood of voters is decidedly down.\nIf a plurality of voters are still convinced two years from now that \u201cthe economy\u201d is getting worse, an entire smorgasbord of economic indicators aren\u2019t going to convince them otherwise.\nIn exit polls on Election Day, 78 percent of voters said they were worried about the economy, and clearly the Democrats took most of the blame.\nAnd as the dust clears from Tuesday's battering, trend lines are emerging that could very easily turn this into the Democrats\u2019 economy\u2014and perhaps Hillary Clinton\u2019s\u2014by 2016."}
