(HOLLYWOOD REPORTER) Joan Rivers, no stranger to controversy, told a reporter this week that President Barack Obama is gay and that his wife, First Lady Michelle, is “a transgender.”

Rivers was asked by a reporter on the street about her Monday appearance at a bookstore in New York City, where she officiated an impromptu gay wedding between two of her fans.

The reporter then asked her whether the U.S. will ever see a gay president, to which the 81-year-old Rivers responded, “We already have it with Obama, so let’s just calm down.”
