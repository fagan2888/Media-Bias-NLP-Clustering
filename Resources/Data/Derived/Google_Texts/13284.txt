Kansas Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, M.D., is not a fan of the Affordable Care Act.

While in Hays for his TMP-Marian high school reunion, Colyer took time out Saturday morning to meet with Hays residents at the invitation of 111th District Representative Sue Boldra, R-KS.

Colyer is a plastic surgeon who has worked in many developing countries, and still practices one day a week.

Last week he testified at a Congressional hearing to discuss the impact the ACA is having on states.

“Profound,” he told the Hays group.

“There are some good things about the program, but many unintended consequences in requiring every American to have health insurance:”

Open enrollment in the Affordable Care Act begins October 1.

Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger was in Hays Monday in a series across the state talking about health care reform.
