Muslims have the most faith in President Obama’s administration.

Among religious groups in the U.S., followers of Islam were overwhelmingly the most approving of the President (72%), according to the results of a Gallup poll released Friday.

Mormons showed the lowest level of satisfaction with Obama (78% disapprove), colored no doubt by the President’s defeat of Mormon Republican challenger Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.

Protestants and Catholics were also among the three groups most dissatisfied with the President’s performance, likely due to his administration’s tense rapport with faith-based organizations seeking religious exemptions from the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act.

Conservative critics of Obama have long declared him the “first Muslim President,” though Obama has professed he is a Christian.

Obama's former "Pastor in Chief" Joshua DuBois affirmed in 2013 that the President was indeed a "a deeply faithful President," citing his fondness for the Old Testament book of Job, the accounts of the prophet Isaiah and works by theologians such as C.S. Lewis.

"People are going to believe any range of things about any leader of the country," DuBois said in an interview with ABC News about those who questioned the sincerity of Obama's Christian faith.

"All the President can do is live out his Christian walk every single day. The detractors will do their detracting, but at the end of the day it's about his relationship with God and that relationship, from all that I can tell, is strong."

The Gallup poll results were based on the group's interviews in the first six months of 2014, when the President's job approval rating averaged 43% among Americans.
