PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota cabin owners could be in line for a big tax cut as House Republicans prepare a push to end the statewide property tax on residents\u2019 second homes next year.\n\nMinnesota has levied the statewide property tax on cabins as if they were businesses since 2002, when then-Gov. Jesse Ventura made the change, the Star Tribune (http://strib.mn/1ZvCGrF ) reported. The tax hits cabins with a higher bill than normal homes, leading some advocates for getaway properties to lobby for a change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not opposed to paying taxes,\u201d said Nyle Zikmund, a 57-year-old Blaine resident who inherited a cabin on 40 acres in northern Minnesota. \u201cWe\u2019re just opposed to paying an unfair share.\u201d\n\nThe tax has generated about $44 million each year for the state and the money goes straight into Minnesota\u2019s general fund.\n\nGroups pushing for its elimination like the Minnesota Lakes and Rivers Advocates argue that it\u2019s pricing middle-class residents out of cabin ownership.\n\nWhile Republicans who control the Minnesota House are on board, others like Democratic Rep. Paul Marquart aren\u2019t sold. The Dilworth lawmaker said it\u2019s unfair to extend a tax cut to wealthy lakefront property owners before slashing everyday homeowners\u2019 bills.\n\n\u201cYou could have a senior citizen in East Grand Forks not see one dime in property tax relief, yet someone in North Dakota, if they owned a lake cabin in Minnesota, they\u2019d see significant property tax relief,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Greg Davids, who chairs the House Taxes Committee, acknowledged that eliminating the tax could be a boon for well-to-do residents. But he argued that it would also benefit the average cabin owner. Davids has also proposed ending statewide property taxes altogether.\n\n\u201cI would say overall that taxes are too high,\u201d Davids said. \u201cAny place where I can see to reduce that, I will. There\u2019s a lot of middle-class homeowners that own cabins.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one of several proposals being floated as top lawmakers work out how to spend a projected $1.2 billion surplus when the Legislature returns in early March.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Star Tribune, http://www.startribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minnesota cabin owners could be in line for a big tax cut as House Republicans prepare a push to end the statewide property tax on residents' second homes next year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/27/house-gop-eyes-tax-cut-for-minnesota-cabin-owners/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Minnesota cabin owners could be in line for a big tax cut as House Republicans prepare a push to end the statewide property tax on residents\u2019 second homes next year.", "title": "House GOP eyes tax cut for Minnesota cabin owners"}, "twitter": {"title": "House GOP eyes tax cut for Minnesota cabin owners", "description": "Minnesota cabin owners could be in line for a big tax cut as House Republicans prepare a push to end the statewide property tax on residents' second homes next year.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "ST.
