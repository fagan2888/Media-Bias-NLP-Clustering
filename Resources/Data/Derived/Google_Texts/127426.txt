Bloomington, Ind. â€” A southern Indiana coroner has released the names of two men killed Thursday when their ultralight plane crashed during a landing approach at a Bloomington-area airport.

Monroe County Coroner Nicole Meyer said Saturday that 51-year-old Russell Kotlarek of Saukville, Wisconsin and 72-year-old Thomas Saccio of Blounts Creek, North Carolina, died in the crash.

She says the victims' preliminary causes of death are trauma as a result of the crash but the final causes are pending toxicology test results.

Meyer says both men were pilots.

Indiana State Police say one of the men reported a mechanical issue, possibly involving fuel mechanisms, to the Monroe County Airport tower the plane neared the airport and received permission to land.

The plane crashed and burned in a wooded area just west of Bloomington.
