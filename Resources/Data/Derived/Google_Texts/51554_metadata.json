BCBSNC projected that 15 percent of the total number of enrollees would be 55 or older, whereas the actual amount was 29 percent.\n\nPeople in a higher age bracket typically have higher health bills and represent a greater risk to insurance companies. Without younger, healthier people buying policies but not cashing in on them, BCBSNC says it must raise premiums to make up the cost.\n\nBCBSNC is the largest healthcare provider in North Carolina under the ACA, enrolling more than 315,000 previously uninsured people during last year\u2019s enrollment period.\n\nIn the plus column for consumers, a third option for buying healthcare coverage under the ACA has been added this year. Though newcomer United Healthcare is a smaller provider than BCBSNC, added market competition could result in lower premiums for some.\n\nThose with grandfathered plans, or plans that were purchased before the ACA was passed, will also see some up-charges when re-enrolling. This is also true of people with transitional plans, or plans that are no longer ACA-compliant.\n\nFor those who will be hopping on the insurance bandwagon for the first time when the ACA enrollment period begins on Nov. 15, High Country Community Health workers will hold free informational and enrollment sessions from 2 to 6 p.m. on Mondays, 2 to 5 p.m. on Thursdays, and Fridays from 9 a.m. to noon beginning on Monday, Nov. 10, at Avery County Morrison Library in Newland.\n\nThe penalty for being uninsured after the ACA enrollment period ends on Feb. 15 is $325 per adult, $162.50 per child or 2 percent of yearly household income, whichever amount is greater.\n\nFor more information, click to www.healthcare.gov.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Avery Journal-Times", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina recently announced that the cost of healthcare plans purchased under the Affordable Care Act will rise between 13 and 19 percent from last year\u2019s prices.", "title": "Blue Cross Blue Shield bets wrong on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.averyjournal.com/news/blue-cross-blue-shield-bets-wrong-on-obamacare/article_5ee2b394-6c33-11e4-aec3-57480cb661d1.html", "image": {"width": 355, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/averyjournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/92/a9286130-6c36-11e4-9e2a-03b19c7aa639/54665c25c8071.image.jpg?resize=355%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sportsAJT", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina recently announced that the cost of healthcare plans purchased under the Affordable Care Act will rise between 13 and 19 percent from last year\u2019s prices.", "fb": {"app_id": 273938919459792}, "keywords": "affordable care act,obamacare,news", "news_keywords": "affordable care act,obamacare,news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc123\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina recently announced that the cost of healthcare plans purchased under the Affordable Care Act will rise between 13 and 19 percent from last year\u2019s prices.\nBCBSNC projected that 15 percent of the total number of enrollees would be 55 or older, whereas the actual amount was 29 percent.\nThose with grandfathered plans, or plans that were purchased before the ACA was passed, will also see some up-charges when re-enrolling.\nThis is also true of people with transitional plans, or plans that are no longer ACA-compliant.\nThough newcomer United Healthcare is a smaller provider than BCBSNC, added market competition could result in lower premiums for some."}
