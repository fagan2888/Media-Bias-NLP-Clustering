I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s all done and we don\u2019t have to divert our attention anymore. All our attention can go towards the nursing program here [in Crownpoint, New Mexico].\u201d\n\nAccording to UNM\u2019s College of Nursing website, the Nursing Education program combines an individually developed focus in a specialty area of nursing practice with a leadership focus in education. While the majority of the classes in the Nursing Education program were offered online, four credit hours were required for students to teach in an academic setting under a nurse educator, which Becenti and Lumibao completed under a clinical nurse at UNM\u2019s Gallup branch.\n\nAlthough Lumibao said it was difficult to balance fieldwork and instruction with his duties as an instructor, he noted that it was worth it in the end. \u201cEducation is always important\u2014especially in nursing. Not only for the nurses themselves but also their patients,\u201d explained Lumibao. \u201cIf we can increase the number of nurses and nurse educators, we might be able to affect the health disparities we\u2019re experiencing these days.\u201d\n\nBecenti agreed with Lumibao about the significance of the degree and explained how it would benefit classroom instruction at NTU. \u201cI learned a lot in my program that will help with lecture delivery and teaching strategies as well as curriculum development and evaluation,\u201d said Becenti, who was named NTU\u2019s Instructor of the Year in 2012. \u201cThe students will benefit by the same token, getting quality education using a variety of teaching strategies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to thank my family and the nursing students for the encouragement while teaching full-time and going to school,\u201d continued Becenti. \u201cI hope to utilize this degree to educate new nurses who will remain on the Navajo Nation.\u201d\n\nNavajo Technical University\u2019s School of Nursing offers a pre-nursing certificate and an Associate of Science degree in registered nursing. The programs provide students with the basic nursing skills necessary for entry-level positions in the nursing field and assist in providing direct nursing care using principles from the biological, cultural, social, and physical sciences.\n\nFor more information about Navajo Technical University\u2019s School of Nursing, contact 505-786-4100 or visit NavajoTech.edu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Navajo Technical University nursing instructors Shawnadine Becenti and Jonathan Lumibao had been balancing work and education until recently.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/04/navajo-technical-university-instructors-balance-work-and-education-158448", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/johnathan-lumibao-navajo-technical-university.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Navajo Technical University Instructors Balance Work and Education"}, "abstract": "Navajo Technical University nursing instructors Shawnadine Becenti and Jonathan Lumibao had been balancing work and education until recently.", "dc": {"title": "Navajo Technical University Instructors Balance Work and Education"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/01/04/navajo-technical-university-instructors-balance-work-and-education-158448", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Navajo Technical University, Educators, Native American students, Native American Education", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-01-04T15:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Navajo Technical University Instructors Balance Work and Education"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefc4\"", "article_summary": "On December 11, 2014, Navajo Technical University nursing instructors Shawnadine Becenti and Jonathan Lumibao graduated with Master\u2019s of Nursing degrees from the University of New Mexico\u2019s Nursing Education program.\nAll our attention can go towards the nursing program here [in Crownpoint, New Mexico].\u201dAccording to UNM\u2019s College of Nursing website, the Nursing Education program combines an individually developed focus in a specialty area of nursing practice with a leadership focus in education.\nFor more information about Navajo Technical University\u2019s School of Nursing, contact 505-786-4100 or visit NavajoTech.edu.\n\u201cThe load was considerable,\u201d Lumibao said, who with Becenti, was admitted to the program in the spring semester of 2012.\n\u201cI hope to utilize this degree to educate new nurses who will remain on the Navajo Nation.\u201dNavajo Technical University\u2019s School of Nursing offers a pre-nursing certificate and an Associate of Science degree in registered nursing."}
