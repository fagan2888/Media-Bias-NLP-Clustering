She\u2019s tried three different medicines to prevent them, but none of them worked. She tried a chiropractor and herbal supplements, but still the debilitating migraines came two to three times a week.\n\nSo now Perez is trying acupuncture.\n\n\u201cDeep\u2026breath in\u2026and out,\u201d says Van Nguyen, an acupuncturist.\n\nNguyen puts the small, sterile needles in Perez\u2019s brow, behind her ears, on her arms, and down her ankle. Perez keeps her eyes closed, wincing as the needles as the needles go in.\n\nShe said the past two months of treatments have helped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m down to one migraine every 10 days,\u201d Perez said. \u201cAnd the intensity is not that intense. I\u2019m not going to emergency rooms any more. If I take just half of the pill, I\u2019m OK.\u201d\n\nHer neurologist recommended acupuncture, but she was skeptical.\n\n\u201cThey all recommend it. I just never thought it would work taking my pain away,\u201d Perez said. \u201cAnd I never thought about it. I\u2019m totally amazed, actually.\u201d\n\nPerez had her doubts because her husband works for a pharmaceutical company \u2013 a bastion of western medicine.\n\nEastern medicine is ever present in Orlando\u2019s Little Vietnam neighborhood. Many of the migrants who fled during the fall of Saigon 40 years ago came to Central Florida. And today, Orlando's Vietnamese community is the state's largest.\n\nAs an acupuncturist, Nguyen understands the tension between eastern and western medicine better than most. She initially wanted to be a surgeon. But she studied eastern medicine and philosophy in Vietnam at a Buddhist temple, and almost became a nun. Her mentor steered her back toward healing.\n\nNguyen said she sees western medicine as only treating half of the problem. Western medicine often suppresses pain. But pain shows your body where the problem is.\n\nThe needles used in acupuncture stimulate your body\u2019s natural reactions and healing, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only the nerve,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cIt\u2019s the channel that encloses the nerve\u2019s pathway, the blood vessel and the lymphatic system. It\u2019s more than the nerve.\u201d\n\nWhile acupuncture is probably the most recognized eastern medicine practice here in Florida, it\u2019s certainly not the only form of eastern medicine practiced in the Vietnamese community.\n\nFor example, another way to treat a cold or flu is an eastern remedy called cao gio, or coining.\n\nYou start by taking a coin or, really, anything hard. You use an oil or balm, and scrape along the back, starting near the spine and going out. You do this in one direction over and over again until a bruise forms.\n\nIf you visit the Vietnamese grocery and health stores in the Little Vietnam area, you\u2019ll often times find supplies for cao gio. On shelves next to boxes of herbal teas and menthol oils, there\u2019s an end cap with coining tools.\n\nIf you\u2019re buying some of those supplies in Orlando\u2019s Little Vietnam neighborhood, you might run into the Bui family: father Guat and his son, Mau.\n\nGuat Bui is more than a shopkeeper. He\u2019s a traditional medicine doctor, a 12th generation traditional medicine doctor at that. The Bui family owns four shops selling supplies, including the one in Orlando\u2019s Little Vietnam neighborhood.\n\nMau Bui said he worries traditional medicine is fading away with the new generation of Vietnamese growing up in Central Florida and far from Vietnam.\n\n\u201cEspecially in Orlando, in U.S. right now, not a lot of Vietnamese people believe in traditional medicine,\u201d Mau said. \u201cSome do, and some don\u2019t. I want to learn both.\u201d\n\nMau said he wanted to learn traditional medicine, but his family worried about its financial rewards.\n\n\u201cYes, they\u2019re saying traditional medicine over here, they don\u2019t make a lot of money,\u201d Mau says with a laugh.\n\nSo he has a big plan: Go to medical school, become a western doctor, and then learn about traditional medicine.\n\nThat idea may seem far-fetched, when looking at the differences between eastern and western medicine treatments. For example, if you have a fever, the typical treatment choice for a western medicine practitioner would be recommending an over-the-counter drug such as Tylenol or Advil.\n\nBut in traditional medicine, fighting a fever involves cutting a red onion into seven pieces for a man, nine for a woman. A patient puts the onion on a small plate and covers it with vegetable oil. Then, light the oil with a small cloth, cover the head with a blanket and inhale. The final step: eat a hot rice soup with an egg in it.\n\nSo what does Mau do when he gets sick? Advil, or onion?\n\nBoth.\n\nHe starts with Western medicine, and if that doesn\u2019t work, he moves on to more traditional remedies.\n\n\u201cIf it gets worse and stay for a while, I don\u2019t think it gets better, at that point, I go for traditional medicine.\u201d\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s the point: A blend of both traditional and western medicine might just keep the eastern custom from fading away.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
