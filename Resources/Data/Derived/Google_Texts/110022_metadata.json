If both measures make it past the voting booth, a legal battle is all but guaranteed to follow.\n\nThe initiative sprang from Ian James, a political consultant with 30 years of experience under his belt. His company, the Strategy Network, specializes in ballot measures.\n\nJames funneled that experience into the ResponsibleOhio campaign spearheading the initiative. Its 24 investors include big names like 98 Degrees pop star Nick Lachey, NBA Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson, and NFL player Frostee Rucker, Politico reported.\n\nThe investors have vowed to pour at least $20 million in its campaign to convince Ohio residents to support the initiative.\n\n\u201cWe have clearly taken this from the tie-dye to the suit-and-tie approach, there is no question about that,\u201d James told The New York Times. \u201cRight, wrong or indifferent, this is the way legalization is moving in this country now.\u201d\n\nThough opponents, including marijuana advocates, argue that James\u2019 initiative would place the state\u2019s marijuana industry in the hands of only a few, ResponsibleOhio notes that it would impose a 15-percent tax on growers and sellers along with a 5-percent tax on sales, which would reap an estimated $554 million annually to fund local government services like police and fire departments.\n\nThough four states plus Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational pot within the past two years, weed still remains illegal on the federal level.\n\nCully Stimson, manager of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s security law program, previously told The Daily Signal that marijuana should remain a federal issue, given a number of findings concluding that the drug is dangerous and addictive.\n\n\u201cIf this administration thinks that marijuana should be legalized or reduced in the Controlled Substances Act, they should lead and convince Congress, which they won\u2019t, that it should be rescheduled,\u201d Stimson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio residents are weighing whether the Buckeye State will become the latest to legalize marijuana.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Ohio residents are weighing whether the Buckeye State will become the latest to legalize marijuana.", "title": "Ohio May Legalize Marijuana Today", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151103_OhioWeed_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-03T23:52:48+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1k8tYk3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Ohio residents are weighing whether the Buckeye State will become the latest to legalize marijuana.", "title": "Ohio May Legalize Marijuana Today", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151103_OhioWeed_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "drugs", "published_time": "2015-11-03T15:27:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T23:52:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "marijuana legalization, Ohio, ResponsibleOhio, Ian James, Nick Lachey, Oscar Robertson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1207\"", "article_summary": "As voters across the United States move to elect their next state leaders Tuesday, Ohio residents are weighing whether the Buckeye State will become the latest to legalize marijuana.\nIf voters approve the measure, Ohio will become the fifth state to legalize recreational weed and the first in the Midwest.\nThe investors have vowed to pour at least $20 million in its campaign to convince Ohio residents to support the initiative.\nIn Ohio, the movement to legalize pot went beyond the often philosophic arguments entrenched in personal freedom and social justice; it morphed into a business venture backed by a handful of wealthy investors and a seasoned political operative.\nThe Ohio General Assembly is working to thwart this measure, putting forth another ballot initiative that would prohibit a \u201cmonopoly, oligopoly or cartel\u201d of federally controlled substances."}
