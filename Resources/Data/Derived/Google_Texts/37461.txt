One of America's most high-profile lawyers is suing Boston's TD Garden over a fall he blames on a wet bathroom floor and lack of paper towels.

Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who has represented numerous celebrity clients like Mike Tyson and OJ Simpson, is suing the Boston sports arena for an undisclosed amount of cash for a fall he says he suffered three years ago at a Celtics game.

As the Boston Globe reports, Dershowitz claims the Garden's alleged failure to provide paper towels in the bathroom resulted in a slippery floor that led to his fall.

“This dangerous condition allowed water from the recently washed hands of each of the myriad bathroom users to drip or be ‘shaken’ onto the floor, negligently creating a hazardous situation for all users,” the complaint alleges, according to the Globe.

The fall, however, did not stop the Harvard law professor — a longtime Celtics fan — from staying for the rest of the game. He only called for an ambulance later, reportedly not wanting to miss the end of an exciting playoff game between the Celtics and the Miami Heat.

Dershowitz told the Globe that he had to walk with a cane following the incident, and is still suffering after his fall. Dershowitz claims that he could need additional surgery on his knee.

Neither Dershowitz nor the Garden responded to Business Insider's request for comment.

Dershowitz's name came up in the news earlier this year, when he was mentioned in a lawsuit filed by two women who were allegedly sex-trafficked as minors by the financier Jeffrey Epstein. A legal filing in the case, which didn't name Dershowitz as a defendant, said the Harvard professor had sex with an underage girl.

Dershowitz denied the allegations, and a judge subsequently ordered that the claims about him be stricken from the record.
