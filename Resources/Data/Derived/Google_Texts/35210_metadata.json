Not so this year, partly because nearly all legislators won reelection and are returning for a new term.\n\n\n\nBesides the in-state tuition bill, called the Dream Act, lawmakers voted for a measure studying new ways for students to pay for college and approved the usual slew of incremental changes to criminal and state mandates \u2014 things like modifying Megan\u2019s Law to require sex offenders to help pay for their own monitoring, or requiring that builders install fire sprinklers in new homes.\n\n\n\nThey also approved a resolution scuttling Governor Christie\u2019s controversial remake of the state\u2019s civil service system.\n\n\n\nBut the list of measures that failed to clear both chambers is long. Lawmakers punted on same-sex marriage legislation, preferring, for the time being, to rely on a court decision giving gay couples the right to marry. They failed to agree on a plan to pay for the state\u2019s open-space preservation programs, leaving two rival proposals to wither on the vine. And they didn\u2019t resolve their differences on a broad plan to cut the cost of local government by encouraging towns to share services with their neighbors.\n\n\n\nThat shared-services bill will be a top priority for Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, when the new session begins on Tuesday. The measure would create a commission to examine which services \u2014 like police coverage or garbage collection \u2014 could be shared by neighboring municipalities and how much money those mergers would likely save. The panel\u2019s recommendations would be put to a vote in the affected towns. If voters say no, the state would reduce aid to the town by the amount the consolidation was expected to save.\n\n\n\nIt passed the Senate, 25-9, in November 2012 and has support from Christie, but Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver has not put it to a vote. She says that she has concerns about how the measure would affect the civil service system.\n\n\n\nLame-duck sessions are typically periods of frenzied activity, with voting sessions that sometimes extend into early morning hours.\n\n\n\nBut no all-night votes were expected this year. Nearly all members of the Legislature won re\u00adelection in November, so they had little need to push through their pet projects and personal priorities. Measures that don\u2019t pass the Legislature by the end of the session on Monday will need to be reintroduced and go through the legislative process again \u2014 a time-consuming inconvenience for bill sponsors, but not a prohibitive requirement.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any expectation that there was going to be the typical lame-duck flurry of activity here because there really wasn\u2019t much change of personnel,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. \u201cThe fact that this happened was not a surprise.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Legislature\u2019s biggest achievement in the last two months was its passage of the Dream Act, which allows students who graduate from a New Jersey high school but are not living here legally to qualify for in-state tuition.\n\n\n\nChris Donnelly, a spokesman for the Senate president, said Sweeney was proud of that measure and was happy another tuition-related bill of his \u2014 which creates a panel to study new ways of allowing students to pay their tuition \u2014 also passed.\n\n\n\nIn the Assembly, a spokesman for Oliver, D-Essex, cited the resolution blocking Christie\u2019s civil service changes and the revisions to Megan\u2019s Law as some of the biggest accomplishments of the last two months.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo-called lame-duck sessions are really meant for unfinished business, and that was the goal of this session,\u201d said the spokesman, Tom Hester.\n\n\n\nAnother major issue of the lame-duck session, same-sex marriage, did not result in any new law. A state court ruling in September made same-sex marriages legal in New Jersey, but marriage supporters say they eventually want that right enshrined in statute to guard against a future court overturning the current ruling. Advocates disagreed, though, on what sort of religious exemption the law should include. Sen. Ray Lesniak, D-Union, said last month that he planned to take up the issue again once the new legislative session begins.\n\n\n\nLegislation financing the state\u2019s long-standing, but broken, open-space program also won\u2019t make it out of the Legislature before the session ends.\n\n\n\nThroughout the lame-duck session, two competing bills \u2014 one in the Assembly and one in the Senate \u2014 have jockeyed for legislative support. Neither is expected to win final approval on Monday.\n\n\n\nThe Assembly bill calls for a $200 million one-time bond issue. The Senate bill would amend the state constitution and provide as much as $200 million annually for 30 years by diverting a portion of the state sales tax. Either measure would have to win support from voters before it could go into effect.\n\n\n\nThe Assembly bill, which won approval in that house last month, 64-13, is now stuck in the Senate Environment and Energy Committee. The Senate-approved bill is before the Assembly Budget Committee. Neither committee will meet today.\n\n\n\nJeff Tittel, director of the Sierra Club, which backs the Assembly bill, said a similar effort to put the Senate bill before the full Assembly has failed twice before. He said he expected nothing to happen today.\n\n\n\n\u201cBoth bills will die, and we will end up starting from Square One,\u201d he said. Ultimately, he said, the inability of Democrats in the two chambers to compromise has blocked both measures. \u201cUnless there is compromise, we are going to have one of the most successful programs in history run out of money.\u201d\n\n\n\nA successor bill to the sweeping reform of New Jersey\u2019s corporate incentive programs, known as Economic Opportunity Act II, was dead long before the lame-duck session was.\n\n\n\nLesniak, the bill\u2019s sponsor, sought to implement a number of economic stimulus measures, among them $200 million to stoke the creation of affordable housing and incentives to help the repurposing of hospital buildings for other uses.\n\n\n\nYet the package\u2019s progress came unstuck because of a $40 million fund to promote television and movie productions and digital media work in the state. Lesniak withdrew the bill in mid-December, about a month after it was introduced. He cited Christie\u2019s opposition, mainly to the media fund, which he had vigorously opposed in the past.\n\n\n\nThe bill followed the enactment in September of the first Economic Opportunity Act, which streamlined the state\u2019s five main corporate incentive programs into two, making it easier for smaller businesses to get tax credits, instead of the large corporations that have benefited in the past, and focusing more on stimulating growth in certain geographic and industry sectors.\n\n\n\nLesniak said he would divide the measures in the second opportunity act and introduce separate bills early in the next legislative session.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think I bit off more than I can chew,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to do too much in too short a time.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmail: linhorst@northjersey.com and morley@northjersey.com\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Landmark legislation giving students who are in the country illegally in-state tuition was the only major accomplishment of the Legislature\u2019s lame-duck session, which ends today.
