They now plan to revive the legislation in the lame-duck session, according to a report by The New York Times.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe senators say their bipartisan bill will force the pharmaceutical industry to lower prices of generic drugs that are sometimes twice as expensive in the U.S. as overseas. But the law faces strong opposition from U.S. companies, which have already helped stall the bill for years.\n\n\u201cThis bipartisan bill would make a commonsense fix and allow individuals to import safe, low-cost prescription drugs from Canada, injecting new competition into the U.S. pharmaceutical market and bringing down costs for families,\u201d Klobuchar wrote in a statement this summer.\n\nThe legislation has been introduced in nearly every Congress since former President Clinton as the cost of generic drugs continues to soar.\n\nIt is illegal under federal law to buy any medication from overseas with a few exceptions; for instance, if a drug cannot be found in the U.S.\n\nThe practice is becoming more complicated to police. A new state law in Maine allows residents to buy from pharmacies licensed in Canada, the U.K., New Zealand and Australia. Separately, officials in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Vermont have also directed residents to websites selling cheaper prescriptions from Canada.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "It is illegal under federal law to buy any medication from overseas with a few exceptions.", "description": "It is illegal under federal law to buy any medication from overseas with a few exceptions.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "It is illegal under federal law to buy any medication from overseas with a few exceptions.", "title": "Senators revive fight to import cheaper prescriptions from Canada", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/225351-senators-revive-fight-to-import-cheaper-prescriptions-from-canada", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/225351-senators-revive-fight-to-import-cheaper-prescriptions-from-canada", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-25T17:27-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Amy Klobuchar, John McCain,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-25T17:27:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/225351-senators-revive-fight-to-import-cheaper-prescriptions-from-canada", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "It is illegal under federal law to buy any medication from overseas with a few exceptions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senators revive fight to import cheaper prescriptions from Canada"}, "dcterms.title": "Senators revive fight to import cheaper prescriptions from Canada"}, "article_summary": "Separately, officials in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Vermont have also directed residents to websites selling cheaper prescriptions from Canada.\nA new state law in Maine allows residents to buy from pharmacies licensed in Canada, the U.K., New Zealand and Australia.\nThey now plan to revive the legislation in the lame-duck session, according to a report by The New York Times.\nKlobuchar and McCain first introduced their bill in July, but it saw no action.\nBut the law faces strong opposition from U.S. companies, which have already helped stall the bill for years."}
