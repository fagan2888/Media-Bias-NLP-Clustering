NEWRY, Maine (AP) — Santa and his helpers have hit the slopes for charity.

A mob of 150 Saint Nick lookalikes hopped on skis and snowboards at Maine’s Sunday River for the resort’s 17th annual Santa Sunday.

All that’s required is a donation and a Santa suit.

But a little luck is needed to make the cut. Brad and Heather Cope of Newton Falls, Ohio, said they were fortunate to get a spot: the online registration filled up in 4 minutes.

The event raises money for the Sunday River Community Fund, a local charity. Participants were required to donate at least $15. In exchange, they get to ski for free and receive another lift ticket good through Dec. 18.
