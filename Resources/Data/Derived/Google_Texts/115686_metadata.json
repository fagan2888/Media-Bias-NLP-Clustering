He said only about 700,000 illegal immigrants currently work and pay taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, but as many as 4 million illegal immigrants could get a stay of deportation and work permits under the temporary amnesty, which would mean they would be eligible to claim back-refunds if they worked those years.\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney, the South Carolina Republican who grilled Mr. Koskinen on the tax credits, said he was stunned the White House never checked with the IRS on the tax implications of its move.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just outrageous,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Congress had passed a law doing exactly what the president did, we would have had not only an estimate of the costs, but we would have also been required to propose ways to pay for the programs. This is just another example of the administration operating outside the rule of law.\u201d\n\nMr. Koskinen said he didn\u2019t know how much money the tax refunds would cost, and said the White House never checked with him before announcing the amnesty. He said the maximum annual credit is between $500 and $600 for an individual.\n\nMeanwhile, the concerns over voting are beginning to bubble up.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, Ohio Republican, will hold a hearing on the issue Thursday.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted, who has told Mr. Obama that illegal immigrants could find ways to vote thanks to his policy, is slated to testify.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress on Wednesday that even illegal immigrants who didn't pay taxes will be able to claim back-refunds once they get Social Security numbers under President Obama's temporary deportation amnesty.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress on Wednesday that even illegal immigrants who didn\u2019t pay taxes will be able to claim back-refunds once they get Social Security numbers under President Obama\u2019s temporary deportation amnesty.", "title": "IRS to pay back-refunds to illegal immigrants who didn\u2019t pay taxes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/11/irs-pay-back-refunds-illegal-immigrants-who-didnt-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/11/koskinen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/11/koskinen.jpg", "description": "IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress on Wednesday that even illegal immigrants who didn't pay taxes will be able to claim back-refunds once they get Social Security numbers under President Oba", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS to pay back-refunds to illegal immigrants who didn\u2019t pay tax"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, John Koskinen, Congress, Internal Revenue Service"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bce\"", "article_summary": "On Wednesday, he said even illegal immigrants who didn\u2019t pay taxes will be able to apply for back-credits once they get Social Security numbers.\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress on Wednesday that even illegal immigrants who didn\u2019t pay taxes will be able to claim back-refunds once they get Social Security numbers under President Obama\u2019s temporary deportation amnesty.\nOhio Secretary of State Jon Husted, who has told Mr. Obama that illegal immigrants could find ways to vote thanks to his policy, is slated to testify.\nHe said only about 700,000 illegal immigrants currently work and pay taxes using an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, but as many as 4 million illegal immigrants could get a stay of deportation and work permits under the temporary amnesty, which would mean they would be eligible to claim back-refunds if they worked those years.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the White House about this at all,\u201d he said."}
