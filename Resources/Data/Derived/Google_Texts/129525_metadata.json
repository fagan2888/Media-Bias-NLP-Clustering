A new office will open soon in Bismarck, adding seven or eight employees, Zimmer said.\n\n\"We have a growing business in North Dakota,\" he said.\n\nDespite the financial losses, customer surveys indicate public employees are happy with their new health coverage, and there was no financial loss to the state or other political subdivisions, he said.\n\nBoth the public employees' group and \"Obamacare\" coverage losses involved new product lines with new members whose health care use was hard to predict, Zimmer said. Predictions will improve over time as the insurance plan acquires more knowledge and experience in those markets, he added.\n\n\"With any new contract, there is a period of learning and understanding the book of business,\" Zimmer said.\n\nMany insurance companies around the country have experienced losses from their Affordable Care Act business, a problem that was compounded when a financial safety net failed to materialize because Congress didn't fund it, Morrison said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,North Dakota,Sanford Health Plan,Sanford,Health,Health insurance,public employees retirement system,Blue Cross Blue Shield", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Patrick Springer", "og": {"site_name": "INFORUM", "description": "FARGO \u2013 The Sanford Health Plan posted an operating loss of $76.5 million for 2015 as a result of higher-than-expected costs for insurance lines including the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System.", "title": "Sanford Health Plan posts $76.5 million loss for 2015", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/3994455-sanford-health-plan-posts-765-million-loss-2015", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/Sanford_Health_Plan_2C_0084A960023D3_1_0.jpg?itok=-i20GdXY", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FARGO \u2013 The Sanford Health Plan posted an operating loss of $76.5 million for 2015 as a result of higher-than-expected costs for insurance lines including the North Dakota Public Employees Retirement System.", "title": "Sanford Health Plan posts $76.5 million loss for 2015", "url": "http://www.inforum.com/news/3994455-sanford-health-plan-posts-765-million-loss-2015", "image": "http://www.inforum.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/Sanford_Health_Plan_2C_0084A960023D3_1_0.jpg?itok=FAAGyHtE", "site": "inforum", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1451861908361756}, "keywords": "News,North Dakota,Sanford Health Plan,Sanford,Health,Health insurance,public employees retirement system,Blue Cross Blue Shield", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inforumFM", "tag": "News,North Dakota,Sanford Health Plan,Sanford,Health,Health insurance,public employees retirement system,Blue Cross Blue Shield", "modified_time": "2016-03-25T07:07:14-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "FARGO \u2013 The Sanford Health Plan posted an operating loss of $76.5 million for 2015 as a result of higher-than-expected costs for insurance lines including..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03da\"", "article_summary": "Blue Cross Blue Shield held the contract for 37 years until the Sanford Health Plan assumed coverage in July.\nThe subsidy for the health insurance plan will not affect health delivery, said Cindy Morrison, a Sanford executive vice president.\nDespite the losses, the Sanford Health Plan's capital and surplus increased last year, thanks to a capital infusion of $85 million from parent Sanford Health to bolster its health insurance subsidiary's finances.\nThe capital infusion was enabled by the strength of Sanford Health, a $5 billion health system, he said.\nThere will be no layoffs for Sanford Health Plan employees, Morrison said."}
