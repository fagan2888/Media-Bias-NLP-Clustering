Senior goaltender Sam “Great” Brittain was true to his adopted nickname and his University of Denver teammates played terrific with the lead Saturday as the Pioneers downed red-hot North Dakota 3-0 to salvage a split of their two-game National Collegiate Hockey Conference series.

North Dakota absorbed its first loss in 11 games, having its unbeaten streak snapped at 9-0-1, and now has company atop the NCHC. DU (13-8-5, 7-5-2) and North Dakota (13-8-3, 8-6) are tied for first place in the first-year conference with 24 points, one more than St. Cloud State, which has two games in hand.

“We love coaching this group because they’re resilient. Their nickname should be ‘scrappy,’ ” said first-year DU coach Jim Montgomery, whose team is idle next weekend before visiting St. Cloud State on Feb. 7-8. “We just keep finding ways to get better. Good things will continue to happen the rest of the year.”

Freshman Emig Romig and junior Zac Larraza (two) scored DU’s goals and Brittain made 43 saves to avenge Friday’s 4-2 loss to the team formerly nicknamed the Fighting Sioux.

Before scoring on an empty net with two seconds remaining, tri-captain Larraza gave DU a two-goal cushion 1:07 into the third period — after North Dakota freshman Luke Johnson took an elbowing minor 14 seconds into the frame.

DU freshman Trevor Moore one-timed a feed from classmate Will Butcher and the puck slithered past UND goalie Clarke Saunders and just inside the goal line, where Larraza tapped it in for the game’s only power-play goal.

Butcher, a defenseman who was selected by the Avalanche in the fourth round of the 2013 NHL draft, also assisted on DU’s first goal.

That was an all-freshman effort. Romig, a winger, put in a wrister through traffic after taking a drop pass from center Evan Janssen inside the UND blue line. Butcher moved the puck up the ice to Janssen.

Both teams went on the power play twice after that to end the second period, but the tight-checking play continued and the senior goaltenders were strong.

North Dakota won Friday at Magness Arena behind two power-play goals and a short-handed tally. Montgomery demanded a more inspired effort from DU stemming from emotion — and he certainly got it.

“We came out with a lot of energy and emotion, and when you’re doing that, you’re first on pucks, moving quicker because you’re mentally sharp,” he said.

DU didn’t give UND much. And when Brittain was tested, he had defenders cleaning up rebounds.

DU also was much better with and without the puck in the neutral zone.
