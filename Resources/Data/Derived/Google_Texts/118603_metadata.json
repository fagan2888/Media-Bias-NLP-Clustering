(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) Story Highlights State lawmakers should restore KidsCare\n\nThis health insurance program serves children of the working poor\n\nUncle Sam will pay 100 percent of the cost\n\nBack when the Great Recession was pulling Arizona into a sinkhole of red ink, the state froze a program that provides health care to children in low-income families.\n\nNow the state has a chance to reopen the program at no cost.\n\nArizona should do so without delay.\n\nThe federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, called KidsCare in Arizona, once enrolled nearly 50,000 children in our state. It was financed by a three-to-one federal match of state dollars.\n\nToday, KidsCare serves about 775 children. Attrition will bring that number to zero unless the Legislature acts.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason not to act.\n\nThe recession-era freeze cost the state more than it saved. According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, the freeze saved the state $12.9 million in fiscal 2011, but it cost the state $41 million in federal matching funds that year.\n\nThe freeze also resulted in more than 100,000 children being put on a waiting list at a time when families across the state were suffering from job losses and home foreclosures.\n\nTimes are better now. The state is looking at a surplus.\n\nSome children may have gotten coverage when their parents found better jobs. Others were helped by the expansion of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the need remains.\n\nIt\u2019s anticipated that 30,000 to 40,000 children would benefit from reopening KidsCare.\n\nThe federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost of restoring the program for at least two years.\n\nFiscally conservative lawmakers should not leave that money on the table when so many children lack medical care.\n\nRepublican Rep. Regina Cobb, who will introduce a bill to restore the program, says the federal government \u201cprobably will extend\u201d the full funding beyond two years. She\u2019s aware of concerns about Arizona being on the hook for coverage if Uncle Sam doesn\u2019t continue paying, and she\u2019s open to adding triggers to her bill to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nFor now, the federal dollars are there to help low-income working families \u201cget their feet under them,\u201d Cobb says.\n\nIt makes sense to use that money in Arizona.\n\nKidsCare helps children whose parents earn too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to buy health insurance. The program serves children whose parents have incomes between 138 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. That\u2019s about $27,000 to $40,000 for a family of three.\n\nThese are people with fragile finances who often cannot afford to buy into a marketplace plan.\n\n\u201cEven with financial help, research shows that Arizona marketplace plans cost much more for families than KidsCare in most cases and may not offer benefits that are as comprehensive or child focused,\u201d according to a new report from Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families.\n\nKidsCare is not a free ride. Families pay a share of the cost with monthly premiums based on income.\n\nArizona, which is the only state that does not have an active federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, has the third-highest rate of uninsured children in the country. Our state has a 10 percent rate of uninsured kids, compared to a national rate of 6 percent.\n\nChildren who don\u2019t get preventative care get sick. Children who don\u2019t get ongoing care for chronic conditions get sicker.\n\nThe impact on a working family can be profound. A sick child cannot focus at school. A parent often can\u2019t work if the child stays home from school or child care.\n\nKidsCare can help children so parents can continue to work and pursue employment opportunities that will lift their income beyond the eligibility limit.\n\nThat\u2019s good for kids, families and the state.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1UPWpz7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Editorial: Too many kids are uninsured.
