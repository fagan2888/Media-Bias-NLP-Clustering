How \u2026 in a state like Idaho where we care about each other, could I be seeing deaths and really damaging illness on a nearly daily basis as a result of failure to expand Medicaid that cost tangible lives? It\u2019s difficult to understand.\u201d\n\nThe Senate panel took an hour of testimony, then wrapped up its hearing without a vote on two bills proposed by Sen. Dan Schmidt, D-Moscow, to expand Medicaid. About 78,000 Idahoans now fall into a coverage gap \u2013 they make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little to qualify for subsidized health insurance plans through the state\u2019s insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cYou heard of tragedies today,\u201d Schmidt, an emergency room physician, told his fellow senators. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you should be making public policy choices based on tragedy. You should be making public policy choices based on good policy. Tragedies do happen. And if we can make good policy to prevent them, that\u2019s our job.\u201d\n\nAsked about the outcome, after the hearing ended without any action, Schmidt said, \u201cIt\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\nIdaho lawmakers have refused to consider expanding Medicaid for the past three years out of distaste for the Affordable Care Act. That federal law made Medicaid expansion optional for states, with federal money covering nearly all the costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been said that perhaps it\u2019s an ideological difference, that we just don\u2019t want to accept federal dollars,\u201d Krell told the senators. \u201cBut if that were true, I don\u2019t think that we would see many in the Legislature accepting federal dollars for federal farm subsidies.\n\n\u201cI could only come to one inescapable conclusion: that the Idaho Legislature is unfortunately responsible for those deaths. Our intransigence in failing to pass Medicaid expansion for the last three years has probably resulted in over 1,000 deaths in this state.\u201d\n\nSenate Health and Welfare Chairman Lee Heider, R-Twin Falls, cautioned those testifying not to make accusations against senators. Fewer than a dozen people were called up to speak, though 60 had signed up to testify and hundreds filled Capitol hallways and overflow rooms. All but one of those who spoke favored expanding Medicaid.\n\nThe lone exception was Fred Birnbaum of the Idaho Freedom Foundation, who disputed the move would save Idaho money. Each of the two bills was estimated to save Idaho taxpayers tens of millions of dollars a year, in part because they include eliminating the state\u2019s Catastrophic Health Care program, which covers catastrophic medical bills for those who can\u2019t pay.\n\n\u201cThe savings that are projected are based on thin air in my opinion,\u201d Birnbaum said, \u201cbecause we simply don\u2019t know what future congresses are going to do.\u201d\n\nBoise Mayor Dave Bieter told the committee, \u201cI think every Idahoan believes that when we see suffering, we have a moral obligation to do what we can to eliminate that. \u2026 This is something you can do now. I really urge you to pass this bill.\u201d\n\nHeider said he didn\u2019t want a vote on the bill because the panel hasn\u2019t yet heard Gov. Butch Otter\u2019s proposal for a new Primary Care Access Program, which is targeted at the same gap population. That program would spend about $30 million a year, at state expense, to provide limited primary and preventive care to the 78,000 Idahoans through community health centers.\n\nHeider said the committee could decide to vote on the bills later.\n\nDr. Ted Epperly, president and CEO of the Family Medicine Residency of Idaho, said two things drive better outcomes for patients: a \u201cusual source of care\u201d and \u201csome source of insurance coverage.\u201d Both Medicaid expansion bills would provide both those things, he said, while Otter\u2019s proposed program would provide just the first.\n\nSB 1204 calls for full expansion of Medicaid to cover Idahoans who earn up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level; its estimated savings to state and county taxpayers is $47 million a year.\n\nSB 1205, the Healthy Idaho plan, would expand Idaho\u2019s Medicaid program to cover nondisabled adults who earn up to 100 percent of the poverty level, and accept federal Medicaid expansion funds to cover those between 100 and 138 percent of poverty by subsidizing their premiums for private insurance plans. Its estimated savings to state and county taxpayers is $28.4 million a year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Idaho lawmakers are responsible for the deaths of close to 1,000 Idahoans in the past three years because they\u2019ve refused to expand Medicaid, a doctor told a state Senate committee on Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "Spokesman.com", "description": "Idaho lawmakers are responsible for the deaths of close to 1,000 Idahoans in the past three years because they\u2019ve refused to expand Medicaid, a doctor told a state Senate committee on Tuesday.", "title": "Failure to expand Medicaid has resulted in nearly 1,000 deaths of Idahoans, doctor says", "url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2016/feb/02/failure-to-expand-medicaid-has-resulted-in-nearly-/", "image": "https://media.spokesman.com/img/logos/sr200.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T22:15:15.648116", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@SpokesmanReview", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 316254480466}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "googlebot": "index, follow"}, "article_summary": "That federal law made Medicaid expansion optional for states, with federal money covering nearly all the costs.\nBOISE \u2013 Idaho lawmakers are responsible for the deaths of close to 1,000 Idahoans in the past three years because they\u2019ve refused to expand Medicaid, a doctor told a state Senate committee Tuesday.\n\u201cJenny\u2019s case for me really crystallized what\u2019s wrong here,\u201d Krell said, as the Senate panel held its first-ever hearing on legislation to expand Medicaid in Idaho.\nIt\u2019s difficult to understand.\u201dThe Senate panel took an hour of testimony, then wrapped up its hearing without a vote on two bills proposed by Sen.
