Thousands of car collectors will be in Nebraska this weekend for an auction like no other.

About 500 cars and pickups from the 1930s to the 1970s will be sold. Despite their age, some of them are even considered brand new because they less than 10 miles on them.

The auction is happening in Pierce, Nebraska. It starts at 9:30 a.m. on Saturday and runs through Sunday. You can learn more about it on the VanDerBrink Auctions website.
