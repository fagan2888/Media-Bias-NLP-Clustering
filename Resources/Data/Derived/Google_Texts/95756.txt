Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was on Saturday Night Live’s 40th anniversary show Sunday night, and thankfully she didn’t take another crack at her horrible “Da Bears” impersonation.

But she did appear during the Q-and-A session with Jerry Seinfeld.

“How much do you think Lorne Michaels would pay me if I were to run in 2016,” Palin asked.

“I don’t think there’s a number too big,” Seinfeld said.

And then she dangled this carrot out there.

“OK, just hypothetically then, what if I were to choose Donald Trump as my running mate?” Palin said.
