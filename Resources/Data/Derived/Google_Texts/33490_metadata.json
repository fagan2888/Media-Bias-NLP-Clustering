That\u2019s one reason top Republicans encouraged the millionaire business-man to get into the governor\u2019s race. Havenstein has vastly outspent his Republican opponent but this race remains tight.\n\nIt\u2019s not every day a candidate for New Hampshire governor has a fighter jet on his resume. But former marine Walt Havenstein, who built planes as a defense contractor, talks them up constantly.\n\nIn TV ads.\n\n\u201c\u2026 This F22 we helped build at BAE systems in Nashua flies at Mach 2.\u201d\n\nAnd on the campaign trail\u2026\n\n\u201c\u2026 we delivered the F22 software. And that program went on to be one of the most successful programs in the Department of Defense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether we\u2019re working on F22 or not\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026The electronic software suite for the F22.\u201d\n\nBut whether this messaging can lift Havenstein\u2019s campaign isn\u2019t clear. So far he\u2019s plowed $1.5 million of his own money into this race.\n\nHe\u2019s also received endorsements from national figures like Mitt Romney and Chris Christie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be up here often to help Walt as much as I possibly can and the RGA will be engaged here because we believe that Walt is an outstanding candidate with a real chance to win.\u201d\n\nMany see help from national Republicans and money from the Republican Governors Association as essential for the GOP to run competitively against Maggie Hassan. A party\u2019s success in the governor\u2019s race can have a major effect on other races down the ballot.\n\nListen to the radio version here.\n\nHavenstein\u2019s business resume, deep pockets and lack of political baggage were all seen as strengths by those who urged him to get in this race.\n\nBut lack of campaign experience isn\u2019t always a plus. Havenstein has occasionally stumbled on the trail. And has said things that could give core Republicans pause. Here\u2019s Havenstein the day he launched his campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you something. I don\u2019t know what the Republican platform is today\u2026\u201d\n\nAnd there are other issues. Such as Havenstein\u2019s complicated relationship to so-called Obamacare. He says he always opposed it but a government tech company he led, SAIC, made millions helping to roll it out.\n\nAnd with plenty of Republicans focusing on the U.S. Senate race, this one has fallen somewhat under the radar.\n\nRalph Boehm, for instance, a state rep from Litchfield, says he\u2019s still kicking the tires. He could vote for Havenstein but might vote for his primary opponent, conservative activist Andrew Hemingway.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really decided yet. I think Havenstein\u2019s probably got a better record overall than Hemingway and probably has a better chance of winning\u2026\u201d\n\nUNH Professor of Political Science Dante Scala says responses like that are emblematic of Havenstein\u2019s situation.\n\n\u201cDespite all the money that he\u2019s spent so far, momentum is a problem. And that\u2019s becoming apparent in the last couple of weeks as the conventional wisdom among the political elite in this state is that this unknown, Andrew Hemingway, actually has a chance to win.\u201d\n\nWhich places greater pressure on Havenstein to court the base of the party. That isn\u2019t always easy for a candidate who\u2019s on the record of being pro-choice, comfortable with same-sex marriage and not dead set on repealing expanded Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe have to address the future of Medicaid expansion and part of that has to be working with the legislature\u2026.\u201d\n\nScala says while a measured approach might help him a general election, he still has a primary to win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s reaching to the Republican electorate at the same time that he\u2019s trying to pivot to the general electorate and he\u2019s having difficulty with that two-step.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019ll have to do that dance on a big stage\u2014WMUR TV\u2014when faces Andrew Hemingway Friday night in the final debate before the primary. Their earlier meetings have at times been heated and personal. But Havenstein, who spent 30 years in the marines, says he\u2019s up for the rough and tumble.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a blood sport, but it\u2019s combative in its nature\u2014that\u2019s the nature of retail politics in New Hampshire. I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be any different.\u201d\n\nAnd should he win the primary, it\u2019s only going to get rougher between now and November.", "article_metadata": {"category": "NH News", "description": "As former President of BAE Systems, Walt Havenstein led one of New Hampshire\u2019s largest employers.
