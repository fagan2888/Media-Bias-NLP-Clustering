No consumer relationship demands more trust than that between a physician and a patient.



Whatever the ailment, the patient is asking to be healed. In return, he or she is asked to trust that the treatment -- whether simply medication or a delicate surgical procedure -- is the best means to reach that end.



This trust requires that no other agenda be at work in a unique consumer business: It offers no money-back guarantees and sometimes little assurance that the treatment will even work, just that the practitioner believes it is the best response to the patient's needs.



Doubt upsets this balance with every news story or blog entry or social media post about doctors who break trust by acting in their own interests: The doctor who overprescribes a new drug after accepting gifts from the pharmaceutical reps who sell it, or who orders unnecessary and costly diagnostic tests from a company in which the doctor is an owner or investor, or any interest that conflicts with the best patient care.





After several delays, a new component of the Affordable Care Act, known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, took effect at the end of September. It's intended to increase transparency in health care by making public any financial relationships -- whether cash or "transfers of value" -- between physicians, pharmaceutical makers and medical device companies.It is a laudable endeavor that deserves the support, at least in principle, of the health care industry. Yet great care must be taken that this transparency does not chill the legitimate and absolutely essential partnerships between industry and medicine.In my practice, many of the stunning, lifesaving innovations and advances in neurosurgery over the past few decades have been developed in healthy, ethical collaborations between manufacturers and neurosurgeons.Advanced imaging and navigation techniques that make brain surgery safer, minimally invasive tools that allow patients to heal faster from spine surgery, and new drugs developed through clinical trials for diseases like brain cancer and epilepsy are all examples of these successful collaborations. The same can be said for other fields of medicine.In a country where the public expects -- and deserves -- innovations in health care, these partnerships often unite the top minds in their fields to develop the best possible products for patients.As we continue to live longer lives, there is an ongoing and ever-growing need for doctors and companies to work together to continue developing new medicines and devices in the most honest, open and transparent manner possible. This is the intent of the Sunshine Act.However, it will be an extremely significant loss for medicine if inclusion in the Sunshine Act database leads to a negative connotation for physicians or companies, rather than an acknowledgment of a fusion of the leading minds and resources in the field.This is one of the many ways -- through research, conversations and clinical trials -- that we work to meet growing patient demands for safer surgery, more effective medicines and the eradication of chronic diseases.If the well-intentioned new law confuses such vital work with that of practitioners who follow their own financial agendas, it will have backfired.
