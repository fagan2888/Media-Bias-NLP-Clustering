He didn\u2019t know how to reconcile my libertarianism with my other commitments. We were Buddhists and vegetarians, and I knew exactly what he meant. The tension centered around compassion. He wanted to know how someone concerned with the world\u2019s suffering wouldn\u2019t adopt a more compassionate political perspective.\n\nIt was a reasonable question, one that I asked myself regularly. My stock answer was that while I supported compassion in the form of assistance to those in need, I opposed the clumsy government mechanisms we relied on for it, not to mention the veiled coercion behind them \u2014 where did anyone get the right to enforce their values at the barrel of a gun (meaning taxes), no matter how noble those values might be?\n\nPretty by-the-books stuff. Libertarianism represented to me a matrix of freedom that could be collapsed onto any particular set of individual values. It was a simple formula to live by: If enough people value X, those people will pay for X, whether or not X = someone else\u2019s interest. Government intervention was at best superfluous to this outcome and at worst distorting of the collective will (measured as the aggregate economy).\n\nWhen my friend offered the natural response, What if people fail to provide enough for those in need?, I resorted to the tried-and-true strategy of telling him the problem wasn\u2019t a problem. The real problem was taxation or regulation or minimum wage or a failed incentive structure. If people were in need it was because government was preventing the market from providing for them.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting to me now is not why this kind of thinking is wrong but why it was once so attractive to me.\n\nI found my way to libertarianism in my teen years when I began reading some of its introductory texts and was attracted to the internal consistency of its policies. If you accepted that the individual was sacrosanct and the government\u2019s only role was to protect the individual, everything else pretty much followed. Unlike mainstream liberalism and conservatism, which were constantly engaged in negotiations between social and economic freedoms, libertarianism was systematically clean and neat. So much so that I quickly stopped concerning myself with how ideas played out in the world. The ideas themselves were enough.\n\nAs a kid, you learn to refute anyone\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d by snidely mocking \u2014 \u201cIn theory, communism works.\u201d When I was in college, I knew that communism did not work, even in theory, and I was happy to tell you why. Only libertarianism worked in theory.\n\nThat in switching the terms of the joke I made myself its butt was, regrettably, lost on me. When the lens of ideology grows so thick it\u2019s all a person sees, a sense of humor is often the first thing to be occluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was a Buddhist concerned with world suffering -- and I could no longer reconcile my humanity with my ideology", "title": "Confessions of a former Libertarian: My personal, psychological and intellectual epiphany", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I was a Buddhist concerned with world suffering -- and I could no longer reconcile my humanity with my ideology", "title": "Confessions of a former Libertarian: My personal, psychological and intellectual epiphany", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/26/confessions_of_a_former_libertarian_my_personal_psychological_and_intellectual_epiphany/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/scott_parker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I was a Buddhist concerned with world suffering -- and I could no longer reconcile my humanity with my ideology", "title": "Confessions of a former Libertarian: My personal, psychological and intellectual epiphany", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/scott_parker.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Parker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Buddhism, Editor's Picks, Liberalism, Libertarianism, Philosophy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4ce7\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Buddhism, Editor's Picks, Liberalism, Libertarianism, Philosophy, Politics NewsDuring college, a friend admitted he was confounded by my politics.\nLibertarianism represented to me a matrix of freedom that could be collapsed onto any particular set of individual values.\nHe wanted to know how someone concerned with the world\u2019s suffering wouldn\u2019t adopt a more compassionate political perspective.\nThat in switching the terms of the joke I made myself its butt was, regrettably, lost on me.\nUnlike mainstream liberalism and conservatism, which were constantly engaged in negotiations between social and economic freedoms, libertarianism was systematically clean and neat."}
