They win when they co-opt big business. \u201cThe necessity of corporate support for, or at least acquiescence to, liberal policies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis not a new development in the history of American liberalism. Indeed it has been one of its hallmarks.\u201d\n\nThat certainly rings true in a week where big businesses like Apple and Wal-Mart helped sink laws meant to defend religious liberty. (In both cases the laws have been amended\u2014but many conservatives believe the \u201cfix\u201d is worse than having no law on the books.) This is ironic, since conservatives are assumed to be in bed with big business\u2014and since at least one of the companies involved has been culturally associated with so-called red state values.\n\nAs Catherine Rampell noted at The Washington Post: \u201cEven Wal-Mart, not exactly known for its liberal values, came out against comparable legislation in its home state, saying it \u2018sends the wrong message about Arkansas.\u2019\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s public condemnation of the religious liberty laws was far less surprising. But even here, we see troubling hints about Senator Rand Paul\u2019s quixotic promise of bringing techies and Millennials\u2014blocs of voters that are supposedly libertarian-leaning\u2014into the fold. Good luck with that. When push comes to shove, these voters will disproportionally pull the lever for Hillary\u2014both to make history, and because they will be told that the Republican nominee\u2014yes, even if it\u2019s Rand!\u2014is a bigot. The promise that the GOP can merely tweak its image and find new allies is a long shot, at best\u2014and surely not one worth betraying its old allies\u2014social conservatives.\n\nBack to big business. For a while now, conservatives like Tim Carney have inveighed against \u201ccrony capitalism,\u201d pointing out that big business doesn\u2019t really like free markets. Big business is fine with killing off the competition by means of onerous governmental regulations only they can comply with. That\u2019s because they have the resources to hire the lawyers needed to navigate regulations, and the lobbyists who can help change the rules if necessary.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen other examples, however, of big business putting profit margins ahead of principle. Don\u2019t forget how big business sided on Obamacare. How could forcing millions of uninsured Americans to buy coverage from private companies not be good business for both the insurance and the pharmaceutical industries? Meanwhile, conservatives who oppose immigration reform often cite the support of big business for \u201cAmnesty.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s time that social conservatives also realize that big business isn\u2019t their friend, either. My theory is that there are essentially two groups of people you have to be wary of: big government and big business. Conservatives have typically obsessed over the former, while attempting to co-opt the latter. And who can blame them? Most of the other powerful coalition groups are natural allies on the left. As we have demonstrated, having big business on your political side is often the difference between winning and losing public policy battles.\n\nBut while conservatives might sometimes have to form a temporary alliance with business, they should remember that this isn\u2019t necessarily a natural alliance. If you\u2019re a conservative, you do have to worry about government (and be cognizant of the fact that bureaucrats don\u2019t care about you). But you must also distrust the people trying to sell you things.\n\nIf you\u2019re a social conservative trying to raise kids in the modern world, consider this: Who\u2019s trying to sell them destructive \u201cproducts\u201d ... violence, promiscuous sex, unhealthy lifestyles, bad food, etc.? It\u2019s probably not the government. It\u2019s much more likely to be big business trying to turn a profit. Do you think these fat cats actually care about you or your family? Hell, no. They\u2019re trying to make a buck.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mattklewis"}, "keywords": "healthcare, Religious Freedom, u.s. poli, Barack Obama, U.S. News, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "publicationDate": 201504051045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Why does the right always go to the mat for big corporations who could give a damn about conservative values?", "pageNum": 1, "title": "A Conservative Case Against Big Business", "tags": "entity:industryterm/healthcare,religious_freedom,topic:politics,barack_obama_u_snewsaffordablecareact,Obamacare:Industryterm", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"A Conservative Case Against Big Business\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/05/a-conservative-case-against-big-business.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/05/a-conservative-case-against-big-business/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47607690.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/05/a-conservative-case-against-big-business\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-05T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Matt Lewis\",\"tags\":[\"healthcare\",\"religious_freedom\",\"politics\",\"barack_obama_u_snewsaffordablecareact\",\"Industryterm\"]}", "news_keywords": "healthcare, Religious Freedom, US Politics, Barack Obama US News Affordable Care Act, Obamacare", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Matt Lewis", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-04-05T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/matt-lewishtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/05/a-conservative-case-against-big-business", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Why does the right always go to the mat for big corporations who could give a damn about conservative values?", "title": "A Conservative Case Against Big Business", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/05/a-conservative-case-against-big-business.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/05/a-conservative-case-against-big-business/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1428230717080.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/matt-lewis", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, conservatives who oppose immigration reform often cite the support of big business for \u201cAmnesty.\u201dI think it\u2019s time that social conservatives also realize that big business isn\u2019t their friend, either.\nMy theory is that there are essentially two groups of people you have to be wary of: big government and big business.\nIt\u2019s much more likely to be big business trying to turn a profit.\nBig business is fine with killing off the competition by means of onerous governmental regulations only they can comply with.\nAs we have demonstrated, having big business on your political side is often the difference between winning and losing public policy battles."}
