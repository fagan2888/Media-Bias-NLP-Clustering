Actor Bryan Cranston is playing a Hollywood communist in his latest film, but his comments in a recent interview suggest that he might already have a few communist sympathies.

In an interview with ITK reported by The Hill, Cranston argued that Obamacare was actually helping many families get health insurance, praising it as a “good and noble act” of President Obama.

“A social program like that, which has been vilified — even the word ‘socialist’ has become a dirty word,” he said. “But in many aspects, as we’ve found, aspects of socialism are a good thing.”

Cranston said he would probably support Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.

He also defended his character Dalton Trumbo, a screenwriter who was blacklisted by Hollywood for being a communist sympathizer.

“The message of the film to me is inclusiveness. It’s to be able to embrace an opposing viewpoint without thinking of them as the enemy or to demonize some of them,” Cranston said, describing Trumbo as “a proud American.”

The film is directed by Jay Roach, who also directed the controversial movie “Game Change” about the 2008 election featuring actress Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin. He also directed the movie “Recount” about Al Gore’s loss in the presidential election against George W. Bush in 2000.
