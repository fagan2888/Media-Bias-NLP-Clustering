According to exit polls, Obama handily won 60 percent overall of 18-to-29-year-old votes, but not among those three ages, with 57 percent of 18 year olds, 59 percent of 19 year olds, and 54 percent of 20 year olds casting ballots for the Republican challenger.\n\nTo Evan Feinberg, the president of Generation Opportunity, that's more evidence that millennials are \"a freedom generation\" that will back whatever candidate or party gives them better economic possibilities. Aimed at 18-year-olds to 34-year-olds, Generation Opportunity promotes entitlement reform, reduced government spending, and increased privacy rights. It's also the group behind the \"Creepy Uncle Sam\" commercials that urge millennials to \u201copt out\u201d of Obamacare. Feinberg sat down with Nick Gillespie at this summer's Lincoln Labs Reboot conference in San Francisco to talk about the group's goals and contemporary politics.\n\nAbout 6 minutes.
