Unsurprisingly, SECEDE Kilgore is not a fan of Obamacare, so don\u2019t expect him to reverse his state\u2019s decision to deny health care to 1.5 million Texans who would be eligible for benefits under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. He also appears none too happy with the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to fight voter suppression in Texas. And he\u2019s a fan of former Rep. Ron Paul\u2019s (R-TX) far right vision of monetary policy.\n\nIf Texas does secede quickly, however, SECEDE Kilgore may not be in power long enough to implement a broader agenda. He pledges to leave public office for \u201cat least one year\u201d once secession occurs.\n\nShould SECEDE Kilgore get the urge to run again, however, the people of the newly independent Republic of Texas may want to watch their language. During a 2007 bid for the Senate, Mr. SECEDE Kilgore \u2014 then known simply as \u201cLarry Kilgore\u201d \u2014 campaigned on promises to execute adulterers and doctors who perform abortions, the later within 24 hours of conviction.
