Along the way, they moved away from Charleston and were largely written out of their home state\u2019s history.\n\nThat is changing this week, as area historians and novelist Sue Monk Kidd join forces for several events to celebrate the Grimke sisters\u2019 life and legacy.\n\nThe collaborative event is backed by the Friends of the Library at the College of Charleston, the South Carolina Historical Society, the Sophia Institute, the Charleston Library Society and the Preservation Society of Charleston.\n\nHarlan Greene, head of special collections at the college\u2019s library, said the library recently acquired some Grimke family papers that had ended up in England. Meanwhile, Kidd\u2019s latest work, \u201cThe Invention of Wings,\u201d is based loosely on the life of Sarah Grimke and her childhood slave. That combination led Greene to think about highlighting the Grimke sisters\u2019 story.\n\n\u201cIt just struck me that since they are so unrecognized in the city of Charleston, why don\u2019t we recognize them?\u201d he said, adding this is part of the Friends\u2019 new effort to recognize places of intellectual currency in the Lowcountry.\n\nSarah Grimke was born in 1792 in Charleston and served as a sort of second mother to her sister, Angelina, who was born 13 years later. Sarah left Charleston in 1829, and the sisters\u2019 lives and beliefs slowly diverged from most of those, even other family members, in their native city. The two joined the American Antislavery Society in 1835, the same year a Charleston mob broke into a post office to destroy abolitionist literature.\n\nThe sisters\u2019 subsequent writings and lectures, which drew on their own experiences in a slave-owning home, gave them national notoriety, and both Sarah and Angelina remained public figures until their deaths in 1873 and 1879, respectively.\n\nThe sisters\u2019 lack of public recognition in their hometown meant that Kidd lived in the Charleston area for years but didn\u2019t learn about the Grimke sisters until she visited Brooklyn in 2007 to see feminist artist Judy Chicago\u2019s work, \u201cThe Dinner Party.\u201d\n\nRecognizing the sisters whose anti-slavery and feminist views broke so thoroughly from Charleston\u2019s antebellum orthodoxy might have been difficult a decade or two ago, but in recent years, the city has erected monuments to noted slave rebel Denmark Vesey as well as to Robert Smalls, an enslaved ship\u2019s pilot who stole a Confederate transport ship and handed it over to the Union during the Civil War.\n\n\u201cWomen and blacks are now getting rewritten back into history,\u201d Greene said, \u201cand the Grimke sisters seem to combine them both.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne revolutionary thought sparked another,\u201d Greene added. \u201cThey could first think outside the box to realize that blacks and white are equal, then take the next step to say women were the equal of men. They basically read the Bible as liberation theology.\u201d\n\nWhile the Grimke sisters have been recognized in other cities \u2014 Sarah\u2019s words are carved in the new Boston courthouse, for instance \u2014they have not been recognized much here.\n\nThat will change Tuesday, when Mayor Joe Riley, Kidd and others gather at 321 East Bay St., the sisters\u2019 childhood home, to dedicate a new historical marker, just one of several public events planned.\n\nGreene said the sisters slowly moved away from Charleston.\n\nSarah, the elder, left first to assist her ailing father in Philadelphia and New Jersey. Angelina eventually moved north, too, where their writings and thinking would mark a clean break from the mindset of their hometown.\n\nThe sisters\u2019 abolitionism and feminism were rooted in their Quaker religion, said College of Charleston history professor Amy McCandless, \u201cand it was this sense of divine mission that gave them the courage to criticize the patriarchal assumptions of antebellum American society.\u201d\n\nNot only did the sisters disappear from Charleston, but their Quaker church did as well. Its former cemetery off King Street is covered by a county parking garage.\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Grimke sisters to be honored in a city they grew to loathe, Arts & Travel, \r\nArts & TravelFP LatestNews, \r\nFeatures, \r\nFeatures, 321 East Bay St.,Angelina Grimke,Charleston Library Society,College of Charleston Addlestone Library,Grimke sisters,Harlan Greene,historical marker,Joe Riley,Preservation Society of Charleston,Quaker cemetery,Sarah Grimke", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Sarah and Angelina Grimke were born into privilege, daughters of an elite Lowcountry family during the peak of Charleston\u2019s prosperity.", "title": "Grimke sisters to be honored in a city they grew to loathe", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150502/150509918/grimke-sisters-to-be-honored-in-a-city-they-grew-to-loathe", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/pc16/150509918/AR/0/AR-150509918.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/pc16/150509918/AR/0/AR-150509918.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sarah and Angelina Grimke were born into privilege, daughters of an elite Lowcountry family during the peak of Charleston\u2019s prosperity.", "title": "Grimke sisters to be honored in a city they grew to loathe", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150502/pc16/150509918/AR/0/AR-150509918.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150509918}}, "keywords": "Grimke sisters to be honored in a city they grew to loathe , Arts & Travel, \r\nArts & TravelFP LatestNews, \r\nFeatures, \r\nFeatures, 321 East Bay St.,Angelina Grimke,Charleston Library Society,College of Charleston Addlestone Library,Grimke sisters,Harlan Greene,historical marker,Joe Riley,Preservation Society of Charleston,Quaker cemetery,Sarah Grimke", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-02T18:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T15:18:00Z", "author": "Robert Behre"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Sarah and Angelina Grimke were born into privilege, daughters of an elite Lowcountry family during the peak of Charleston\u2019s prosperity."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9934\"", "article_summary": "If you go The following events are scheduled to honor Sarah Grimke and Angelina Grimke Weld.\nWalking tours On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, there will be two-hour walking tours of historical sites connected to the Grimke sisters.\nSarah and Angelina Grimke were born into privilege, daughters of an elite Lowcountry family during the peak of Charleston\u2019s prosperity.\nMeanwhile, Kidd\u2019s latest work, \u201cThe Invention of Wings,\u201d is based loosely on the life of Sarah Grimke and her childhood slave.\nThat combination led Greene to think about highlighting the Grimke sisters\u2019 story."}
