The company apologizes for the worker\u2019s behavior and says they\u2019re moving forward to correct the situation.\n\nJeff Graves, senior director of operations for Taco Bell, said the worker was let go from the job. The worker wrote \u201cPIG\u201d on to-go orders for the couple Saturday night in Newton.\n\n\u201cWe do not share the same belief or view as the employee whatsoever,\u201d Graves said. \u201cOur company, Taco Bell, has always been pro-law enforcement, military. We\u2019ve always supported the police in our community. Many of our restaurants give police discounts when they come in and eat.\u201d\n\nGraves said he reached out to the officer and the officer\u2019s fianc\u00e9 once he learned of the situation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve of course apologized to him, all the Newton Police officers and, in fact, everyone in the community,\u201d Graves said. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019ve even met with the lieutenant with the Newton Police Department this morning, and we\u2019re even going to plan a community event working with the Newton Police officers within the next week just to show our support for the officers and the community.\u201d\n\n------------\n\nNEWTON, Kan. -- An officer and his fianc\u00e9 say they found an unexpected surprise at a fast food restaurant. Now some are upset online.\n\nThe couple went to order food at Taco Bell Saturday night in Newton. When they received their order, they found the word \"PIG\" written on top of some of their food.\n\nThe message, they believe, was in reference to the officer's work in law enforcement.\n\nThe couple called and spoke to a manager on duty.\n\n\"I was told I could bring the 5 tacos back and she would have them remade,\" the couple shared with us. \"I advised her that we were both working and that wasn't an option. She then said she would leave a note to refund our money and get the food remade.\"\n\nKAKE News has reached out to Taco Bell. Once we hear back from them, we will share the company's side of the story.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Taco Bell has fired an employee that left an insensitive remark on an order of an officer and his fianc\u00e9.", "language": "english", "author": "Annette Lawless", "og": {"description": "Taco Bell has fired an employee that left an insensitive remark on an order of an officer and his fianc\u00e9.", "title": "UPDATE: Taco Bell fires worker for writing 'PIG' on officer's order", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newton-officer-finds-PIG-written-on-fast-food-order-320409932.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FA7/635/FA76357F4166411D86B28647514C137D", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E9D/996/E9D996A29143453FA11264ECE712EBC3.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Taco Bell has fired an employee that left an insensitive remark on an order of an officer and his fianc\u00e9.", "title": "UPDATE: Taco Bell fires worker for writing 'PIG' on officer's order", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newton-officer-finds-PIG-written-on-fast-food-order-320409932.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/TACO+BELL+PIG.PNG", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "UPDATE: Taco Bell fires worker for writing 'PIG' on officer's order", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "UPDATE Taco Bell fires worker, for writing PIG on officers"}, "article_summary": "Jeff Graves, senior director of operations for Taco Bell, said the worker was let go from the job.\nUPDATE: Taco Bell has fired an employee that left an insensitive remark on an order of an officer and his fianc\u00e9.\nThe couple went to order food at Taco Bell Saturday night in Newton.\n\u201cOur company, Taco Bell, has always been pro-law enforcement, military.\nKAKE News has reached out to Taco Bell."}
