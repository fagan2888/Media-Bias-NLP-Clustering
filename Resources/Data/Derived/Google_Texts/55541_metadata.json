Dude, even this guy was stoked for me,\u201d said Wild, relishing the opportunity to made amends.\n\nNot everyone is stoked on Wild, but that doesn\u2019t bother him. When you excel, he said, \u201cPeople are going to hate you.\u201d\n\nThree years ago, the professional alpine snowboarder left his Washington state home for Moscow. He married a Russian girl. He became a Russian citizen.\n\nOn Saturday, the 27-year-old became the first snowboarder to win two medals in the same Olympics, taking gold in the Olympic debut of parallel slalom. The crowd in the packed stadium erupted as Wild delivered for his new country. His second gold helped Russia take the total medal lead over the U.S., 29-27. As he whipped through the gates, thousands chanted \u201cRuss-See-Uh! Russ-See-Uh!\u201d\n\nAfterward, facing a phalanx of reporters, it was time to set the record straight. Wild said he didn\u2019t go country shopping when he moved to Russia, became a citizen and began training with the support he never had while racing in the U.S.\n\nAfter a frustrating career in the U.S., traveling with random teams to World Cup events and fighting for financial scraps to support his training after the dissolution of the U.S. alpine snowboard team, he was ready to quit the sport. He started thinking about college. Maybe studying architecture.\n\nThen opportunity knocked. It was Russia.\n\n\u201cI chose to continue snowboarding because I thought I could do something special. I wanted to see how good I could get. That\u2019s why I continued snowboarding, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a Russian,\u201d said Wild, who spent years training with the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club.\n\nA whole new world\n\nIn Moscow, he was fully funded to train year-round. Coaches pushed him. He had the best equipment. Doctors from the hockey team helped him through an injury. An osteopath from the figure skating team assisted. He has a tech who sharpened and waxed his board. Administrators arranged his World Cup travel so he could focus on snowboarding.\n\nHe finally had the team behind him that allowed him to fulfill his potential. He had support in the U.S., but nothing like he has now. And, when he traveled, he was on his own.\n\n\u201cWhen I was on the road, I didn\u2019t have anything. I traveled with the Japanese team, actually,\u201d he said.\n\nMuch will be made about how Russia unleashed Wild\u2019s greatness. But friends and family say there was a larger factor in his sudden rise from the middle of the pack to twice-golden Olympic superstar.\n\nHis wife, Alena Zavarzina, certainly played a major role. She won bronze alongside her husband\u2019s gold in Wednesday\u2019s parallel giant slalom.\n\n\u201cVic has really developed as a person. In Steamboat, he was able to develop his riding and his technical ability and his philosophy about riding and grow as a person. And then when he fell in love with Alena, I think the love relationship helped him to mature,\u201d said Thedo Remmelink, the coach who helped Wild during his years with the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club.\n\nWild\u2019s brother, Michael, concurs.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the reason he\u2019s doing so well,\u201d he said.\n\nWild too, not surprisingly, said his wife has done more to improve his riding than Russia\u2019s well-oiled Olympic machine.\n\n\u201cI have a great wife to come home to, and that\u2019s something that most of the guys I compete with don\u2019t have,\u201d Wild said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for them to have results, whereas for me, I have a great wife. Either way, my life is going to be great, with or without the medals, and that does help ease the mind and allows me at least to move and not be so tight.\u201d\n\nU.S. funds lacking\n\nJustin Reiter, the lone American alpine snowboarder competing in the Sochi Winter Olympics, spent months sleeping in his truck to support his training. When Reiter came to Russia \u2014 without a coach, without a wax tech, without a teammate \u2014 other snowboarding athletes asked if he was a coach.\n\nReiter did not move beyond qualifying in the parallel giant slalom. In Saturday\u2019s slalom, the Steamboat Springs rider missed a gate and was disqualified in his first run. He wouldn\u2019t blame the lack of his support for his struggle in Sochi. But it played a role.\n\n\u201cWithout a consistent team, without a consistent support staff, makes it really difficult,\u201d he said Saturday as he served as a coach for his friend Wild. \u201cThen all the sudden, you show up at the big game and everything changes, whereas for a guy like Vic, it\u2019s just another race and he\u2019s able to focus on what he needs to focus on.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association allocated more funds to halfpipe and slopestyle than to alpine snowboarding and the investment paid off, with the U.S. winning 12 medals in freestyle skiing and snowboarding.\n\n\u201cOur strategic focus on new events like halfpipe and slopestyle had clear athletic success for us in Sochi and are very relevant to what kids are doing at resorts around the world today,\u201d said Luke Bodensteiner, executive vice president of U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association.\n\nWild isn\u2019t bitter at the association.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t focus on everything,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he hopes the association turns more focus toward snowboard racing.\n\n\u201cYou need all the pieces of the pie to be complete, and if you only focus on one or two disciplines, you are not going to have well-rounded athletes,\u201d he said.\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374, jblevins@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jasontblevins", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Vic Wild\u2019s gold ring leads to two gold medals as a Russian", "title": "Vic Wild\u2019s gold ring leads to two gold medals as a Russian", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/22/vic-wilds-gold-ring-leads-to-two-gold-medals-as-a-russian/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__BN20140222_Z00_BNSP23OLYWILDp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140222__BN20140222_Z00_BNSP23OLYWILDp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-22T16:06:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:23:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd99\"", "article_summary": "On Saturday, the 27-year-old became the first snowboarder to win two medals in the same Olympics, taking gold in the Olympic debut of parallel slalom.\nThat\u2019s why I continued snowboarding, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a Russian,\u201d said Wild, who spent years training with the Steamboat Springs Winter Sports Club.\nHis second gold helped Russia take the total medal lead over the U.S., 29-27.\nKRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia \u2014 When Russian snowboarder Vic Wild won Olympic gold in the parallel giant slalom last week, he got an e-mail from Hans, a kid he was mean to more than 20 years ago.\nWild too, not surprisingly, said his wife has done more to improve his riding than Russia\u2019s well-oiled Olympic machine."}
