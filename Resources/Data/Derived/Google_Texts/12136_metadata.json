Now a new look at farm country shows greater incidence of Parkinson\u2019s among some residents but not others \u2014 those with a variation of the ALDH2 gene. The study also finds that pesticides increase Parkinson\u2019s risk, too, by inhibiting the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme, which helps to rid cells of toxins.\n\nPeople with a specific variation of that ALDH2 gene were two to five times as likely to develop Parkinson\u2019s, says Jeff M. Bronstein, an investigator from the University of California and the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n\n\"These results show that ALDH inhibition appears to be an important mechanism through which pesticides may contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease,\" Bronstein said in a statement. \"Understanding this mechanism may reveal several potential targets for preventing the disease from occurring or reducing its progression.\"\n\nIn the study, Bronstein compared 360 people with Parkinson\u2019s with another 816 residents of the same area, using a computer model to incorporate information on pesticide exposures at home and work with information from the state\u2019s department of pesticide regulation. For the first time, he and his colleagues determined that 11 pesticides inhibited the ALDH gene variant, all of which are used in farming. The 11 chemicals fall into four basic classes including dithiocarbamates, imidazoles, dicarboxymides, and organochlorides.\n\nSome chemicals were more dangerous than others with regard to Parkinson\u2019s risk, the researchers found. Workplace and residential exposures to the pesticide benomyl brought an associated 65 percent, whereas dieldrin brought a risk of six-fold. Those unfortunates exposed to three or more pesticides were 3.5 times more likely to develop the disease, overall.\n\nInterestingly, the heightened risk for those with the altered ALDH gene came only with pesticide exposure. \"In other words, having this gene variant alone does not make you more likely to develop Parkinson's,\" Bronstein said. \"Parkinson's is a disease that in many cases may require both genetics and environmental factors to arise.\"\n\nTo lower risk for Parkinson\u2019s, Bronstein said investigators might focus on reducing pesticide exposures while seeking to improve the enzymatic functioning of ALDH.\n\nSource: Bronstein JM.
