The San Diego Unified School District, for example, paid only $5,000 to get the 6-wheel vehicle\u2014though it\u2019s unclear what the cost will be to return it to DOD.\n\nIn the past few weeks, lawmakers have zeroed in on the program, questioning whether local police forces \u2013 some with only one or two full-time officers \u2013 should have access to tanks and BearCats. And with all of the heightened scrutiny, the local agencies themselves it seems are also asking those same questions.\n\nSan Diego Unified School District officials said they originally wanted the MRAP to be used as a rescue vehicle in emergency situations. They were planning to store $20,000 to $30,000 worth of donated medical supplies in the vehicle. But community concern over the use of the equipment after the militarized response in Ferguson, Mo., made the district change its tune. One local resident called it an \u201cunnecessary\u201d piece of military equipment that \u201csends the message that local officials are at war with students.\u201d\n\nRelated: 40 Percent of \u201cUsed\u201d Military Equipment Given to Police Is Brand New\n\n\u201cThe value that this defensive tool would bring cannot exceed the value of retaining the public\u2019s trust, confidence and perceptions of how we will protect our students,\u201d Rueben Littlejohn, chief of the district\u2019s School Police Department, said in statement.\n\nUrsula Kroemer, a spokesperson for the San Diego Unified School District, said the district is still in the process of working with DOD to return the vehicle, though apparently there are tons of other return requests from other local agencies across the country. \u201cThey\u2019re slammed with return requests,\u201d Kroemer told The Fiscal Times on Friday.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Recognizing that their schools probably don\u2019t have a legitimate day-to-day use for an", "title": "School District Returns Its $700K MRAP from Pentagon", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/19/School-District-Returns-Its-700K-MRAP-Pentagon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06202013_MRAP_Football_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/19/School-District-Returns-Its-700K-MRAP-Pentagon", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06202013_MRAP_Football_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Recognizing that their schools probably don\u2019t have a legitimate day-to-day use for an", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8bdd\"", "article_summary": "San Diego Unified School District officials said they originally wanted the MRAP to be used as a rescue vehicle in emergency situations.\nThe San Diego Unified School District, for example, paid only $5,000 to get the 6-wheel vehicle\u2014though it\u2019s unclear what the cost will be to return it to DOD.\nAnd with all of the heightened scrutiny, the local agencies themselves it seems are also asking those same questions.\nRecognizing that their schools probably don\u2019t have a legitimate day-to-day use for an 18-ton $700,000 military-grade MRAP \u2013 or mine-resistant ambush protective vehicle \u2013 officials from the San Diego Unified School District have decided to return their heavily armored truck to the Pentagon.\nThe school district acquired the MRAP through the Defense Department\u2019s now-controversial 1033 program, which has been scrutinized for outfitting local police departments like the one in Ferguson, Mo., with battlefield equipment intended for warzones in Iraq and Afghanistan."}
