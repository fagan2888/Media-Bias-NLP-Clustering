You people are looking for somebody who knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nAs he has done in interviews on cable news networks, Trump took swipes at the more traditional political candidates he\u2019s competing with, accusing them of being controlled by lobbyists. \u201cAll these guys like Bush and Hillary, they\u2019re taken care of,\u201d he said.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nHe also singled out the runner-up for the Republican nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. \u201cWho would you rather have president, Trump, or Bush?\u201d Trump said, spurring the crowd to chant his name.\n\nThe Trump campaign and local authorities predicted a crowd of some 40,000, the largest turnout of any presidential campaign so far. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another anti-establishment candidate, has drawn crowds of close to 28,000. With that expectation in mind. the Trump campaign moved the event from the city\u2019s smaller Civic Center to the 43,000-seat Ladd-Peebles Stadium.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear that he had pulled as many people as expected to the arena, as large sections remained empty, but the overall turnout was still the largest for any Trump event so far.\n\nTrump\u2019s rally is just one more sign the real estate mogul is serious about winning the Republican nomination. Mobile is within a few hours drives of many millions of devoted Republican voters across not just Alabama, but Louisiana, Florida and Georgia as well, many of which are key primary states.\n\nMORE: Read Trump\u2019s Interview with TIME\n\nAlabama is one of the five southern states scheduled to hold a primary on March 1, a date that will be crucial in sorting out a packed Republican field that will likely still be teeming with contenders after contests in the four early states. Winning a good portion of those five states\u2014which also include Texas, Virginia and Arkansas\u2014on the same day could be key to winning the nomination. Louisiana\u2019s primary is four days later.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, who is vying with Trump for a similar anti-establishment sector of the GOP electorate, is also working hard at mobilizing the so-called Southeast Conference states, as is former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.\n\nDuring the 50-minute speech, Trump attacked the political establishment, a tack that has helped him gain momentum with Republican voters frustrated with the status quo. In government \u201cwe use political hacks, diplomats, we use people who have never held a real job,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also insulted Secretary of State John Kerry and criticized the Iran nuclear deal, saying that Kerry\u2019s bicycle accident during the Iran negotiations in which he broke his leg \u201cwas the good part of the deal.\u201d\n\nWhen someone in the crowd called out for Trump to opine on Israel, the candidate was enthusiastic. \u201cI love Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cIsrael? I loooove Israel.\u201d\n\nTrump promised that as president his \u201cwhole energy, my whole being is going to make our country rich and make our country great again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason people like what I\u2019m saying is I want to put that energy\u2014I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s genius or screwed up\u2014I want to do something with it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will devote 1,000%.\u201d\n\nRead Next: Donald Trump Has Landed", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump gave a provocative but meandering speech about immigration and foreign policy to tens of thousands in an arena in Alabama.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "He attracts tens of thousands to an arena in Mobile.", "title": "Donald Trump Rallies Alabama", "url": "http://time.com/4006494/donald-trump-rally-alabama/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/donald-trump-rally.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/donald-trump-rally.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594"}, "description": "He attracts tens of thousands to an arena in Mobile.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump Rallies Alabama"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "donald trump, donald trump event, donald trump mobile, ted cruz, mike huckabee, mobile alabama, donald trump rally", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump Event, Donald Trump Mobile, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Mobile Alabama, Donald Trump rally"}, "article_summary": "the Trump campaign moved the event from the city\u2019s smaller Civic Center to the 43,000-seat Ladd-Peebles Stadium.\nThe Trump campaign and local authorities predicted a crowd of some 40,000, the largest turnout of any presidential campaign so far.\nSign up for and more view exampleHe also singled out the runner-up for the Republican nomination, former Florida Gov.\nTrump\u2019s rally is just one more sign the real estate mogul is serious about winning the Republican nomination.\nMobile is within a few hours drives of many millions of devoted Republican voters across not just Alabama, but Louisiana, Florida and Georgia as well, many of which are key primary states."}
