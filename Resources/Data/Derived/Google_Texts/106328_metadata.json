Garland for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that releasing the records to the public would basically moot \u2014 unfairly \u2014 congressional laws that exempted presidential records from FOIA, Politico reported.\n\n\u201cWhere Congress has intentionally excluded a governmental entity from the Act, we have been unwilling to conclude that documents or information of that entity can be obtained indirectly, by filing a FOIA request with an entity that is covered under that statute,\u201d the judge wrote in the 46-page opinion, Politico reported. \u201cAt bottom, we do not believe Congress intended that FOIA requesters be able to obtain from the gatekeepers of the White House what they are unable to obtain from its occupants.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama agreed in 2009 to disclose information on White House visits, while maintaining that disclosure was voluntary.\n\nJudicial Watch, a nonprofit government watchdog group, sued for information on nine months of visits that occurred before Mr. Obama\u2019s policy went into effect, and it won concessions from a district court in 2011. Then, judges said that the records fell under FOIA law but that certain exemptions applied.\n\nThe appeals ruling puts the case back in Judicial Watch\u2019s hands, which now could seek a full bench hearing before all six of the D.C.
