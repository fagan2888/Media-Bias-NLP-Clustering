Baseball’s free-agent market is stocked with plentiful and tempting talent — from pitchers Zack Greinke and David Price, to outfielders Justin Upton, Jason Heyward and Alex Gordon, to slugging first baseman Chris Davis.

Will the Rockies do more than window shop for top-line players? History says no.

It’s no secret the team must upgrade its pitching, which was the worst in the big leagues. But is general manager Jeff Bridich planning to make a bold and dramatic move — via a free-agent signing or a trade — to immediately upgrade the rotation?

“That’s a tough question,” Bridich said recently. “We haven’t seen any of the market play out yet, or even begin to, so it’s a tough question to answer. I think there are — in terms of our depth — some internal answers that we are very hopeful that we are going to have, next year.”

In other words, look for the Rockies to develop their young talent to improve their pitching and not spend big for a free-agent ace.

The Rockies certainly need upgrades. Colorado’s pitching staff allowed a 5.04 ERA, 844 runs and a .278 opponent batting average, all of which were major-league worsts.

That said, Bridich’s decision to trade star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto last summer for pitching prospects shows that he is willing to deal. If a team approaches Bridich about a trade for rejuvenated right fielder Carlos Gonzalez, he will certainly listen.

The Rockies have a young, talented lineup, but would they surprise and make a run at a player such as power hitting free-agent first baseman Chris Davis? It seems unlikely, but if they were to trade Gonzalez for pitching, then spending money on a free-agent power hitter could make sense.
