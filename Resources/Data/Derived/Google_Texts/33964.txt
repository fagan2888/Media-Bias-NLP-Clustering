MONTPELIER, Vt. - Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin announced that Department of Health Access (DVHA) Commissioner Mark Larson will be stepping down in March.



A press release says Lori Collins will become Interim Commissioner once Larson steps down. A search for a permanent replacement is underway.



“Mark has worked as hard as anyone on my team over the last four years,” said Gov. Shumlin. “Mark led the Department through some challenging times, but no one cared more or tried harder to overcome those challenges so Vermonters could access affordable health care than Mark. Thanks to the work of Mark and others, tens of thousands more Vermonters are now insured. I appreciate his service and understand his desire to take some time to step back and explore new opportunities."



The Governor's Office says to ensure continuity of management of critical projects during the leadership transitions, Department of Health Commissioner Harry Chen will serve as Chair of the Health and Human Services Enterprise Program Executive Steering Committee. He will provide daily executive oversight of Vermont Health Connect, Integrated Eligibility, and Medicaid Management Information Systems projects. He will report to Agency of Human Services Secretary Hal Cohen.



During Larson's time at Vermont Health Access, he helped expand Medicaid services provided for by the Affordable Care Act and develop the state's insurance marketplace, Vermont Health Connect.
