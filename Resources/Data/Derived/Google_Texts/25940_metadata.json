(AP) - A Minnesota startup is using a 3-D printer to create custom urns shaped like objects that were important to the person whose remains they hold.\n\nThe Eden Prairie-based Foreverence offers urns that are made with a ceramic material that looks different than the plastic material typically produced by a 3-D printer. The process takes nearly an entire day, starting with about nine hours of printing, and then followed by several hours of touchups, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reported (http://bit.ly/1tRLCM6 ).\n\nEach urn is unique and can take the form of just about anything, including ballet slippers, cars and instruments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fascinated by the endless possibilities,\u201d company CEO Pete Saari said.\n\nIt has even made an urn shaped like the signature hats worn by rock band Devo when co-founder Bob Casale died earlier this year. Foreverence offered Casale\u2019s family the urn and ended up making two for them. Casale\u2019s family told the company that it was \u201cthe first joyous moment in a dark period of time for them,\u201d Saari said.\n\nForeverence sells its urns, which typically cost thousands of dollars, through funeral directors.\n\n\u201cWe want funeral directors to keep conversations focused on legacy,\u201d said Saari, whose privately held company launched five months ago. \u201cWhat was important to the deceased? What was symbolic of a life, a dream, the pursuit of a passion?\u201d\n\nThe urn is created by a ceramic-composite material that\u2019s fed into the 3-D printer in a powdered form. Its shape gradually takes form with coloring that bonds each layer together, and staff members put the final touches on the urns.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: St. Paul Pioneer Press, http://www.twincities.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Minnesota startup is using a 3-D printer to create custom urns shaped like objects that were important to the person whose remains they hold.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Minnesota startup is using a 3-D printer to create custom urns shaped like objects that were important to the person whose remains they hold.", "title": "Custom urns courtesy of company\u2019s 3-D printer", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/25/eden-prairie-company-uses-3-d-printer-to-make-urns/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/25/3718d7a4d6c27329630f6a706700081b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/25/3718d7a4d6c27329630f6a706700081b.jpg", "title": "Custom urns courtesy of company\u2019s 3-D printer", "description": "A Minnesota startup is using a 3-D printer to create custom urns shaped like objects that were important to the person whose remains they hold.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecd3\"", "article_summary": "The Eden Prairie-based Foreverence offers urns that are made with a ceramic material that looks different than the plastic material typically produced by a 3-D printer.\nEDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.
