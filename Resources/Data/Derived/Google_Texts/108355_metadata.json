Reuters\n\nROBERT RAPIER: What is the most important question in the climate debate that supporters and opponents are overlooking?\n\nThe answer to this question is different for supporters and opponents. For opponents, the most overlooked question is whether they have attempted to quantify the possibility that they are wrong about the impacts of climate change, and whether some sort of risk mitigation is appropriate given the possibility they are wrong.\n\nAn analogy I use sometimes is that of homeowner\u2019s insurance. The chance of a person\u2019s house burning down is low, but the outcome is potentially devastating. Thus, regardless of whether a person believes that it is extremely unlikely that their house will burn down, they have homeowner\u2019s insurance so they can afford another home should that low risk probability materialize.\n\nIn the climate debate, opponents have to acknowledge that there is some probability that they are wrong, and given the severity of the potential consequences risk mitigation is warranted even if they believe that there is a 99% chance that their position is correct.\n\nOn the side of supporters I believe the most important overlooked question is about the most likely outcome. When I am working on a problem, I often ask the questions \u201cWhat is the optimal outcome?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the most likely outcome?\u201d, and \u201cHow much influence do I have to make the \u2018optimal outcome\u2019 the \u2018most likely outcome\u2019?\u201d If I find that the answer to the last question is \u201cnot much,\u201d then I have to think about how to deal with the most likely outcome.\n\nThe Copenhagen Accord stipulates that in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the global temperature rise needs to be kept below 2\u00b0C relative to preindustrial temperature levels. But studies have projected that even if the carbon-emission reduction pledges from the Copenhagen Accord are met, there is still little chance of keeping the temperature rise below 2\u00b0C.\n\nPerhaps that would open the door for more serious discussion of radical options that climate-change supporters have generally resisted, such as geoengineering. That is of course not an option to be considered lightly, but if it\u2019s highly likely that the temperature will increase by more than 2\u00b0C, we have to start broadening the possible mitigation options.\n\nRobert Rapier (@RRapier) director of alternative-fuels technology for Advanced Green Innovations LLC, a Chandler, Ariz.-based technology-development company focused on alternative-energy resources and delivery mechanisms.
