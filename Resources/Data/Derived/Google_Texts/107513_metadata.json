Global advertising, in contrast, grew only 4.2% last year and over the past five years grew on a compound annual growth rate by 2.3%, Pivotal said, using Magna Global data.\n\nMuch of the growth in global media agencies\u2019 billings has come from the big firms taking share from smaller independents and full service agencies (with some exceptions such as Horizon Media), Pivotal said. International expansion\u2014especially in Asia outside of Japan \u2013has been particularly important, Pivotal added.\n\nIPG\u2019s Mediabrands unit\u2019s growth was slightly below its peers last year, with billings growing 11% in 2013 with a five-year CAGR of 5.9% based on RECMA\u2019s figures. Pivotal Research noted that IPG was the second weakest among the global agencies after Havas, whose billings are half of IPG\u2019s size, over a five-year time frame.\n\nIn contrast, Pivotal Research notes, media buying growth at Dentsu\u2013 whose size is similar to IPG\u2019s\u2013 has been near the top of the global agencies group though a key difference is that Dentsu\u2019s Carat as a standalone agency is almost as big as Interpublic\u2019s Initiative and UM agencies combined.\n\nStill, IPG\u2019s performance could be highlighted by proponents of a sale. IPG itself, the fourth largest ad holding company by revenue, has argued it has enough scale to be competitive. During an earnings call last week, IPG Chief Executive Michael Roth noted \u201cperformance at Mediabrands remains strong in the quarter\u201d and said the unit was a strong driver of organic growth during the second quarter.\n\nPivotal notes that Dentsu, if it acquired IPG, would jump to second place for media buying among holding companies from fourth place. Publicis, combined with Interpublic, would be \u201ca clear number one\u201d in media buying, Pivotal says.\n\nBut in a cautionary note, Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser says that an active sales process for Interpublic could be bad for the business, producing \u201can even greater distraction for all of the people involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile media agencies have very favorable financial profiles and contribute meaningfully to the logic underpinning M&A in the industry, they are at the end of the day much like the other kinds of agency businesses: they are very much \u2018human\u2019 businesses, with people as the core product and people as the core customer,\u201d Mr. Weiser wrote in a research note on Thursday.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately for activist investors, human considerations need to play a major part in further industry consolidation for the agency industry,\u201d Mr. Wieser writes.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "If Interpublic Group is put on the auction block, as activist Elliott Management reportedly wants, potential bidders may be particularly interested in the holding company\u2019s Mediabrands media buying unit.
