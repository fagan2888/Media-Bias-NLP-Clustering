Gordon M. Grant for The Wall Street Journal\n\nHalfway through a Bridgehampton dinner party of striped bass and grilled leeks, James Slattery and 14 of his friends ran out of their favorite wine, a local Wolffer Rose.\n\nMr. Slattery pulled out his phone, and, using a new app called Minibar, solved the quandary without anyone leaving the house.\n\n\u201cWithin 20 minutes, a happy driver was knocking on the door with more wine,\u201d Mr. Slattery, a 31-year old consultant, said about the beverage that he affectionately refers to as \u201cHamptons Gatorade.\u201d\n\nMinibar, which lets local liquor stores sell online and deliver quickly to their customers, is just one of many services tailored to making the easy lives of beachgoers on the eastern end of Long Island even easier.\n\nFrom getting their hair done to shopping for groceries, visitors may never have to leave the comfort of their vacation homes.\n\n\u201cOur customers are busy and especially in the Hamptons they don\u2019t want to spend their time on errands. We help make their summer more convenient,\u201d said Lindsey Andrews, who co-founded Minibar, which now makes deliveries between Westhampton and East Hampton.\n\nMs. Andrews said Minibar\u2019s average Hamptons order is four times the size of the average New York City order. The top seller out on the island is ros\u00e9\u2014 by far.\n\n\u201cWe definitely see a customer in the Hamptons that values service and convenience,\u201d Ms. Andrews said.\n\nThat is also the goal for the newly launched Uber Beauty, an on-demand salon service that has no connection with the transportation service.\n\nStylist David Benjamin saw a business opportunity at the vacation spot, where he vistis every year, too.\n\n\u201cWhat if we could bring the salon to them?\u201d he wondered.\n\nSo this season, Mr. Benjamin bought a fleet of Torino 150 Scooters for a gang of high-end stylists who are on call 24 hours around the clock. Their home base is a rental house in East Hampton.\n\nMr. Benjamin acts as mission control, dispatching the stylists to appointments. They look appropriately chic on their Italian motorbikes, wearing white pants, white V-neck T-shirts, Converse sneakers and trench coats. Their services range in price from $90 to $550.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a fire drill. We get a call and people hop on the scooter,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. \u201cThey are zipping around the Hamptons at every hour of the day. We have early mornings and 10 p.m. slots before the late-night partyers go out.\u201d\n\nUber Beauty stylists are all experienced, doing everything from highlights to keratin treatments, he said.\n\n\u201cI put them through an intense interview and audition process,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said. Their slogan is: \u2018Book from the beach and we\u2019ll have you ready by dinner.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTraffic is always a concern in the Hamptons, which was one reason why Mr. Benjamin bought scooters instead of cars.\n\nMr. Benjamin prepares to ride a scooter to a client\u2019s house in East Hampton on July 24. Gordon M. Grant for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cWe also use the WAZE app which takes us through all the back roads,\u201d he said of the mapping app that gives drivers the best route.\n\n\u201cStylists can usually get in between appointments in about 15 minutes,\u201d which allows them to pack as many as eight appointments in a day.\n\n\u201cThey operate every single day of the week,\u201d he said.\n\nLexi Stolz\u2019s busiest days are Thursday and Friday. That is when she and her staff at South Fork & Spoon are busily shuttling between farm stands, wine shops and grocery stores to stock the refrigerators of their Hamptons clients before they arrive for the weekend.\n\nSouth Fork & Spoon calls itself a food concierge service, and its goal is to assist clients with everything from menu planning to wine selection and then perform all the shopping.\n\n\u201cAll items are then delivered and unpacked, washed and stored away ready to be eaten, cooked or heated by the time the client arrives,\u201d Ms. Stolz said.\n\nMs. Stolz is something of an expert at finding organic anything and locally produced everything, but the trickiest request she received so far this season was for two cases of Bud Light.\n\n\u201cNot very Hamptons,\u201c Ms. Stolz said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Halfway through a recent Bridgehampton dinner party of striped bass and grilled leeks, James Slattery and 14 of his friends ran out of their favorite wine, a local Wolffer Rose.", "title": "Grocers, Stylists and Even Liquor Stores Make House Calls in the Hamptons", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/01/grocers-stylists-and-even-liquor-stores-make-house-calls-in-the-hamptons/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DY115_NYHAMP_P_20140801114511.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Grocers, Stylists and Even Liquor Stores Make House Calls in the Hamptons", "description": "Halfway through a recent Bridgehampton dinner party of striped bass and grilled leeks, James Slattery and 14 of his friends ran out of their favorite wine, a local Wolffer Rose.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Jo Piazza", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Halfway through a recent Bridgehampton dinner party of striped bass and grilled leeks, James Slattery and 14 of his friends ran out of their favorite wine, a local Wolffer Rose.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-01T22:28:12-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/01/grocers-stylists-and-even-liquor-stores-make-house-calls-in-the-hamptons/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21311", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Halfway through a recent Bridgehampton dinner party of striped bass and grilled leeks, James Slattery and 14 of his friends ran out of their favorite wine, a local Wolffer Rose.", "title": "Grocers, Stylists and Even Liquor Stores Make House Calls in the Hamptons", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/08/01/grocers-stylists-and-even-liquor-stores-make-house-calls-in-the-hamptons/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DY115_NYHAMP_P_20140801114511.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21311", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-01T22:28:52-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce920\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Slattery pulled out his phone, and, using a new app called Minibar, solved the quandary without anyone leaving the house.\nMr. Benjamin prepares to ride a scooter to a client\u2019s house in East Hampton on July 24.\nWe have early mornings and 10 p.m. slots before the late-night partyers go out.\u201dUber Beauty stylists are all experienced, doing everything from highlights to keratin treatments, he said.\n\u201cI put them through an intense interview and audition process,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said.\nWe get a call and people hop on the scooter,\u201d Mr. Benjamin said."}
