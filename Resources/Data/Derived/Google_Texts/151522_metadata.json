The Gulf Coast city is about 20 miles from where 46-year-old Teresa Sievers was found dead in her Bonita Springs home.\n\nRodgers admitted leaving Missouri during Wednesday's five-minute federal court hearing in St. Louis, but he waived his right to a more robust hearing on the allegations. Asked by U.S. District Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh if he had anything to say, Rodgers replied: \"No, not at this time.\"\n\nRodgers' court-appointed attorney, Joan Miller, said after the hearing that Rodgers told her \"he didn't know the people in Florida.\" She declined further comment, and Rodgers hasn't entered a plea in the Florida case.\n\nAssistant federal prosecutor John Bird made only a vague reference to the Florida case during the hearing in St. Louis, referring to the \"rather significant\" case for which Rodgers had been arrested. He declined comment after the hearing.\n\nAccording to court documents, Rodgers' probation officer said Rodgers was seen at the Wal-Mart in Fort Myers on June 28, the day before Sievers' body was found. No details about who saw Rodgers were included in the documents. Investigators also haven't said how Sievers died or released a possible motive in the killing.\n\nCurtis Wayne Wright Jr., 47, who grew up with Sievers' husband in Hillsboro, Missouri, has also been arrested in the case. He was being held without bond in Jefferson County, Missouri, pending an extradition hearing on Sept. 30. His attorney didn't return a message seeking comment Wednesday.\n\nBoth men were arrested last week on suspicion of second-degree murder. Sievers, a holistic physician and mother of two, had a medical practice in Estero, Florida.\n\nSheriff Mike Scott in Florida's Lee County, home to Fort Myers and Bonita Springs, said Wednesday that the investigation into Sievers' death is ongoing. He didn't rule out additional arrests, but declined to comment on a possible motive, the two suspects' alleged connection or how Sievers died.\n\n\"We believe there's more work to be done,\" he said.\n\nScott said he expects Wright to be transferred to Florida within 30 to 60 days, while Rodgers \"will step out one cell and right into another\" once he completes his federal sentence.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "One of two Missouri men charged with killing a southwest Florida doctor was sentenced Wednesday for a probation violation that investigators allege put him", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/suspect-fl-docs-death-violates-federal-probation", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201508/doc_murdered.png", "type": "article", "description": "One of two Missouri men charged with killing a southwest Florida doctor was sentenced Wednesday for a probation violation that investigators allege put him", "title": "Suspect In FL Doc's Death Violates Federal Probation"}, "story_id": 437174540, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Suspect In FL Doc&#039;s Death Violates Federal Probation"}, "nid": 11839, "datePublished": "2015-09-03", "keywords": "death of Florida doctor, murder, Dr. Teresa Sievers", "wordCount": 487, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Terms of his probation barred him from leaving Missouri, but his probation officer said he was seen at a Wal-Mart store in late June in Fort Myers, Florida.\nSheriff Mike Scott in Florida's Lee County, home to Fort Myers and Bonita Springs, said Wednesday that the investigation into Sievers' death is ongoing.\nAccording to court documents, Rodgers' probation officer said Rodgers was seen at the Wal-Mart in Fort Myers on June 28, the day before Sievers' body was found.\nShe declined further comment, and Rodgers hasn't entered a plea in the Florida case.\nRodgers' court-appointed attorney, Joan Miller, said after the hearing that Rodgers told her \"he didn't know the people in Florida.\""}
