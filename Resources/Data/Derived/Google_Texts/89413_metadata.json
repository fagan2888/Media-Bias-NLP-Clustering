Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is straying from his typical straight-edged, suit-and-tie look ahead of a speaking engagement in Los Angeles, Calif., appearing in mysterious posters that show the conservative with edgy tattoos and a cigarette dangling from his lips.\n\nThe posters of a rough-around-the-edges Cruz appeared Thursday night around several locations in the City of Angels ahead of a speaking engagement at the Beverly Hills Wilshire Hotel for the Claremont Institute.\n\nA shirtless Cruz appears to be photoshopped into the images and dons several tattoos, including one of the bald eagle sprawled across his muscly pecs. With a cigarette in his mouth and the word \u201cCruz\u201d inked across his stomach, the poster reads \u201cTED CRUZ\u2019S SO-CAL \u2018BLACKLISTER & LOVING IT\u2019 TOUR\u201d with the date March 15th written across the top.\n\nCruz is the keynote speaker for the Claremont Institute\u2019s annual Winston Churchill dinner at the Wilshire on the 15th.\n\nThe senator, who must\u2019ve received word of the odd posters, decided to join in the fun.\n\nSaw this, but noticed an error.
