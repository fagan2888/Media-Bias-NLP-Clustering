The state has since cut ties with CGI.\n\nIndependent reports have found problems with both CGI and with the state's project management.\n\nYang stressed the workarounds the state has used to get people enrolled in insurance coverage, even though most of that coverage is only temporary. Yang also talked about the large gains in insurance under the reforms put in place by Republican Gov. Mitt Romney in 2006, which was the model for Democratic President Barack Obama's national health care overhaul.\n\n\u201cWe support the Affordable Care Act because it embodies the principles of our Massachusetts reforms: shared responsibility for expanding coverage; a balance between private and public solutions; and the fundamental belief that health is a public good,\u201d Yang said.\n\nRepublicans in Massachusetts used the occasion to criticize the state\u2019s handling of the health connecter website problems.\n\n\u201cI continue to worry about the new federal health law's disastrous effect here,\u201d said Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker in a statement. \u201cWhat members of Congress likely didn't hear today is that thousands of families are still in the dark, unsure of whether they have access to a doctor or about the rising costs surely to hit job creators.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Boston Globe reported that the committee members spent most of the hearing questioning a representative of Maryland's health insurance website.\n\nRead Jean Yang\u2019s full Congressional testimony below.\n\nCongressional testimony of Jean Yang", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@homepage','@mobile','affordable-care-act','beacon-hill','health-care','jean-yang','massaschusetts-health-connector','politics','us-congress'", "title": "Jean Yang of Massachusetts Health Connector testifies before Congress on Obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jean Yang of Massachusetts Health Connector testifies before Congress on Obamacare\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/jean_yang_of_massachusetts_hea.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/14625200-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12579880\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-03T20:43:30Z\", \"author\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"@mobile\",\"affordable-care-act\",\"beacon-hill\",\"health-care\",\"jean-yang\",\"massaschusetts-health-connector\",\"politics\",\"us-congress\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.masslive.com/politics_impact/photo/14625200-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@#!/shiraschoenberg", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary", "description": "Yang blamed the problems with the state website on technology vendor CGI."}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, April 03, 2014,  4:43 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/politics_impact/photo/ae-health-1-12931727jpg-aa48d0c3ee15d30a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sschoenberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com\", \"author_id\": \"10164552\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "Yang blamed the problems with the state website on technology vendor CGI.", "title": "Jean Yang of Massachusetts Health Connector testifies before Congress on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/jean_yang_of_massachusetts_hea.html", "image": "http://www.masslive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, April 03, 2014,  3:42 PM", "article_author": "Shira Schoenberg | sschoenberg@repub.com", "Description": "Yang blamed the problems with the state website on technology vendor CGI."}, "article_summary": "Mitt Romney in 2006, which was the model for Democratic President Barack Obama's national health care overhaul.\nCongressional testimony of Jean Yang\nJean Yang, the executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, testified before a congressional committee on Thursday that the state is benefiting from the Affordable Care Act, despite the problems with its website.\nRepublicans in Massachusetts used the occasion to criticize the state\u2019s handling of the health connecter website problems.\nYang said the website problems, which have prevented people from using the online Health Insurance Exchange to sign up for insurance \u201care mainly due to failures of our system integrator,\u201d referring to technology vendor CGI."}
