The court even defied expectations Thursday and retained an important category of lawsuits under the Fair Housing Act. The justices will release the final three rulings of their nine-month term Monday.\n\n\u201cWe can safely say this is the most liberal term of the Roberts court, and probably of the past quarter-century,\u201d said Tom Goldstein, an appellate lawyer and founder of the website Scotusblog. \u201cThe left held a majority in most of the close cases, including easily the most important ones.\u201d\n\nA key reason: Even though Republican-appointed justices hold a 5-4 edge, the four Democratic appointees stuck together on an overwhelming number of cases. Each has agreed with the other three, at least in part, in 90 percent or more of the court\u2019s rulings, according to Scotusblog.\n\nThat unity meant it took just one vote from the other side to capture most of the ideologically divisive cases, resulting in a term that almost let liberals forget how often the court led by Chief Justice John Roberts has drawn their ire over the past decade.\n\nLopsided Score\n\nThe term might adopt a slightly different hue when the court releases its final rulings. Cases involving lethal injection, clean-air rules and redistricting all offer the prospect of conservative triumphs.\n\nStill, the scorecard has been lopsided in favor of the liberal wing. According to statistics kept by Scotusblog, the non-unanimous cases this term have left Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, two of the most conservative Republican-appointed justices, disproportionately in dissent. Scalia was in the majority in 48 percent of those cases and Thomas in only 33 percent.\n\nBy contrast, the court\u2019s four Democratic appointees -- Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- all were in the majority in at least 78 percent of those cases, as was Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nBig Cases\n\nThose numbers may actually understate the phenomenon because of the significance of some of the rulings. Kennedy provided the fifth vote to legalize gay marriage nationwide only a day after he and Roberts joined with the liberal wing to uphold the tax subsidies that are a core component of President Barack Obama\u2019s landmark health-care law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult not to feel fairly gleeful about this term after two consecutive days of sweeping wins in hugely important cases,\u201d said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel at the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\nRoberts\u2019s vote in the Obamacare case drew a torrent of criticism from people who had backed his 2005 nomination to the court by President George W. Bush. It was the second time the chief justice had backed the health-care law, following the 2012 ruling that rejected a broad constitutional challenge to the historic measure.\n\nOnce hailed by conservatives for leading the court in striking down campaign-finance laws and rolling back the Voting Rights Act, Roberts is today the focal point for their anger.\n\nHe \u201cis now dead to conservatives,\u201d said Curt Levey, the president of the Committee for Justice and a former supporter of Roberts.\n\nThe chief justice also aligned with the Democratic appointees in a 5-4 ruling that said states can bar judicial candidates from personally soliciting campaign funds.\n\nSwing Vote\n\nMore often, it was Kennedy providing the swing vote, as he did in the gay-marriage and housing-bias cases. The latter ruling said that people suing under the Fair Housing Act don\u2019t have to show intentional discrimination. Instead, Kennedy said they can use statistical evidence to show that a disputed practice has \u201cdisparate impact\u201d on racial minorities.\n\n\u201cMuch progress remains to be made in our nation\u2019s continuing struggle against racial isolation,\u201d Kennedy wrote.\n\nKennedy also joined the liberals in another race case, reviving a lawsuit by Democrats and black lawmakers who said a Republican-drawn Alabama legislative map unconstitutionally packed too many racial minorities into a handful of districts.\n\nThe same group of five invalidated a Los Angeles ordinance that let police demand access to hotel registries.\n\nEven Thomas\n\nIn another case, it was Thomas who broke with his usual allies and joined a 5-4 majority to say that Texas didn\u2019t have to issue a license plate depicting the Confederate battle flag.\n\nThomas and Kennedy both aligned with the liberals in a 6-3 decision to side with the Obama administration and strengthen presidential power. That ruling struck down a law that would have let Americans born in Jerusalem designate Israel on their passport as their place of birth.\n\nThe administration said the law undermined the State Department\u2019s longstanding policy of neutrality toward Jerusalem\u2019s status.\n\nAnd Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, another Republican appointee, were in the majority when the court voted 6-3 to bolster the rights of pregnant women and revive a lawsuit by a former United Parcel Service Inc. driver.\n\nThe conservative wing did stick together to win a handful of 5-4 rulings, including a decision that said the federal government was unconstitutionally forcing raisin growers to set aside part of their crop during high-production years. Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan all dissented at least in part.\n\nMore often, the conservatives fractured while the liberals stayed united.\n\n\u201cThese victories,\u201d Wydra said, \u201care perhaps even sweeter when you think that we are achieving them in a court with a conservative majority.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Greg Stohr", "twitter": {"description": "Republican appointees are in the majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, but the term is shaping up as the biggest liberal rout in decades.", "title": "Liberals Unite to Win as Top U.S. Court Closes Blockbuster Term", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-27/liberals-unite-to-win-as-top-u-s-court-closes-blockbuster-term", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwfOx.gJbHls/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Greg Stohr", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Anthony McLeod Kennedy,Liberal,Conservative", "news_keywords": "Anthony McLeod Kennedy,Liberal,Conservative", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-27/liberals-unite-to-win-as-top-u-s-court-closes-blockbuster-term", "parsely-title": "Liberals Unite to Win as Top U.S. Court Closes Blockbuster Term", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-27T16:54:30.394Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Republican appointees are in the majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, but the term is shaping up as the biggest liberal rout in decades.", "parsely-tags": "Anthony McLeod Kennedy,Liberal,Conservative,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-06-27T16:54:30.394Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Republican appointees are in the majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, but the term is shaping up as the biggest liberal rout in decades.", "title": "Liberals Unite to Win as Top U.S. Court Closes Blockbuster Term", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-27/liberals-unite-to-win-as-top-u-s-court-closes-blockbuster-term", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwfOx.gJbHls/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Republican appointees are in the majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, but the term is shaping up as the biggest liberal rout in decades."}, "parsely-post-id": "NQKS9A6JIJUP01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iwfOx.gJbHls/v2/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36ef\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe can safely say this is the most liberal term of the Roberts court, and probably of the past quarter-century,\u201d said Tom Goldstein, an appellate lawyer and founder of the website Scotusblog.\nRepublican appointees are in the majority on the U.S. Supreme Court, but the term is shaping up as the biggest liberal rout in decades.\nLopsided ScoreThe term might adopt a slightly different hue when the court releases its final rulings.\nThe court even defied expectations Thursday and retained an important category of lawsuits under the Fair Housing Act.\n\u201cThese victories,\u201d Wydra said, \u201care perhaps even sweeter when you think that we are achieving them in a court with a conservative majority.\u201d"}
