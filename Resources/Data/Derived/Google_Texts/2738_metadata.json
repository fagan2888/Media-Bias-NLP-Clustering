Sounds great, right? But did you need all that? Would still want all of that if you had to stake your own money?\n\nCon\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive re\u00adformers say that if con\u00adsumers have to spend their own money, they will forgo use\u00adless or un\u00adne\u00adces\u00adsary care and fo\u00adcus on the things that mat\u00adter to them, such as qual\u00adity, cost, or bed\u00adside man\u00adner. These re\u00adformers ad\u00advoc\u00adate for health in\u00adsur\u00adance plans with high\u00ader de\u00adduct\u00adibles or great\u00ader cost-shar\u00ading to sub\u00adject health de\u00adcisions to fin\u00adan\u00adcial dis\u00adcip\u00adline. And while these ideas are gen\u00ader\u00adally touted as an al\u00adtern\u00adat\u00adive to the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act, high-de\u00adduct\u00adible, low-premi\u00adum plans are gain\u00ading in pop\u00adular\u00adity as the law is im\u00adple\u00admen\u00adted. It\u2019s just not clear that they are bet\u00adter at mak\u00ading pa\u00adtients more con\u00adscien\u00adtious con\u00adsumers of care than their lower-de\u00adduct\u00adible coun\u00adter\u00adparts.\n\nHigh-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans, typ\u00adic\u00adally defined as those with a de\u00adduct\u00adible (the amount a pa\u00adtient has to pay out of pock\u00adet be\u00adfore the in\u00adsurer steps in) in ex\u00adcess of $1,000, have sprouted in re\u00adcent years. A pa\u00adper by Katy Kozhi\u00adman\u00adnil, a pro\u00adfess\u00ador of pub\u00adlic health at the Uni\u00adversity of Min\u00adnesota, and oth\u00aders pub\u00adlished in the Au\u00adgust is\u00adsue of Med\u00adic\u00adal Care es\u00adtim\u00adates that 34 per\u00adcent of in\u00adsured work\u00ading Amer\u00adic\u00adans have high-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans, and that the num\u00adber has tripled since 2008. With their lower premi\u00adums, the plans are at\u00adtract\u00adive to em\u00adploy\u00aders and pa\u00adtients, who save money each month \u2014 as long as they don\u2019t have to seek ex\u00adpens\u00adive med\u00adic\u00adal care. The new Obama\u00adcare in\u00adsur\u00adance mar\u00adket\u00adplaces, which give con\u00adsumers the abil\u00adity to shop for health cov\u00ader\u00adage on\u00adline, are pro\u00adjec\u00adted to fur\u00adther the pro\u00adlif\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion of high-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans for the same reas\u00adon.\n\nAs you\u2019d ex\u00adpect, in\u00adcreas\u00ading the cost of care does de\u00adcrease con\u00adsump\u00adtion. An April re\u00adport from Mas\u00adsachu\u00adsetts\u2019 at\u00adtor\u00adney gen\u00ader\u00adal de\u00adscribes a Blue Cross Blue Shield ana\u00adlys\u00adis of the pa\u00adtients in its high-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans. Their use of health care ser\u00advices de\u00adcreased between 1 and 5 per\u00adcent, de\u00adpend\u00ading on their de\u00adduct\u00adible, from 2008 to 2010, and they used more pre\u00advent\u00adive ser\u00advices and cheap\u00ader gen\u00ader\u00adic pre\u00adscrip\u00adtions. That\u2019s ex\u00adactly how cost-shar\u00ading plans are sup\u00adposed to drive be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador.\n\nBut pre\u00adlim\u00adin\u00adary data from 2010 and 2011 for two oth\u00ader health plans in Mas\u00adsachu\u00adsetts re\u00advealed that, when ad\u00adjus\u00adted for health status, the costs of high-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans over\u00adall were ac\u00adtu\u00adally high\u00ader than stand\u00adard plans. The re\u00adport doesn\u2019t make clear why this might be the case and urges fur\u00adther study. But some health policy ex\u00adperts say such high\u00ader costs could be the res\u00adult of pa\u00adtients put\u00adting off ne\u00adces\u00adsary care and al\u00adlow\u00ading health prob\u00adlems to fester, ne\u00adces\u00adsit\u00adat\u00ading more pricey treat\u00adment in the end.\n\nKozhi\u00adman\u00adnil ex\u00adamined how men and wo\u00admen in high-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans in New Eng\u00adland used health care between 2001 and 2008. Wo\u00admen re\u00adduced the num\u00adber of emer\u00adgency-room vis\u00adits for low-sever\u00adity prob\u00adlems (say, a flu) by ap\u00adprox\u00adim\u00adately one-quarter, but main\u00adtained rates for in\u00adter\u00adme\u00addi\u00adate- and high-sever\u00adity is\u00adsues. Men, on the oth\u00ader hand, re\u00adduced all emer\u00adgency-room vis\u00adits, while de\u00adcreas\u00ading high-sever\u00adity emer\u00adgency care the most, by nearly one-third.\n\nThe study says this is \u201ccon\u00adsist\u00adent with the hy\u00adpo\u00adthes\u00adis that men who trans\u00adition to [high-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans] may fore\u00adgo needed care \u2026 res\u00adult\u00ading in delays or in\u00adcreased sever\u00adity of ill\u00adness when care is later sought.\u201d\n\nAn\u00adoth\u00ader study by Har\u00advard Med\u00adic\u00adal School pro\u00adfess\u00ador J. Frank Wharam and oth\u00aders, pub\u00adlished in the Au\u00adgust is\u00adsue of Health Af\u00adfairs, found that poorer pa\u00adtients in Mas\u00adsachu\u00adsetts also re\u00adduced high-sever\u00adity vis\u00adits by as much as one-third in a giv\u00aden year. The high de\u00adduct\u00adibles were dis\u00adcour\u00adaging the most ne\u00adces\u00adsary care.\n\nDes\u00adpite these early con\u00adcerns about high-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans, some as\u00adpects of their philo\u00adsophy, if the plans pro\u00adlif\u00ader\u00adate as ex\u00adpec\u00adted un\u00adder Obama\u00adcare, might nudge pa\u00adtients in\u00adto be\u00ading sav\u00advi\u00ader health care con\u00adsumers. Hard data \u2014 for price and for qual\u00adity \u2014 are cur\u00adrently lack\u00ading, mak\u00ading shop\u00adping around dif\u00adfi\u00adcult. What stand\u00adard\u00adized qual\u00adity meas\u00adures there are can be mis\u00adlead\u00ading: A hos\u00adpit\u00adal that does poorly on one in\u00addic\u00adat\u00ador (say, death after sur\u00adgery) may have very un\u00adhealthy pa\u00adtients rather than a prob\u00adlem with its care. The met\u00adrics and in-depth re\u00adviews that are avail\u00adable in many areas of the eco\u00adnomy are gen\u00ader\u00adally un\u00adavail\u00adable with\u00adin the health care sys\u00adtem.\n\nAs Obama\u00adcare con\u00adtrib\u00adutes to the rise of high-de\u00adduct\u00adible plans, it might push reg\u00adu\u00adlat\u00adors to make this data avail\u00adable. In\u00addeed, a few states have taken ac\u00adtion on price trans\u00adpar\u00adency in re\u00adsponse to re\u00adcent health re\u00adforms. North Car\u00ado\u00adlina and Mas\u00adsachu\u00adsetts each passed bills man\u00addat\u00ading that hos\u00adpit\u00adals pub\u00adlish the prices they ne\u00adgo\u00adti\u00adate with in\u00adsurers, which might help pa\u00adtients se\u00adlect af\u00adford\u00adable care.\n\nMak\u00ading more and bet\u00adter data avail\u00adable to con\u00adsumers has the po\u00adten\u00adtial to change the health care sys\u00adtem for the bet\u00adter.
