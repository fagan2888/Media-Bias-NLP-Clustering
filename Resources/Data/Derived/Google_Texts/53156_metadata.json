But even at that point, the Obamacare program will cost the governemnt 'about $145 billion' each year.\n\nThat number doesn't include the insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs paid by Americans \u2013 only the government's role in implementing the law and paying for its guarantees.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Obamacare,program,costs,50,000,American,gets,health,insurance,says,bombshell,budget,report", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2927348/Obamacare-program-costs-50-000-American-gets-health-insurance-says-bombshell-budget-report.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act will still leave 'between 29 million and 31 million' nonelderly Americans without medical insurance by 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office.", "title": "Federal budget price tag for every new Obamacare enrollee: $50,000", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2927348/Obamacare-program-costs-50-000-American-gets-health-insurance-says-bombshell-budget-report.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/26/250D49B200000578-0-image-a-6_1422308321889.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2927348/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2927348/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2927348, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Obamacare,program,costs,50,000,American,gets,health,insurance,says,bombshell,budget,report", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-01-26T21:38:59.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=David+Martosko,+Us+Political+Editor+For+Dailymail.com", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-01-26T23:32:15.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Obamacare program costs 50 000 American gets health insurance says bombshell budget report"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "The Affordable Care Act will still leave 'between 29 million and 31 million' nonelderly Americans without medical insurance by 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office.", "title": "Federal budget price tag for every new Obamacare enrollee: $50,000", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2927348/Obamacare-program-costs-50-000-American-gets-health-insurance-says-bombshell-budget-report.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/01/26/250D49B200000578-0-image-a-6_1422308321889.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2015/01/1418450360_4013801096001_9-9-09-Obama-Promises-ObamaCare-Won-t-Add-One-Dime-1422314971820.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "The Affordable Care Act will still leave 'between 29 million and 31 million' nonelderly Americans without medical insurance by 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe269b\"", "article_summary": "It will cost the federal government \u2013 taxpayers, that is \u2013 $50,000 for every person who gets health insurance under the Obamacare law, the Congressional Budget Office revealed on Monday.\nBut even at that point, the Obamacare program will cost the governemnt 'about $145 billion' each year.\nThat number doesn't include the insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs paid by Americans \u2013 only the government's role in implementing the law and paying for its guarantees.\nOffsetting that massive outlay will be $643 billion in new taxes, penalties and fees related to the Obamacare law.\nPulling that off will cost Uncle Sam about $1.35 trillion \u2013 or $50,000 per head."}
