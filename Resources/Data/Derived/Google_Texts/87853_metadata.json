Each team is 13-4.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: Chancellor put on an epic performance against Carolina last weekend, delivering big hits on running backs DeAngelo Williams and Mike Tolbert, leaping over the line of scrimmage to nearly block two field-goal attempts and clinching the Seahawks\u2019 31-17 win with a 90-yard interception return for a touchdown.\n\nBackground: Chancellor was a high school quarterback in Norfolk, Va., before playing for Frank Beamer-coached Virginia Tech, where he was switched to defensive back as a freshman. At 6-foot-3 and 232 pounds, the 26-year-old Chancellor is bigger than many weakside linebackers in the NFL. He was the second player selected in the fifth round of the 2010 draft.\n\nKlis\u2019 take: With stars Richard Sherman and Earl Thomas in the same secondary, Chancellor was relatively unknown until he blasted Demaryius Thomas on the Broncos\u2019 third offensive play of last year\u2019s Super Bowl. The hit sent notice that the Seahawks were going to bully the Broncos, which they did 43-8. Chancellor\u2019s game vs. Carolina last weekend was the best I\u2019ve seen by a strong safety since Troy Polamalu\u2019s 2004-08 run in Pittsburgh. The Seahawks may well have the best cornerback (Sherman), free safety (Thomas) and strong safety (Chancellor) in the NFL. Which is why they\u2019re favored to repeat as Super Bowl champions.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Kam Chancellor,NFL,Seahawks,spotlight", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Kam Chancellor put on an epic performance against Carolina last weekend, delivering big hits on running backs DeAngelo Williams and Mike Tolbert", "title": "Kam Chancellor: Spotlight on the Seahawks safety", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/17/kam-chancellor-spotlight-seahawks-safety/32225/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/01/Kam-Chancellor.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Kam Chancellor put on an epic performance against Carolina last weekend, delivering big hits on running backs DeAngelo Williams and Mike Tolbert", "creator": "@mikeklis", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/01/17/kam-chancellor-spotlight-seahawks-safety/32225/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/01/Kam-Chancellor.jpg", "title": "Kam Chancellor: Spotlight on the Seahawks safety", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Kam Chancellor put on an epic performance against Carolina last weekend, delivering big hits on running backs DeAngelo Williams and Mike Tolbert"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef62\"", "article_summary": "The Seahawks may well have the best cornerback (Sherman), free safety (Thomas) and strong safety (Chancellor) in the NFL.\nSpotlight on \u2026 Kam Chancellor, safety, SeahawksWhen: 1 p.m. Sunday when the Seattle Seahawks host the Green Bay Packers in the NFC championship game at CenturyLink Field.\nChancellor\u2019s game vs. Carolina last weekend was the best I\u2019ve seen by a strong safety since Troy Polamalu\u2019s 2004-08 run in Pittsburgh.\nThe hit sent notice that the Seahawks were going to bully the Broncos, which they did 43-8.\nAt 6-foot-3 and 232 pounds, the 26-year-old Chancellor is bigger than many weakside linebackers in the NFL."}
