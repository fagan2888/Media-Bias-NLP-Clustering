I know Tangs wants to too, so when he has the puck, I just want to get to open ice, open space. I\u2019m fairly confident he\u2019ll be able to find me or Iggy.\n\n\u201cI just want to work hard and hopefully chip in a few goals.\u201d\n\nGoing into the late game against the Jets, Mitchell had eight goals and six assists in 43 games this season, missing 11 games in November with an oblique injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played with Iggy and Tangs before,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly helpful. I know their tendencies and what they like to do, so it\u2019s just a matter of doing that in the game.\u201d\n\nSince joining the Avalanche in July 2012, Mitchell has been consistent offensively, scoring 10, 11 and 11 goals in the three seasons, so he\u2019s on pace to do slightly better this season. He remains one of the Avalanche\u2019s primary penalties killers and was averaging 15:32 of ice time heading into the game against the Jets.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Line reunion with John Mitchell to aid offense", "title": "Line reunion with John Mitchell to aid offense", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/line-reunion-with-john-mitchell-to-aid-offense-2/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__John-Mitchellp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160206__John-Mitchellp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T20:58:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T06:13:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I know Tangs wants to too, so when he has the puck, I just want to get to open ice, open space.\n\u201cThey\u2019re both obviously very good players who have been in this league a long time,\u201d Mitchell, 30, said after the morning skate.\nIginla had one goal in the previous 12 games, and his ice time dipped to 9:11 in Thursday\u2019s night overtime loss to Dallas.\nThat was one of the realities Saturday night, when Avalanche coach Patrick Roy reunited Iginla and Tanguay as linemates against the Winnipeg Jets.\n\u201cI\u2019ve played with Iggy and Tangs before,\u201d Mitchell said."}
