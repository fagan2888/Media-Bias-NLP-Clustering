They have no sense of decorum. Sometimes they're just plain embarrassing.\n\nWhy, just a few breaths ago, we were wondering what possessed so many young minds to post selfies from funerals.\n\nThen the world's leaders gather for Nelson Mandela's funeral and they do just the same thing.\n\nHere were British Prime Minister David Cameron, Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, and President Barack Obama grinning it up, as the latter two held a smartphone steady. (It's unlikely to have been the president's, as he's often said how committed he is to his BlackBerry.)\n\nPerhaps they just want to be hip to the Selfies At Funerals Tumblr feed.\n\nI can reveal that this highly sensitive Tumblr feed is hip to this seminal work of political art.\n\nIt has featured this image with the words: \"Obama Has Taken A Funeral Selfie, So Our Work Here Is Done.\"\n\nIndeed, the creator of the feed, Jason Feifer, added that he is serious about ending the feed on this highest of high notes.\n\nThe face of the first lady seems like a comment on the whole affair. Staring somberly ahead, she ignores this seemingly ignoble act.\n\nThose fond of nitpickery will say that this wasn't precisely a funeral, but a memorial service.\n\nBut when the world's leaders decide to follow a trend, it's like being on Facebook: it's over.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president and British and Danish prime ministers smile for the smartphone at Nelson Mandela's memorial.
