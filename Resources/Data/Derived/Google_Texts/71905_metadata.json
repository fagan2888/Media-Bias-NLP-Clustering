He opens it with a gathering he covered in a small town in rural Australia, a place nicknamed after a species of tree with potentially lethal stingers. A couple of hundred people gathered there to hear John MacKay, a science teacher turned creationist, lay out evidence for his belief that the world was created by God, 7,000 years ago.\n\n\u201cI see the lines there,\u201d Storr thinks, looking down at his notepad, \u201cready to be filled with descriptions and strings of overheard dialog and the thoughts I\u2019ll think about these Christians, these crazy Christians; the words that will make up the story that will be read by people just like me. I see the lines, and I already know what they\u2019re going to say.\u201d None of it will answer the nagging question of why people believe the strange things they do.\n\nAnd if Storr is sure of anything \u2014 being sure emerges as a dubious quality in the course of \u201cThe Unpersuadables\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s that he\u2019s tired of how this story has been told. He doesn\u2019t believe in creationism, and sees no reason why he ever should, but after quizzing a few of the attendees about their understanding of the scientific substance of the creationist debate, he admits that his own pro-evolution position is just as faith-based as theirs. \u201cLike so many people who hold strong opinions about it, I have never studied evolution. I have exercised no critical thinking on the topic whatsoever.\u201d\n\nAnd so begins a searching, extraordinarily thoughtful exploration of what it means to believe anything \u2014 not just the weird things that the fanatics, eccentrics and heretics that Storr interviews believe. These renegades lavish their conviction on everything from the fairly respectable (homeopathy) to the decidedly not (Holocaust denial) and their fixations range from from such classics as UFOs and ghosts to an obscure malady called Morgellons, whose sufferers believe that their skin has been infested by a mysterious agent that some think is a rare parasite and others are sure is a top-secret form of nanotechology run amok. Storr undergoes past-life regression and attends a huge convention of the followers of a superstar guru whose breathing exercises are said to cure cancer. (\u201cIt has been found that cancer cells cannot thrive in a highly oxygenated environment,\u201d a follower informs him.) He also rubs shoulders \u2014 and butts heads \u2014 with public figures from the thriving skeptic community.\n\n\u201cThe Unpersuadables,\u201d like most books intended to make you think rather than to tell you all the ways you\u2019re right, is difficult to characterize. It contains a larger portion of autobiographical material than some readers will expect or welcome, but to my mind this background creates an illuminating context for Storr\u2019s perpetual self-questioning. In his youth, he rebelled against his parents\u2019 Catholicism and expectation that he\u2019d go to college; he also suffered from periods of depression, kleptomania and obsessive, self-destructive jealousy. Now a novelist and journalist, Storr comes across as a man on even footing who never takes that evenness for granted. He also likes outsiders and dissenters, having spent the first part of his life adamantly refusing to fulfill his family\u2019s dreams for him.\n\nFortunately for Storr, he wanted to write and he\u2019s really good at it. Each chapter in \u201cThe Unpersuadables\u201d plunges the author into a peculiar subculture, and each has its own narrative flavor. The account of a family who discovers that their late, estranged daughter and sister had fallen into the clutches of therapists convinced of the existence of networks of Satanic ritual child abusers, murderers and cannibals works like a detective story. Another on Lord Monckton, a famous British climate-change denier, is a profile in reactionary nostalgia as a way of life. The Morgellons chapter is, of course, a medical thriller, although the results are not vindicating when Storr finds a doctor willing to analyze some fibers for a sufferer. (Most medical professionals view even the request to have such lab work done as a symptom of a psychological disorder, but this particular physician had been afflicted with a rare parasite himself and sympathized.) And Storr tries \u2014 very, very hard, in a chapter resembling a courtroom drama \u2014 to get to the bottom of some troubling disputes surrounding the presiding saint of the skeptics movement, James Randi.\n\nRunning through all these stories is Storr\u2019s growing uncertainty about certainty. In the first chapter, he presents his readers with a conundrum: \u201cI consider \u2014 as everyone surely does \u2014 that my opinions are the correct ones,\u201d yet to assume that he really is right about everything \u201cwould mean that I possess a superpower: a clarity of thought that is unique among human beings. Okay, fine. So accept that I am wrong about things \u2014 I must be wrong about them.\u201d Yet when Storr surveys his own views, again, they all strike him as spot-on. \u201cI know that I am not right about everything, and yet I am simultaneously convinced that I am. I believe these two things completely, and yet they are in catastrophic logical opposition to each other.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A journalist's investigation of strange beliefs and the people who hold them leaves him questioning himself", "author": "Laura Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A journalist's investigation of strange beliefs and the people who hold them leaves him questioning himself", "title": "From creationism to ESP: Why believers ignore science", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/16/from_creationism_to_esp_why_believers_ignore_science/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/the_unpersuadables.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A journalist's investigation of strange beliefs and the people who hold them leaves him questioning himself", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/the_unpersuadables.jpg", "title": "From creationism to ESP: Why believers ignore science", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "From creationism to ESP: Why believers ignore science", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Climate Change, Editor's Picks, Evolution, Holocaust, Must-Do, Nonfiction, Science, The Unpersuadables, What to Read, Will Storr", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1c4\"", "article_summary": "I believe these two things completely, and yet they are in catastrophic logical opposition to each other.\u201d\nEach chapter in \u201cThe Unpersuadables\u201d plunges the author into a peculiar subculture, and each has its own narrative flavor.\nTopics: Books, Climate Change, Editor's Picks, Evolution, Holocaust, Must-Do, Nonfiction, Science, The Unpersuadables, What to Read, Will Storr, Entertainment NewsWill Storr knows exactly what sort of book you expect \u201cThe Unpersuadables: Adventures With the Enemies of Science\u201d to be.\n\u201cI know that I am not right about everything, and yet I am simultaneously convinced that I am.\nSo accept that I am wrong about things \u2014 I must be wrong about them.\u201d Yet when Storr surveys his own views, again, they all strike him as spot-on."}
