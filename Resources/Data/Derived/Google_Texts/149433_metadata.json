But he was one of my favorite players to watch, so I watched him a lot.\n\n\u201cMaybe it did come from him. It\u2019s a mental technique for me. Every pre-pitch, that\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 newest starting shortstop played so long in the giant shadow of Tulowitzki that some things rubbed off. And with Tulowitzki long gone from Colorado, his successor is finally playing without a ceiling.\n\nStory, a 23-year-old from Irving, Texas, tore through spring training to leap ahead of a three-man competition at shortstop. He probably will be a starter on opening day, April 4 against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix. Story is finally ready to be himself.\n\n\u201cI grew up in this organization. He was here the whole time I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Story said of Tulowitzki, who was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays last July. \u201cShortstop was on lock when he was here. And when he went, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, man, I\u2019m not used to not having Tulo here.\u2019\n\n\u201cWith him leaving, it opens some things up.\u201d\n\nBatting sure beats pitching:\n\nStory is not the Rockies\u2019 shortstop of the future \u2014 he is their shortstop now. You just have to lean in close to tell it\u2019s him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a super quiet guy, but he sure works hard,\u201d said third baseman Nolan Arenado. \u201cThe power is there, obviously. He looks great. He has solid at-bats and has some pop. I can\u2019t get over how much control he has over his game.\u201d\n\nStory appeared on his way to the major leagues by the time his freshman year began at Irving High School in suburban Dallas. He was a pitcher then, and could touch 96 mph on a radar gun. But he was too athletic to play only once every five days.\n\n\u201cWhen I got into high school, I fell in love with hitting,\u201d Story said. \u201cFreshman and sophomore years, that\u2019s when I realized I could do something with this.\u201d\n\nBig-league scouts began appearing like mushrooms. The Rockies used their second pick in the first round of the 2011 draft to select Story, the 45th overall pick. He then rose through every level in Colorado\u2019s minor-league system.\n\nBut his climb was difficult. He flailed at first with Single-A Modesto and Double-A Tulsa. His ability often outshined the field. But as the pitching got tougher and strike zones shrank and breaking balls turned sharper, his batting average cratered (going from .277 to .200 in less than a year) and his strikeouts shot up (from an average of one per game to 1.5).\n\n\u201cA lot of times with a young player, they have tremendous ability but the consistency of what they\u2019re doing every day isn\u2019t there,\u201d said Rockies farm director Zach Wilson, aware that many scouts wrote off Story.\n\n\u201cThe prospect world tried to do that when all of a sudden he had a tough year at Modesto and he slipped on everybody\u2019s lists,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cOur belief in him never slipped. We knew the guy and what kind of baseball heart he has in him.\u201d\n\nPulled away from pull hitter:\n\nThe scouting line on the 6-foot-1, 180-pound Story at the time said he had plenty of pop in his bat but didn\u2019t make enough contact and was a pull hitter.\n\nBut in 2014, he dumped 40 strikeouts off his ledger and began spraying the ball around \u2014 and his on-base-percentage jumped 62 points.\n\n\u201cHis approach is to the big part of the field, an opposite-field approach,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him pull a lot of balls this spring. That\u2019s a good sign. Early on, some of the reports from his minor-league days were he got pull-happy. But those days are gone.\u201d\n\nStory\u2019s 1.166 OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage) this spring is second-best among the Rockies, behind Arenado. But spring stats count for bupkis.\n\nTulowitzki didn\u2019t exactly light the world on fire when he was called up in 2007, two years after he was drafted out of Long Beach State. But he helped the Rockies reach the World Series that season. He is among the best shortstops in baseball, now starring with Toronto after his blockbuster trade last summer.\n\n\u201cIt was a whirlwind. I remember lying in bed, it was late at night, one of my buddies screenshotted it to me on Twitter,\u201d Story said of the night when he learned Tulowitzki was no longer in front of him. \u201cI woke up and saw it. It was crazy.\u201d\n\nStory has played his way past veteran utility man Daniel Descalso (hand injury) and Cristhian Adames in spring training. And veteran shortstop Jose Reyes, who was acquired in the Tulowitzki trade, is out while facing domestic abuse charges.\n\nWhen the Rockies play their home opener April 8 against the San Diego Padres, Story likely will kick the same dirt Tulo perched on for so long at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely more at home now,\u201d Story said. \u201cLast year was my first camp. I was just trying not to say too much, put in my work, keep my head down. This year is the same, but I can be more myself. It helps on the field.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Trevor Story rockets into starting shortstop spot for Rockies", "title": "Trevor Story rockets into starting shortstop spot for Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/trevor-story-rockets-into-starting-shortstop-spot-for-rockies/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T23:30:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T23:30:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And with Tulowitzki long gone from Colorado, his successor is finally playing without a ceiling.\nEvery pre-pitch, that\u2019s what I do.\u201dThe Rockies\u2019 newest starting shortstop played so long in the giant shadow of Tulowitzki that some things rubbed off.\nAnd when he went, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, man, I\u2019m not used to not having Tulo here.\u2019\u201cWith him leaving, it opens some things up.\u201dBatting sure beats pitching:Story is not the Rockies\u2019 shortstop of the future \u2014 he is their shortstop now.\nStory, a 23-year-old from Irving, Texas, tore through spring training to leap ahead of a three-man competition at shortstop.\nBut those days are gone.\u201dStory\u2019s 1.166 OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage) this spring is second-best among the Rockies, behind Arenado."}
