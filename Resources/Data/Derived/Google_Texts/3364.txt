Some of our local little leagues were saying 'play ball' for the first time this year on Saturday.

Hiland Park Little League opened their spring baseball season Saturday morning.

There are 11 teams for the league this year, with about a dozen players on each team ranging from T-ball to 15-years-old.

The opening ceremonies were complete with the first pitch being thrown by 17-year professional baseball player Kevin Toler.

League officials say opening events like this is a way to thank the community for its support.

"Everything here from field upkeep to most maintenance is mainly all volunteer," said Mike Dixon, the President of Hiland Park Little League. "Community involvment is huge and I'm just glad to see that there's so many people that are willing to step up and really take part in something like this because without the community involvement, this league would not exist at all."

Other local leagues that held their opening day event include Southport, Callaway, and R.L. Turner.
