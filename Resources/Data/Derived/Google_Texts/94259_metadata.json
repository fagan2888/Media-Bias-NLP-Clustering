The state also requires an accounting of the changes Highmark has made in its effort to turn around the hospital system.\n\nStephen Foreman, an associate professor of health administration and economics at Robert Morris University, said it's a fair request.\n\n\u201cWhat we're concerned with here is the use of a nonprofit insurer's reserves to realign the hospital market in Western Pennsylvania. If there are substantial risks of losses or inefficient use of money, it's the public's business,\u201d he said.\n\nHighmark spokeswoman Lynn Seay said the insurer plans to submit a final plan, including the requested information, by the state's deadline. Allegheny Health Network spokesman Dan Laurent concurred.\n\n\u201cWe expected the PID to scrutinize the preliminary plan and to weigh in on it, and we're prepared to address the issues raised in the letter in the final plan,\u201d Laurent said.\n\nSamuel Marshall, president of the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, said Highmark's July 15 filing was too vague to be labeled a preliminary plan.\n\n\u201cThe preliminary plan, as the department pointed out, doesn't set forth its corrective actions,\u201d said Marshall, who testified before the state on the matter during a public meeting in May. \u201cMaybe Highmark is going to get everything right on the nose in the final plan, but I'd expect some give and take even after that is filed. Right now, it's impossible for anybody to evaluate the quality of the plan.\u201d\n\nHighmark wrote in its preliminary plan that expansions of outpatient facilities in Pine, Bethel Park and Peters are key drivers behind Allegheny Health Network's road to financial viability and reduction of operating losses.\n\nHighmark has invested more than $1 billion to form Allegheny Health Network, the region's second-largest hospital network behind rival UPMC. It rescued the former West Penn Allegheny Health System, a five-hospital network that was on the verge of bankruptcy, to form the backbone. Allegheny General and West Penn hospitals were part of West Penn Allegheny.\n\nAllegheny Health Network wants to build outpatient centers across the region, expand women's services and increase access to emergency and trauma services in key communities.\n\nHighmark last week disclosed an operating loss of $171 million for the first half of 2015, compared to a gain of $12 million during the same period last year. The insurer attributed the loss to higher-than-expected medical claims from people who signed up for health plans through the Affordable Care Act's online exchange. It reported a loss of $16 million for Allegheny Health Network.\n\nBen Schmitt is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
