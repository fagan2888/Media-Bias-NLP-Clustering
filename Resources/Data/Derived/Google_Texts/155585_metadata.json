A study by the Association of American Medical Colleges predicts a shortfall of nearly 100,000 doctors by the year 2025.\n\nThe study concludes that the demand of the expanding population is growing faster than the supply of doctors. Those numbers are compounded by 26 million more people expected to have insurance who wouldn't otherwise, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDoctors at Bristol Regional Medical Center said the trend also has to do with a limit on how many doctors schools can train at one time. Furthermore in this area, doctors can be harder to keep because, thanks to limits on how many hours a doctor can work a week, there is less time spent on-call in areas with bigger populations and more doctors.\n\n\"I want to say in the past couple years they've brought in, I think, 50 new physicians, but the problem is there's just as many if not more who are retiring, and so to try to get those spots filled is the problem,\" pediatrician Dr. Jessica Hommel said.\n\n\"As the population is expanding and growing, in medical schools, training and residency programs, they have not expanded their population as we're expanding, so it's just that we're really not producing as many doctors as we need to,\" Dr. Ben Scharfstein said.\n\nHospitals in the area are making more efforts to train and then keep doctors here in the Tri-Cities.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "Despite efforts to attract more doctors, there may be a physician shortage in the country in just a few years.
