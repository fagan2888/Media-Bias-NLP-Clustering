The Four Seasons hotel, in the upscale Georgetown neighborhood, will for the 16th year host the public servants for a free feast dubbed \u201cThanksgiving on the Mayflower.\u201d\n\nBetween 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., the Four Seasons will offer sit-down and to-go meals prepared by Executive Chef Douglas Anderson to all first responders scheduled to work on the holiday.\n\n\u201cIt is nice to be able to cater to those that can\u2019t be with their families because they are working, working for all of us,\u201d Four Seasons General Manager David Bernand told The Daily Signal in an interview.\n\nThe hotel invited the first responders to visit a 53-foot truck provided by the Mayflower moving company, parked in front of the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest. They may sit and dine in the vehicle or take their meals to go.\n\n\u201cWe have so many people in the community that cannot get to enjoy Thanksgiving because they\u2019re working,\u201d Bernand said. \u201cAnd we ourselves, being in the hospitality industry \u2026 most of the time, on holidays, are actually working.\u201d\n\nInside the moving truck, volunteers and hotel employees dressed in festive garb\u2014ranging from Pilgrim costumes to turkey outfits\u2014expect to hand out roughly 350 Thanksgiving meals to dine-in guests as well as 150 to-go meals.\n\nBernand said some men and women stop by to get meals for co-workers who can\u2019t step away from their desks or other posts.\n\nHoliday dishes include butternut squash soup, green bean casserole, stuffing and up to 100 assorted pies created by the hotel\u2019s executive pastry chef, Charles Froke.\n\nAnderson expected to prepare 300 pounds of turkey and 200 pounds of mashed potatoes.\n\nThe hotel\u2019s chefs prepare the meals, Bernand said, \u201cand it\u2019s exactly the same items that we are serving at the hotel brunch.\u201d He added:\n\nIt\u2019s usually very festive, and a great atmosphere, and it\u2019s very well appreciated by those who have to work on that day. There is camaraderie and support.\n\nThe Washington hotel launched \u201cThanksgiving on the Mayflower\u201d in 2000. It was the brainchild of Chris Hunsburger, then general manager and now executive vice president of human resources and administration.\n\nOver the next few weeks, the Four Seasons also will collect jackets, coats, and blankets to distribute to the homeless around Christmas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Four Seasons hotel, in Washington's upscale Georgetown neighborhood, again will host public servants for a feast dubbed \u201cThanksgiving on the Mayflower.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Four Seasons hotel, in Washington's upscale Georgetown neighborhood, again will host public servants for a feast dubbed \u201cThanksgiving on the Mayflower.\u201d", "title": "This Hotel Caters to Cops, Firefighters for Thanksgiving", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151125_FourSeasonsThanksgiving_Donnelly1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-25T17:46:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1YupC5h"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Four Seasons hotel, in Washington's upscale Georgetown neighborhood, again will host public servants for a feast dubbed \u201cThanksgiving on the Mayflower.\u201d", "title": "This Hotel Caters to Cops, Firefighters for Thanksgiving", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151125_FourSeasonsThanksgiving_Donnelly1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "civil society", "published_time": "2015-11-25T12:24:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-25T17:46:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Four Seasons Hotel, Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving on the Mayflower, Four Seasons Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving volunteers, working Thanksgiving  Byline: Madaline Donnelly"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe have so many people in the community that cannot get to enjoy Thanksgiving because they\u2019re working,\u201d Bernand said.\nThe Washington hotel launched \u201cThanksgiving on the Mayflower\u201d in 2000.\nThe hotel invited the first responders to visit a 53-foot truck provided by the Mayflower moving company, parked in front of the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest.\nPolice officers, firefighters, and emergency medical workers in the nation\u2019s capital will briefly abandon their posts Thanksgiving Day and head to one of the region\u2019s most luxurious hotels.\nIt was the brainchild of Chris Hunsburger, then general manager and now executive vice president of human resources and administration."}
