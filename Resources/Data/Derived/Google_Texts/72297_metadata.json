Saunders said he expects the deal to be accretive immediately to earnings, adding roughly 78 cents a share for fiscal 2015. The deal should add $700 million to fiscal 2015 sales, he added.\n\nAptalis\u2019s fiscal 2013 revenue was $688 million, he said, up 12% from 2012. Adjusted earnings were $350 million, up 29%. Aptalis has 1,000 employees spread out over three divisions: U.S. drug sales, overseas drug sales and a pharmaceutical manufacturing services group.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nChart illustrates differences between states that love, hate Obamacare\n\nStaying on Obamacare sidelines helps UnitedHealth to new high\n\nPharmacyclics soars after panel says cancer drug met goals", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-01-08T11:03:19-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "It might one of the few examples where an acquisition resulted in a buyer's stock taking off but that seems to be the case with Forest Laboratories Inc.'s purchase of privately held drug maker Aptalis.", "title": "Forest shares see double-digit gains following Aptalis purchase", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/08/forest-shares-see-double-digit-gains-following-aptalis-purchase/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS171_forest_MG_20140108105917.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "acquisition,Aptalis,Forest Laboratories Inc.,gastrointestinal drugs", "article.headline": "Forest shares see double-digit gains following Aptalis purchase", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "It might one of the few examples where an acquisition resulted in a buyer's stock taking off but that seems to be the case with Forest Laboratories Inc.'s purchase of privately held drug maker Aptalis.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "acquisition,Aptalis,Forest Laboratories Inc.,gastrointestinal drugs", "article.published": "2014-01-08T11:03:19-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/08/forest-shares-see-double-digit-gains-following-aptalis-purchase/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "It might one of the few examples where an acquisition resulted in a buyer's stock taking off but that seems to be the case with Forest Laboratories Inc.'s purchase of privately held drug maker Aptalis.", "title": "Forest shares see double-digit gains following Aptalis purchase", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/01/08/forest-shares-see-double-digit-gains-following-aptalis-purchase/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS171_forest_MG_20140108105917.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-1822", "article.updated": "2014-01-08T11:03:19-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf247\"", "article_summary": "Aptalis has 1,000 employees spread out over three divisions: U.S. drug sales, overseas drug sales and a pharmaceutical manufacturing services group.\nForest /quotes/zigman/226825/delayed /quotes/nls/frx FRX blew past its 52-week high after announcing the $2.9 billion purchase of Aptalis from investment firm TPG and was up $8.64 to $67.40 in recent action.\nForest makes an array of drugs, treating everything from high blood pressure to depression, and is now adding an arsenal of cystic fibrosis and gastrointestinal medications to its product lineup with the Aptalis purchase.\nThe deal should add $700 million to fiscal 2015 sales, he added.\nAptalis\u2019s fiscal 2013 revenue was $688 million, he said, up 12% from 2012."}
