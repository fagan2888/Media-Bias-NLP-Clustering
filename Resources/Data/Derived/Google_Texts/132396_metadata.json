She intends to carry that voice to Washington to help overcome the unique challenges facing Western New York.\n\nIt\u2019s a silly statement, when you read it. \u201cInequity in power\u201d doesn\u2019t prevent or stunt someone\u2019s ability to \u201cspeak for themselves\u201d. Unless Weppner is advocating for that socialist equality nonsense, it\u2019s hard to know what she\u2019s talking about. I can\u2019t decide if she\u2019s trying to be regular people, or if she\u2019s saying, in effect, that she\u2019s better than regular people \u2013 you lumpenproles can rely on her to do your anti-Obama, anti-Kenyan advocacy for you.\n\nIn the meantime, I wonder if Weppner is funding her campaign through the sale of her yacht?\n\nRight now, you can buy a 1989 Beneteau Oceanis 500, a 50\u2032 sailing vessel registered to Kathleen Weppner of Williamsville. The \u201cPerseverance III\u201d is available for the low, low price of $99,900. It looks like Weppner let her FCC license for the ship\u2019s radio lapse in 2012, which would essentially coincide with the end of her radio program.\n\n\u2018Perseverance VII\u2019, 5 Cabin, 4 Heads, Roller Furling, Enormous Salon, Great Live-Aboard Potential, Rochester, NY Description:\n\nThe Oceanis 500: This 50 footer has supplied thousands of sailors the \u201cbig boat\u201d experience. The accommodations are sumptuous for 4 couples. There is a \u201ccrew\u2019s quarters\u201d forward with two bunks. This 500 is fast and stable with a 15 ton displacement. While Beneteau built her to go anywhere, she is equally comfortable in light air as well as a blow. Always a \u201cLot of boat for the money\u201d This particular 500 is priced extremely well for a domestically based boat.
