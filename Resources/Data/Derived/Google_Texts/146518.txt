A grass fire that began Sunday afternoon in El Paso County has been extinguished.

The fire, which began at 3:15 p.m., burned 80 to100 acres near Yoder along South Yoder Road, according to the Mike Tipton, a spokesperson for the Tri-County Fire Department.

Although the El Paso County Sheriff’s Department initially tweeted there would be mandatory evacuations, Tipton said evacuations ultimately weren’t necessary. He noted that structures were threatened at the outset of the fire, but the flames migrated in a different direction.

“The direction the fire traveled was away from the structures,” Tipton said. “As a result, there was no evacuation necessary.”

Crews managed to control the fire in around 20 minutes, but it took three hours to put out the blaze. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

The Tri-County Fire Department posted photos on its Facebook page officials of the grass fire south of Yoder, which is located about 30 miles east of Colorado Springs.
