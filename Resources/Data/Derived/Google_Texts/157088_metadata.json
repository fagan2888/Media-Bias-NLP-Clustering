I feel lucky to work for a clinic that is willing to support the community in this way.\u201d Commented Jessica Mejia, Office Manager at MCoM.\n\nCorte Madera, California: The objective of project Unify is: to help as many needy families in as many ways as possible. However, this event focuses on a comprehensive long-term solution rather than what can simply be accomplished in one day. Though Medical Center of Marin will administer complimentary Flu shots and provide many other items and services at no cost, the goal is to provide resources to needy families to help have their needs met throughout the year.

This year, we are looking to double those numbers.\n\nThere will be a donation room containing hundreds of complimentary coats from our One Warm Coat Drive that took place in Whole Foods markets throughout Marin, groceries donated by Whole Foods, and used books for the taking.\n\nMany nonprofit agencies will be running tables and offering demonstrations at the event including: Parent Services Project, MCFL Flagship Literacy Bus, Marin Housing, Marin Transit, Centers for Domestic Peace, Home for All Marin, Trips for Kids, Kids Cooking for Life, Marin Community Clinics Dental, Lift-Lev\u00e1ntate, Environmental Health Network, Apple Family Works, Promotores and more!
