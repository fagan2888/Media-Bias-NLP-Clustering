But it's not pulling back from the online marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\nThat comes as Highmark, which plunged headfirst into the marketplace while some competitors stayed on the sidelines, weathers marketplace losses it calls \"unsustainable.\"\n\nIt also comes as many health insurers around the country are sustaining losses, and some have pulled back from the marketplace, also called the exchange. Observers around the country are watching how Highmark responds to its loss.\n\nLike many insurers, Highmark attributes the losses, which amounted to $318 million in the first half of 2015, to Obamacare customers who ended up being far sicker, and needing far more medical care, than expected.\n\nOn Thursday, a Highmark executive said the insurer is responding by reducing the number of plans offered on the marketplace from about two dozen to about ten.\n\nSome of the revised offerings will have narrower networks of hospitals and doctors. Highmark expects this to hold down costs by restricting members to providers who have agreed to accept lower reimbursements.\n\nAt the same time, Jean Rush, Highmark's executive vice president for government markets, outlined a series of investments and service expansions by Highmark intended to help those customers stay healthier and eventually lower their costs.\n\nThese include an increased level of customer service to help customers chose the plan that best suits them. Highmark will further use \"enhanced care management\" to better coordinate and manage the care of the chronically ill. This will include deploying nurses and other professionals to help them optimize their health, Rush said. In some cases, Highmark will send doctors or nurses to the homes of very sick members, she said.\n\nAsked if the revised offerings might be less appealing to people who need a lot of medical care, Rush said Highmark's goal is not to avoid the sickest patients, but to more effectively address health issues that account for their high costs.\n\nHighmark has requested premium increases of 35 to 40 percent for plans sold to central Pennsylvania residents on the ACA marketplace. Prices vary according to region, and in western Pennsylvania, Highmark has requested increases of 25 to 30 percent, she said.\n\nCustomers for plans sold on the Obamacare exchange are kept separate from the rest of Highmark's under-65 customers, such as those who have Highmark coverage through their job. As a result, the ACA marketplace customers and their costs have no impact on non-marketplace customers, Rush said.\n\nFor Highmark's non-marketplace customers, premium increases will be in the \"high single digits,\" according to Kelly Lieblein, a Highmark vice president based in central Pennsylvania. She noted those increases are based on things such as medical use within individual employer groups and medical cost inflation.\n\nRegarding the customers who came to Highmark via the Obamacare marketplace, Rush said they were far more likely to have conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure, and have used 58 percent more hospital inpatient care.\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, Highmark offered some of the nation's most affordable premiums for Obamacare plans. As a result, it presently has about 258,000 marketplace customers in Pennsylvania, far more than any other insurer, and about 379,000 when counting marketplace customers in other states. Highmark, which is based in Pittsburgh and has a large campus on Center Street in East Pennsboro Township in Cumberland County, has about 143,000 marketplace customers in the Pennsylvania region extending from the State College to the Harrisburg to the Allentown areas.\n\nAsked whether Highmark expects its revised offerings will result in similarly-large numbers of marketplace customers in 2016, Rush said it will depend on how Highmark's premiums compare to those from other insurers.\n\nInsurers had to submit proposed 2016 premiums to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department for Approval, which has yet to reveal the results. People can begin comparing prices and shopping for coverage when the federally-run Obamacare exchange opens in November.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Highmark, health care, politics, news", "title": "Despite big losses, Highmark soldiers on with Obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Despite big losses, Highmark soldiers on with Obamacare\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/10/affordable_care_act_insurers_l.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/18311726-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17089549\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-10-02T11:03:04Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstories\",\"health care\",\"politics\"] }", "twitter": {"creator": "@DavidRWenner", "description": "Highmark took a big plunge into the marketplace.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@pennlive"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, October 02, 2015,  7:28 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/obama-obamacare-affordable-care-act-d0d5828951408f0d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "Highmark took a big plunge into the marketplace.", "title": "Despite big losses, Highmark soldiers on with Obamacare", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/10/affordable_care_act_insurers_l.html", "image": "http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/18311726-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, October 02, 2015,  7:00 AM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "Highmark took a big plunge into the marketplace."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca33d\"", "article_summary": "Prices vary according to region, and in western Pennsylvania, Highmark has requested increases of 25 to 30 percent, she said.\nAs a result, the ACA marketplace customers and their costs have no impact on non-marketplace customers, Rush said.\nIn 2014 and 2015, Highmark offered some of the nation's most affordable premiums for Obamacare plans.\nAs a result, it presently has about 258,000 marketplace customers in Pennsylvania, far more than any other insurer, and about 379,000 when counting marketplace customers in other states.\nThat comes as Highmark, which plunged headfirst into the marketplace while some competitors stayed on the sidelines, weathers marketplace losses it calls \"unsustainable.\""}
