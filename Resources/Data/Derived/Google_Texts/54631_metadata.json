The new rules apply to plans sold on the federal exchange as well as some individual and group plans sold elsewhere. Although only 17 states have legalized gay marriage, millions of same-sex partners gain more equal treatment in the distribution of health coverage across the United States.\n\n\"In other words, insurance companies will not be permitted to discriminate against married same-sex couples when offering coverage,\" Matthew Heinz, the Department of Health and Human Services's director of LGBT outreach, wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe department said the new regulation would make health coverage \u201cmore accessible and equitable for married same-sex couples.\u201d Now, insurers providing plans with benefits for heterosexual married partners must offer the same to gays and lesbians married legally in any state permitting same-sex marriage.\n\nLike the state-by-state campaign to liberalize marijuana laws, the movement to permit same-sex marriages in America continues to accelerate. In a 5-4 Supreme Court decision last year, Justice Anthony Kennedy declared DOMA \u2014 the Clinton-Gingrich-era Defense of Marriage Act \u2014 in violation of the Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment prohibiting unequal treatment before law. This week, the Obama administration urged insurers to begin coverage of same-sex married partners ahead of the Jan. 1 deadline.\n\nThe White House updated the health regulation after Alfred Cowgers Jr. and Anthony Wesley Jr., a gay couple of Gates Mill, Ohio, complained they could not get family health coverage after marrying in New York, which legalized same-sex marriage in 2011. Among others facing the same battle, the couple last month sued their insurer and the state of Ohio, as the federal government had deferred to state law on the issue.\n\nMany more same-sex married partners may qualify for family health coverage in the coming months following Virginia\u2019s overturned gay marriage ban, and court fights soon expected in Ohio, California, and Colorado, analysts say.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gay marriage and health care, gays and health care, gay marriage and health insurance, same-sex marriage and health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Obama administration issued a new regulation on Friday requiring most health insurers, on the federal exchange and elsewhere, to provide equal coverage to married partners gay and straight.", "title": "Obama: Insurers Must Cover Same-Sex Married Couples", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/same-sex-married-couples-be-covered-obamacare-health-plans-271305", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/obama-orders-same-sex-partners-covered-equally-under-most-health-plans.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration issued a new regulation on Friday requiring most health insurers, on the federal exchange and elsewhere, to provide equal coverage to married partners gay and straight.", "title": "Obama: Insurers Must Cover Same-Sex Married Couples", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/same-sex-married-couples-be-covered-obamacare-health-plans-271305", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/obama-orders-same-sex-partners-covered-equally-under-most-health-plans.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/15/obama-orders-same-sex-partners-covered-equally-under-most-health-plans.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-03-15T14:03:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-15T14:09:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Obama administration issued a new regulation on Friday requiring most health insurers, on the federal exchange and elsewhere, to provide equal coverage to married partners gay and straight."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc5b8\"", "article_summary": "Same-sex married couples will soon be covered by insurers offering benefits to heterosexual spouses on the federal health insurance exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe department said the new regulation would make health coverage \u201cmore accessible and equitable for married same-sex couples.\u201d Now, insurers providing plans with benefits for heterosexual married partners must offer the same to gays and lesbians married legally in any state permitting same-sex marriage.\nThis week, the Obama administration urged insurers to begin coverage of same-sex married partners ahead of the Jan. 1 deadline.\nAlthough only 17 states have legalized gay marriage, millions of same-sex partners gain more equal treatment in the distribution of health coverage across the United States.\nMany more same-sex married partners may qualify for family health coverage in the coming months following Virginia\u2019s overturned gay marriage ban, and court fights soon expected in Ohio, California, and Colorado, analysts say."}
