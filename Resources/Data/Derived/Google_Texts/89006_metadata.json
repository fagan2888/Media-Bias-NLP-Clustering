It was detected through a regular mammogram. It\u2019s a little scary, but my prognosis is good and I expect a full recovery. I will be in St Louis for the next 3 weeks receiving treatment. During this time my staff will continue to assist Missourians and I will be posting on my Senate website (McCaskill.senate.gov) how I would have voted on any matters that come before the Senate during my absence\u2014which I\u2019ll also enter into the Congressional record. Additionally, I\u2019ll be submitting questions in writing for any missed Senate hearings.\n\nThank you for the honor of serving you in the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill revealed in a post on her Tumblr this afternoon that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mccaskill.jpg", "title": "Senator Claire McCaskill Reveals She Has Breast Cancer"}, "twitter": {"description": "Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill revealed in a post on her Tumblr this afternoon that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer.", "title": "Senator Claire McCaskill Reveals She Has Breast Cancer", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/mccaskill.jpg", "creator": "@feldmaniac", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2016-02-22T16:10:13+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill revealed in a post on her Tumblr this afternoon that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer.\nHere is McCaskill\u2019s full announcement:I very recently learned that I have breast cancer.\nAdditionally, I\u2019ll be submitting questions in writing for any missed Senate hearings.\nI will be in St Louis for the next 3 weeks receiving treatment.\nIt\u2019s a little scary, but my prognosis is good and I expect a full recovery."}
