"If you can't afford it how are you supposed to take care of yourself," said Karina Rojo.

Rojo, a college student on a budget, is struggling to find affordable insurance.

Just recently Rojo injured her ankle. Instead of seeing a doctor, she put it off.

"It is crazy I should not be doing that," she said.

That's because Karina and her family travel to Mexico for health care.

"I think it's way cheaper," she said.

So cheap, they save an average of 70%. Family vacation time is set aside every summer for annual check-ups and all of their prescription drugs are from our neighbors to the south.

"People have been flocking to Mexico to buy their drugs because they can get it a lot less expensive," said Mario De los Santos, a San Antonio pharmacist.

De los Santos said, while the Afordable Care Act opened doors for many uninsured Americans, some of his customers complain their co-pay is too high and drugs are too expensive as well.

Karina can't recall the last time she relied on American drugs. She even started a treatment in Mexico and finished it here. She asked her friend, a nurse, to give her the remaining shot.

"A shot here is like $100 dollars probably, I saved more than that," she said.

"What you buy over there you're taking a chance," said De los Santos.

De los Santos said there are so many counterfit drugs all over the world that you can't tell the difference between the good and the bad.

"It's like putting a bullet in roulette maybe the first two cliques don't work but maybe the third one does

Karina said this is not her first gamble and she knows exactly what she's getting, as well as the price she will be paying.
