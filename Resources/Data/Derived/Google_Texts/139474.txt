The onset of Obamacare in the United States brought on fears of death panels via rationed health care that encourages the elderly, disabled or terminally ill to choose death over medical care and treatment or that may cut off treatment without their consent.

Those fears were prompted by concerns about government-run health care in Britain and Canada, where patients often wait in long lines for medical treatment or surgery — sometimes at risk to their own life and health because of the delays. In states lie Oregon, where assisted suicide is legal, patients have been told their assisted suicide would be paid for while their medical treatment would not.

Now, out of the UK, new NHS guidelines are urging doctors to ask elderly patients to sign DNR orders that would have doctors taking their lives by refusing to resuscitate them rather than providing them lifesaving care.

New NHS guidelines urge doctors to draw up end-of-life plans for elderly patients and younger patients with serious conditions, such as cancer. Doctors are told to ask patients if they want a DNR order if thei9r medical condition worsens. Medical professionals say it is ‘blatantly wrong’ and will frighten elderly patients.

The NHS says the guidance will improve patients’ end-of-life care, but medical professionals say it is ‘blatantly wrong’ and will frighten the elderly into thinking they are being ‘written off’. In some surgeries, nurses are cold-calling patients over 75 or with long-term conditions and asking them over the phone if they have ‘thought about resuscitation’.
