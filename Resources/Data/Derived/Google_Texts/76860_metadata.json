The recent pay raises have been sold as 7 percent \u2013 but that\u2019s not what many teachers are seeing in their paychecks. Young teachers are getting a modest raise, but those veteran teachers who have worked and sacrificed to give our children a good education have seen the longevity pay they counted on abolished. And the new salary schedule treats them very unfairly. A teacher in Clayton wrote that she got a raise of only $47.60 per month. One Wake County teacher told WRAL-TV that when she saw her increase was only 1.39 percent she \u201csat down and cried.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, many North Carolina teachers are voting against education cuts with their feet. States like Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia and Texas are actively recruiting them. (The Houston School District just hired 28.) Other teachers are retiring early, and many top teachers are going into better paying jobs in business and science.\n\nI think we should be especially alarmed by the message current policies and low teacher pay is sending to the young people of North Carolina who should be our \u201cfuture teachers.\u201d\n\nEnrollment in Schools of Education on our University of North Carolina campuses has dropped precipitously. I received my undergraduate degree in the School of Education at North Carolina State University. Over the last several years new enrollment in my alma mater\u2019s program has gone down every single year \u2013 a drop of 52 percent in four years.\n\nAt UNC-Greensboro (my teacher mother\u2019s alma mater) total undergraduate enrollment in the School of Education has gone down 44 percent in the last six years.\n\nWhere will our future teachers come from? Will we even have enough to teach our kids?\n\nOnce North Carolina had a Teaching Fellows Program that attracted \u201cthe best and brightest\u201d of our students with four-year scholarships if they promised to teach for four years or more. Now the legislature has abolished it.\n\nI believe the status of our public schools and teachers is the No. 1 concern of North Carolina\u2019s resident today. Some say we don\u2019t have the resources and can\u2019t do any better. I know that we can.\n\nRepublican Gov. Jim Holshouser believed we could when he supported the establishment of public kindergarten in 1973 and raised teacher pay to 27th in the nation.\n\nIn 1996 I campaigned for governor on a platform of raising teacher pay to the national average. In 1997 we built a bipartisan coalition with support from Democrats and Republicans, business leaders, education advocates and teachers to support the Excellent Schools Act. And over the next four years we increased teacher pay by almost 33 percent, raising pay to the national average and 20th in the country.\n\nIt is my hope that when the General Assembly convenes in 2015, there will be a new sense of cooperation and a firm commitment to do three things:\n\nFirst, respect veteran teachers by restoring longevity pay and giving them the minimum 5.5 percent raise they were sold.\n\nSecond, increase salaries for all teachers, moving North Carolina to the national average in the next four years.\n\nThird, improve working conditions for our teachers and send the message that North Carolina values its teachers.\n\nThat will show the real respect that North Carolina teachers deserve.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Third, improve working conditions for our teachers and send the message that North Carolina values its teachers.\nThat will show the real respect that North Carolina teachers deserve.\nAnd over the next four years we increased teacher pay by almost 33 percent, raising pay to the national average and 20th in the country.\nSecond, increase salaries for all teachers, moving North Carolina to the national average in the next four years.\nIn 1996 I campaigned for governor on a platform of raising teacher pay to the national average."}
