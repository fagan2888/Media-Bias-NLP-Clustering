Bush brain trust torching conservatives for getting behind Donald Trump? The stale complaint is that conservatives are tossing overboard their \u201ccore principles\u201d when they get behind the fairly elected Republican nominee.\n\nI won\u2019t mention names, but here is the latest offensive rant of one longtime Bush aide who wrote in \u2014 where else \u2014 that bastion of conservative thought, The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cNow loyalty to party is causing many to abandon their ideals. Conservatism is not misogyny. Conservatism is not nativism and protectionism. Conservatism is not religious bigotry and conspiracy theories. Conservatism is not anti-intellectual and anti-science. For the sake of partisanship \u2014 for a mess of pottage \u2014 some conservatives are surrendering their identity.\u201d\n\nWait.\n\nThis from the Bushies who shoved down our throats the biggest expansion in Medicare in decades and the No Child Left Behind buildup of the Department of Education, who spent money at twice the pace of Bill Clinton, who wrote Hank Paulson and the Treasury Department a $700 billion check to bail out financial companies, who sent American troops into Afghanistan for the Wilsonian purpose of \u201cnation-building\u201d with no apparent result, and who passed the worst energy bill in American history \u2014 a bill that regulates every electrical appliance in your home, from the light bulbs you put in your bedroom to the energy efficiency of your refrigerator.\n\nTrump supporters have to listen to holier-than-thou sermons from these people? Really? This is like being lectured to by Snoop Dog about smut on the radio.\n\nWhat the Bush never-Trumpers can\u2019t seem to get over is that the rise of Mr. Trump is not just a rejection of President Obama \u2014 which it is first and foremost \u2014 but a thorough repudiation of the brand of unprincipled \u201cconservatism\u201d that marked the Bush years. Conservatism is supposed to be about improving people\u2019s lives and opportunities. Free markets and limited government. Sorry, the Bush years didn\u2019t turn out so well for the middle class. Wages started stagnating around 2000.\n\nOf course, the unforgivable sin of the Bush administration was the Troubled Asset Relief Program bill that bailed out banks. We unconstitutionally handed out hundreds of billions of dollars to the losers who made egregiously bad financial decisions. This only laid the groundwork for the Obama \u201cstimulus\u201d debacle. At the very time we needed to embrace free-market principles, the Bush team lit a match to them. The Bushies even made crazy justifications such as we have to abandon the free market to save it.\n\nNot only have the Bush folks never apologized for this apostasy, many of them still cling to the ridiculous belief that they did the right thing. Maybe rather than bashing Mr. Trump, these folks might want to just tell conservatives: We\u2019re sorry.\n\nI\u2019ve never been a Bush basher, and I like George W. Bush personally very much. And, sure, Donald Trump is no saint, and he does indeed stray from conservative principles. But he has proposed the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, he wants to repeal Obamacare, he has proposed hundreds of billions in spending cuts, he wants a pro-America energy policy, and he has launched the most successful counterassault against political correctness in American history.\n\nIt turns out that conservatives today \u2014 the tens of millions who voted for Mr. Trump, are challenging many of the worn-out orthodoxies of the party. No, we don\u2019t want to be the policeman of the world. Yes, we are going to insist that Europe pay the cost of defending itself. No, we don\u2019t think the federal government has done anything to advance educational outcomes in America. No, we don\u2019t want to let terrorists into the country simply because political correctness says we have to.\n\nIs this \u201canti-intellectual?\u201d No, it is common sense. I\u2019ve been to Trump rallies. There are thousands of veterans who served our country valiantly. They are patriots.\n\nYou can disagree with the priorities or even the values of Trump voters. But to call them misogynists, bigots, anti-intellectuals and anti-science? Shameful. What\u2019s next: calling Trump voters fascists? No wonder the grass roots thumb their noses at the Republicans\u2019 intellectual leadership. They\u2019re just returning the favor.\n\nWhat is worst is that the never-Trumpers are playing into the hands of the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Washington Post will joyously run these kinds of Republican-on-Trump attacks every day of the week and twice on Sunday. The only way the left can retain power is if the GOP is a house divided. The never-Trumpers are Hillary enablers \u2014 and if they are so smart, they should get this.\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore is an economic consultant with Freedom Works.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is there anything more laughable than all the former members of the George W.
