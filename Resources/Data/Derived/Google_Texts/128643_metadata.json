Clementa Pinckney and eight others who were murdered in their church earlier this month by a white racist who hoped his act of terror would ignite a racial war. The first part of Obama\u2019s remarks were a fitting and inspiring tribute to the victim, whom he knew personally. The second half was a regrettably political speech that exploited the pulpit for partisan ends\u2013and claimed the murderer had been \u201cused by God.\u201d\n\nObama said that the murderer had committed \u201can act that he imagined would incite fear and recrimination, violence and suspicion, an act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our nation\u2019s original sin. He continued:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nOh, but God works in mysterious ways. (APPLAUSE) God has different ideas. (APPLAUSE) He didn\u2019t know he was being used by God. (APPLAUSE)\n\nObama went on to list a set of causes: taking down the Confederate flag, passing gun control, opposing voter ID, and fighting white racism in general, all of which Obama described as expressions of \u201cGod\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the murders were a good thing, because they help advance the left\u2019s political agenda.\n\nAnd presumably, God\u2019s grace is being withheld from those of us who oppose Obama on some of these issues.\n\nWhat a grotesque abuse of religion and mourning.\n\nReligious people often say that everything that happens on earth, even terrible things, are God\u2019s will. But Obama presumes to know what God\u2019s will actually is\u2013and that it lines up, of course, with the political priorities of the Democratic Party.\n\nOf course, on the same day as the funeral, Obama praised the Supreme Court for declaring gay marriage a fundamental right\u2013a position that, in 2008, he said he opposed as a Christian.\n\nTo Obama, God\u2019s word is just a political tool. And those who invoke God\u2013sincerely\u2013to defend their political views are religious bigots.\n\nOnly the Party faithful shall be Saved.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No, Obama--The Charleston Murderer Was Not Being 'Used by God'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "No, Obama--The Charleston Murderer Was Not Being 'Used by God'", "title": "No, Obama-The Charleston Murderer Was Not Being 'Used by God' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4894, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/ap_barack-obama_ap-photo40.jpg", "height": 3390}, "updated_time": "2015-06-28T00:11:24-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/28/no-obama-the-charleston-murderer-was-not-being-used-by-god/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No, Obama--The Charleston Murderer Was Not Being 'Used by God'", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/ap_barack-obama_ap-photo40.jpg", "title": "No, Obama-The Charleston Murderer Was Not Being 'Used by God' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "charleston, Charleston Massacre, Funeral, obama eulogy, religion and politics, religious bigotry, Reverend Clementa Pinckney,Big Government, Faith, Obama,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-28T00:09:14-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-06-28T00:11:24-07:00", "tag": "Reverend Clementa Pinckney", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93b0\"", "article_summary": "(APPLAUSE) He didn\u2019t know he was being used by God.\nTo Obama, God\u2019s word is just a political tool.\nThe first part of Obama\u2019s remarks were a fitting and inspiring tribute to the victim, whom he knew personally.\nBut Obama presumes to know what God\u2019s will actually is\u2013and that it lines up, of course, with the political priorities of the Democratic Party.\nAnd presumably, God\u2019s grace is being withheld from those of us who oppose Obama on some of these issues."}
