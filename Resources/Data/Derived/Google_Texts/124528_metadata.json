But costs have peaked and begun to decline, due partly to innovations in managing prison medical care systems as well as greater reliance on federal Medicaid funds, according to a new study by the Pew Charitable Trusts and the MacArthur Foundation.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2008, prison health care spending rose dramatically as a percentage of overall spending and then peaked in 2009, at $8.2 billion \u2013 or roughly 20 percent of overall state prison expenditures for that year. The rising costs coincided with an historic surge in the number of people incarcerated in U.S. prisons as the government cracked down on drug addicts and dealers.\n\nRelated: Medicaid Expansion Cheaper Than Expected: CBO\n\nThe overall cost finally began to decline, as many states including California began to soften sentencing guidelines and to release or parole inmates to relieve overcrowding. Many state corrections officials also began tapping into the Medicaid program for low-income people to defray or cover inmate patients\u2019 treatment costs.\n\nStates can be reimbursed by Medicaid to cover at least half of enrolled prisoners\u2019 inpatient hospitalization costs, according to the study. They can save additional funds because Medicaid \u201ctypically pays the lowest provider rates of any payer in a state,\u201d the report said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, states that have agreed to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act may actually achieve the biggest savings. Most prisoners, who are non-disabled adults without dependent children, will only become eligible for coverage of inpatient costs under this Medicaid expansion, according to the report \u2013 and will get a great deal. The federal government will initially reimburse the states 100 percent of the cost of covered services under this expansion.\n\nMany corrections officials have also adopted cost-saving measures, including the use of electronic information and advanced telecommunications technologies to provide long-distance health care services to inmates in remote prisons. \u201cThis strategy can help improve prisoners\u2019 access to primary care doctors and specialists while reducing transportation and guarding expenses,\u201d the report said.\n\nState officials have also contracted with outside organizations and businesses to provide health care services to inmates at lower costs.\n\nRelated: How the Mentally Ill Are Being Warehoused in Prisons\n\nNationwide, prison health care spending totaled $7.7 billion in fiscal 2011, down from the peak of $8.2 billion two years before. California accounted for most of this decline: It decreased its spending by $441 million between fiscal 2009 and 2011, according to the study.\n\n\u201cHealth care and corrections have emerged as fiscal pressure points for states in recent years as rapid spending growth \u2026 has competed for scarce revenues,\u201d the report noted. \u201cAs states work to manage prison health care expenditures, a downturn in spending was a positive development as long as it did not come at the expense of access to quality care.\u201d\n\nBut the report cautions that states \u201ccontinue to face challenges that threaten to drive costs back up,\u201d chiefly the steady aging of the prison population that reflects the graying of the U.S. population. As the number of inmates who have grown old in prison dramatically increased, the cost of treating them has also risen.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2012, the number of state and federal prisoners who were 55 or older increased 204 percent \u2013 from 43,300 to 131,500.\n\nRelated: How Hepatitis C Could Wallop the U.S. in Next Decades\n\nThese older prisoner are prone to chronic physical and mental conditions, including hearing loss, diminished mobility, and dementia. It costs a lot more to treat older prisoners than younger prisoners: The National Institute of Corrections found that the annual cost of incarcerating prisoners age 55 and older with chronic or terminal illness is, on average, two to three times that of all other inmates.\n\nFor example, Vermont\u2019s prison system, with its nearly 12 percent elderly inmates, reported average health spending per inmate at $11,015 between 2007 and 2011. Connecticut, with only 4 percent of its inmates at 55 or older, reported average health spending per inmate at $5,437 during that same period, according to the Pew-MacArthur study.\n\nSome states have embraced medical or geriatric parole policies that would allow the release of older or terminally ill patients. But \u201cstates have released relatively few people\u201d because of narrow eligibility critieria, according to the report. Many older and infirm prisoners, convicted of violent crimes or sentenced as habitual offenders, don\u2019t qualify for parole.\n\n\u201cWhile spending began trending down from its peak in 2009, prison health care continues to pose a fiscal challenge for states,\u201d said Maria Schiff, director of the State Health Care Spending Project, who oversaw the study.\n\nSchiff says a variety of factors affect state-to-state spending comparisons, including the age and health status of prisoners, regional differences in the prices of health care services, and disparities in care quality and health outcomes.\n\n\u201cBecause of these and the absence of measured outcomes, it is important to remember that higher spending is not necessarily an indication of waste, and lower spending not necessarily a sign of efficiency,\u201d she said.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For many years, states faced skyrocketing medical costs to treat inmates, especially as state prison populations rose because of tough sentencing laws.
