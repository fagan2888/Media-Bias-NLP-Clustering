The rapper still played the song in question, though he was ultimately forced to use a 50-piece orchestra in place of Lana Del Rey.\n\nAccording to the folks at Radar Online, no reason was given for the singer\u2019s refusal. Although West tried his best to get her to help out with his proposal, she simply refused to comply with his wishes.\n\n\u201cLana politely declined, and didn\u2019t give any reason for not being able to perform. It was a very firm no from Lana and her camp. Kanye did try to push it, but didn\u2019t get anywhere. Kanye decided to hire an orchestra to perform the song for Kim, and he was much happier with how it turned out,\u201d the anonymous insider dished.\n\nLana Del Rey has yet to comment on the situation as of this writing. Considering it\u2019s been almost two weeks since the proposal, chances are the singer might keep her lips locked on this particular matter.\n\nHowever, you probably shouldn\u2019t spend too much time worrying about West\u2019s feelings on the matter. After all, Kim Kardashian said yes to his marriage proposal. Despite Lana Del Rey\u2019s refusal to perform, everything turned out a-okay.\n\nAccording to The Huffington Post, West admitted that he was a little nervous about what Kim might say when he popped the question. Although she\u2019d already given birth to his child, West wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to walk down the aisle with him.\n\nHe reportedly told Ryan Seacrest:\n\n\u201cI was nervous. I was talking to her cousin. I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, what do you think she\u2019s going to say?\u2019 I\u2019m not arrogant about love and feelings at all. I\u2019m confident in the work I put so much work into, but this is someone else\u2019s feelings. You never know what someone else may feel at the time. I just knew I wanted her to be my girl for a long time.\u201d\n\nIt would appear West\u2019s ability to get what he wants is starting to weaken. Not only did Lana Del Rey turn down a chance to play at his surprise proposal, Vogue magazine also refused to put pictures of North West on the cover. Don\u2019t be too surprised if you catch him performing the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d in the near future.\n\n[Image via Featureflash / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lana Del Rey was originally asked to play her song \"Young and Beautiful\" during Kanye West's surprise engagement to Kim Kardashian.
