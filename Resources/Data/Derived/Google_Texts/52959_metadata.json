CVS Health will also explore enabling MinuteClinic providers to consult with telehealth physicians to expand the scope of care offered at MinuteClinic.\n\nIn addition, MinuteClinic will continue to provide telehealth care to patients in CVS retail stores and will explore serving as a site for in-person exams to facilitate telehealth medical visits.\n\n\"With the increased demand for patient care anticipated in future years as a result of the expansion of coverage through the Affordable Care Act, the primary care physician shortage, aging of the population and epidemic of chronic disease, telehealth gives us the opportunity to offer high quality care to an expanded group of patients in a variety of convenient and cost-effective locations,\" Sussman said.\n\n\"A key pillar of our strategy is forging the right partnerships within the industry,\" said Brian Tilzer, senior vice president and chief digital officer, CVS Health, in a press statement. \"We recognize that some of the best ideas are already being developed, so we're committed to partnering with other companies to explore and expand on these ideas together.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "CVS is working with three telehealth companies -- American Well, Doctor On Demand and Teladoc -- on how, together with pharmacies, they might expand and improve patient care.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "CVS is working with three telehealth companies -- American Well, Doctor On Demand and Teladoc -- on how, together with pharmacies, they might expand and improve patient care.", "title": "CVS Health expands its care reach", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cvs-health-expands-its-care-reach", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/cvs_0.png", "updated_time": "2015-08-27T16:20:33-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/cvs-health-expands-its-care-reach", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/cvs_0.png"}, "description": "CVS is working with three telehealth companies -- American Well, Doctor On Demand and Teladoc -- on how, together with pharmacies, they might expand and improve patient care.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CVS Health expands its care reach"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-27T10:44:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T16:20:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9e8\"", "article_summary": "CVS Health is piloting several telehealth opportunities, including making telehealth physician care accessible through CVS Health digital properties.\n\"In doing so, CVS Health will add value for patients, clients and health plans by improving access to low-cost quality care.\"\nCVS Health will also explore enabling MinuteClinic providers to consult with telehealth physicians to expand the scope of care offered at MinuteClinic.\n\"A key pillar of our strategy is forging the right partnerships within the industry,\" said Brian Tilzer, senior vice president and chief digital officer, CVS Health, in a press statement.\nCVS is working with three telehealth companies -- American Well, Doctor On Demand and Teladoc -- on how, together with pharmacies, they might expand and improve patient care."}
