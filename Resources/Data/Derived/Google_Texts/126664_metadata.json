The exhibit will be controlled from his smartphone.\n\n\"Millennials are engaged every moment with the screen on the phone, the screen on the computer, video games and we feel like this is a long time coming for the world of music production to catch up with the way young people engage art and music,\u201d Afra said.\n\n(Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Sound, image and digital art installations collide in Houston this", "title": "Music, digital art intersect in 'Day for Night' festival in Houston", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/19/Music-digital-art-intersect-Day-Night-festival-Houston", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/houston-festival_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/19/Music-digital-art-intersect-Day-Night-festival-Houston", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/houston-festival_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Sound, image and digital art installations collide in Houston this", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Sound, image and digital art installations collide in Houston this weekend for the Day for Night Festival, which brings together music giants including Kendrick Lamar and visual artists such as Casey Reas.\nWalls of light, animations projected onto buildings and video installations created by award-winning artists connect three performance stages and multiple warehouse galleries.\n\"What we\u2019re trying to do is create an immersive experience where moving throughout the festival grounds is as engaging as standing and staring at the stage,\u201d said Omar Afra, the Day for Night festival producer.\n\"The idea is to create something which is already a visual assault and make it more of a literal visual assault,\u201d Reas said.\n(Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by James Dalgleish)"}
