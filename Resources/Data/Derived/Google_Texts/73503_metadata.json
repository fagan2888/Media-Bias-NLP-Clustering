Dana Perino in a recent appearance on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio program. While promoting her new book, And the Good News is\u2026, Perino was asked to elaborate on her strong feelings about the Senate minority leader. She didn\u2019t hold back.\n\nHewitt noted Reid\u2019s latest offense to decorum occurred when he attempted to give Jeb Bush a compliment after the former Florida governor said that the GOP-led Senate should hastily confirm Loretta Lynch as the next attorney general. In the process of complementing Bush, Reid said that \u201che showed more common sense than his brother showed in eight years as President of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t give a compliment,\u201d Hewitt observed.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an absolutely poisonous figure in Washington, D.C., he\u2019s been a disaster for the country,\u201d Perino shot back. \u201cI think a lot of the dysfunction in Washington can be traced directly to his doorstep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is very good for this country, for the world, and especially for the Democrats that Harry Reid is retiring,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything so abhorrent in my entire life as Harry Reid.\u201d\n\nEven while issuing a stern condemnation, it\u2019s admirable that Perino still refuses to shed her trademark politeness. This was a rather mild condemnation of the Nevada Democrat who reiterated his demand that Mitt Romney release his tax returns in order to disprove his own spurious allegations as recently as two weeks ago.\n\nBut Perino does deserve kudos for dropping the Beltway pretense of cordiality even for those who do not deserve the courtesy.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Deserved.", "title": "Dana Perino unloads on \u2018poisonous,\u2019 \u2018abhorrent,\u2019 \u2018disaster for the country,\u2019 Harry Reid", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/22/dana-perino-unloads-on-poisonous-abhorrent-disaster-for-the-country-harry-reid/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-23T00:01:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-22T20:28:10+00:00"}, "keywords": "Dana Perino, Harry Reid, Hugh Hewitt,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddd82\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s an absolutely poisonous figure in Washington, D.C., he\u2019s been a disaster for the country,\u201d Perino shot back.\nDana Perino unloads on \u2018poisonous,\u2019 \u2018abhorrent,\u2019 \u2018disaster for the country,\u2019 Harry Reidposted at 8:01 pm on April 22, 2015 by Noah RothmanOutgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is a rather despicable figure, and he has determined to use his waning days in Washington to prove that fact.\nBut Perino does deserve kudos for dropping the Beltway pretense of cordiality even for those who do not deserve the courtesy.\nWhile promoting her new book, And the Good News is\u2026, Perino was asked to elaborate on her strong feelings about the Senate minority leader.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything so abhorrent in my entire life as Harry Reid.\u201dEven while issuing a stern condemnation, it\u2019s admirable that Perino still refuses to shed her trademark politeness."}
