The only problem with being governor, he laments, is that sometimes he has to sleep. If powerful Republicans have stymied McAuliffe\u2019s legislative agenda, he takes it in stride. On his overarching goal \u2014 economic development \u2014 the governor pronounces his administration \u201cas wildly successful as anything I could want to do.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s McAuliffe\u2019s own party that has him down.\n\nHe begins carefully \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be overly critical \u2026\u201d \u2014 but then he gets rolling. In a 2014 campaign fought against a backdrop of dropping unemployment and record highs for the Dow, he says there\u2019s no excuse for Democrats to cede the argument on jobs to Republicans. \u201cThey didn\u2019t talk about it!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have a strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy come out and vote for the Democratic Party? There was no message to say: Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. I wish the party or whoever had done a national media campaign and say, here\u2019s what you get when you elect Democrats,\u201d McAuliffe says. \u201cBut there was no \u2014 what was the message out of \u201914? I\u2019m asking you rhetorically \u2014 do you know? No. What was it?\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe, a close friend of Hillary and Bill Clinton, calls it an urgent, hair-on-fire priority for Democrats to learn how to tie together an assertive, socially liberal message with close-to-home concerns about opportunity and economic competitiveness. In 2008, he was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, but says he won\u2019t take a formal role with her 2016 campaign, if she runs, because of his commitments as governor. But he says he talks \u201call the time\u201d with Bill Clinton and would be an enthusiastic \u201cfriend of the family\u201d if and when Hillary Clinton launches her campaign.\n\n\u201cThe biggest issue in this upcoming election, it\u2019s still going to be the economy. It\u2019s going to be this income inequality, the issue of the middle class dropping down,\u201d McAuliffe predicts, with a shot of nostalgia for the 1990s: \u201cI always like to say, Bill Clinton created more millionaires and billionaires than any president, but you know what, more people moved out of poverty. Middle-class income \u2014 all-time high.\u201d\n\nA former Democratic Party chairman, McAuliffe has been thrust into an unexpected role in recent weeks: Less than a year after his swearing-in as governor, he is one of his party\u2019s most senior elected officials outside Washington. This onetime problem-child candidate, battered by opposition researchers for his background as a Beltway operator and his use of political contacts to fuel a lucrative business career, is now one of his party\u2019s last remaining swing-state governors. After a 2014 debacle that nearly took down Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, McAuliffe has become perhaps the most electorally successful Democrat of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nAs such, McAuliffe says, he plans to speak out more aggressively about the future of the Democratic Party. He has burned up the phones over the last week to tell his fellow Democratic governors \u2014 16 so far \u2014 that the party\u2019s message is in dire need of a reboot. Proud of the political formula he has honed in Virginia, the governor plans to visit New Hampshire to deliver a speech urging Democrats to recommit themselves to winning the economic debate.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, that approach was on full display: McAuliffe swept into the small city of Petersburg, visiting eight African-American churches in the span of a few hours (stopping at one church twice, visiting both early and mid-morning services). The governor declared each church to be the finest \u201cin all the globe.\u201d At every stop, he thanked his audience for their support in his 2013 election. He touted his work making it easier for felons to get their voting rights back and scrapping certain testing requirements for schools. Most insistently, McAuliffe advertised his record on economic development: $5 billion in investment deals negotiated so far, handily outstripping his predecessors. \u201cNot that I\u2019m counting,\u201d McAuliffe repeatedly joked.\n\nPetersburg has a special place in McAuliffe\u2019s in-state narrative, furnishing a prime example of how his let\u2019s-make-a-deal approach to the governor\u2019s job has paid dividends. The distressed community here suffered a grievous economic blow in 2013 when the Boehringer Ingelheim Chemicals company announced it would close a plant there and eliminate 240 jobs. This year, McAuliffe persuaded the Chinese company UniTao to buy the facility and reopen it, hiring an estimated 376 employees. (\u201cThere\u2019s not many business folks I can\u2019t pick up the phone, on the globe \u2026 and say here\u2019s why you need to come to Virginia,\u201d he explains in the car. \u201cWe\u2019ve used it extensively.\u201d)\n\nWhat makes McAuliffe\u2019s political story interesting is not merely that he has a good rap on economic development. It\u2019s that he has an economy-tailored sales pitch \u2014 on everything. From gay rights to abortion, to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act and even the unfolding sexual assault crisis at the University of Virginia, for McAuliffe it\u2019s all tied into the economic bottom line.\n\nExtending marriage and adoption rights to gay couples, McAuliffe says, made Virginia \u201copen and welcoming\u201d to big businesses, as well as to families. At a tourism convention in Northern Virginia last week, he bragged to vendors about his record of keeping women\u2019s health centers open. With his eye on taking back the Virginia state Senate in 2015, McAuliffe plans to go after Republicans who have rejected federal health care funds for harming their constituents \u2014 and making their communities unfriendly to economic growth.\n\n\u201cLee County lost their hospital. I\u2019m good at sales. I enjoy it. I can\u2019t bring any businesses there,\u201d McAuliffe says. \u201cDo you think any company from the globe is going to put their manufacturing facility in a county that no longer has a hospital and if some of their workers have a heart attack, they have to get in an ambulance for 80 miles?\u201d\n\nAsked about the recent Rolling Stone magazine article detailing horrific rape allegations at UVA, McAuliffe says has delivered a stern message to the university president, Teresa Sullivan. \u201cShe\u2019d better resolve it,\u201d he says. \u201cTotally unacceptable.\u201d And then \u2014 the business angle.\n\n\u201cI am traveling the globe today and being very successful at bringing businesses in. I need a workforce of the future,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen this affects our prestige university, this affects Virginia. In addition to all of the issues that go with the woman and the sexual assault, you are now hurting Virginia.\u201d\n\nFor Democrats, McAuliffe believes, the party\u2019s national message on the full spectrum of issues must be similarly tied to the bread-and-butter concerns of average Americans. \u201cEverything\u2019s been encapsulated into the jobs argument, but I\u2019ve gotten everything done socially,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, McAuliffe\u2019s playbook has kept him firmly in the good graces of the Democratic base, which applauded his support for gay marriage and adoption rights and his vow to be a \u201cbrick wall\u201d protecting health centers that provide abortions. As he worked the crowd at a series of Baptist churches on Sunday, members of the crowd praised the governor in emphatic terms \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s not a good governor; he\u2019s a great governor,\u201d one man said \u2014 though few named specific accomplishments that earned their admiration.\n\nFor these Democratic constituents, merely the sustained attention from a governor is a welcome change of pace. Introducing McAuliffe at Higher Way Ministries, Petersburg Sheriff Vanessa Crawford drew cheers by asking the crowd: \u201cHow many governors have you known to say \u2018thank you\u2019? Nobody!\u201d Richmond-area radio host Jack Gravely, a parishioner at the nearby Good Shepherd Baptist Church, said he was glad to see McAuliffe tending to his base \u201cafter the whupping that the Democrats took.\u201d\n\nUnlike some other Democrats whom Gravely declined to name, the broadcaster said McAuliffe \u201chasn\u2019t run away from his pedigree, his party or his president.\u201d\n\nVirginia Republicans, for their part, say McAuliffe is something less than an overpowering figure \u2014 a governor whose hopeless crusade for Medicaid expansion has left him with little sway over the Legislature. But, they add, he is no longer a figure to be mocked or dismissed, as many in the GOP once viewed him.\n\nRepublican state Del. Greg Habeeb said the Democratic executive was an abrupt shift from his predecessor, GOP Gov. Bob McDonnell, who was known for his deep relationships in Richmond and his interest in legislative draftsmanship. McAuliffe takes a \u201cwildly different\u201d approach, according to Habeeb, and seems more interested in going it alone on economic development: \u201cI\u2019d say the impression is that he doesn\u2019t want to be governor; he wants to be secretary of commerce.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy perception of him is, he\u2019s a salesman,\u201d Habeeb explained. \u201cThat\u2019s a very valuable role to play. I think it\u2019s less than the governorship can be, but it\u2019s up to every governor how big they want their governorship to be.\u201d\n\nYou look at that Electoral College \u2014 five, six true swing states. We\u2019re one of those. It\u2019s a great state for us, and I will be promoting our two senators very hard to whoever our nominee may be.\n\nFor this particular governor, the role of salesman-in-chief really may be satisfaction enough. McAuliffe bats away the idea that it might be a disappointment for him to finish his term without a landmark legislative achievement, like McDonnell\u2019s transportation package or then-Gov. Mark Warner\u2019s tax deal. If his chief accomplishment is to spur economic growth that offsets painful federal budget cuts, McAuliffe says he\u2019ll be deeply gratified.\n\nAsked if it\u2019s time for a Virginian on the national ticket, he offers an enthusiastic \u201cyes,\u201d citing the state\u2019s two senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner. \u201cYou look at that Electoral College \u2014 five, six true swing states. We\u2019re one of those,\u201d McAuliffe says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great state for us, and I will be promoting our two senators very hard to whoever our nominee may be.\u201d\n\nRight now, McAuliffe seems happy in the job he has. Working the Sunday-morning crowd in Petersburg, he tells worshipers that in his next life he\u2019d like to come back as a pastor, quizzes middle-schoolers on their grades and beams as he recounts a visit to Hampton Roads where he visited 16 churches in a single day. Shedding the note-taking, furrowed-brow persona of his 2013 campaign, McAuliffe and his longtime aide, Secretary of the Commonwealth Levar Stoney, inform a pastor that legendary record producer Quincy Jones once described McAuliffe as \u201cthe blackest white man [he] had ever met.\u201d In one pulpit after another, McAuliffe throws his arms out to the sides and raises his voice to a shout.\n\n\u201cFolks, I\u2019m just starting!\u201d McAuliffe proclaims at Good Shepherd. \u201cThis is just an appetizer!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The GOP has stymied his legislative agenda, but he worries more about his own party.", "title": "Terry McAuliffe is unhappy - with Democrats", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/terry-mcauliffe-democrats-economy-113148.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/24/141124_terry_mcauliffe_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Democrats,Economy,Terry McAuliffe,Virginia,Governors", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The GOP has stymied his legislative agenda, but he worries more about his own party.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "As such, McAuliffe says, he plans to speak out more aggressively about the future of the Democratic Party.\nI wish the party or whoever had done a national media campaign and say, here\u2019s what you get when you elect Democrats,\u201d McAuliffe says.\nPETERSBURG, Va. \u2013 Don\u2019t be fooled by the expansive grin, outstretched arms and the booming baritone with which Terry McAuliffe greets throngs of churchgoers here: The governor of Virginia is frustrated.\nAfter a 2014 debacle that nearly took down Virginia Democratic Sen.
