Our codes of ethics, for example, assume that we can freely choose between right and wrong. In the Christian tradition, this is known as \u201cmoral liberty\u201d\u2014the capacity to discern and pursue the good, instead of merely being compelled by appetites and desires. The great Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant reaffirmed this link between freedom and goodness. If we are not free to choose, he argued, then it would make no sense to say we ought to choose the path of righteousness.\n\nToday, the assumption of free will runs through every aspect of American politics, from welfare provision to criminal law. It permeates the popular culture and underpins the American dream\u2014the belief that anyone can make something of themselves no matter what their start in life. As Barack Obama wrote in The Audacity of Hope, American \u201cvalues are rooted in a basic optimism about life and a faith in free will.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"author": "Ta-Nehisi Coates", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "title": "The Devastating Effects of Concentrated Poverty", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/static/b/theatlantic/img/default-thumbnail.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/personal/archive/2014/04/the-devastating-effects-of-concentrated-poverty/360607/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a86\"", "article_summary": "For centuries, philosophers and theologians have almost unanimously held that civilization as we know it depends on a widespread belief in free will\u2014and that losing this belief could be calamitous.\nToday, the assumption of free will runs through every aspect of American politics, from welfare provision to criminal law.\nIf we are not free to choose, he argued, then it would make no sense to say we ought to choose the path of righteousness.\nAs Barack Obama wrote in The Audacity of Hope, American \u201cvalues are rooted in a basic optimism about life and a faith in free will.\u201d\nOur codes of ethics, for example, assume that we can freely choose between right and wrong."}
