He was apparently pretty good at most of the poses but appeared to be a little shaky on flip dog (a version of downward dog but flipped out) and his shoulders appeared to be stiff in a black T-shirt. He wasn\u2019t a pro, but he wasn\u2019t completely uncoordinated or falling over, either. He put in good effort. Considering his career appears to be unsettled these days as he figures out what\u2019s next, he looked very Zen and sort of smiley. He wore his glasses the entire time. Other Yogis didn\u2019t appear to know who he was and did not crowd him for autographs. Later that evening he fell back into Washington mode and appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Last Word\u201d with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell.\n\nPreaching to the choir on Christopher Hitchens\n\n\u201cJust a hunch, but I think Hitchens would hate being on Upworthy\u201d \u2014 Josh Greenman, New York Daily News opinion editor. See the feature here.\n\nOOPS! Journo puts phone on mute by accident\n\n\u201cThat thing where you forget that you have your phone on mute during a press call and miss your window.\u201d \u2014 Hayes Brown, national security reporter at ThinkProgress.\n\nReporter has witnessed stoners with the munchies at 7-Eleven\n\n\u201cI start work at 3am & have witnessed many stoned folks scarfing 7-11 junk food after consuming. More high stupid people on the roads. Great!\u201d \u2014 WMAL morning show co-host Brian Wilson.\n\nReporter faces Obamacare website nightmare of epic proportions\n\nEx-Politico scribe, freelance journalist and former Obamacare supporter Steve Friess writes a first-person account of his horrible journey through the Affordable Care Act website. The Mirror has no idea how Friess has either not committed a crime or otherwise had a breakdown dealing with this. In the process of trying to obtain healthcare for his husband, Miles, Friess learned that being a reporter in this kind of situation doesn\u2019t mean a whole lot. Especially when dealing with the \u201cPhone People.\u201d Read the full story published in The Daily Caller earlier this week. The lede is perfectly ominous: \u201cAs we hoisted champagne flutes in the first seconds of 2014, my partner and I toasted all the usual things people do as they look ahead to the coming year. Health. Happiness. Love. Optimism. Hope.\u201d\n\nStop the Presses: MSNBC\u2019s Tour\u00e9 has a book recommendation\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come to my attention that some young journos haven\u2019t read Greg Tate\u2019s Flyboy In The Buttermilk. It\u2019s the zenith of music journalism.\u201d \u2014 Tour\u00e9.\n\nSexy Howard Coble shows up in politico\u2019s dream\n\n\u201cDisturbed by the fact that reading Buzzfeed\u2019s sexiest bachelors in Congress piece yesterday caused me to dream of Howard Coble.\u201d \u2014 Liz Mair, former online communications strategist to Sen. Paul, Govs Walker & Perry & Carly Fiorina.\n\nAll positive book reviews. What\u2019s next: No insults? No critiques?\n\n\u201cNot going to name the story (or link to it) that today fails even to include the name of the congressman it is discussing.\u201d \u2014 BuzzFeed Legal Editor Chris Geidner.\n\nTeam Marisa Schultz! The reasonable blonde who wants to help you in the Daily Press Gallery\n\n\u201cHi Colleagues, Friendly reminder that voting for the Standing Committee is happening today in the House Press Gallery until 5:30 p.m. Thanks to those of you who sent kind words and suggestions. I appreciate your interest and hope all of you can cast your votes today. Thanks!
