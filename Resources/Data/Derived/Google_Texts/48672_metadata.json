But according to the IRS\u2019 national taxpayer advocate, the agency is going to be much better at dealing with taxpayers than it was last year.\n\nThis, according to the national taxpayer advocate, Nina Olson. She\u2019s represented the voice of taxpayers to Congress since 2001 in her role heading up the Taxpayer Advocate Service, an independent organization within the IRS.\n\nShe spoke with MarketWatch about her expectations for how the agency can improve in the future, especially with the $290 million in extra funding it received as part of the recently signed Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 (more info on that bill here). That bill included a total of $11.2 billion in fiscal funding for the IRS in 2016.\n\nSome of the IRS\u2019 customer service issues could improve next year, Olson says, because of the additional boost the agency is getting. That money will go toward improving the IRS\u2019 telephone service, cyber security and identity theft issues.\n\n\u201cThe additional funding will be extremely helpful over the next two years,\u201d she told MarketWatch, adding that some taxpayers had their worst tax season to date in 2015.\n\nThough the extra money isn\u2019t likely going to fix things in time for the filing season\u2019s start in January, there should be fewer logistical headaches this year, Olson says. For one, she expects the money to help with things like \u201ccourtesy disconnects,\u201d which is what happens when the IRS switchboard can\u2019t handle the volume of calls and just hangs up on people.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers should see an improvement on the phones sooner rather than later,\u201d Olson said.\n\nMore money, staff and training will go a long way in 2016, she adds, to help combat other issues like folks who overpay the Affordable Care Act penalty for not buying insurance if one can afford it. Olson said most of the 300,000 people last year who overpaid were exempt because of their income. There will sitll be a risk of that in 2016, she notes, despite her office\u2019s work with software providers to give taxpayers clearer warnings.\n\nFraud filters to prevent identity theft won\u2019t be improved yet this year, however, as the IRS already tweaked them in response to this year\u2019s issues. The money will go toward assigning more workers to identity theft cases, Olson says. Doing so \u201cmay be able to reduce cycle time and issue refunds to legitimate taxpayers more quickly.\u201d\n\nIRS service should improve after some saw their \u2018worst tax season,\u2019 advocate says [MarketWatch]", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "application-name": "Consumerist", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Consumerist", "description": "As we approach 2016, taxpayers might be wary of dealing with the Internal Revenue Service after last year\u2019s identity theft problems.
