Washington (CNN) Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Sunday that the likelihood he'll enter the race for the Republican presidential nomination "looks pretty good."

Kasich set up a political action committee to test the waters two weeks ago. He told Fox News' "Fox News Sunday" that he's "not going to be able to raise the kind of money that Jeb Bush is raising, but we want to be able to raise enough that we can be competitive."

"The results here in Ohio give me, I think, a lot of credibility for our team to be able to move forward," he said.

Kasich said he's set to make his third trip to New Hampshire, and he's also visited states like South Carolina that play a key role in the presidential nominating process.
