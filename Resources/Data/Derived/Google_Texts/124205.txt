On Saturday afternoon, the Cameron, Missouri native freshman Taylor Hamilton gave the Missouri Western softball team the spark it needed.

In game one, Hamilton had the biggest hit of the game. With the game tied at 5-5, Hamilton blasted a two-run walkoff over the left field wall to give the Griffons the game one win.

In the second game of the afternoon, Hamilton continued her hot hitting, as she hit two home runs, including the game winner in the sixth inning.

Hamilton's first home run in game two came in the fifth and was the spark the Griffons needed. After her three-run home run, Kailey Green and Katie Klosterman both went yard making it back-to-back-to-back home runs. It's the second time in five days the Griffons pulled off the feat.

Missouri Western returns to action Sunday with two games against Nebraska-Kearnye.
