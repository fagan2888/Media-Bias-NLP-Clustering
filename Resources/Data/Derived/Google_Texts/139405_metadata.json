Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cNo bill, no review. No bill, no oversight. The American people want [Congress] on their behalf to ensure that Iran is accountable.\u201d\u2019\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the leading congressional opponent of talks with Tehran, was the only senator to vote against the bill. The legislation now goes to the House for a vote.\n\nCotton had led a fight to alter the bill, including trying to force a vote on an amendment to make a nuclear deal contingent on Iran entirely ending its nuclear program and another measure\u2014offered by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\u2014requiring Tehran to recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. The Obama administration opposes those provisions, believing they would imperil nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., prevented debate on the amendments for fear they would derail a fragile bipartisan agreement.\n\nIn a statement, Cotton blamed Democrats\u2014not McConnell\u2014for blocking his amendment, saying, \u201cCongress must stand up and protect America from a nuclear Iran, and it\u2019s regrettable that Democratic intransigence blocked our efforts to strengthen this bill.\u201d\n\nThe compromise legislation\u2014a bill Corker negotiated with Democrats and that President Obama supports\u2014would give Congress 30 days to review a nuclear pact with Iran.\n\nDuring that time, Obama would be able to waive sanctions against Iran that were imposed by presidential action but would have to leave in place sanctions that Congress previously levied.\n\nCongress could only offer a resolution disapproving the deal. If the House and Senate could get enough votes to overcome a presidential veto\u2014which is considered doubtful\u2014Obama would have to leave the congressionally mandated sanctions in place.\n\nSome accepted the compromise bill reluctantly, believing that it does not give Congress enough power to actually stop an Iran nuclear deal lawmakers don\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cThe bill in theory gives Congress more leverage to block the Obama administration\u2019s ability to lift congressionally-imposed sanctions on Iran,\u201d said Jim Phillips, an expert on the Middle East at The Heritage Foundation, in an email to The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cBut in practice, it is likely to be little more than a speed bump slowing the administration\u2019s rush to sign a risky nuclear deal with Iran.\u201d\n\nOthers who wanted the bill to have stronger oversight argued that the Iran deal should be handled as a treaty, requiring two-thirds of the Senate to approve it.\n\nHowever, over the last century presidents have often treated deals with foreign countries as executive agreements not subjected to the Constitution\u2019s treaty process.\n\nMichael O\u2019Hanlon, the director of research for the foreign policy program at Brookings Institution, said in an email to The Daily Signal that the compromise legislation should be enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not inappropriate for Congress to have some say\u2014as long as it stops short of a completely equal role as negotiator in the process, since we can only have one negotiator and that\u2019s the executive branch prerogative,\u201d O\u2019Hanlon said. \u201cSo, at least, it would seem to strike a reasonable balance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill Thursday to give Congress at least some voice over a proposed nuclear deal with Iran.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill Thursday to give Congress at least some voice over a proposed nuclear deal with Iran.", "title": "Senate Votes to Give Congress Review Over Iran Nuclear Deal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IranReviewFeat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-08T09:36:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1csE2AI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill Thursday to give Congress at least some voice over a proposed nuclear deal with Iran.", "title": "Senate Votes to Give Congress Review Over Iran Nuclear Deal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IranReviewFeat.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-05-07T18:02:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T09:36:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iran, nuclear deal, Bob Corker, Ben Cardin, Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, Tehran, Ted Cruz"}, "article_summary": "The Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill Thursday to give Congress at least some voice over a proposed nuclear deal with Iran.\nSome accepted the compromise bill reluctantly, believing that it does not give Congress enough power to actually stop an Iran nuclear deal lawmakers don\u2019t like.\n\u201cWithout this bill, there is no review,\u201d said Sen.
