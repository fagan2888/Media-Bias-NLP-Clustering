Nevertheless, the supply of organs \u2014 donated by living and deceased donors \u2014 will fall short of the number of patients added last year to the transplant waiting lists.\n\nWith the persistent shortage, there are those who would seek to increase the organs available for transplantation by providing financial incentives as a motivation for organ donation. These financial incentives would represent a monetary gain or \u201cvaluable consideration,\u201d and are currently prohibited by the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) to buy and sell organs.\n\nThe financial incentives (valuable consideration) proposed include a contribution to the donor\u2019s retirement fund, an income tax credit or a tuition voucher or global health insurance. Even though cash would not be exchanged, these incentives have a monetary value and target individuals who otherwise would not have these resources/finances, for example, to secure their retirement or those not qualifying for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFor those who are enticed by such incentives, they would simply be trading the commodity they have (a kidney) for a commodity they need (a mortgage payment or health insurance). One in seven people in the United States live below the poverty line. The target group of donors/vendors becomes inescapable, it becomes the economically distressed to supply organs for transplantation.\n\nEvery other country in the world has wrestled with the dilemma of targeting the poor to be the source of organs by such incentives, and other than Iran (whose professionals now regret such a policy) every country will not permit such financial incentives.\n\nThe World Health Organization rejects a system that would foster a social stratification in obtaining organs for transplantation. The WHO Guiding Principles of Organ Donation and Transplantation states clearly that \u201ccells, tissues and organs should only be donated freely, without any monetary payment or other reward of monetary value. Purchasing, or offering to purchase, cells, tissues or organs for transplantation, or their sale by living persons or by the next of kin for deceased persons, should be banned.\u201d\n\nHowever this WHO Principle emphasizes that \u201cthe prohibition on sale or purchase of cells, tissues and organs does not preclude reimbursing reasonable and verifiable expenses incurred by the donor, including loss of income, or paying the costs of recovering, processing, preserving and supplying human cells, tissues or organs for transplantation.\u201d\n\nMaking reimbursement available for the actual costs or losses incurred, regardless of donors\u2019 financial resources, would not enrich donors but merely make donating a kidney a financially neutral act. Since covering expenses results in neither a better \u2014 nor worse \u2014 financial situation for the donor, there would be no need to modify NOTA\u2019s prohibition on paying for organs to assure coverage of donor costs.\n\nThe Declaration of Istanbul calls for the provision of health care for the living donor \u2014 but importantly related to the donation act of kidney removal.\n\nDespite the Affordable Care Act, approximately 10 percent of Americans do not have health insurance. The financial neutrality components would include coverage of the cost for the annual follow-up visits for the kidney donor to include: blood pressure, physical examination, assessment of renal function, urinalysis, and assessment for diabetes or any other medical condition; but not by a health insurance package that would cover the cost of care for example of a malignancy during the rest of the donor\u2019s lifetime or for trauma care following a motor vehicle accident.\n\nIf a donor\u2019s medical insurance does not provide lifelong medical follow-up and treatment of any conditions related to the nephrectomy or if the donor\u2019s health insurance leaves the donor responsible to pay for a portion such care, those costs should be covered. Donors should also be provided with life insurance to cover death as a result of being a living donor. Interval (perhaps in some instances becoming annual) exams that are covered for the donor should enable the collection of data that determine what remains an unknown lifetime risk of kidney failure and it would also provide the opportunity to treat the donor if kidney disease is developing in the donor.\n\nThus far, the government has not supported the provision of financial incentives as a motivation for organ donation \u2014 presumably because it does not want to be responsible for placing anyone at risk of kidney failure in their life time \u2014 as a result of being a donor.\n\nBut we can all agree that a program of financial neutrality that provides care for the donor is an ethically proper approach for those who wish to be a donor. Otherwise the stale arguments that have been a point and counterpoint in the debate of financial incentives are going nowhere for the help of donors and the needs of the patients that would benefit from organ transplants.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editor's Note: For an alternative viewpoint, see: Counterpoint: Changes Are Needed in Organ Donation It is encouraging to note data from the United Network", "og": {"site_name": "InsideSources", "description": "Editor's Note: For an alternative viewpoint, see: Counterpoint: Changes Are Needed in Organ Donation It is encouraging to note data from the United Network", "title": "Point: Living Organ Donation Should Elicit Care for the Donor and Be a Financially Neutral Act \u2013 InsideSources", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bigstock-heart-monitor-in-surgery-100438928.jpg", "url": "http://www.insidesources.com/living-organ-donation-should-elicit-care-for-the-donor-and-be-a-financially-neutral-act/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Editor's Note: For an alternative viewpoint, see: Counterpoint: Changes Are Needed in Organ Donation It is encouraging to note data from the United Network", "creator": "@InsideSourcesDC", "image": "http://www.insidesources.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bigstock-heart-monitor-in-surgery-100438928.jpg", "title": "Point: Living Organ Donation Should Elicit Care for the Donor and Be a Financially Neutral Act \u2013 InsideSources", "site": "@InsideSourcesDC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.insidesources.com", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-01-24T12:29:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Declaration of Istanbul calls for the provision of health care for the living donor \u2014 but importantly related to the donation act of kidney removal.\nDespite the Affordable Care Act, approximately 10 percent of Americans do not have health insurance.\nWith the persistent shortage, there are those who would seek to increase the organs available for transplantation by providing financial incentives as a motivation for organ donation.\nThese financial incentives would represent a monetary gain or \u201cvaluable consideration,\u201d and are currently prohibited by the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 (NOTA) to buy and sell organs.\nThe financial incentives (valuable consideration) proposed include a contribution to the donor\u2019s retirement fund, an income tax credit or a tuition voucher or global health insurance."}
