Furthermore, Reid argues the Kochs are really trying to \"buy\" elections to advance their self-serving corporate interests of lower taxes and less regulation.\n\nIn this cycle, the brothers have already given a reported $30 million to nonprofits such as Americans for Prosperity to help pay for attack ads on ObamaCare and against incumbent Senate Democrats, as they try to defend their party\u2019s six-seat majority in the upper chamber in an increasingly tough political environment.\n\nThe group has already spent a reported $700,000 in ads against Arkansas Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor, who is trailing challenger and Arkansas GOP Rep. Tom Cotton by 3 percentage points, according to an averaging of polls by nonpartisan RealClearPolitics.com\n\nThe Koch-backed attacks have also extended into a money war with the pro-Democrat group Senate Majority PAC, which spent a reported $3 million on ads on tough Senate races in Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan and North Carolina and drew a sharp response.\n\nOn Friday, Philip Ellender of Koch Industries told Politico the ads marked \u201cthe latest round in a series of attacks and attempts to silence private citizens who dare to disagree with the policies of the Majority Leader and the [Obama] administration.\u201d\n\nEllender also said Reid specifically has decided to focus on \u201cintimidating political opposition and squelching dissent,\u201d instead of creating jobs and improving the lives of Americans.\n\nRepublicans, though, are hardly the only ones benefiting from the political spending of well-heeled backers.\n\nFormer hedge fund manager and California billionaire Tom Steyer reportedly is planning to spend at least $100 million (half of it his own money) on attack ads this year against candidates who aren\u2019t supporting efforts to address climate change.\n\nAnd until recently, even some moderate Senate Democrats were enjoying donations from the Koch brothers\u2019 political action committee. But as that money shifted directions, Democrats stopped holding their tongues.\n\nCharles Koch, 78, and David Koch, 73, inherited a small oil company from their father. They expanded worldwide into chemicals, textiles, paper and other products, building a hugely profitable and privately held conglomerate.\n\nLong active in conservative politics, they seized on the 2010 Citizens United court ruling that allows unlimited corporate spending on political campaigns, often without disclosing donors. They helped found Americans for Prosperity, which reported spending $122 million on elections in 2012. In addition, Charles Koch helped start the Washington-based Cato Institute in the late 1970s. The family has given millions to the Libertarian-minded think tank over the years but was involved in a public dispute with leaders several years ago.\n\nAs part of the Democratic offensive this year against the brothers, and the apparent attempt to keep criticism about them in the news cycle, Reid and fellow Senate leaders last week suggested the brothers are behind congressional Republicans agreeing to support a Ukraine aid package only in exchange for delays in IRS rules that would impact the political activities of nonprofits like Americans for Prosperity.\n\nReid returned to the Senate floor last week to say that when Republican senators rush to defend the Koch brothers, they are also defending the brothers\u2019 \u201cradical philosophy.\u201d\n\nHe challenged Republicans by asking, \u201cIs even one of you willing to stand up and disavow the Koch brothers\u2019 radical agenda?\u201d\n\nLouisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter has publicly defended the brothers, saying at a recent town hall meeting that they are \u201ctwo of the most patriotic Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod bless the Koch brothers,\" said Vitter, according to YouTube video posted by trackers American Bridge. \u201cThey\u2019re fighting for our freedom.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata":
