By 2:30 p.m., the water level on Bear Creek in town had begun to recede, officials said.\n\nStill, just the mention of the dam\u2014 and the inevitable rumors that followed \u2014 meant residents faced decisions about whether to stay or go, what to take and leave, and exit routes.\n\n\u201cWith an evacuation, if you don\u2019t go and it\u2019s no big deal, I guess you\u2019ve won,\u201d said Mark Flanagan, owner of Red Rocks Cyclery on Bear Creek Avenue. \u201cBut if you stay behind and get stuck \u2026\u201d\n\nFlanagan was considering loading up bikes and gear to ferry out. A half-hour later, his \u201cOpen\u201d sign had gone dark.\n\nRandy LaLene, 49, was awoken at 3 a.m. by police pounding on his door telling him to evacuate.\n\nHe lives in what locals call \u201cThe Morrison Compound\u201d on the creek. Residents live communally, reaching decisions by committee.\n\nWhile his neighbors chose to heed the voluntary evacuation order, LaLene stayed to deter burglars. He also marked a rock in the river at 3 a.m. to monitor the water\u2019s rise. It had not risen any Friday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they were jumping the gun at all,\u201d LaLene said. \u201cThe river\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, a deep rumbling could be heard \u2014 boulders rolling like marbles at the bottom of the swollen creekbed.\n\nGus Chambers, a local surveyor, said officials were concerned that if the water continued to rise, debris might break a sewer pipe suspended below a bridge and send raw sewage into the creek.\n\nSome downtown merchants closed as a precaution.\n\nAt Tony Rigatoni\u2019s Italian Kitchen, patrons on a damp rooftop patio drank cans of Dale\u2019s Pale Ale. Owner Reza Ardehali said he owed it to employees to stay open because they depend on their paychecks.\n\nThe sun was out. This worried Ardehali, who did not want to be lulled into feeling safe, not with the earlier warnings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those days,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here 23 years. We\u2019ve never had anything like this. This is unimaginable.\u201d\n\nEric Gorski: 303-954-1971, egorksi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/egorksi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Four evacuated in Morrison, dam upstream deemed sound", "title": "Four evacuated in Morrison, dam upstream deemed sound", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/13/four-evacuated-in-morrison-dam-upstream-deemed-sound/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914__morrison-colorado-floodingp1.jpg", "height": 408}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914__morrison-colorado-floodingp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-13T11:21:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:10:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "By 2:30 p.m., the water level on Bear Creek in town had begun to recede, officials said.\nMORRISON \u2014 Swollen Bear Creek surged above normal levels here Friday, prompting the evacuation of four homes and causing town officials to keep a wary eye on Evergreen Dam some 11 miles upstream.\nThose fears were eased Friday afternoon when the Jefferson County Incident Management Team announced engineers had inspected the dam and deemed it structurally sound.\n\u201cWith an evacuation, if you don\u2019t go and it\u2019s no big deal, I guess you\u2019ve won,\u201d said Mark Flanagan, owner of Red Rocks Cyclery on Bear Creek Avenue.\nWhile his neighbors chose to heed the voluntary evacuation order, LaLene stayed to deter burglars."}
