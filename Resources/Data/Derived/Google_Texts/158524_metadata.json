James Lankford, R-Okla., isn\u2019t just moving out, he\u2019s moving up \u2013 all the way up to the Senate.\n\nAs a conservative on the rise, his opinion is in increasing demand, and the Oklahoman was repeatedly grilled on national television the day before as to whether the GOP would be willing to risk a government shutdown to stop a presidential executive order granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nIn an interview with WND, Lankford presented an intriguing alternative scenario in which a shutdown may not be even necessary, making talk of it premature.\n\nHe suggested President Obama\u2019s executive order could turn out to be more talk than action and might have very little actual effect on immigration policy.\n\n\u201cMy suspicion on this is the president is going to cobble together a bunch of stuff they\u2019ve already done. They are going to change titles and some things and find a way to make this look like a big package. He doesn\u2019t have the legislative authority, actually, to make a lot of decisions. He\u2019s done executive orders in the past that have had big titles but didn\u2019t actually make big changes,\u201d the senator-elect told WND.\n\nAnd, in that case, he said a shutdown would be a massive overreaction.\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019ll see what this is,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m kind of keeping my powder dry until I see exactly what this is.\u201d\n\nLankford also implied the GOP may have a secret weapon in the battle to stop amnesty: Democrat voters.\n\nHe noted that any unilateral move by the president to grant amnesty is unpopular with most voters. In fact, an exit poll showed 74 percent of voters would disapprove of it.\n\nAnd if it is unpopular with two-thirds of voters, that means it is unpopular with Democratic voters as well.\n\nThat means amnesty is cause for Democrats in elected office to be wary, too.\n\nLankford mentioned an untold story, so far, was how many Democratic lawmakers were \u201cvery nervous\u201d over the prospect of a voter backlash among their supporters over amnesty, especially after the landslide that just gave the GOP control of the Senate.\n\nThat\u2019s why, before even discussing a shutdown, the GOP is hoping public opinion will persuade Democrat lawmakers, and perhaps even the president, to change their minds.\n\nSome conservatives see a shutdown as the only option to stop amnesty, if Obama does issue an executive order. GOP leaders are particularly wary that the public would blame Republicans.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Congress could send the president a series of short-term spending measures, called continuing resolutions, or CRs, before a Dec. 11 deadline. The CRs could fund everything but the tools he would need to implement amnesty, perhaps including such things as the printing millions of new Social Security cards.\n\nIf Obama refused to sign such bills, the government would then be unfunded after Dec. 11 until either the president or Congress changed course.\n\nThe GOP was blamed by the mainstream media over the 15-day government shutdown in the fight to stop Obamacare in 2013. But the GOP then went on to a huge election victory in 2014.\n\nSo, WND asked Lankford, what was the political risk of another shutdown, if it was that important to stop amnesty?\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t see the budget connection to this (amnesty). So, that will be difficult, just convincing people why you need a government shutdown to deal with it,\u201d he replied, while noting it was an easier connection for voters to make in the Clinton presidency when the issue was welfare reform.\n\n\u201cPeople understood how shutdowns were connected to that issue \u2013 it was entitlement reform and budget related.\u201d\n\nSoon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has flatly said there will be no shutdown this year.\n\nRep. Steve King, R-Iowa, said he did not think a shutdown should be taken off the table.\n\nWhen asked if GOP leaders would back efforts to use CRs to stop amnesty, risking a shutdown, Lankford succinctly replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. We\u2019re about to find out.\u201d\n\nWhile Lankford wants Obama to show his cards before the GOP reacts, Republicans may have an important ace up their sleeves: public opinion.\n\n\u201cThe president, in whatever he proposes, doesn\u2019t have full public support. If he had full public support, we would have already passed something, because people would have risen up and said this is what we want. But that\u2019s not where people are,\u201d said Lankford.\n\nHe said it was significant to note, \u201cWhen Oregon votes and says we don\u2019t want illegal driver\u2019s licenses, its pretty clear that the American people are not opposed to immigration. They are opposed to illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nThe senator-elect also pointed out the irony in Democrats\u2019 unwillingness to see what was good for the goose as good for the gander.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told some of my Democratic colleagues, tell you what, when the next Republican president comes in, he\u2019ll just give amnesty to everyone on Obamacare, and just do a unilateral waive and say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to enforce the individual mandate, I\u2019m not going to enforce anything on businesses, I have that authority, is that OK?'\u201d Lankford said with a mischievous smile.\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd, of course, they all say, \u2018No, that\u2019s not OK.\u2019 Because, of course, they want to protect Obamacare. So why is it suddenly OK with amnesty? The president can\u2019t just wave a wand and ignore the law and just change it unilaterally. It\u2019s not legal.\u201d\n\nFollow Garth Kant @DCgarth", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The walls were bare and the office was in boxes, but Rep.
