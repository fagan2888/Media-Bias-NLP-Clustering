Behind the scenes at the University of Miami’s Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, two top physicians feuded so badly over just about everything that a "personality coach" was hired to try to soothe tensions.

But as the Miami Herald reports, the two stars couldn’t coexist; and after one of the doctors left Bascom Palmer, he turned in the other over allegations of Medicare fraud.

Surgeon Timothy Murray left the hospital two years ago, after a bitter feud with Dr. Philip Rosenfeld, a retinal specialist, the Herald reports. Documents show that Rosenfeld reviewed Murray’s files after he left, and claims that Murray and the hospital incorrectly charged Medicare.

The claims, lawyers for Bascom Palmer and Murray told the Herald, are a “high-end medicine dispute” between the two physicians.
