A number of countries in the region, including Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines are likewise embroiled in disputes over islands and their surrounding waters.\n\nThe deployment occurred at the same time President Obama was hosting leaders of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) at a summit in Sunnylands, Calif. One of the biggest topics on the agenda, besides the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, was disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Weapons Sale to Iran Shifts the Balance of Mideast Power\n\nObama pressed for a \"halt to reclamation, new construction and militarization\" of Asia's oceans during a press conference marking the end of the summit on Tuesday. The remark was an indirect reference to China's construction of airstrips and ports in the Spratly Islands that could have military uses.\n\nSatellite images suggest that Beijing has sent at least four HQ-9 systems to Woody Island. Each is capable of carrying eight missiles, which U.S. officials estimate have a range of up to 125 miles, making them a serious threat to any airplanes flying nearby.\n\nNews of the deployment somewhat mirrors a move China made in 2011 when Beijing conducted the first test flight of its stealth fighter just hours before then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates sat down with the country\u2019s president. The test upstaged Gates\u2019s visit and threatened to derail relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nRelated: Stealth Wars: China Rolls Out a New J-20, Another Knockoff Fighter\n\nHowever, the latest incident appears much more deliberate: The HQ-9 deployment was to the same island chain where a U.S. Navy destroyer sailed close to another contested island a few weeks ago. Chinese officials vowed \u201cconsequences\u201d for the action. This might be it.\n\nWhite House and Defense Department officials no doubt will huddle in the days ahead to sort out how best to respond to the missile defense system\u2019s deployment.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chair John McCain (R-AZ) said the U.S. \u201cshould consider additional options to raise the costs on Beijing's behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeclarations that we remain committed to what amounts to an ever-changing status quo and conducting occasional freedom of navigation operations are inadequate,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe day-to-day system management that is required to actually shape Beijing's actions will mean adopting policies with a level of risk that we have been unwilling to consider up to this point.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "China has deployed an advanced surface-to-air-missile system to one of the disputed islands in the South China Sea, a move that is sure to inflame tensions in the region and impact Washington\u2019s relationship with Beijing.", "title": "Chinese Missiles Ratchet Up a Dangerous Game in the South China Sea", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/17/Chinese-Missiles-Ratchet-Dangerous-Game-South-China-Sea", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southchinasea-india-usa_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/17/Chinese-Missiles-Ratchet-Dangerous-Game-South-China-Sea", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southchinasea-india-usa_4.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "China has deployed an advanced surface-to-air-missile system to one of the disputed islands in the South China Sea, a move that is sure to inflame tensions in the region and impact Washington\u2019s relationship with Beijing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "China has deployed an advanced surface-to-air-missile system to one of the disputed islands in the South China Sea, a move sure to ratchet up tensions in the region and have an impact on Washington\u2019s relationship with Beijing.\nSatellite images suggest that Beijing has sent at least four HQ-9 systems to Woody Island.\nOn Tuesday, Fox News reported that Imagesat International satellite imagery showed that China had deployed HQ-9 SAMs to Woody Island, part of the Paracel Island archipelago, possibly on or around Feb. 14.\nWhite House and Defense Department officials no doubt will huddle in the days ahead to sort out how best to respond to the missile defense system\u2019s deployment.\nThe deployment occurred at the same time President Obama was hosting leaders of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) at a summit in Sunnylands, Calif.
