And the state of this presidency is spent.\n\nThe signs of intellectual exhaustion were everywhere. Consider just three. After taking credit for success in Syria, raising American stature abroad and prevailing against the Islamic State \u2014 one claim more surreal than the next \u2014 Obama was forced to repair to his most well-worn talking point: \u201cIf you doubt America\u2019s commitment \u2014 or mine \u2014 to see that justice is done, just ask Osama bin Laden.\u201d\n\nReally? Five years later, that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got?\n\nIndeed, it is. What else can Obama say? Talk about Crimea? Cite Yemen, Libya, Iraq, the South China Sea, the return of the Taliban?\n\n\u201cSurveys show our standing around the world is higher than when I was elected to this office,\u201d Obama boasted. Surveys, mind you. As if superpower influence is a Miss Universe contest. As if the world doesn\u2019t see our allies adrift, our enemies on the march and our sailors kneeling, hands behind their heads, in front of armed Iranians, then forced to apologize on camera. (And our secretary of state expressing appreciation to Iran after their subsequent release.)\n\nOn the domestic side, Obama\u2019s agenda was fairly short, in keeping with his lame-duck status. It was still startling when he worked up a passion for a great \u201cnew moonshot\u201d: curing cancer.\n\nIs there a more hackneyed national-greatness cliche than the idea that if we can walk on the moon? Or a more hackneyed facsimile of vision than being \u201cthe nation that cures cancer\u201d? Do Obama\u2019s speechwriters not know that it was Richard Nixon who first declared a war on cancer \u2014 in 1971?\n\nBut to see just how bare is the cupboard of ideas of the nation\u2019s most vaunted liberal visionary, we had to wait for the stunning anachronism that was the speech finale. It was designed for inspiration and uplift. And for some liberal observers, it actually worked. They were thrilled by the soaring tones as Obama called for, yes, a new politics \u2014 a post-partisan spirit of mutual understanding, rational discourse and respect for one\u2019s opponents.\n\nWhy, it was hope and change all over again. You\u2019d have thought we were back in 2008 with Obama\u2019s moving, stirring promise of a new and higher politics that had young people swooning in the aisles and a TV anchor thrilling up the leg \u2014 and gave Obama the White House.\n\nOr even further back to 2004, when Obama electrified the nation with his Democratic convention speech: \u201cThere\u2019s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America: There\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d\n\nTuesday night, Obama did an undisguised, almost phrase-for-phrase reprise of that old promise. Earnestly, he urged us to \u201csee ourselves not, first and foremost, as black or white, or Asian or Latino, not as gay or straight, immigrant or native born, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans first.\u201d\n\nOn cue, various commentators were moved by this sermon summoning our better angels. Good grief. I can understand falling for this 12 years ago. But now? A cheap self-quotation, a rhetorical mulligan, from a man who had two presidential terms to act on that transformative vision and instead gave us the most divisive, partisan, tendentious presidency since Nixon.\n\nRational discourse and respect for one\u2019s opponents? This is a man who campaigned up and down the country throughout 2011 and 2012 saying that he cares about posterity, Republicans only about power.\n\nThe man who accused opponents of his Iran treaty of \u201cmaking common cause\u201d with Iranians \u201cchanting death to America.\u201d\n\nThe man who, after Paul Ryan proposed a courageous, controversial entitlement reform, gave a presidential address \u2014 with Ryan, invited by the White House, seated in the first row \u2014 calling his ideas un-American.\n\nIn a final touch of irony, Obama included in his wistful rediscovery of a more elevated politics an expression of reverence for, of all things, how \u201cour founders distributed power between \u2026 branches of government.\u201d This after years of repeatedly usurping Congress\u2019 legislative power with unilateral executive orders and regulations on everything from criminal justice to climate change to immigration \u2014 already halted by the courts.\n\nThere is wisdom to the 22nd Amendment. After two terms, presidents are spent. Nothing shows it like a State of the Union valedictory repeating the hollow promises of the yesteryear candidate \u2014 as if the intervening presidency had never occurred.\n\nCharles Krauthammer is a columnist for The Washington Post.
