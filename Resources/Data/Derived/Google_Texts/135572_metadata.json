If you're working, watch your mailbox or your email for details on how to buy it through the new health care marketplace.\n\nUnder the new Affordable Care Act, companies must notify their employees by Oct. 1 that they can buy health insurance through health care exchanges or, as they're now known, the health insurance \"marketplace.\"\n\nEven though companies have until 2015 to provide health care or pay penalties, they still have to provide the notices to employees, said Michael Abbott, an employment lawyer who specializes in employee benefits at Gardere in Houston.\n\nAbbott said his clients are surprised to hear about the notification requirement.\n\nThey figure that with the year delay in providing coverage that they didn't have to do that, he said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor has a sample letter that companies can use that spells out the marketplace's \"one-stop shopping\" to compare health insurance plans.\n\nThe notice also explains that participants in the exchanges may be eligible for a tax credit that would lower their monthly premiums. However, the tax credit is available only to those whose employers do not offer health insurance that meets \"minimum value\" standards or costs more than 9.5 percent of the employee's household income.\n\nAnd those who buy from the marketplace face another hurdle: a big tax bill. Participants have to use after-tax dollars to buy coverage, according to the notice.\n\nCurrently, both the employer and employee contributions to health care plans are typically excluded from federal income taxes.\n\nThe disclosure rule applies to companies with just one employee, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. As long as they're covered under the federal law that governs minimum wage and overtime rules - the Fair Labor Standards Act -companies have to send their employees the notice.\n\nJesse Gelsomini, an employment lawyer who specializes in employee benefits at Haynes and Boone in Houston, has been fielding questions from clients.\n\nOne frequent question: Do companies have to distribute the notice in Spanish?\n\nGelsomini said there is no formal requirement, but if Spanish-speaking employees have any questions, the notice should include the name of a Spanish-speaking human resources representative who can help.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Even though companies have until 2015 to provide health care or pay penalties, they still have to provide the notices to employees, said Michael Abbott, an employment lawyer who specializes in employee benefits at Gardere in Houston.
