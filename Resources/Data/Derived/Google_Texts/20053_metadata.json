Health care costs are increasing, but competition for insurance plan customers means populous Chicago is bucking the trend, said Marc Pierce of Stonegate Advisors, a Chicago-based independent consulting company that conducted the analysis.\n\nThe law requires most people to have health insurance, and the fine for not having it is going up next year to $325 per adult\u2014or 2 percent of household income, whichever is greater.\n\nRelated:\n\n\u2022 Here's why Chicago small-business owners aren't satisfied with the Affordable Care Act\n\n\u2022 Obamacare enrollment erroneously inflated\n\n\n\n\"Almost every one of my clients got an increase of some sort,\" said Jamie Simmons, an insurance broker in the southern Illinois city of Carterville. \"Several people have said, 'I'm going to drop it and pay the fine.'\"\n\nThe Stonegate analysts ran numbers and repeated scenarios they used last year when they did a similar study for the AP. Stonegate conducts research for insurers and benefits managers.\n\nEXAMPLES\n\nThe analysis looked at the average monthly costs for three hypothetical households buying bronze or silver plans, the most popular choices, with costs adjusted to include available tax credits or subsidies.\n\nIt found that for a single, 30-year-old fast-food cook making $18,000 a year, a bronze plan would cost an average of $66 a month and a silver plan $111 a month in Chicago. In Springfield, the fast-food cook could get a bronze plan for $52 a month or a silver for $106 a month. In Belleville, the cost would be $46 monthly for a bronze or $93 for a silver.\n\nA 50-year-old preschool teacher making $30,000 a year could expect to pay $210 monthly for a bronze plan or $281 a month for a silver plan in Chicago. In Springfield, a bronze plan would cost $188 a month and a silver $274. In Belleville, the prices would be $180 for a bronze or $254 for a silver.\n\nFor a family\u2014a 40-year-old freelance writer making $60,000 a year with a stay-at-home spouse and two children\u2014the cost would be $413 a month for a bronze plan or $565 a month for a silver plan in Chicago.
