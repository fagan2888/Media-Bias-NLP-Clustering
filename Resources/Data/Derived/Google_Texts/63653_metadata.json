Bush in 2005 and confirmed by a Republican-led Senate, has been criticized by conservatives for his rulings in favor of key parts of Obamacare. With Republicans seemingly set to hold up President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, the party\u2019s candidates are sparring over ties to the chief justice.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFront-runner Donald Trump criticized Jeb Bush and Sen. Ted Cruz, who was Texas' solicitor general at the time, for pushing Roberts' nomination.

He got there because Ted Cruz pushed him like wild. And by the way, Jeb Bush pushed him through the brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have Obamacare because of Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and George Bush,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCruz backed away from his support of Roberts on the same program.\n\n\u201cListen, No. 1, I did not appoint John Roberts. George W. Bush did,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cNow, once the president made the appointment, I supported that nomination. That was a mistake.\u201d\n\nBut Jeb Bush stuck with the high court\u2019s top judge despite the rulings on the health care law.\n\n\u201cJohn Roberts, I think, can be a defended choice for sure,\u201d Bush said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThe Obamacare decision I was disappointed in, but he\u2019s made some really good rulings beyond that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Amid the discussion of Antonin Scalia, another Republican appointee is debated.", "title": "GOP candidates spar over Chief Justice Roberts", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/scalia-roberts-supreme-court-justices-219284", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/01/141201_john_roberts_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Amid the discussion of Antonin Scalia, another Republican appointee is debated.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| AP Photo GOP candidates spar over Chief Justice RobertsSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Sunday found himself in the center of a debate among Republican White House hopefuls who warned about future picks for the high court drifting to the left.\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is a point of contention between GOP candidates.\nWith Republicans seemingly set to hold up President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, the party\u2019s candidates are sparring over ties to the chief justice.\nAnd by the way, Jeb Bush pushed him through the brother.\u201d\u201cWe have Obamacare because of Ted Cruz, Jeb Bush and George Bush,\u201d Trump said.\nThat was a mistake.\u201dBut Jeb Bush stuck with the high court\u2019s top judge despite the rulings on the health care law."}
