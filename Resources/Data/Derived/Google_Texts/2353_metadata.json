Bill Cassidy (R-LA) introduced legislation that would give Americans an alternative to Obamacare.\n\nThe bill would coexist with \u2014 rather than replace \u2014 the Affordable Care Act and modify components of the current system.\n\nHouse GOP leaders have continually vowed to replace the ACA if they put a Republican in the White House this fall.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nUnder the plan, every adult in the U.S. would receive a $2,500 tax credit to buy health coverage. Families would get an additional $1,500 for each dependent.\n\nThe new benefit would replace the tax breaks currently tied to employer health coverage and could be assigned to an employer, transferred to a Roth health savings account or advanced for annual distribution.\n\n\u201cThis plan offers a unique, free-marketplace alternative that unleashes doctors, patients, and all individuals from the constraints of Obamacare, and gives them the opportunity to be in charge of their own healthcare,\u201d Sessions said in a press release.\n\nRepublicans have long sought to revamp the healthcare system through modifications in the tax code, the Los Angeles Times noted.\n\nCurrently, health benefits aren\u2019t subject to income taxes, meaning higher-paid employees with comprehensive health plans often reap much higher tax benefits than lower-paid workers without insurance. The proposed tax credit would level the playing field by extending to people who don\u2019t have work-based coverage.\n\nThe measure comes at a time when a task force under the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is gearing up to unveil an ACA replacement plan. As The Hill reported, the GOP plans are not meant to compete with one another.\n\nFor those of you keeping score at home like Huffington Post's Jeffrey Young, such plans has long been in the works.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nLos Angeles Times: As Republicans look for an Obamacare replacement, two GOP lawmakers make their own bid", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "medium": "news", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-health-law", "description": "Healthcare", "category": "News Post", "title": "Lawmakers pitch Obamacare alternative", "pub_date": "may 20, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-20T21:37:31", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, May 20, 2016, 09:37 PM", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/ff/ec/ffecfa0498c34f04d13d6e0373860f10.jpg", "news_keywords": "Payer,Health Law", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-05-08T21:37:31", "teaser": "<p>Every U.S. adult would get a $2,500 tax credit to purchase health insurance under the proposal.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-05-20", "sailthru.description": "Every U.S. adult would get a $2,500 tax credit to purchase health insurance under the proposal.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Every U.S. adult would get a $2,500 tax credit to purchase health insurance under the proposal.", "title": "Lawmakers pitch Obamacare alternative", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/lawmakers-pitch-obamacare-alternative/419548/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Fotolia_42366545_Subscription_Monthly_M_2I1ItDd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/43/cc/43cc1b8e5db9c0a51a353371f596cd00.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingLos Angeles Times: As Republicans look for an Obamacare replacement, two GOP lawmakers make their own bid\nHouse GOP leaders have continually vowed to replace the ACA if they put a Republican in the White House this fall.\nDive Brief:On Thursday, House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions (R-TX) and Sen.
