Toward the end of the clip, we learn that McConaughey and his intergalactic space-traveling partner Anne Hathaway land on an Earth-like planet where no animals or land appear, but the ocean they\u2019re floating on contains massively terrifying waves. Will humanity be destroyed or will McConaughey rescue us all? Such is the central question moviegoers will embrace next month.\n\nAlong with the new trailer, Paramount announced today that the film will get a special release on Wednesday, November 5, presenting the film in its \u201cnative formats.\u201d The early screenings will appear on 70mm IMAX film, 70mm film and 35mm film in more than 240 locations across the U.S. and Canada; tickets are already on sale.\n\nThe film hits regular theaters on November 7.
