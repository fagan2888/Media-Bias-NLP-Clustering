Brookings, SD

Even while rain made the grounds at Pioneer Park a little muddy today, thousands of people still showed up for the 43rd Brookings Summer Arts Festival.

Pioneer Park is filled with people today, and it's also filled with 200 different artists representing a wide variety of pieces.

Some artists sell paintings, while others sell pottery and wood carvings. But Bill Lillibridge sells something a little bit different: Robots.

“They just kind of make themselves, and they kind of take on their own personality. And you know, they just, they kind of talk to you, actually. And I'm not a crazy person, but they got their own personality, and so I just say they kind of make themselves,” Lillibridge said.

This is Lillibridge's second time at the Brookings Summer Arts Festival, and last year, he was given an award of excellence for his work.

The festival goes until 7 p.m., and starts back up tomorrow 10 a.m. We'll have more on this popular summertime event and hear more from the artists tonight on KELOLAND Weekend news at 10.
