Her examination showed several flaws, including: there are not enough primary care physicians to serve Covered California enrollees.\n\nCovered California leaders were not entirely prepared for the flood of patients who are now seeking care.\n\nSpecialized \u2013 and sometimes lifesaving \u2013 services can be distant or unavailable.\n\nMany patients, sometimes frustrated by the lack of basic services and access to physicians, are streaming into emergency rooms.\n\nOur examination also showed that in many cases, the system is working fine. So \u201cUncovered California,\u201d was not a wholesale indictment, but a focused critique.\n\nWe also found some providers who are responding with innovations. For instance, Dignity Health now employs \u201cpatient navigators\u201d in several of its emergency rooms to assess what kind of care patients truly need. They can coordinate care and help schedule follow-up appointments.\n\nSo what are the answers? No doubt they are complex. They will involve political and economic negotiations.\n\nHere are questions that can serve as starting points:\n\nCan Covered California explore higher reimbursement rates to entice more physicians into the system?\n\nCan physician assistants be engaged to provide more care and take a load off physicians who do serve Covered California patients?\n\nCan our medical schools produce more primary care physicians?\n\nCovered California is providing care to millions of residents. That\u2019s a good thing.\n\nBut as our examination of the system showed, this patient can and should be even healthier.\n\n~ The Press Tribune", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
