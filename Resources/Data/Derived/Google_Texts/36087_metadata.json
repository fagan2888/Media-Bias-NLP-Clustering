Right? While the cost of a college education is an issue, another big challenge is facing students today: malnutrition, hunger pains and worrying about dinner. Between juggling tuition and rent, working part time or full time, scraping together enough money to eat can come last for students.\n\n\u201cCollege campus hunger is a big issue,\u201d Shannon Coffin, child hunger programs manager at the Auburn-based Good Shepherd Food Bank, said. In Maine it\u2019s just starting to be detected and recognized.\n\nThe organization partners with 64 Maine schools to help establish food pantries, but only two are on college campuses. One leader is Southern Maine Community College in South Portland.\n\nIn former military officer quarters, shelves of canned goods, pasta, tuna and beans stand at the ready. For more than two years this food pantry called The Captain\u2019s Cupboard has provided relief for students who can\u2019t afford to feed themselves or their families.\n\n\u201cMost food banks have financial requirements,\u201d Tabatha Copeland, a student and director of The Captain\u2019s Cupboard, said. \u201cWe are a lot different from that. We say \u2018What do you need?\u2019 not \u2018How much do you make?\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to the most recent student senate survey, 31.5 percent of students at this associate degree-granting school are food insecure.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know where their next meal will come from or don\u2019t know what to do to get it,\u201d Coffin explained. \u201cThey have a fear of looking at the cupboard.\u201d\n\nThat number is nearly double the state average. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 16.2 percent of Maine households, or more than 208,000 individuals, are food insecure. In addition, 24 percent of Maine\u2019s children are food insecure. The Pine Tree State has the highest rates in New England and ranks 12th in the nation.\n\nTo help relieve this problem, the school\u2019s Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society created the food pantry in the fall of 2013. The all-volunteer, student-run organization opens again in mid-January with new members and students to serve. To access it, all students need is a valid school ID.\n\n\u201cVolunteers from all walks of life and majors band together to help each other out. When we have students coming in, we say \u2018take what you need.\u2019 No questions asked,\u201d former director Maisarah Miskoon said.\n\nDonations come from Good Shepherd, community members, local groups and the cafeteria.\n\nSodexo, the company that runs SMCC\u2019s dining services, also pitches in. Leftover meals such as lasagna, rice dishes, quesadillas and steamed veggies are offered as frozen dinners. The Captain\u2019s Cupboard has collected about 300 pounds of food from Sodexo that otherwise would have been thrown away.\n\n\u201cWe have dorm students who come in for snacks, people that come in to feed their families. They are all food insecure, that\u2019s what bonds them together,\u201d Copeland, a 22-year-old from Biddeford, said.\n\nTo SMCC President Ron Cantor, a nourished student is a thriving student.\n\n\u201cThe highest priority at SMCC is student success,\u201d Cantor said. Contrary to popular belief, tuition isn\u2019t the biggest hurdle. \u201cMany can\u2019t finish college or make it to classes. A companion to the complex lives they live is food insecurity.\u201d\n\nAt nontraditional schools such as SMCC and Kaplan University in Lewiston, where a student-led food pantry has been established just as long, students are not shielded from real world problems.\n\n\u201cThe ups and downs in the economy have had an impact,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cIf we go back a generation or two, students went to college and finished school. In today\u2019s world many are part time instead of full time. They have rent and food and transportation and child care. \u2026 If they hit a bump in the road, college is the last priority on their list.\u201d\n\nFree nutrition in the form of beef enchiladas, bagels, soup, cereal and corn helps. Since launching, Good Shepherd says these two college campuses have distributed more than 59,000 meals including over 15,000 pounds of fresh produce.\n\nSimilarly in 2009, University of Maine in Orono initiated a food pantry and clothing swap called the Black Bear Exchange. Open to students and their families, as well as faculty and staff, it dispensed 5,600 food items in the last year. Local student and staff food drives support the on-campus exchange.\n\nFood insecurity in younger students, tallied through participation in free and reduced lunch programs and food desert maps, are easier to track. Similar statistics on college students \u201care harder to nail down with data,\u201d Coffin said.\n\nBut symptoms, hunger experts say, are the same across the board.\n\n\u201cIf you are coming into school hungry, you are not able to focus,\u201d said Madelyn Holm, a Feeding America Child Hunger Corps member working at Good Shepherd Food Bank for a two-year stint. \u201cYou\u2019ll have poor attention in class. If you don\u2019t have adequate nutrition, there is the added stress of \u2018Where is our food coming from? Should I be focused on class or taking shifts?\u2019\u201d Holm said.\n\nCopeland, a young mother, understands this firsthand. Struggling with feeding her baby and attending class, a faculty advisor at SMCC told her about the pantry. She faced what many of her peers face: \u201cDo I work a shift to feed our kids, or do I come to school to try and better our lives? Doing papers until midnight is really hard when you are thinking, \u2018How am I going to feed my kid in the morning?\u2019\u201d\n\nGood Shepherd considers The Captain\u2019s Cupboard a model they would like to duplicate statewide. SMCC\u2019s Brunswick campus plans to open a pantry in 2016.\n\n\u201cOur long-term goal is to be in every school that needs it,\u201d Coffin said. \u201cWe want to continue to grow this, but we are a long way from reaching that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cCollege campus hunger is a big issue,\u201d Shannon Coffin said.
