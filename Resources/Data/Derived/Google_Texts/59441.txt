NEW YORK (MainStreet) â€” For many Americans, a visit to the emergency room is a necessity when a particular ailment is a matter of life or death. Yet in instances when the health issue is not life-threatening, the decision of an ER doctor to admit a patient for an overnight stay can be a costly one. In fact, those overnight hospital stays can rack up costs in the tens of thousands of dollars per patient and may make people think twice about submitting to a sleepover after an ER visit.

That's all the more true, because the price tag is arbitrary. A new study released by the University of Michigan and published in a September issue of Health Affairs found that overnight admittance rates from ER visits can vary greatly by hospital. In particular, one hospital may be as be as much as six times as likely to admit an emergency patient with a common and non-fatal health condition than another hospital that is treating a patient with an identical diagnosis and symptoms.

The study concluded this variation in treatment can cost consumers, insurers and government agencies an extra $5 billion dollars a year.

"Our data reveal widely varying decision-making about hospitalization for patients who come to the emergency department with symptoms such as chest pain, asthma flare-ups, an infected wound or a urinary tract infection," Keith Kocher, M.D., MPH, senior author of the study and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Michigan Medical School, said in a press release. "This suggests tremendous opportunity for care improvement and cost reduction, and even the chance to turn [the emergency department] into a workshop for new forms of care coordination and alternatives to acute hospitalization for such patients."
