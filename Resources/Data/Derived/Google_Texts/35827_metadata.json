Bruce McKibben of the state\u2019s Division of Administrative Hearings.\n\n\u201cThe rulemaking process also refutes any claim that the Proposed Rule was arbitrary or capricious. There was ample testimony as to the facts and logic supporting each of the criteria in the Proposed Rule--negating any claim of arbitrariness,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFriday\u2019s decision addresses the DOH rule divvying Florida into 19 zones, and opening up the chance for a number of new trauma centers across the state. Specifically, it answers the question whether the Department overstepped its authority in creating the rule.\n\nAnd it is just the latest in a long list of lawsuits, administrative complaints and legislative policy battles over trauma centers \u2013 hospitals that have additional staff to handle serious medical emergencies and that can charge additional fees for the higher level of care.\n\nThis decision is a blow to large, mostly urban non-profit trauma centers that have spent several years challenging DOH\u2019s rule that opened up the opportunity for more trauma centers in the state. It's an enormous boost to newer, suburban trauma centers in Pasco, Manatee and Marion Counties that have been threatened with closure.\n\nPlaintiffs including Tampa General Hospital, Miami\u2019s Jackson Health and UF Shands Health in Gainesville maintain that more centers dilutes the talent pool and quality of care needed at trauma centers, and financially cripples hospitals already invested in the costly care.\n\nMcKibben didn\u2019t buy that argument. \u201cThe fact that the Proposed Rule may cause Petitioners economic harm is not a basis to invalidate it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nHCA Healthcare owns most of the newer trauma centers, and argues that residents who don\u2019t live close to existing centers deserve better access to trauma care. The for-profit chain has come under scrutiny for how its trauma center fees are disproportionately higher than those from other hospitals.\n\nFriday\u2019s decision comes after multiple hearings were held in March, April and May. It wasn\u2019t clear late Friday how this administrative ruling affects other pending complaints.\n\nFor example, the same court this month announced it planned to delay final hearings until September in other cases involving Blake Medical Center in Bradenton and Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida\u2019s Department of Health was within its legal right to revamp the state\u2019s system for establishing new hospital trauma centers, an administrative", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/judge-affirms-doh-trauma-rule", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201406/TGH_Exterior_Day_Feb08.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida\u2019s Department of Health was within its legal right to revamp the state\u2019s system for establishing new hospital trauma centers, an administrative", "title": "Judge Affirms DOH on Trauma Rule"}, "story_id": 324031993, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Mary Shedden", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Judge Affirms DOH on Trauma Rule"}, "nid": 6880, "datePublished": "2014-06-20", "keywords": "trauma centers, Florida Department of Health, Division of Administrative Hearings", "wordCount": 470, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc097\"", "article_summary": "For example, the same court this month announced it planned to delay final hearings until September in other cases involving Blake Medical Center in Bradenton and Regional Medical Center Bayonet Point.\nHCA Healthcare owns most of the newer trauma centers, and argues that residents who don\u2019t live close to existing centers deserve better access to trauma care.\n\u201cThe fact that the Proposed Rule may cause Petitioners economic harm is not a basis to invalidate it,\u201d he wrote.\nIt's an enormous boost to newer, suburban trauma centers in Pasco, Manatee and Marion Counties that have been threatened with closure.\nFriday\u2019s decision addresses the DOH rule divvying Florida into 19 zones, and opening up the chance for a number of new trauma centers across the state."}
