Researchers are testing an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d on these children who all have Type 1 diabetes. The device is the latest advance in diabetes management technology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to push this system to the limit by having the kids eat a lot and get out and run.\u201d\n\nThe artificial pancreas is an android phone loaded with software mimicking the function of a real pancreas. Using bluetooth, the device communicates with two monitors attached to the patient\u2019s body; one that keeps track of blood sugar levels and another that pumps insulin into the body when those sugar levels are too high. It determines when and how much insulin to release and sends that information to the insulin pump without patient intervention.\n\nResearchers say the device could simplify the lives of those with diabetes by taking the guesswork out of treating the disease.\n\nParents will often wake up multiple times each night to ensure their child\u2019s blood sugar levels are within the normal range and correct the problem if they aren\u2019t. The artificial pancreas could help eliminate those interruptions.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve been getting up in the middle of the night for years, it drains you,\u201d said Dr. Bruce Buckingham, a Stanford pediatric endocrinologist and head of the study. \u201cYou\u2019re brain-dead. And typically you\u2019re only getting three or so readings a night. This device takes a reading every 5 minutes, and adjusts the insulin by itself based on those readings.\u201d\n\nIn the study the seven children, all under age 15, volunteered to spend four days and three nights in the Newark hotel to put the device to the test. Each day, the group eats meals at nearby restaurants and plays outside \u2014 all while Stanford researchers monitor their blood sugar and insulin levels by accessing the device\u2019s readings online. They\u2019re trying to determine how well the artificial pancreas copes with the lifestyles of typical teenagers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to push this system to the limit by having the kids eat a lot and get out and run,\u201d said Prof. Marc Breton, with the Center for Diabetes Technology at the University of Virginia. \u201cWe want to drive the system to the ground, so whatever errors that still exist are found today, as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nTamar Sofer-Geri is the founder of CarbDM, a non-profit diabetes support group, Her daughter, Tia, is one of the children in the study. \u201cManaging diabetes is a 24/7, 365 days a year full-time job where you get no vacations and no breaks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge job for anyone to take on, certainly a child. So any technology that makes that easier or takes any elements out of the equation is something we\u2019re interested in.\u201d\n\nSo far, researchers say the results have been positive, and that\u2019s encouraging news to Sofer-Geri.\n\n\u201cIt would dramatically change the way she lives her life,\u201d said Sofer-Geri, referring to her daughter. \u201cThis would take so much of the decision making out of the equation. You\u2019re still wearing devices, but those devices are making the decisions for you.\u201d\n\nBuckingham plans to replicate the study at diabetes camps across the state this summer. Home trials are set to begin by the end of the year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The children are eating restaurant food and then running around to \"push the system to the limit.\"", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Stanford Tests Artificial Pancreas on Children with Diabetes\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/20\\/stanford-tests-artificial-pancreas-on-children-with-diabetes\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-20 09:12:00\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-24 14:16:29\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19627,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Diabetes\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/06\\/RS10930_2013-06-02-03.17.50-hpf.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The children are eating restaurant food and then running around to \"push the system to the limit.\"", "title": "Stanford Tests Artificial Pancreas on Children with Diabetes", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/20/stanford-tests-artificial-pancreas-on-children-with-diabetes/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/RS10930_2013-06-02-03.17.50-hpf.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,diabetes,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9612\"", "article_summary": "Researchers are testing an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d on these children who all have Type 1 diabetes.\nThey\u2019re trying to determine how well the artificial pancreas copes with the lifestyles of typical teenagers.\nThe artificial pancreas could help eliminate those interruptions.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to push this system to the limit by having the kids eat a lot and get out and run.\u201dThe artificial pancreas is an android phone loaded with software mimicking the function of a real pancreas.\nParents will often wake up multiple times each night to ensure their child\u2019s blood sugar levels are within the normal range and correct the problem if they aren\u2019t."}
