And not just thoracic, or chest, surgery.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a gynecological oncologist. There are very few in the country, and in order to support a program, you need more than one. A community hospital doesn\u2019t have the volume of activity that would justify it,\u201d said Boehler.\n\nThose two specialities are the most obvious, but not the last, therapies to be involved in the new agreement between St. Joseph\u2019s and Lahey.\n\n\u201cWe just signed the memorandum of understanding \u2013 that\u2019s in force \u2013 and are working through the details of which services make the most sense,\u201d said Boehler.\n\nThe expanded collaboration has financial benefits to St. Joseph Hospital, keeping some services in house that would otherwise take place elsewhere, making billable use of existing operating rooms and anesthesiology and nursing staff. It also expands locally available health care options, helpful to patients who are less likely to be moved south.\n\nIt\u2019s an example of integration between hospitals and medical groups that seek to join forces even as they compete for business \u2013 sometimes called \u201cco-opetition\u201d in the business world.\n\nPressure to lower medical costs, spurred by the Affordable Care Act, has only increased the need for such sharing, while technology, notably the increase in electronic medical records, has made them more feasible.\n\nSharing of services has long been part of the medical world. The Radiation Center of Greater Nashua on Southwood Drive, for example, was created by Nashua\u2019s two hospitals and Dartmouth-Hitchcock two decades ago to provide radiation therapies too expensive to create separately. More recently, the three institutions joined together to open the Surgery Center in the former Lamprey Health Care facility alongside Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, which specializes in surgeries that don\u2019t require an overnight stay.\n\nAll hospitals, including St. Joseph, have long had various types of service-sharing arrangements with other hospitals or other medical practices. For example, city hospitals partner with Harbor Homes \u201cto deliver mental health services that would be much more difficult for us to do independently,\u201d said Boehler.\n\nThe expanded Lahey arrangement \u201cis looking at gaps, where we don\u2019t have types of service delivery models in place,\u201d said Boehler. \u201cWe have no intention of changing any existing arrangements,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Brooks can be reached at 594-6531 or dbrooks@nashua\n\ntelegraph.com.
