Their tactics have primarily veered toward being \u201cdisruptive\u201d:\n\nNotably, people on social media have predominately not been in lockstep with the protesters on these actions:\n\nWhile I\u2019m inclined to side with the activists, I can also understand some of the points made by these Twitter posters. If protesters are attempting to build a movement, it doesn\u2019t necessarily help to alienate low and middle class citizens by impeding their commutes. There are other ways to protest without intentionally adding a hassle to the lives of potential allies.\n\nHowever, as we\u2019ve seen this week from Cleveland\u2019s failure to indict the officer who murdered Tamir Rice, it\u2019s not as if increased awareness has remedied the situation. While more people are certainly talking about this issue, the racist system itself isn\u2019t budging. Authorities are continuing to impede justice and give cops a pass. The fact that officials let police off while knowing full well that public outcry would ensue just goes to show how institutionalized the disregard for black lives is.\n\nDisruptive demonstrations have become more commonplace because the typical marches haven\u2019t brought about change. If the government treats the deaths of black citizens like \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d then expect protesters to disturb \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for everyone else. It\u2019s their way of illustrating the unrest they\u2019ve been experiencing for far too long.\n\nTalk to activists who have participated in a freeway shutdown and I doubt you\u2019d get an apology. If you\u2019re pissed off at spending an extra hour in your car, just imagine how pissed off you\u2019d be if you actively feared for your life from the same people being paid to \u201cserve and protect\u201d you. It\u2019s not enough for American citizens to say, \u201cBut I\u2019m not part of the problem!\u201d This crisis requires more people to actively be part of the solution.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that it wouldn\u2019t be worthwhile for Black Live Matters protesters to re-examine some of their tactics. Though blocking an airport to prevent travelers from visiting their families at the holidays is impactful, it probably isn\u2019t likely to win over many new supporters or in any way discredit the police force that winds up looking like Christmas heroes when they arrest the protesters and clear the roadway.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re one of the many people who have complained about a protest-caused traffic jam while failing to voice an opinion against the racist police state, then you\u2019re definitely part of the problem. All that does is signal that you believe the inconveniences that the protesters are inflicting are somehow more outrageous than police killing black people without ramifications. And if that\u2019s the case, then of course the activists aren\u2019t going to mind disrupting people who are \u2014 at least implicitly \u2014 siding with their oppressors. White America has been able to comfortably ignore this racist epidemic, and it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be comfortable with it anymore.\n\nPhoto Credit: Tony Webster", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recent Black Lives Matter protests are upsetting the public, but why isn't the public directing any of that rage at the police?", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3164/3163556.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "protests,protesting,freeway,highway,airport,black lives matter,blm,race,racism,police,police brutality,tamir rice,minneapolis,mall of america,disruption", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This holiday season, Black Lives Matter activists ramped up their protest efforts in order to increase visibility for their cause.\nThe fact that officials let police off while knowing full well that public outcry would ensue just goes to show how institutionalized the disregard for black lives is.\nIf the government treats the deaths of black citizens like \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d then expect protesters to disturb \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for everyone else.\nThat\u2019s not to say that it wouldn\u2019t be worthwhile for Black Live Matters protesters to re-examine some of their tactics.\nThere are other ways to protest without intentionally adding a hassle to the lives of potential allies."}
