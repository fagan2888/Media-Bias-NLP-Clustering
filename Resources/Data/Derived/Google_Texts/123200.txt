A 21-year-old San Diego man was killed early Friday when his SUV slammed into a box truck while headed the wrong way on state Route 163 near Miramar.

A 2004 silver Nissan Xterra and the white 2004 International box truck driven by a 49-year-old San Diego man collided in the southbound lanes at state Route 52 shortly after 1:30 a.m., California Highway Patrol Officer Jake Sanchez said.

The Xterra sustained major front end damage and its driver died at the scene, according to Sanchez. His name was not immediately available.

The truck was overturned, missing an axle and was blocking two lanes, CHP officials said. Its driver was taken to a hospital to be treated for moderate injuries, Sanchez said.

Southbound traffic was temporarily diverted off state Route 163 and onto westbound state Route 52, but all lanes on the 163 were reported as cleared shortly before 6 a.m.
