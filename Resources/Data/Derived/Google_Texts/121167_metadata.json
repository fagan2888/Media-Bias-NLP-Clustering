The bigger problem, though, is the very existence of FSOC. Empowering a group of regulators to impose regulations tailored to specific firms, based on the notion that those companies might \u201cpose a threat to the financial stability of the U.S.\u201d is wholly incompatible with the functioning of a dynamic private capital market.\n\nThere appears to be little chance that Congress will get rid of the FSOC (or Dodd-Frank, the monster bill that created the FSOC) anytime soon, but there are many marginal improvements that could be made until a full repeal is possible. By the end of this week, the House will have voted on two such reforms.\n\nOne is H.R. 3340, introduced by Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn. The bill, known as the \u201cFinancial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act,\u201d would subject the FSOC to the congressional appropriation process to increase transparency and accountability. Under this bill, large financial firms would still be assessed fees to fund the FSOC and the Office of Financial Research (OFR), but Congress would review how these funds are being used before releasing the money. The act would also require the OFR to provide a public notice and comment period for any of its proposed rule or regulations, a much needed change.\n\nThe second bill, H.R. 2947, introduced by Rep. Dave Trott, R-Mich., passed on Tuesday night. This bill, known as the \u201cFinancial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2016,\u201d would amend the bankruptcy code so that large insolvent financial institutions can be more easily resolved.\n\nThe approach is an improvement over the status quo and would make it much less likely that Dodd-Frank\u2019s so-called orderly liquidation authority would ever be used. (Incidentally, the House Financial Services Committee is set to vote this Wednesday on H.R. 4894, a bill that would repeal Title II of Dodd-Frank, the section of the bill that created orderly liquidation.) While orderly liquidation sounds pleasant, it allows federal regulators to seize troubled financial firms and close down their affairs with minimal judicial review.\n\nSeparately, Reps. Dennis Ross, R-Fla., and John Delaney, D-Md., introduced the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2015, which passed out of committee 44 to 12 (29 Democrats and 27 Republicans) on Nov. 4, 2015.\n\nThis act would increase transparency in the FSOC\u2019s designation process and also create a formal path for firms to avoid being designated by lowering specific risks.\n\nAll of these sensible proposals represent positive steps toward solving the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d problem. However, any such marginal improvements should be viewed only as the very first step toward reforming financial market regulations. Dodd-Frank created new opportunities for unrestrained government intervention in financial markets, and it should be repealed.\n\nThis piece has been updated to state that H.R. 1550 passed out of committee on Nov. 4, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) suffered a well-publicized defeat last week.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) suffered a well-publicized defeat last week.", "title": "Court Rules FSOC Failed to Show MetLife Is a Threat to US Stability", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/16513_METLIFE.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-14T11:25:32+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/23utHfI"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) suffered a well-publicized defeat last week.", "title": "Court Rules FSOC Failed to Show MetLife Is a Threat to US Stability", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/16513_METLIFE.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "regulation", "published_time": "2016-04-13T03:56:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-14T11:25:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2545\"", "article_summary": "The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) suffered a well publicized defeat last week when a U.S. District Court rescinded the FSOC\u2019s decision to single out MetLife, Inc. for special regulation.\nWhile orderly liquidation sounds pleasant, it allows federal regulators to seize troubled financial firms and close down their affairs with minimal judicial review.\nThe bill, known as the \u201cFinancial Stability Oversight Council Reform Act,\u201d would subject the FSOC to the congressional appropriation process to increase transparency and accountability.\nThe second bill, H.R.\nHowever, any such marginal improvements should be viewed only as the very first step toward reforming financial market regulations."}
