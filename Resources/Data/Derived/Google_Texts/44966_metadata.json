As Obamacare\u2019s third open enrollment season began Sunday, this rock-solid conservative community of about 650 people offers a window into the challenges health law advocates face to expand coverage around the country.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cHealth care is fine, if you can afford it,\u201d said Brenda Copeland, a middle-aged woman who works at the Coyote Country Store and caf\u00e9, along with her two grown daughters, all of whom are uninsured. Copeland has had health insurance only once in her life, and opted to pay Obamacare\u2019s tax penalty earlier this year rather than buy a plan.\n\n\u201cI hope Obamacare goes down the toilet,\u201d she added.\n\nTurning around that kind of entrenched hostility \u2014 and convincing people they can afford Obamacare plans \u2014 are among the biggest challenges facing the administration as it rolls out the health law\u2019s third enrollment period against the backdrop of a presidential campaign whose winner could determine the law\u2019s fate. Winning new converts like Copeland is key \u2014 not just to boost the law\u2019s political standing but to enable its online insurance markets to flourish. But by now most people have heard about the law \u2014 even if they have limited or even erroneous understandings about what it might mean for their own pocketbooks. And despite the law\u2019s success in bringing about a historic drop in the uninsured, many don\u2019t like what they\u2019ve heard.\n\nThis is Texas, after all, one of the most anti-Obamacare states in the country, and people here have heard plenty from politicians about why they should demand the repeal of President Barack Obama\u2019s health law.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get a very high grade in my district,\u201d said local Rep. Randy Neugebauer, who is known nationally for yelling \u201cbaby killer\u201d as Congress debated the Affordable Care Act five years ago. Neugebauer, who represents 29 predominately rural counties from the New Mexico border to central Texas, added: \u201cI think a lot of people are finding that it\u2019s just not affordable.\u201d\n\nWith some of those difficulties in mind, the administration announced modest goals for national signup growth \u2014 a target of 10 million people covered through the health law\u2019s exchanges by the end of 2016, or a net increase of roughly 1 million. Its most intense outreach efforts will focus on five metropolitan areas with high concentrations of the uninsured, including Dallas and Houston.\n\nBut Dallas and Houston seem worlds away from Borden County, parts of which are so remote they don\u2019t have running water or Internet access. It had one of the lowest Obamacare enrollments in the country this past year, along with Yakutat City and Borough in Alaska, according to administration data. Part of that low enrollment may be because many Borden County residents get health benefits through jobs in the local school system, on oil rigs and on cattle and cotton ranches, so only about one in six was uninsured in 2013. Part of it may be because of its conservative leanings and remoteness.\n\nOutreach workers who are supposed to educate people here and in other parts of west Texas must travel huge distances to find small pockets of the uninsured \u2014 people like Copeland and her daughters, Becky Justice and Rika Law, both married women with children. And all of them think the Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable.\n\nCopeland said her income fluctuates but she made about $19,000 last year; she didn\u2019t know that she would have qualified for significant subsidies to lower her monthly insurance premiums, as well as for lowered co-pays and out-of-pocket costs. A plan for the coming year in the mid-priced, most popular tier would cost about $200 a month, after subsidies are figured in.\n\nWhen she did learn about the subsidies, she softened her stance slightly and said she might look into it. But she said she\u2019s done just fine without health insurance most of her life and is still angry that the federal government can mandate she has to buy it.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t mind them penalizing me,\u201d she said.\n\nLaw, her daughter, did take a look at the federal enrollment website HealthCare.gov, but said the plans cost too much for her family of four. She too was unaware that she might qualify for tax credits to lower her premiums.\n\nHer family previously had job-based coverage that cost about $1,000 a month \u2014 her husband works in the oil fields, but when oil prices dropped, his hours were cut and the Laws decided they didn\u2019t have the money to cover premiums. The plans she looked at on HealthCare.gov cost even more, about $1,350 a month.\n\n\u201cI understand the benefit of having it,\u201d she says of health insurance. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to juggle everyday bills, that\u2019s when it becomes a problem.\u201d\n\nHer sister Becky Justice, who owns this one-room store on the only road through town, said she had health insurance until mid-2014. She doesn\u2019t agree with Obamacare and, unlike her sister, never even window-shopped for plans. If she needs to see a doctor, she says she\u2019ll go to a community health clinic outside the county and figure out how to pay the bill.\n\nMimi Garcia, the Texas director for Enroll America, an outreach group closely associated with the Obama administration, says people in these rural communities may have heard something about the Affordable Care Act but for whatever reason were not motivated to check out their options.\n\nLow awareness about the benefits remains a challenge nationwide; a recent Robert Wood Johnson Foundation survey found that 59 percent of uninsured people lack knowledge about the tax credits even after two open enrollment periods. Addressing worries about affordability will be a major part of the messaging. That\u2019s why financial assistance will be emphasized in advertising for the 2016 season.\n\nIn rural areas especially, Enroll America\u2019s Garcia says local institutions that are trusted in the community are crucial for sharing information and cutting through the noise. But people here in Borden County say that churches, for example, haven\u2019t taken that on. To get people enrolled for 2016, the administration awarded roughly $10 million to \u201cnavigator\u201d organizations across Texas. The navigators are the administration\u2019s boots on the ground, and many of them will concentrate on the rural uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known from the beginning that this was going to be a multi-year project,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cIn a place like Texas, multi-year really does mean five years or more.\u201d\n\nThe state government \u2014 which has the greatest ability to coordinate a broad educational effort \u2014 isn\u2019t doing anything, Garcia said. Both Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and his predecessor Rick Perry have adamantly opposed the law.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any of the state health folks on the ground because of the politics of it, which is sad,\u201d said Rep. Gene Green (D-Texas), a supporter of the health law who represents parts of Houston.\n\nFederal officials say their priority is to reach Americans in all communities and they are advertising in some smaller communities with high uninsured rates, such as Green Bay, Wis., Dayton, Ohio and Waco, Texas.\n\n\u201cWe want people to know that wherever they are, we\u2019re here to help,\u201d said CMS spokesman Aaron Albright.\n\nNavigators and other assisters active in west Texas say they use different approaches to educate people, from in-person help, to radio and newspaper ads and spots on local TV shows. But they encounter a deeply embedded ethos of shunning assistance and distrusting the federal government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lots and lots of footwork and being at almost every event that you can be at, dropping off brochures at every place that you can think of,\u201d said Roger Cardenas, health services director at the South Plains Community Action Association, which received a $1 million navigator grant. \u201cWe\u2019ve even dropped off at laundromats, places that you wouldn\u2019t typically think that you could leave brochures. You never know if one person\u2019s going to see it.\u201d\n\nOther health care entities are trying to put out the word too. The Texas Hospital Association has mounted a social media campaign and has member hospitals distributing enrollment materials. But Borden County is so small it doesn\u2019t have a clinic, let alone a hospital.\n\nGiven the relative isolation, no one here knows just how the 12 residents here did enroll in Obamacare plans. It\u2019s not something that comes up in conversation among neighbors at the Coyote\u2019s caf\u00e9, says Becky Justice, adding she \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d who any of them are.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Why the uninsured in Borden County may stay that way as the health law's third enrollment season begins.", "title": "The Texas county where only 12 people signed up for Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/obamacare-texas-health-care-215415", "image": "http://static.politico.com/87/72/08b9a6dc47dbb1187fa239afb684/151030-obamacare-texas-ap-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Why the uninsured in Borden County may stay that way as the health law's third enrollment season begins.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "GAIL, Texas \u2014 In rural Borden County, 12 people signed up for Obamacare this year.\nGiven the relative isolation, no one here knows just how the 12 residents here did enroll in Obamacare plans.\nThe navigators are the administration\u2019s boots on the ground, and many of them will concentrate on the rural uninsured.\nCopeland has had health insurance only once in her life, and opted to pay Obamacare\u2019s tax penalty earlier this year rather than buy a plan.\n\u201cI understand the benefit of having it,\u201d she says of health insurance."}
