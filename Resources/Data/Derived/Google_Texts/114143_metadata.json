The mailer looks very official: the seal of the state of Montana in one corner, a stars-and-stripes \u201cvoters guide\u201d circle in the other, with the title, \u201c2014 Montana General Election Voter Information Guide.\u201d The guide purports to show along an Obama-to-Romney continuum how liberal or conservative the four Supreme Court candidates might be, showing Mike Wheat close to Barack Obama, Jim Rice a little to the left of Mitt Romney, and Lawrence VanDyke and W. David Herbert to Romney\u2019s right.\n\nTester charges that this mailer constitutes \u201cvoter manipulation\u201d by the colleges. He has asked the presidents of both institutions to reveal the funding behind this effort. Montana\u2019s Secretary of State, Linda McCulloch, filed a complaint last week that the mailing might have violated several state election laws (including, potentially, the unauthorized use of the state seal).\n\nA Stanford spokeswoman, Lisa Lapin, responded that the university is conducting a full investigation of the mailing, which she said was funded by a $250,000 grant from the Hewlett Foundation, plus another $100,000 directly from Stanford University itself. The university subsequently apologized to the state.\n\nThe project conducted by the Stanford and Dartmouth professors, according to the Gazette\u2019s Mike Dennison, is a \u201cjoint study is looking at how information on \u2018candidate positioning\u2019 affects voter turnout in judicial and other elections where voters can\u2019t distinguish between the candidates by political party.\u201d Montana would be an attractive test site for the research study because Supreme Court elections there are nonpartisan. Montana, however, is not the only state that was in the Stanford/Dartmouth study; mailers also went to voters concerning elections in New Hampshire and California.\n\nCommenting on this research brouhaha, Menlo College political science professor Melissa R. Michelson writes in The New West, the blog of the Western Political Science Association, that two of the professors involved in this study, Adam Bonica and Jonathan Rodden, are political science professors and fellows at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution, and the third is Dartmouth political scientist Kyle Dropp. The Hoover Institution is considered a reliably conservative think tank. On its website, viewed on October 27th, the organization touts an article by Edward Lazear published in the Wall Street Journal criticizing government forecasting as no better than a Ouija board, an announcement of an upcoming program hosted by Hoover with Congressman Paul Ryan to discuss his new book, and Scott Atlas\u2019s critique of the \u201canti-innovation effect\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. Former Bain & Company president Thomas J. Tierney, who founded the nonprofit consulting firm Bridgespan out of Bain, is chair of the Hoover Institution\u2019s \u201cboard of overseers.\u201d Among the well-known conservative political activists and financiers on the board are Peter A. Thiel, William E. Simon Jr., Margaret Hoover (Fox News), and James Piereson.\n\nWhile Tester might be concerned about the conservative ideological tenor of the Hoover apparatchiks, it could well be that this mailer, seen by Tester as \u201cundermining elections in Montana,\u201d might simply have been a \u201cpoorly designed experiment,\u201d though with no lesser impact of disruption on the Supreme Court election than if it had been a right wing dirty trick. Michelson notes that Montanans might be especially sensitive to political scandal, having witnessed problems with dark money being dumped into the state during previous election cycles. A few years ago, the anti-environmentalist American Tradition Partnership went to court to overturn Montana\u2019s ban on direct spending by corporations on political candidates and political committees, but the Montana Supreme Court upheld the ban (subsequently overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court). A change in the state\u2019s Supreme Court composition as a result of the races mentioned in the Stanford/Dartmouth mailer could be significant for future campaign regulation, environmental regulation, and other governmental policies in Montana.\n\nEven if the assumption is correct that Dropp, Rodden, and Bonica were not attempting to improperly influence the Montana election, their approach to the research has upset the apple cart. According to Michelson, \u201cthe Bonica group blundered in not anticipating how\u2026[the] context [or previous dark money scandals in Montana] might color reaction to their mailers.\u201d There\u2019s academia and then there\u2019s real life. Bonica and his colleagues seem to have missed the real life dimension of their research. If this really is merely a mucked up research project, the research team might have done damage not just to themselves, but to other researchers with better, more defensible, less tone-deaf projects looking at what gets voters to the polls. If, however, any scent of political bias were to be identified in the design\u2014for example, where the candidates were placed on the ideological spectrum compared to Obama and Romney, the damage to legitimate political science research would be deeper and more difficult to undo.\n\nFor the Hewlett Foundation, even though the grant went to the Hoover Institution, Hewlett had every right to expect that the methodology would avoid having disruptive effects on a contentious election and not stumble into state election law violations. But if further problems ensue with this research, Hewlett will be compelled to explain what it did to select researchers who, regardless of their think tank home, were expected to conduct well-designed political science research. As Michelson notes, citing Dawn Steele\u2019s work on field experiments, \u201cEthical field research requires that the research itself leave no trace.\u201d In the Montana Supreme Court election, the Stanford/Dartmouth team may have left a large and inappropriate footprint.\u2014Rick Cohen\n\nFULL DISCLOSURE: The Hewlett Foundation provides grant support to the Nonprofit Quarterly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether bad research design or something more nefarious, a political science experiment on nonpartisan voting funded by a well-known foundation has raised partisan hackles in Montana.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/10/28/hewlett-funded-political-science-experiment-creates-political-fuss-in-montana/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "Whether bad research design or something more nefarious, a political science experiment on nonpartisan voting funded by a well-known foundation has raised partisan hackles in Montana.", "title": "Hewlett-Funded Political Science Experiment Creates Political Fuss in Montana", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2014/10/Montana-election-guide.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-16T16:09:42+00:00", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/10/28/hewlett-funded-political-science-experiment-creates-political-fuss-in-montana/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2014/10/Montana-election-guide.jpg", "description": "Whether bad research design or something more nefarious, a political science experiment on nonpartisan voting funded by a well-known foundation has raised partisan hackles in Montana.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hewlett-Funded Political Science Experiment Creates Political Fuss in Montana - Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/10/28/hewlett-funded-political-science-experiment-creates-political-fuss-in-montana/", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Scandals", "published_time": "2014-10-28T15:03:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T16:09:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Policy, Foundation Investment, Foundations, Political Candidates, Scandals"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f79\"", "article_summary": "But if further problems ensue with this research, Hewlett will be compelled to explain what it did to select researchers who, regardless of their think tank home, were expected to conduct well-designed political science research.\nMontana\u2019s Secretary of State, Linda McCulloch, filed a complaint last week that the mailing might have violated several state election laws (including, potentially, the unauthorized use of the state seal).\nA few years ago, the anti-environmentalist American Tradition Partnership went to court to overturn Montana\u2019s ban on direct spending by corporations on political candidates and political committees, but the Montana Supreme Court upheld the ban (subsequently overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court).\nSenator Jon Tester (D-MT) is unhappy with Stanford and Dartmouth Universities over a mailer sent under their auspices to 100,000 Montanan voters concerning the state\u2019s nonpartisan Supreme Court election.\nIf, however, any scent of political bias were to be identified in the design\u2014for example, where the candidates were placed on the ideological spectrum compared to Obama and Romney, the damage to legitimate political science research would be deeper and more difficult to undo."}
