This practice refers to a demand that the patient pay the difference between the amount being charged and what the insurer agrees to pay.\n\nThe proposal would not bar balance billing for patients who scheduled a stay at an in-network hospital but ended up being seen by some physicians not in their network. Instead, the proposal would require hospitals to warn patients that this can happen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re taking an incremental approach to a major issue,\u201d James said Thursday in a call with reporters.\n\nJames acknowledged that she had hoped to go further. Last month she told a House subcommittee that non-emergency patients are sometimes balance-billed through no fault of their own, and deserve protection.\n\nBut James took that out of the draft in order to create a proposal that could pass. \u201cThe worst thing that could happen is to not get any movement at all,\u201d she said Thursday.\n\nThe issue applies to the most popular kind of commercial insurance -- Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and similar insurance plans that have a contracted network of doctors and hospitals but offer some coverage outside the network.\n\nFlorida law already bans balance billing for those enrolled in health maintenance organizations (HMOs).\n\nRecent reports have come to light of PPO patients being bankrupted or threatened by bill collectors over out-of-network treatment they could not have avoided. While the majority of such bills involve emergency treatment, they include some for care during elective stays.\n\nSome out-of-network bills can run into thousands of dollars. James said the highest reported to her office was for nearly $90,000. The case involved a Palm Beach County patient who underwent surgery for a brain tumor; while her hospital was in her insurance network, the neurosurgeon was not.\n\nDuring the 2015 Legislative session, a bill that would have barred balance billing in emergencies passed the House but stalled in the Senate. A similar bill, HB 221, has been filed for the 2016 session by Rep. Carlos Trujillo, R-Miami-Dade.\n\nThe major hurdle for the bill last time was the question: How will the payment amount for the out-of-network treatment be figured? Several suggestions have cropped up, but have been rejected by one side or another.\n\nJames\u2019 proposal avoids that quagmire by requiring both billers and insurers to negotiate a fair compromise. If they can\u2019t resolve it on their own, either side can call for binding arbitration.\n\nThe consumer advocate, attached to the Division of Financial Services, held hearings on balance billing in October. She followed up by talking to officials in other states and presented her findings last month to the House Subcommittee on Banking and Insurance.\n\nCarol Gentry is a special correspondent for WUSF in Tampa.
