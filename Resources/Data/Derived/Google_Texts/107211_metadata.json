And in fairness, most doctors would never consciously put profits ahead of their patients\u2019 well-being.\n\nHowever, the new analysis raises some troubling economic and ethical issues. And, for the first time, it demonstrates that there is a proven relationship between physicians receiving money from drug companies other than for research and the way that they prescribe drugs.\n\n\u201cBefore, a lot of people would say that folks who get more payments are prescribing more brand-name drugs but you didn\u2019t really have a lot of good evidence to support that,\u201d explained Dr. Wallid Gellad, associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and co-director of its Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing, who reviewed the data for ProPublica.\n\nWhile researchers have yet to make a causal connection between industry payments to doctors and their prescribing practices, \u201cAt least you can say that it is true that there\u2019s an association between getting more money and prescribing more brand name drugs,\u201d Gellad told The Fiscal Times.\n\nRelated: Drug Company Profits Soar as Taxpayers Foot the Bill\n\nHe cautioned that some doctors who receive large payments from pharmaceutical companies for their expertise may have practices with sicker or more challenging patients, and that those physicians might prefer to choose from a larger array of brand-name drugs. \u201cThat\u2019s still possible, and you can\u2019t rule out that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing,\u201d Gellad said.\n\nWith consumers, government agencies and policymakers in an uproar over the soaring cost of prescription drugs \u2013 especially biologic drugs for the treatment of cancer and the Hepatitis-C virus \u2013 any physician bias towards costlier brand name drugs can compound the economic problem.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there is a huge difference between generic and brand name drugs when it comes to price. Indeed, the cost of a generic drug is on average 80 to 85 percent lower than a brand name product, an FDA fact sheet states. In 2010, for example, FDA-approved generics saved $158 billion \u2013 or an average of $3 billion a week.\n\nJust for the average patient purchasing prescription drugs for cardio-vascular disease, a generic anti-cholesterol medicine might cost no more than a $4 co-payment. But if the patient has to purchase a non-preferred brand drug, the co-payment could be as high as $60 to $80.\n\nRelated: New Tech Tools Beat the High Cost of Prescription Drugs\n\nBeyond that is the ethical question of whether \u2013 subconsciously or otherwise \u2013 doctors who favor brand name drugs over generic drugs are being influenced by their dealings with major pharmaceutical companies. While the AMA offers guidelines for doctors dealing with drug companies to protect their patients\u2019 interests, doctors have wide latitude in contracting with drug companies to deliver speeches, provide testimonials for drugs and engage in other activities that sometimes will net them hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAccording to the ProPublica report, a handful of doctors who received substantial payments from industry and had above-average prescribing rates of brand-name drugs asserted they were acting in the best interest of their patients. \u201cI do prefer certain drugs over the others based on the quality of the medication and also the benefits that the patients are going to get,\u201d Dr. Amer Syed of Jersey City, N.J., told the investigative news organization.\n\nSyed received more than $66,800 from companies in 2014 and his brand-name prescribing rate was more than double the rate of his colleagues in internal medicine. \u201cMy whole vision of practice is to keep the patients out of the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nHolly Campbell, senior communications director for PhRMA, the drug industry\u2019s chief lobby, said yesterday that many factors affect physicians\u2019 prescribing decisions.\n\nA 2011 survey she cited found that 91 percent of physicians felt that a great deal of their prescribing was influenced by their clinical knowledge and experience. That industry survey also found that factors such as a patient\u2019s particular situation, including drug interactions and side effects, articles in peer-reviewed medical journals and clinical practice guidelines affected prescribing decisions a great deal.\n\n\u201cWorking together, biopharmaceutical companies and physicians can improve patient care, make better use of today\u2019s medicines and foster the development of tomorrow\u2019s cures,\u201d Campbell said in an email. \u201cManufacturers engage with physicians to keep them current on new indications for approved medicines, potential side effects of medicines, and both emerging benefits and risks of medicines. Physicians provide real-world insights and valuable feedback and advice to inform companies about their medicines to improve patient care.\u201d\n\nHowever, some medical experts seriously question the propriety of doctors trading on their experience and reputations to collect fat payments and fees from drug companies and medical devices manufacturers. And the latest ProPublica findings about the relationship between payments and prescribing practices only further fuels those concerns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it means that every decision is necessarily driven one way or another or that all physicians who have these kinds of relationships do this sort of thing,\u201d Kesselheim of the Harvard Medical School said in an interview.\n\n\u201cBut I think that that kind of conflict of interest exists, and there\u2019s been decades\u2019 worth of data. And this [ProPublica study] is another large data point showing that those kinds of relationships are associated with changes in physicians\u2019 prescribing behavior. That\u2019s not something patients expect, and it\u2019s potentially problematic in terms of the sort of trust that patients might have in their physicians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When a doctor takes out his or her pad and writes a prescription, patients typically t", "title": "Doctors Who Take Money from Drug Companies Prescribe More Expensive Drugs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/18/Doctors-Who-Take-Money-Drug-Companies-Prescribe-More-Expensive-Drugs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07122011_States_Doctor_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/18/Doctors-Who-Take-Money-Drug-Companies-Prescribe-More-Expensive-Drugs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07122011_States_Doctor_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When a doctor takes out his or her pad and writes a prescription, patients typically t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b2c\"", "article_summary": "And, for the first time, it demonstrates that there is a proven relationship between physicians receiving money from drug companies other than for research and the way that they prescribe drugs.\nRelated: Ignoring Warnings, Drug Companies Hike Prices By 10 PercentMoreover, the larger the payment, the more doctors tend to steer their patients to brand-name drugs instead of less expensive generic drugs that have essentially the same effect, the study found.\nWhile the AMA offers guidelines for doctors dealing with drug companies to protect their patients\u2019 interests, doctors have wide latitude in contracting with drug companies to deliver speeches, provide testimonials for drugs and engage in other activities that sometimes will net them hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nAnd this [ProPublica study] is another large data point showing that those kinds of relationships are associated with changes in physicians\u2019 prescribing behavior.\nHolly Campbell, senior communications director for PhRMA, the drug industry\u2019s chief lobby, said yesterday that many factors affect physicians\u2019 prescribing decisions."}
