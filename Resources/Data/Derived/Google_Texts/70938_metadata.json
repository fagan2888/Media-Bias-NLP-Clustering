The goal is that once volunteers act as patients in the area, students will be able to practice their skills in a more realistic setting.\n\n\"Occupational therapy helps people to get back to everyday life,\" Todd Rutledge, Cox College's director of communications and development, says. \"This allows our students to practice the safe patient skills they'll need before they're actually in a real-life environment.\"\n\nThe plan for the new cox cottage is to eventually let other community members inside who could also use the space. That may include paramedics, EMT's or hospice nurses.\n\nThe cottage is just the latest sort of \"simulation space\" to be added to the college. Those studying in degree programs such as nursing also have areas they're already practicing in, including an old critical care unit that has been transformed into the students' critical care lab.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- Cox College has created another way for students in the medical field to simulate real situations they'll face after graduation.&nbsp;", "author": "Dana Thayer", "og": {"site_name": "OZARKSFIRST", "description": "SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- Cox College has created another way for students in the medical field to simulate real situations they'll face after graduation.", "title": "New 'Cottage' Helps Students Prepare for Work in Occupational Therapy", "url": "http://www.ozarksfirst.com/news/new-cottage-helps-students-prepare-for-work-in-occupational-therapy", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/ozarksfirst/photo/2016/02/23/cottagepic_1456229190337_7138998_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1631794217050460}, "google-site-verification": "yajPFA3faS8IXhyhEQy0u8jahhAZ84S-y6tkL5ZMPeU", "keywords": "News", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "cox cottage", "published_time": "2016-02-23T12:32:07+0000", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T12:32:07+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"This allows our students to practice the safe patient skills they'll need before they're actually in a real-life environment.\"\n-- Cox College has created another way for students in the medical field to simulate real situations they'll face after graduation.\nThe new 900-square-foot apartment built inside Cox North is meant to look and feel like a real home.\nThose studying in degree programs such as nursing also have areas they're already practicing in, including an old critical care unit that has been transformed into the students' critical care lab.\nThe plan for the new cox cottage is to eventually let other community members inside who could also use the space."}
