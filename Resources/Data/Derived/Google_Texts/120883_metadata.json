On Friday, Donald J. Trump faced criticism for an even bolder act of conservative heresy: embracing the core tenet of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMr. Trump has to date offered only bits and pieces of his health agenda, generally presenting a vow to repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d and replace it with \u201csomething great.\u201d\n\nIn a town-hall meeting hosted by CNN on Thursday night, he shared some more expansive views on the subject, and unlike most Republicans he did not call for removing the individual mandate that requires Americans to have health insurance.\n\nAsked how people with pre-existing medical conditions would purchase insurance if the health law and the mandate were eliminated, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI like the mandate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s where I\u2019m a little bit different,\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want people dying on the streets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLess than 24 hours later, Mr. Trump backed away from his remarks, proclaiming himself to be the fiercest opponent of the health law. It was the latest example of a candidate who has been impervious to inconsistencies again emerging unscathed from a misstep that would probably be damaging to anyone else.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has sometimes put Republicans in an awkward position on the campaign trail. While the popularity of the law remains mixed nationally, many Americans have benefited from the aspects of the legislation that would be lost if it is repealed.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas faced an uncomfortable silence in Iowa last month when a supporter of Hillary Clinton explained to him how a relative who was riddled with tumors had not had insurance before the law. While Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, like his Republican opponents, wants to repeal the law, he has also been criticized by conservatives for using it to expand Medicaid in his state.\n\nFor years, President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, and the individual mandate specifically, have been anathema to Republicans who cite it as a vivid example of government overreach.\n\nWithout providing many details, Mr. Trump said this week that he would promote health savings accounts and spur interstate competition among insurance companies to reduce prices. As for patients who could still not afford insurance, Mr. Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take care of them through maybe concepts of Medicare,\u201d suggesting an expansion of that government program.\n\nConservatives were taken aback. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who opposes Mr. Trump, said in a series of posts on Twitter that the billionaire businessman appeared to embrace most of the health law and wondered what kind of Supreme Court justices he would appoint if elected. The legality of the mandate, and the government\u2019s power to impose fines on people who ignore it, was central to the Supreme Court decision that upheld the law in 2012.\n\nMany Republicans have called Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., a George W. Bush appointee, a turncoat for having written that decision. Mr. Trump has been one of the loudest.\n\n\u201cWould you nominate a Supreme Court justice who agrees with you that federal government can mandate purchasing specific products?\u201d Mr. Sasse asked Mr. Trump on Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host who has been a defender of Mr. Trump in many instances, was also incensed. And he took issue with Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that other Republicans are not disturbed by the idea of people dying in the street.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t talk about repealing Obamacare and like the mandate,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said during his show on Friday.\n\nIn the face of that backlash, Mr. Trump fired back on Twitter that he had been misunderstood. He said he only liked the provision in the law that requires insurers to provide coverage for people who are already ill. He then promised that he intended to repeal the entire piece of legislation, including the mandate.\n\nThe mandate underpins the law by spreading insurers\u2019 risk between the young and healthy and the older part of the population that needs costlier medical care. Without that requirement, insurers have said, the market could collapse.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s expression of support for the mandate was not the first time that he has struck a left-leaning tone on health care. In an interview with CBS last year he said, \u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be covered\u201d and said he would cut deals with hospitals to care for people who could not afford treatment. Asked how it would be paid for, Mr. Trump responded, \u201cThe government\u2019s going to pay for it.\u201d\n\nHe also recently began talking about allowing the government to negotiate with drug companies to cut prices.\n\n\u201cIf we negotiated the price of drugs,\u201d he said in a town hall-style debate on MSNBC this week, \u201cwe\u2019d save $300 billion a year.\u201d\n\nBoth Mrs. Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders have called for allowing Medicare to negotiate the cost of medicines with drug companies. President Obama has also sought the authority to negotiate prices for some expensive drugs through the Medicare Part D program. But he has faced fierce opposition from Republicans in Congress and pharmaceutical lobbying groups.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHealth care analysts have said that allowing the government to have more influence in the market this way could have unintended consequences, like suppressing drug company revenues so much that they would cut back on research. In any event, hearing the idea come from a Republican raised eyebrows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a proposal that\u2019s normally associated with Democrats, so for a Republican, in fact the leading Republican candidate, to say that was a surprise,\u201d said John Rother, executive director of the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing, an advocacy group working to cut drug prices.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Trump said that his independence on the issue was more evidence that he was not beholden to \u201cspecial interests\u201d and lobbyists.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160219211143, "twitter":
