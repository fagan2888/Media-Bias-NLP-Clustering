A poll released Monday showed Hillary Clinton barely ahead of Bernie Sanders in the Democratic contest, by 2 percentage points; while Donald Trump was far ahead of Republican opponents Ted Cruz and John Kasich.

(The city polling place list can be found here.)\n\nConnecticut supporters of Clinton, Sanders and Cruz made final pitches in appearances Monday on WNHH radio\u2019s \u201cDateline New Haven\u201d program.\n\nFormer state Comptroller and two-time Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill Curry argued that a Bernie Sanders presidency would \u201cbreak the corporate hammerlock Congress\u201d and support a needed \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d centered first and foremost on ending \u201cpay of play politics\u201d through campaign finance reform. The influence of big money on elections prevents both parties from tackling major challenges like climate change and income inequality, Curry argued.\n\nCurry knows the Clintons well. He worked as a presidential advisor in the Bill Clinton White House. Bill and Hlllary Clinton campaigned for Curry for governor.\n\nCurry said his support for Sanders isn\u2019t a personal knock on Clinton, whom he called \u201cintelligent.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t thnk she\u2019s dishonest. I think she is in deep denial about\u201d the bipartisan \u201cmarriage with Wall Street and big business\u201d of which she was a \u201cprincipal architect\u201d and beneficiary, he argued.\n\nThat said, Curry said he will definitely vote for Clinton in November if she wins the nomination. Though he characterized Clinton \u201cto the right\u201d of Cruz and Trump on foreign intervention, overall she is far superior when it comes to funding schools or childrens\u2019 needs and filling U.S. Supreme Court vacancies.\n\nClinton\u2019s Connecticut campaign director, Michael Mandell, said on the WNHH program that he believes the Sanders supporters will indeed fall in line with the Democratic nominee in November when, he predicted, his candidate will head the ticket.\n\n\u201cBecause the alternative is Donald Trump,\u201d Mandell said. \u201cAll Democrats can rally around that fact that [he is] dangerous. This election is too important.\u201d\n\nHillary and Bill Clinton will have made three appearances in New Haven in the five days prior to Tuesday\u2019s primary. Unlike Bernie Sanders \u2014 who attracted the biggest political crowd on the New Haven Green in over four decades with a Sunday night rally \u2014 the Clintons and their surrogates have mostly held intimate gatherings with one or two dozen people at a time.\n\nMandell said that the strategy has been to \u201cshow how issues impact real people\u201d with roundtables on subjects like the minimum wage, paid leave, and gun control. \u201cWe know we can draw a crowd,\u201d he claimed. \u201cWe want to speak to voters\u201d and have Hillary Clinton converse with them personally.\n\nIn addition to representing Democratic concerns on specific issues, Clinton has articulated a broader vision of \u201cbreaking down barriers for working families,\u201d \u201cmaking sure people can get ahead\u201d and \u201cfeel safe\u201d in their communities.\n\nRepublican Ted Cruz\u2019s most prominent Connecticut supporter, State Sen. Joe Markley, said he prefers Cruz over Kasich because Kasich is unelectable (\u201cKaisch has run in 40 primaries, or caucuses, and only won his home state\u201d). He said he prefers Cruz over Trump because he has \u201cthought through the principles\u201d he espouses and has a track record of sticking to them.\n\nFor instance, Cruz led a move to shut down the federal government for 16 days in 2013 to seek the defunding of Obamacare. Markley said while he might not have agreed with the tactic, the effort showed that Cruz would stick up for his principles rather than succumb the Capitol culture of compromise.\n\nMarkley said Cruz has the best understanding of and commitment to Constitutional principles and a commitment to limit the size of government. He praised Cruz\u2019s vow to eliminate the Internal Revenue Service. While the IRS wouldn\u2019t ever probably disappear, Markley said, a simplified tax code could render much of its work unnecessary.\n\nCruz has been the leading voice in this primary in support of North Carolina\u2019s controversial new law barring male-born transgender people from women\u2019s restrooms and removing legal protections from LGBT discrimination. Markley said he agrees with Cruz\u2019s stand; he argued that people already have\"tremendous protections\u201d from discrimination in existing laws and he considers it problematic to create new classes of protected people.\n\n\u201cHe has stuck to what he says. I think he\u2019s proven commodity,\u201d Markley said.\n\nClick on or download the above sound file to hear the full episode of WNHH radio\u2019s \u201cDateline New Haven.\u201d\n\n\n\nMonday\u2019s episode of \u201cDateline New Haven\u201d was made possible in partnership with Gateway Community College.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Paul Bass, New Haven, Connecticut, New Haven Connecticut, CT, New Haven news, news about New Haven, Toni Harp", "og": {"site_name": "New Haven Independent", "description": "For the first time in decades, Connecticut is in the national spotlight, not an afterthought, in a presidential primary election, as voters prepare to cast votes Tuesday.", "title": "Partisans Make Final Arguments  |  New Haven Independent", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 720, "identifier": "http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/upload/2016/04/misc/Bill_Curry.jpg", "height": 477}, "url": "http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/final_arguments/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index,nofollow,archive", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-25T21:38:48-0400", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:16:49-0400"}}, "article_summary": "Connecticut supporters of Clinton, Sanders and Cruz made final pitches in appearances Monday on WNHH radio\u2019s \u201cDateline New Haven\u201d program.\nMarkley said Cruz has the best understanding of and commitment to Constitutional principles and a commitment to limit the size of government.\nCurry said his support for Sanders isn\u2019t a personal knock on Clinton, whom he called \u201cintelligent.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t thnk she\u2019s dishonest.\nThe polls open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tuesday for both the Democratic and Republican presidential contests.\nWhile the IRS wouldn\u2019t ever probably disappear, Markley said, a simplified tax code could render much of its work unnecessary."}
