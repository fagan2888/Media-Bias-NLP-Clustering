Despite its massive success and even more massive profitability, it was viewed as the tidal wave that washed away something better.\n\nThe early and mid-\u201970s are often revered by cineastes as a true Golden Age of cinema, with the first generation of American Film School brats coming of age (which of course does include George Lucas as well as his friends Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese). Films like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d \u201cChinatown\u201d and \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d ruled the box office back then \u2014 until, at least in the popular narrative, Steven Spielberg and Lucas had to come along and ruin everything, turning Hollywood into a franchise machine, built to sell toys as much as tickets.\n\nRelated: Star Wars: The Rise of a Financial Empire\n\nNow, in a very different Hollywood landscape, \u201cStar Wars\u201d is back to save the universe. The franchise that was once the pariah of Hollywood is now its Jedi Knight. With glowing reviews, massive advanced ticket sales and the express approval of Gen-X nerd icons like Patton Oswalt, the success of \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d is now long past being a foregone conclusion. In a world where the studios desperately need a savior, \u201cStar Wars\u201d has become its only hope.\n\nOnly a film like \u201cStar Wars\u201d has the cultural clout to break through the industry\u2019s years-long morass. The problem is you can count films like \u201cStar Wars\u201d on one finger. Sure, on a dollars and cents level, this has not been a bad year for Hollywood. But only \u201cStar Wars\u201d will be remembered as a real victory.\n\n\u201cJurassic World,\u201d the year\u2019s current No. 1 (a title it is almost certainly going to lose very soon), has raked in over $650 million and is currently the third most successful film of all time, without adjusting for inflation. But does anyone remember the film at all? People came, saw their dinosaurs and left.\n\nThe second \u201cAvengers\u201d movie, despite bringing in $460 million, is already considered a disappointment for failing to match the success of the first. \u201cThe Martian,\u201d currently sitting at No. 7 on the list of 2015\u2019s top-grossing films, is the highest ranking live-action entry that is not part of a larger franchise.\n\nThe highest-ranking \u201coriginal\u201d film on that list \u2014 not part of a series, or adapted from a book or real-life events \u2014 is Melissa McCarthy\u2019s \u201cSpy\u201d at No. 23 with a paltry $110 million at the box office. (Yes, technically, \u201cSan Andreas\u201d is an original film and it ranks 18th with $155 million, but we\u2019re considering The Rock his own franchise). The highest box office take for what we\u2019d traditionally consider \u201cOscar Bait\u201d is the Cold War collaboration \u201cBridge of Spies\u201d from Spielberg and Hanks, just shy of $70 million.\n\nThe problems plaguing the movie industry aren\u2019t new. They\u2019ve been building for decades, and a review of the top films for the past 10 years shows a growing trend of forgettable big budget blockbusters without any critical leverage and a cluster of smaller films that rack up award nominations but never find a wider audience.\n\nThere are exceptions like \u201cGravity\u201d and \u201cInception\u201d \u2014 big budget, effects driven, star studded, with hot directors \u2014 but they remain exceptions. The last time a \u201cprestige pic\u201d busted the top 10 was 2006\u2019s \u201cThe Pursuit of Happyness\u201d (which came in 10th that year).\n\nRelated: Star Wars: A Beginners Guide\n\nAgain, these are problems Hollywood has had since at least the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d in 1977, but this year might be a tipping point. In addition to the increasing ease of watching video content at home (and the increasing annoyance, and potential threat, of going to see a movie in the theater), television has simply been the dominant force in today\u2019s cultural conversation. \u201cStar Wars\u201d is the exception that proves the rule. There have probably been more articles written about \u201cStar Wars\u201d since Thanksgiving than articles about Christmas, and even the most die-hard fans have to be feeling a bit burned out.\n\nBy contrast, consider the way a zeitgeist-capturing cable show like \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d can dominate the cultural conversation for months. The buildup for the new \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d season in April has already started, and as the premiere grows closer we will get any number of posts about what will happen this season. Why we\u2019re still watching or why we\u2019re no longer watching. Then we\u2019ll get weekly recaps. We\u2019ll get Facebook discussions and Twitter outrage, think pieces on sexism and violence, season wrap-ups and debates about next season. \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d can dominate \u2014 has dominated \u2014 the cultural conversation (for better or worse) from March to the end of June. And that\u2019s not even counting the endless Jon Snow speculation that has threaded through the offseason.\n\nAt an event at USC in 2013, both Spielberg and Lucas predicted that an \u201cImplosion\u201d in the film industry was coming soon. They foretold a massive change to film (by which, to be clear, I mean movies you see in a theater). They predicted a shift, where theaters become more like Broadway, where tickets are much more expensive, $50 and up, and only the biggest events bring in the crowds.\n\nIn a way, this shift is huge for genre fans who have already been treated to two decades of superheroes, hobbits, Harry Potters and Hunger Games, but for those who want a more thoughtful and intimate version of cinema, the massive success of these franchises has sucked the life out of the market for smaller films.\n\nFor viewers, this isn\u2019t necessarily that big of a deal. We have all become accustomed to having our more thoughtful pieces of video content delivered to us on our couch. There is a very solid argument that that is where they belong anyway. Maybe we as a culture have moved beyond the 20th century phenomenon of \u201cthe movie theater.\u201d\n\nObviously, we shed no tears for the Hollywood execs who will be spending Christmas with giant piles of \u201cStar Wars\u201d money. But the movie industry, like many others, has been massively disrupted by digital, and the many ancillary jobs that the old industry supported, from poster makers to the kid who sells you popcorn, may go the way of the Blockbuster clerk.\n\n\u201cStar Wars\u201d might just save Hollywood\u2019s Christmas\u2026and destroy its future.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For the better part of several decades, Star Wars has been a favorite whipping boy of", "title": "Why the Massive Success of \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Will Be Terrible for Movies", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Why-Massive-Success-Star-Wars-Will-Be-Terrible-Movies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12182015_Star_Wars_The_Force_Awakens.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/18/Why-Massive-Success-Star-Wars-Will-Be-Terrible-Movies", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12182015_Star_Wars_The_Force_Awakens.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "For the better part of several decades, Star Wars has been a favorite whipping boy of", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d49\"", "article_summary": "Related: Star Wars: The Rise of a Financial EmpireNow, in a very different Hollywood landscape, \u201cStar Wars\u201d is back to save the universe.\nDespite its massive success and even more massive profitability, it was viewed as the tidal wave that washed away something better.\nRelated: Star Wars: A Beginners GuideAgain, these are problems Hollywood has had since at least the first \u201cStar Wars\u201d in 1977, but this year might be a tipping point.\nIn a world where the studios desperately need a savior, \u201cStar Wars\u201d has become its only hope.\nFor the better part of several decades, Star Wars has been a favorite whipping boy of the film industry."}
