NEW YORK (MainStreet) - The economic recovery continues to disappoint.

Even though GDP growth has held steady and employment looks better than it has since the Great Recession, pushing unemployment to 5.5% in the latest jobs report, for the average American this feels like just so much paper prosperity. It’s a recovery that made it to the headlines but bypassed their wallets, with wages stagnant and disposable income effectively fallen thanks to increases in the cost of living.

It’s a problem felt across almost the entire economy, frustrating workers and dragging down businesses right as things are supposed to be getting better. In all of this, though, there is some good news.

One industry appears to be working. It just isn’t one anyone knew about.

According to Brookings economist Mark Muro, wages have gone up for workers in he calls the “advanced industries,” a sector of the economy that didn’t exist as its own category until Muro and his colleague Jonathan Rothwell created it in their recent study. Advanced industries include a cross section of manufacturing, energy and service sector companies, Munro explained, that all share one common trend: they focus on research and development.

To qualify for "advanced industries," Muro and Rothwell created two main criteria. A company has to have above average research spending per worker, at least in the 80th percentile or higher nationwide, and at least 21% of the workforce must need some level of Science, Technology, Engineering or Math (STEM) knowledge

In fact, it was by studying STEM workers that the two economists accidentally discovered the link between research and wage growth.
