High winds and hail caused damage in parts of northern and western Kansas overnight.

One hard hit area was Beloit. Residents are cleaning up after hurricane-force winds raced through their town. In addition to the wind, lightning struck near Jessica Gardner's home. It hit a tree in her yard, splitting it in half and landing on her friend's car. "We are feeling pretty lucky, it only took half a shingle on my house and their minivan only sustained minor scratches," Gardner said.

Power in Beloit was out for 12 hours, some power lines were taken out by trees while many power poles were blown crooked by the wind.

Tree branches with a diameter of four-to-six inches could be found laying across many yards and alleyways.

In northwest Kansas an 89 mile per hour wind gust was reported north of Atwood. Blowing dust limited visibility to zero, stopping traffic on I-70 for a short period of time. Baseball sized hail was also reported in the Colby and Goodland area.

Wichita received 0.97 inches of rainfall overnight that caused flooding on many city roads.
