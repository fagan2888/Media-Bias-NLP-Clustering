The economic development professionals ought to be doing backflips right now.\u201d\n\nParticularly noteworthy is the proposed 19-hospital organization\u2019s pledge to stave off any growth in health care costs, placing limits on negotiated rates with insurers to keep increases below the national average. Those involved say such a commitment puts to rest any argument that joining the two organizations would mean higher costs for consumers. \u201cThis is an affirmative commitment to absolutely reduce the growth in the price of health care,\u201d says Alan Levine, president and CEO of Mountain States.\n\nThe two systems are pledging to address six key areas in their communities, if the states of Tennessee and Virginia green-light the deal: improving community health, enhancing health care services, expanding health care choices and access to care, bolstering value, investing in research and education, and attracting and retaining a strong workforce.\n\nFaced with the option of either getting bought out by a much larger organization, or teaming with one another, the choice was easy, Levine says. Remaining independent was not an option, and a larger acquisition of both systems, he believes, would have spelled a loss of both control and jobs in their communities.\n\n\u201cIn the environment where you have the largest insurance company mergers in history happening, where really 90 percent of our nongovernment payer mix is going to be controlled by three payers, it\u2019s an environment where we don\u2019t think, long term, we can sustain ourselves as small, independent systems,\u201d Levine says. \u201cSo, the choice is whether we merge with each other, or whether we\u2019re acquired by outside systems.\u201d\n\nWellmont and Mountain States submitted paperwork for the merger to the Tennessee Department of Health and Southwest Virginia Health Authority, initiating the state review process.
