Bexar County is offering space at Bibliotech for residents to get help with signing up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.

The county is partnering with AACOG, Centro Med, Communicare and other community agencies to bring in ACA-certified navigators for the free assistance at Bibliotech.

Bexar County spokeswoman Laura Jesse said Bibliotech is an ample venue for residents to get the help they need.

"We have 48 computers at Bibliotech," she said. "We also have laptops and tablets that people can check out, with wifi right there. So we can accommodate a lot of people in there."

Residents should bring personal info including Social Security cards, employment and income verification, and policy numbers of existing insurance coverage if they have it.

Bexar County is hosting the events twice a week -- each Wednesday and Friday from noon to 8 p.m. -- through the end of March, 2014, which is the ACA deadline for enrollment. Bibliotech is located at 3505 Pleasanton Road.
