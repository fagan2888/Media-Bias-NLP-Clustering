Former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor called President Barack Obama’s proposed executive action on illegal immigration “incendiary,” warning it would torch any hope of common ground between the president and the new GOP congressional majority — leading Meet the Press host Chuck Todd to ask why the constant calls for Obamacare repeal in the days since the midterm were somehow not incendiary.

“That’s not incendiary because we know that that’s going to happen,” Cantor said, comparing it to the 2006 Democratic Congress’ playtime bills to condemn the Iraq War.

Brace yourself: Stephanie Cutter disagreed. “The difference is that even though the new Republican majorities have already committed to repealing health care, the president has said, ‘I vehemently disagree with you, but that’s not going to stop me from working with you on other issues.’ Contrast that to Republicans who say, ‘If you move forward on immigration, Mr. President, even though we have not acted over multiple years, then we’re just going to shut down and stop working with you.’ That is no way to start a new Republican majority.”
