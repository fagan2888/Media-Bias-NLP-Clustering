× Democratic US Rep. Jim McDermott announces retirement

SEATTLE (AP) — Longtime Democratic Rep. Jim McDermott of Washington state is retiring.

He announced Monday he won’t seek a 15th term. McDermott was first elected in 1988 and is the longest-serving member of the state’s congressional delegation.

The 78-year-old is a former Navy psychiatrist known for his liberal views and criticism of the Iraq war. He is a senior member of the tax-policy-writing House Ways and Means Committee.

One of the few physicians in Congress, McDermott also has focused on health care issues and implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

His 7th Congressional District includes most of Seattle and some surrounding suburbs.

Democratic state Rep. Brady Walkinshaw last month announced he is challenging McDermott. Walkinshaw said he respected McDermott’s service but thought the area was ready for a change.
