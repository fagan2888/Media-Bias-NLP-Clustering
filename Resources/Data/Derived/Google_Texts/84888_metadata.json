I am human. I had a lot of emotions yesterday and I should have just done boxing with my trainer,\u201d Vonn said after bouncing back to finish second Saturday and wrap up the season-long downhill championship.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always usually careful with what I do and say on the social media platforms and I just didn\u2019t really think it through,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI was a little bit too emotional. It was a good lesson for me. I just have to remember that I have a lot of people looking up to me and I can\u2019t let my emotions get the best of me.\u201d\n\nNadia Fanchini of Italy won with a 0.14-second margin ahead of Vonn in a race shortened by strong wind. Italy\u2019s Daniele Merighetti finished in third place, 0.72 behind.\n\nWith only one more downhill race this season, Vonn extended her lead to an insurmountable 173 points ahead of Larisa Yurkiw of Canada.\n\nThis is Vonn\u2019s record eighth downhill title \u2014 adding to four overall globes plus five in super-G and three in combined.\n\nSweden\u2019s Stenmark held the previous record of 19 globes established from 1975 to 1984.\n\nVonn also reclaimed the overall lead from Swiss rival Lara Gut, who finished 11th on Saturday. Vonn is 43 points ahead of her.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn\u2019s latest title soured by outburst", "title": "Lindsey Vonn\u2019s latest title soured by outburst", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/20/lindsey-vonns-latest-title-soured-by-outburst/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T17:24:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-20T17:24:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This is Vonn\u2019s record eighth downhill title \u2014 adding to four overall globes plus five in super-G and three in combined.\nWith only one more downhill race this season, Vonn extended her lead to an insurmountable 173 points ahead of Larisa Yurkiw of Canada.\nVonn is 43 points ahead of her.\nA day earlier, Vonn posted a video of an angry outburst in which she destroyed her bindings with a hammer after a race where one ski detached.\nVonn also reclaimed the overall lead from Swiss rival Lara Gut, who finished 11th on Saturday."}
