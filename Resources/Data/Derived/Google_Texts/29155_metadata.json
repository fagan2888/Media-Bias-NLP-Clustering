He fit her needs \u2014 she wanted an older, gentle dog for a companion to one at home \u2014 but he also fit her budget preferences.\n\nBecause of his age and length of stay, the shelter reduced Levi\u2019s adoption fee 50 percent, from $130 to $65.\n\nThe discount definitely helped, Casillas said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a matter of adopting \u2026 it\u2019s how much extra once you get him home: There\u2019s vet bills and all the accoutrements like the leash and the bowl.\u201d\n\nEven though adopting a pet from a shelter earns you a karmic payback and is usually cheaper than buying your next best friend, that love doesn\u2019t come free. It\u2019s better to let your head lead before something with four legs drags your heart away.\n\nThe ASPCA estimates that the first year of owning a cat will cost an average of $1,035. A dog can cost from $1,314 to $1,843, depending on size. That total includes the fees to spay or neuter and initial medical costs, which many shelters and animal rescue organizations cover prior to adoption. Denver also requires residents to buy a dog license for $15 per year or $150 lifetime.\n\nDespite all this, summer remains a great time to adopt a pet. As days grow warmer, shelters fill up \u2014 especially with cats, according to Denver Dumb Friends League spokeswoman Megan Rees, who said that spring and summer tend to be \u201ckitten season.\u201d Summer often prompts adoption specials; the league itself will offer dog adoptions for $52.80 and waive fees for cats 1 year and older Aug. 1-3 to celebrate Colorado\u2019s birthday.\n\nBut humane workers know that an event chockful of puppies or kittens in need of adoption can overwhelm the unprepared. Rees said adoption counselors are on the lookout for impulsive adoptions. Part of the adoption process is making \u201csure that any patron is ready to take on the financial responsibility of caring for a pet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure they find their forever home and don\u2019t wind up back in the shelter, she said.\n\nSavvy consumers will start by narrowing down their species and breed preferences, a task that often begins online. But prospective pet adopters need to dig deeper to avoid sticker shock later.\n\n\u201cPeople won\u2019t realize this is a lifetime commitment you just made,\u201d said Dr. Julie Smith, director of PetAid Animal Hospital, which helps owners retain \u201cat risk\u201d pets by providing discounted medical services to cats and dogs based on owner income. Smith said dental issues and recurring vaccinations are a few of the veterinary expenses prospective owners most commonly fail to consider.\n\nWhile it\u2019s difficult to budget for medical emergencies (Smith is a proponent of pet health insurance), a little research can clue prospective adopters in on hereditary or genetic trends. Many breeds are associated with specific health issues, such as eye disease for pugs and hip dysplasia for golden retrievers.\n\nOf course, if a golden retriever is someone\u2019s perfect match in every way but initial cost, it is possible to get a good deal by going through a shelter or breed rescue organization, according to Eileen Proctor, a longtime pet-industry veteran who speaks nationally and tries to debunk the misconception that shelter animals are \u201cjust\u201d mutts or \u201cthrowaways.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is, there are rescue opportunities for every breed and species,\u201d she said. Almost every dog breed has an easily Google-able local or regional rescue organization. Talking to that organization can often provide the most accurate estimate of such a dog\u2019s overall cost.\n\n\u201cWe give people a pretty good idea of what normal and routine expenses are like, and then we can also tell them about extraordinary expenses, like if a dog needs particular training,\u201d said Kevin Shipley, executive director at Golden Retriever Rescue of the Rockies.\n\nShipley suggested volunteering as a dog walker at one of the many volunteer-run rescue organizations to gain familiarity with a breed, or even a particular dog, before adopting. Casillas suggested visiting one of the Denver area\u2019s many off-leash parks and talking to other dog owners.\n\nOf course, if pet adoption decisions were dictated by cost, everybody would adopt a guinea pig or rat. But if you\u2019re looking for true love at a dog or cat shelter, experts say that researching factors that influence pets costs, ranging from obvious ones, such as size, to lesser-known line items such as grooming needs, is the best way to ensure long-term happiness.\n\nNine Things to Research Before You Adopt\n\nAdoption Fees\n\nTypical fees are based on age and range from $10-120 for cats and $95-250 for dogs. This often includes initial shots and required spay/neuter operations. Special-needs or older pets may be available for reduced fees.\n\nVaccinations\n\nSome shots recur every 1 to 3 years. Certain breeds, or dogs used in certain activities, may come with recommendations for additional vaccinations \u2013 such as kennel cough for sled-dog breeds or rattlesnake-bite vaccinations for serious outdoor dogs.\n\nDental\n\nDental issues and obesity are the top two issues PetAid Hospital sees in dogs. Some breeds require a teeth cleaning every year.\n\nGrooming\n\nWithout professional grooming, some breeds can experience pain from mats or skin issues. Regular nail trimming is mandatory, but rescue animals may be foot-shy, meaning you may want a pro to do it.\n\nLifespan\n\nMost cats and small dogs usually live longer than large dogs, but there is also variation among similar sizes \u2014 greyhounds, for example, tend to live longer than mastiffs.\n\nBreed issues\n\nSome dog breeds are more at-risk for certain medical problems.\n\nSize\n\nSize influences the cost of food and equipment such as crates, carriers and beds.\n\nAge\n\nYouth signals more shot requirements and possibly more training, plus the threat of some destructive behavior such as ruining carpets or shoes. Indoor gates can help keep a dog confined to a safe, durable area of your home.\n\nEnergy, dominance and intelligence levels\n\nAll of these can influence the need for training or adapting your home to your pet: A \u201cfree\u201d dog may require an $800 fence upgrade to keep him safe. Another may need a dog door so that she can urinate more frequently. And a high-energy, high-intelligence dog may need regular doggy day care to expend excess energy \u2013 plus extra training.\n\nSmart Money Adopting a pet", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Adopting a pet?
