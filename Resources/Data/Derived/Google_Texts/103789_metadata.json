It happened because the state\u2019s Catastrophic Health Care program has been spending less than anticipated, both last year and this year, as more Idahoans have gotten health insurance. Gov. Butch Otter had recommended transferring $16.9 million in unspent funds from fiscal year 2015 from the CAT fund back to the state general fund; this morning, in the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, Sen. Dan Schmidt, D-Moscow, instead proposed a transfer of $28,892,700. The fund still will have enough to continue covering its bills; you can read my full story here at spokesman.com.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little embarrassing,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cBut if you remember last year, the actual request from the CAT fund and the governor\u2019s recommendation was $32 million. And we said maybe it\u2019ll be less than that, and we went ahead with $27 million. Well, it was quite a bit less than that.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cYou guys all probably remember about three years ago, there was a bill that we did here in the Legislature that increased people\u2019s access to health insurance.\u201d That set up the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, which has allowed close to 100,000 Idahoans to get health coverage, most with subsidies that make it more affordable. \u201cAnd that has dramatically affected how much we\u2019re affecting costs in the CAT fund,\u201d said Schmidt, a physician. \u201cSo we\u2019ve seen CAT fund costs go down. They aren\u2019t going away. They aren\u2019t going away. But they have gone down. And getting people insured has reduced costs for the general fund.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis, to me, is an example of a courageous effort both by the Legislature and our governor to accomplish this,\u201d Schmidt said, \u201cand I\u2019m very happy that we\u2019ve been able to do this. And I\u2019m glad that we can return this to the general fund.\u201d\n\nThe CAT fund is the state portion of Idaho\u2019s system for paying the catastrophic medical bills of Idahoans who can\u2019t pay up. Counties cover the first $11,000 of each bill from local property taxes; amounts exceeding that are picked up by the CAT fund. People whose bills are covered get liens placed on virtually everything they own, including their estates when they die, but relatively little is recovered.\n\nJFAC Co-Chair Rep. Maxine Bell, R-Jerome, agreed with Schmidt that it\u2019s good to see the money return to the state\u2019s general fund. \u201cAnd I\u2019m grateful to those county people who strive diligently to make sure that this CAT fund is used in the way it\u2019s intended to help out,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll use this to fight another battle or to do something else.\u201d\n\nLegislative analyst Jared Tatro said three factors appear to be contributing to the decline in CAT costs, with the Your Health Idaho exchange by far the biggest. The other two are 2010 legislation that required people applying for the fund to go through an eligibility process that first determines if they\u2019re eligible for Medicaid; and the institution of medical reviews, in which the CAT fund has a contractor question the medical necessity of each service provided and rejects those not deemed necessary. Idaho\u2019s Medicaid program largely covers only children and the disabled.\n\nSen. Shawn Keough, R-Sandpoint, the Senate co-chair of JFAC, said, \u201cI do recall having to increase funding to the CAT fund in past years.\u201d She said, \u201cI agreed with Sen. Schmidt\u2019s assessment,\u201d but said she\u2019s reserving judgment on the governor\u2019s recommendation for $22 million in funding for the CAT fund in the coming year, fiscal year 2017. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to over-appropriate scarce dollars, but we also don\u2019t want to leave the counties in a bind,\u201d she said.\n\nSchmidt, who serves on the CAT board, said, \u201cThe costs are going down, they\u2019re dropping off, and we\u2019ve been seeing this now for a year and a half. \u2026 The demand is dropping off, and it\u2019s because people have insurance.\u201d Schmidt called Idaho\u2019s state insurance exchange \u201ca glowing success.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said he\u2019s heard anecdotally that counties haven\u2019t seen the drop-off. \u201cThey\u2019re still getting claims,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re smaller claims.\u201d\n\nTotal costs combined between the state and the counties were $36.3 million in fiscal year 2015, down from $51.5 million a year earlier. State costs were $19 million in 2015, down from $28.4 million in 2014. The program hit its peak in fiscal year 2012, at $55 million in costs, $38.6 million of that from the state and the rest from county taxpayers.\n\nSchmidt said, \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one to estimate. That\u2019s, in my opinion, why this should be going away. It isn\u2019t healthy for the economy. We need to do this differently. I wish we could talk about that.\u201d He was referring to expanding Medicaid to cover those Idahoans who don\u2019t make enough to qualify for subsidized plans on the insurance exchange; lawmakers have thus far been unwilling to consider the move. He noted that Idaho\u2019s CAT program isn\u2019t insurance; it\u2019s a mechanism for paying catastrophic medical bills after they\u2019re incurred.\n\n\u201cI believe people in the state of Idaho should have health insurance, and we have a way to do it,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cIt\u2019s very affordable, and it will make health care very accessible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Idaho\u2019s state general fund just got a $28.9 million one-time boost.
