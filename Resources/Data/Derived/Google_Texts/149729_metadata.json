(Photo: Keel Hunt/Special to The Tennessean)Buy Photo\n\nIn a most unlikely part of town, only blocks from the old state prison, I had my visit with the spirit of St. Nick last Thursday and watched his helpers in their busy workshop.\n\nI was standing inside a concrete-block building with a steeple on top, in a section of West Nashville zoned for heavy industry. This is the tiny Sixty-First Avenue United Methodist Church, and for 21 years it has been the scene of a recurring Christmas miracle called \u201cThe Last Minute Toy Store.\u201d\n\nBy noon, it was standing-room-only inside the sanctuary, when the Rev. Paul L. Slentz, the pastor, gave his cheerful welcome to volunteers from across Middle Tennessee. He tells them this is \u201cnot about presents, but presence \u2013 your presence here, doing this.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, in an adjacent room that normally serves as the church fellowship hall, another minister Dale Robble was standing on a stool so he could be seen and heard. Using a bullhorn, he was instructing the large roomful of volunteers who would soon spring into action.\n\nFellowship Hall had become \u201cToy Store Central,\u201d its tables now filled with age-appropriate gifts \u2013 dolls, board games, basketballs, bikes, and more \u2013 all donated. Dale had slept only a few hours on Wednesday night \u2013 so great is the demand for this Toy Store, so important its final preparations.\n\n\u201cAll of you,\u201d he said to the crowded room, \u201cwill be a blessing to the people you help here today. But, I assure you, it is you who will be blessed.\u201d\n\nMany volunteers have been doing this year after year. They come from churches, schools, and clubs. I saw young and old from Antioch, Belle Meade, Brentwood, Clarksville, East Nashville, Edgehill, Forest Hills, and Murfreesboro. They work the registration tables or provide childcare or distribute gifts. A dozen high school students, fluent in Spanish, served as translators.\n\nHow it works: Each year preparations begin in August, and as December approaches the word goes out to the community so families in need can know the store will be open for four days the weekend before Christmas. To qualify, a parent must be a Davidson County resident and not have received aid from any other toy assistance program.\n\nAt 6:30 each morning the store is open, tickets are distributed on a first-come first-served basis. Once inside, each of these \u201cguests\u201d is paired with a volunteer called the \u201cshopper\u201d who assists with toy selection.\n\nBut how the Toy Store mainly works is through a great welling up of goodwill from across the town. The level of generosity on display is breathtaking, people giving and doing what they can.\n\nThe numbers are not in yet in for total families served this season (today is the final day), but last year toys were provided to about 1,600 families accounting for 4,973 children. On Thursday, tickets already had been issued for 425 families.\n\nSome donors send checks. Near church baptistery, I saw a cardboard blow-up of a check for $1,161.50. It bore the signatures of 88 inmates of Unit 6 at Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Pastor Paul told me the prisoners had amassed that sum from their meager earnings in the prison shops. One of them had also written this note: \u201cMay God bless each child touched with this donation. Wish we could do more.\u201d\n\nWhen these volunteers share their own stories of the Toy Store experience, you hear the emotion in their voices.\n\nSome may have professional jobs downtown, others may be only a little better off in their circumstances than those they serve in the Toy Store. Here they are equals \u2013 all wear nametags but showing their first names only.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on the other side,\u201d said one volunteer named Elizabeth. Another December she stood in the line outside. Today she was on the helping side of the registration table \u2013 making good on her private pledge to return someday when her own luck turned \u2013 to pay it forward.\n\nNot much time to talk, too many people in line. Elizabeth then turned to greet a new guest waiting patiently to check in, and she spoke to this mother with great respect.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I was like you, on that side of this table,\u201d she said softly. \u201cOne day, when your luck turns, you could come back here and help other people like yourself.\u201d\n\n---\n\nKeel Hunt is a Tennessean columnist.
