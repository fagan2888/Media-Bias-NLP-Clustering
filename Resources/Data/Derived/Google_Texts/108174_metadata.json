The hostages are still beaten, or killed, regardless of their profession of faith.\n\nOver the last few years, we've seen a dozen Western hostages convert to Islam in order to appease their captors, or in the hopes of getting better treatment.\n\nWashington Post:\n\nIt would seem intuitive for Islamic State hostages to convert to Islam in order to win some modicum of mercy from captives who proclaim profound religiosity. But it clearly doesn\u2019t work, according to accounts and stories from Somalia to Syria. And why should it, since the Islamic State has proven itself willing to execute people of all faiths by the thousand? The only out for a hostage seems to be ransom or escape. Conversion to Islam appears fairly common among jihadists\u2019 hostages. Executed journalist James Foley, who until his capture was a devout Christian and spent a prior captivity stint in prayer, converted to Islam and took the name Abu Hamza, according to a harrowing New York Times report. \u201cI recited the Quran with him,\u201d fellow hostage Jejoen Bontinick, 19, told the Times. \u201cMost people would say, \u2018Let\u2019s convert so that we can get better treatment.\u2019 But in his case I think it was sincere.\u201d Fellow hostages Kassig and reportedly John Cantlie also converted, as well as a \u201cmajority of Western prisoners,\u201d the Times said. It\u2019s impossible to determine whether someone in captivity and threatened with death converts willingly or is capable of doing so. Sometimes, such conversions are clearly forced, as was the case for Fox News reporter Steve Centanni and photographer Ola Wiig, who were captured in Gaza. (In a video declaring fealty to Islam, both men stumbled on their recitations.) For Foley, it might have been different. \u201cMr. Foley had been captivated by Islam,\u201d the Times reported. \u201cWhen the guards brought an English version of the Quran, those who were just pretending to be Muslims paged through it.\u201d But Foley, who endured perhaps the harshest torture, was consumed by it.\n\nThere are a couple of motivations for Islamic State captors to force conversion on the hostages. The first is that it shows how truly weak Christianity is compared to Islam.\n\nBut in a political context, it shows their enemy the inevitability of Islam's triumph.\n\nOne thing for sure: it doesn't improve the conditions under which the hostages are held.\n\nAmerican Theo Padnos, taken by an al-Qaeda offshoot in Syria, saw similar depravity during his captivity. He declined to convert to Islam, a stance that in his telling appeared to slowly win the respect of the jihadists. A fellow hostage, American Matt Schrier, converted to Islam. At first, the jihadists were elated at their success. \u201cThe younger fighters would point at him and, \u2018You, good!\u2019\u201d Padnos wrote in a New York Times Magazine piece. \u201cThen they would point at me and say, \u2018You, bad!\u2019 But the conversion did not get Matt better food, and it certainly did not get him home.\u201d At one point, one of the guards hit him while he was heading to the bathroom. \u201c\u2018You, bad!\u2019 he said to Matt. \u2018You lie about religion.\u2019 The guard nodded at me. \u2018You, you Christian,\u2019 he said. \u2018You, good.\u2019\u201d But even that token of respect was fleeting. Padnos only got out much later after the Qataris helped engineer his release, following several escape attempts. Indeed, one of the greatest tragedies of any hostage crisis is the oscillating hope \u2014 hope conversion will help, hope they\u2019ll take mercy on you. And then, as in the Kassig\u2019s case, for that hope to disappear.\n\nPresident Obama used Kassig's Muslim name in confirming his death. To those who would criticize the president for recognizing Kassig's fake conversion, we should remember that there are at least two other American hostages being held by the Islamic State. Using his Christian name might have angered the terorists, and the American hostages could have endured the consequences. It's just common sense not to take that kind of chance when innocent lives are in peril.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/11/why_converting_to_islam_didnt_save_peter_kassig.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Why converting to Islam didn't save Peter Kassig"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd251f\"", "article_summary": "Indeed, one of the greatest tragedies of any hostage crisis is the oscillating hope \u2014 hope conversion will help, hope they\u2019ll take mercy on you.\nAnd why should it, since the Islamic State has proven itself willing to execute people of all faiths by the thousand?\nWashington Post:It would seem intuitive for Islamic State hostages to convert to Islam in order to win some modicum of mercy from captives who proclaim profound religiosity.\nOver the last few years, we've seen a dozen Western hostages convert to Islam in order to appease their captors, or in the hopes of getting better treatment.\nHe declined to convert to Islam, a stance that in his telling appeared to slowly win the respect of the jihadists."}
