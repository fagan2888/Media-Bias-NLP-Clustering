If the federal government fools around and changes the formula, I\u2019ve told the people in the state we\u2019ll get out of it. I\u2019m not going to let my budget be put into a hole.\u201d\n\nBut in the end, Kasich told Fulton County Republicans sounded a note that Georgia Republicans have heard only rarely. \u201cMy choice in that decision was to ignore some of the most vulnerable people in our population. I\u2019ve been criticized for this decision. Do you think it bothers me? It doesn\u2019t,\u201d the governor said.\n\nLater in the day, Kasich met with potential financial backers in downtown Atlanta, and would close out his post-Memorial Day adventure in Georgia with a rainsoaked barbecue on a farm near Monroe, Ga.\n\nThe supporters who awaited him included Phil Neff of Dalton. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him since he was a congressman in Ohio.\u201d Neff wasn\u2019t bothered with the Medicaid expansion issues.\n\n\u201cThe money\u2019s out there. Georgia\u2019s going to be on board very quickly,\u201d Neff said \u2014 a reference to the Medicaid \u201cexperiment\u201d that Gov. Nathan Deal is pursuing.\n\nBut interest in Kasich was high throughout the day. In Sandy Springs, he nearly packed the house, with an audience that included longtime GOP strategist Ralph Reed, former candidate for governor Karen Handel, and Secretary of State Brian Kemp, whose \u201cSEC\u201d March 1 primary next year has prompted a parade of GOP presidential candidates into the state.\n\n\u201c[Kasich] will make a great president if we can get him that far,\u201d said Sandy Springs Mayor Rusty Paul, who once worked for the late Jack Kemp, when Kemp was secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBack in the day, Kemp attempted to weld fiscal conservatism to a broader social conscience, and in his encounter with Georgia Republicans, Kasich tried to do the same. He offered a message not often heard by the GOP base in Georgia.\n\n\u201cA lot of government is improvement. It\u2019s not slashing and burning. It\u2019s making things work better at a lower price,\u201d the Ohio governor said. \u201cOur party needs more compassion. We need more empathy,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery once in a while, we\u2019ve got to get people out of a ditch, so they can live their God-given potential and they change the world.\u201d\n\nKasich made a brief allusion to the plight of Cleveland, where on Saturday a police officer was acquitted for his role in a fatal car pursuit of an unarmed African-American couple. Their car was riddled with 137 bullets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone through tough times in Cleveland right now. People came through with a gold star,\u201d Kasich said, after a third, relatively tranquil night. The governor reassured Republicans that they had made the right choice in picking Cleveland for the 2016 national political convention.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/05/26/john-kasich-to-critics-of-medicaid-expansion-do-you-think-it-bothers-me-it-doesnt/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/kasichinsandysprings.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "The first question from his first Georgia audience was the tough one for John Kasich.\r\n\r\nMike Fitzgerald, chairman of the 6th District GOP, confessed that he\u2019d been \u201cgrinding on this\u201d during the Ohio governor\u2019s entire Tuesday speech in Sandy Springs.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald noted that the Republican presidential possibility had expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care...", "title": "John Kasich to critics of Medicaid expansion:  \u2018Do you think it bothers me?
