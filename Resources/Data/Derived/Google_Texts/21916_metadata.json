For Barack Obama, it might be the mother of leadership. Necessity finally forced Obama to recognize the genocidal threat rising from the desert in Iraq and Syria, necessity forced Obama to design a strategy to deal with it, and finally the necessities of its underlying causes forced the new war President to deal honestly with it at the United Nations.\n\nThis particular mantle of leadership wasn\u2019t exactly what Obama wanted for his second term, but the last few weeks have wrought a sea change in the ship of state at the White House. As late as June, the official line on the terrorist army ISIS was that it was a local threat, or regional at worst, which the Iraqi military could handle.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Tough Talk May Not Be Enough to Beat ISIS\n\nPresident Obama dismissed them in January as \u201cjayvees\u201d to core al-Qaeda, which the US continued to claim was still \u201con the run\u201d after the death of Osama bin Laden three years earlier. The conflict brimming in Gaza, which would explode into another chapter of war later in the month, had most of the administration\u2019s attention for that region, and what was left focused mainly on the Assad regime\u2019s atrocities in Syria.\n\nEven after ISIS broke out of Syria to begin its genocidal sweep across northern Iraq, the White House sounded curiously passive about the emergence of an army of Islamist extremists. While Obama dispatched Secretary of State John Kerry to Qatar and Israel to deal with the Gaza war, ISIS pushed hundreds of thousands of Christians from their ancient communities in Mosul and the province of Nineveh, creating a flood of refugees into the Kurdish autonomous zone.\n\nObama refused to respond to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s pleas for military assistance, insisting that Iraqis complete the transition away from Maliki before the US would act, even as the humanitarian crisis was unfolding north and west of Baghdad.\n\nOnly when the world finally demanded protection for the tens of thousands of Yazidis trapped on Mount Sinjar, as ISIS threatened to annihilate them in a gruesome campaign of starvation, did Obama finally order air strikes that allowed Kurdish forces to break the siege. Shortly afterward, the US conducted more air strikes to help the Kurds retake the Mosul Dam and prevent a catastrophe that could have cost 500,000 lives.\n\nRelated: Obama Plays the Long Game with ISIS and Ukraine\n\nStill, Obama appeared to remain in denial that American leadership would be needed to fight ISIS until well after the terrorists decapitated two abducted American journalists for propaganda videos. At a press conference during late August, the media began pressing Obama for his strategy to deal with the threat, at which time the President admitted that he had no strategy yet.\n\nOne month after that Kinsleyan gaffe, Obama has changed directions almost entirely. Initially, the US stepped up air strikes against ISIS only in Iraq, and only after the Iraqi parliament finally replaced Maliki with Haider al-Abadi. That strategy, while tactically effective in slowing ISIS\u2019 expansion toward Baghdad, didn\u2019t stop it from expanding elsewhere from its command-and-control base in Raqqa, a key city in eastern Syria.\n\nObama initially resisted air strikes in Syria. Even in his prime-time address in September, Obama focused more on training the Iraqi army to fight ISIS and only considered air strikes on Syria as a possibility for a \u201ccounterterrorism campaign.\u201d Obama held out Yemen as a success story for his approach to counterterrorism, a country where terrorists staged a coup less than two weeks later.\n\nA week after that speech, the White House treated Syrian air strikes as so unlikely that Barack Obama himself would have to personally approve each target before agreeing to engage there.\n\nRelated: Can Americans Be Safe with Almost No Border Security?\n\nWhen the strikes came, though, they much more closely resembled a military offensive rather than the \u201ccounterterrorism campaign\u201d the White House had promised just a few days earlier. Admiral John Kirby told CNN on Wednesday as the strikes continued, \u201cIt\u2019s an offensive campaign now,\u201d and that the Obama administration would not \u201cbe constrained by that border between Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nWith his speech at the UN, the transformation to a war President was seemingly complete. In place of the half-hearted and cautious rhetoric about humanitarian interventions and the need for a more humble approach, Obama defiantly challenged the world to join the US in the long fight against ISIS \u2013 and beyond that, Islamism in all of its violent manifestations. \u201cThere can be no reasoning \u2013 no negotiation \u2013 with this brand of evil,\u201d Obama said of ISIS after reciting a list of atrocities still unfolding where they control ground. \u201cThe only language understood by killers like this is the language of force.\u201d\n\nAfter reciting the usual caveats about not being at war with Islam, complete with the now-familiar reminder that millions of Muslims call America their home, Obama demanded that nations of the General Assembly stop funding, nurturing, and protecting those espousing the Islamist ideology on which ISIS and al-Qaeda operates. \u201cIt is time for the world \u2013 especially Muslim communities \u2013 to explicitly, forcefully, and consistently reject the ideology of al Qaeda and ISIL,\u201d Obama declared.\n\n\u201cThat means cutting off the funding that fuels this hate. It\u2019s time to end the hypocrisy of those who accumulate wealth through the global economy, and then siphon funds to those who teach children to tear it down.\u201d That is a direct, if unnamed, challenge to some of the same nations that the White House celebrated as members of their anti-ISIS coalition, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the latter of which funds and protects Hamas.\n\nRelated: The New Terror Group Khorasan Is Plotting a 9/11 Attack\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Obama\u2019s speech didn\u2019t have a few clunkers that dented the serious turn he took against Islamist terrorism. For some reason, Obama felt compelled to include a nonsensical allusion to the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri as an example of how the US struggles with ethnic and racial issues, seemingly asserting a parallel between a disputed police shooting and massive genocide, ethnic cleansing, and sexual enslavement.\n\nThe White House demonstrated its usual subpar research skills by having Obama cite Sheikh bin Bayyah as a figure of peace after which the State Department had to repeatedly apologize when it came out that Bayyah had issued a fatwah in 2004 urging Iraqis to kill US soldiers. In 2009, another Bayyah fatwa prohibited \u201call forms of normalization with Israel.\u201d Using Bayyah as a leading light against Islamism certainly confuses matters and weakens the strength of Obama\u2019s demand at the UN for the world to reject it completely.\n\nEven so, the speech gave the clearest indicator that Obama has finally begun to awaken to the security threat that has re-emerged on his watch. \u201cWe are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom,\u201d Obama concluded, \u201cand we are prepared to do what is necessary [emphasis mine] to secure that legacy for generations to come.\u201d\n\nThat echoed an Obama statement made the day before after the beginning of the Syrian campaign. \u201cWe are going to do what is necessary,\u201d Obama declared, \u201cto take the fight to this terrorist group.\u201d In his UN speech, Obama insisted that US forces would not be sent \u201cto occupy foreign lands,\u201d but gone were the categorical refusal to consider other options.\n\nAt least for a moment on the global stage, Obama clearly defined the mission and pledged to do what has to be done to meet it. He then articulated that position without apology, and challenged the world to act alongside the US to accomplish it. Necessity, it seems, is the mother of leadership.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Necessity, it\u2019s said, is the mother of invention.
