Nikki Haley speaks out against a union seeking a vote on organizing at North Charleston\u2019s Boeing Dreamliner plant.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Democratic Party plans to push back against Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s strident anti-labor rhetoric ahead of the pending vote on forming a union at the Boeing assembly plant in North Charleston.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure in terms of the public perception there is equal pushback,\u201d party Chairman Jaime Harrison said Tuesday during a conference call with reporters. \u201cBecause we know Gov. Haley is going to do everything she can to push back.\u201d\n\nWhile the Democrats don\u2019t yet have funds or a campaign strategy, Harrison said Democrats will work \u201cwith our labor friends\u201d to ensure the Boeing vote is fair and fully explained.\n\nHarrison said Haley has gone out of her way to demonize unions, comparing them to thugs. He called the characterization false, one-sided and something the party plans to address in its response.\n\n\u201cThese are men and women who get up for work every day,\u201d he said.\n\nProduction workers at Boeing Co.\u2019s Dreamliner assembly line are gearing up for a vote on whether they want to be represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, known in the industry as the IAM.\n\nThe union filed a petition Monday with the National Labor Relations Board to hold an election. The vote, possibly months off, will determine whether more than 2,400 employees at the Boeing plant will be eligible for collective bargaining.\n\nNo date has been set for the vote, which could still be challenged by Boeing.\n\nWhile approval is considered a long shot, it is being closely watched nationally, largely because it is one of organized labor\u2019s largest-ever pushes in South Carolina. It also comes as the state is becoming a stage for Republicans seeking the White House.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and current Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, both of whom are anti-union, have appearances scheduled in the state this week. Earlier this month, Walker signed a so-called right-to-work law, barring private-sector workers in Wisconsin who are covered by a collective-bargaining agreement from being required to join a union and pay dues as a condition of employment.\n\nHarrison was joined by national Democratic Party officials and the AFL-CIO of South Carolina in a conference call with state media Tuesday. They criticized Bush and Walker as \u201ccompletely at odds\u201d with the values of state residents for opposing an increase in the minimum wage.\n\nDemocratic state lawmakers have proposed raising the minimum hourly wage from the current federal $7.25 to $10.10 per hour. The two proposals are not expected to pass.\n\nHarrison said the union vote at Boeing shouldn\u2019t be an opportunity to demonize the working class. Basic job protections that most Americans enjoy today \u201care the results of the hard work that unions have done,\u201d he said.\n\nHaley\u2019s office responded by saying Democrats don\u2019t have a track record of supporting Boeing\u2019s workforce and expansion to South Carolina, as was evident in a challenge filed by the NLRB when the company was moving here. The governor addressed the Boeing union question during a joint appearance with Bush on Tuesday at a domestic violence shelter. Haley said the nonunion Boeing workforce in North Charleston has \u201cproved we can build an airplane and build it well.\u201d\n\nA Boeing spokeswoman said earlier the company is opposed to the union, saying it wants to keep an open culture of collaboration between workers and management.\n\nJockeying ahead of the vote has already begun. Both sides have been paying for billboards and radio advertisements, including one that Haley recorded for Boeing. The union and Boeing also have dueling websites, each urging employees to take their side. The IAM released a video on YouTube over the weekend depicting people being interviewed about their support for a union at Boeing.\n\nBoeing\u2019s North Charleston plant has about 7,500 workers. The union petition filed Monday does not cover any workers at Boeing\u2019s propulsion facility, which held its grand opening in February and will make engine inlet components for the single-body 737-MAX airplane and design and engineer engine components for the wide-body 777-X.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s status as a right-to-work state means that no worker can be required to join a union to be employed at a business where workers are represented by a union. So, even if the IAM wins the vote, Boeing employees still can choose not to join. Any collective bargaining agreement, however, would cover all eligible Boeing workers.\n\nDavid Wren contributed to this report.
