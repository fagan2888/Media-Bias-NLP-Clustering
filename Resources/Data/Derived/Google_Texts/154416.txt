March Madness was injected with a dose of politics this week as Millennials filled out a bracket of what they believe are the biggest scandals to rock the Obama administration.

Campus Reform headed to George Mason University to ask students to participate in #BarackTology. Armed with a white board listing a bevy of scandals that plagued the Obama administration — from the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs to Fast and Furious — each student filled out a bracket of President Barack Obama’s winners and losers.

The majority of students said the NSA’s spying, president’s “If you like your plan, you can keep it” lie and Internal Revenue Service’s targeting of conservative groups were the three biggest scandals of the Obama administration.

“It’s pretty incredible, really,” one student said of the bevy of scandals. “I didn’t realize how many scandals were going on.”

Another said the wrongdoings were “terrifying.”

“I really wanted to see some change happen,” she said. “I thought I could trust them but they just got really sketchy really fast.”
