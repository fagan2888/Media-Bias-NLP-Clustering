His team is the Good News Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos are No. 1 in the NFL in total defense, and the defensive unit itself has allowed 6, 17 and 12 points.\n\nOnce Gary Kubiak took the \u201cpistol\u201d out of its holster, Manning and the Broncos got their groove back. The Broncos won back-to-back on the road.\n\nThe Broncos have developed a closer\u2019s mentality.\n\nAnd the Broncos are about to be 4-0 by Sunday evening at The Authority.\n\nYou want Bad News. Check out the Bears with our old friends John Fox, Adam Gase, Jay Cutler et al. They can\u2019t get out of their own way.\n\nWho\u2019s the MVB at this juncture? Wade \u201cI Was a Lousy Head Coach\u201d Phillips, who is a decent defensive coordinator. For the eighth time in his 46-year coaching career, Phillips has taken over a team as defensive coordinator. The first was in 1970 at Lutcher Stark High School in Orange (yes, Orange), Texas, where he was born. The Son of a Bum became the defensive coordinator of the New Orleans Saints in 1981, the Philadelphia Eagles in 1986, the Broncos in 1989, the Buffalo Bills in 1995, the Atlanta Falcons in 2002, the San Diego Chargers in 2004, the Houston Texans in 2011 and the Broncos, again, this year.\n\nIn each situation, he has improved the defense impressively in his first season.\n\nBut Wade never quite achieved so much so quickly as through three games this season. The Phillips Screwdrivers have permitted only four touchdowns (two others were pick-sixes off Manning) and three field goals. Offenses are averaging only 259 yards per game against the Broncos, and the attack mode has produced 11 sacks, six interceptions and four recovered fumbles.\n\nIs it possible the Broncos become the 50-50 club on defense?\n\nThe original Orange Crush in 1977 had 37 sacks and 38 turnovers (25 interceptions, 13 fumbles recovered). Last year, the Broncos finished with 41 sacks, 18 interceptions and 15 fumbles recovered.\n\nThe Broncos are on pace for 59.2 sacks and 52.8 turnovers.\n\nIn comparison, the Legion of Boom defense for Seattle in 2013 (when the Seahawks beat the Broncos in the Super Bowl) finished the regular season with 43 sacks and 57 turnovers (100 total). The Broncos could top that total by a dozen.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that a franchise can engineer one of the greatest offenses in NFL history (2012) and one of the greatest defenses (2015?).\n\nPeyton made pointed references the other day to the old \u201cBad News Bears\u201d movies, their sequels and their remakes, trying to deflect criticism of the Broncos\u2019 offense.\n\nThis is Orange Crush 15.0.\n\nOn the eve of taking over the Broncos, John Elway said his objective was to re-create Denver\u2019s old defense. For quite a while, it was \u201cenver efense\u201d \u2014 No D.\n\nThe first Super Bowl championship team in the 1997 season managed nine fumble recoveries, 18 interceptions and 44 sacks. The next (and last Super Bowl title team) had 31 turnovers and 40 sacks.\n\nThis could be the Broncos\u2019 and Wade\u2019s best defense ever, with as many as eight Pro Bowl types (Chris Harris, Aqib Talib, Darian Stewart, Brandon Marshall, Von Miller, DeMarcus Ware, Malik Jackson and \u2014 yes, even \u2014 Sylvester Williams).\n\nThe Vikings bring in Adrian Peterson, the premier running back in the league. He has accumulated more than a third of the Vikings\u2019 total offense, but, lest we forget, Teddy Bridgeovertroubledwater has one touchdown and two interceptions. Peterson could run for 200 yards and three touchdowns, but that won\u2019t be enough to defeat the Broncos.\n\nNot against Optimum Orange.\n\nBad to the Bone Broncos.\n\nDenver Demolition Inc.\n\nBTU (Broncos Thermal Unit).\n\nNuke U.\n\nThe Broncos are playing one game at a time, of course. It\u2019s not possible to play a doubleheader in pro football.\n\nBut the rest of us can think two, or 10, games at a time.\n\nThe Broncos didn\u2019t lose in September, and will remain undefeated through October.\n\nBut November is another month \u2014 with home games against Green Bay, Kansas City and New England, and road games at Indianapolis and in Chicago \u2014 vs. the real Bad News Bears.\n\nHow about 6-0 Pack and 6-0 Broncos on Sunday night, Nov. 1, on the night Pat Bowlen will be inducted into the Ring of Fame. Who you got?\n\nOr how about 10-0 Pats and 10-0 Broncos on Sunday night, Nov. 29? Brady and Manning last time?\n\nBoth games are here, not there. That\u2019s the good news, Broncos.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or @woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Broncos\u2019 defense is a good news bearer", "title": "Paige: Broncos\u2019 defense is a good news bearer", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/paige-broncos-defense-is-a-good-news-bearer/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913_052746_aqib-talib.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150913_052746_aqib-talib.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T19:04:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:09:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Wade Phillips, Woody Paige"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c8e\"", "article_summary": "1 in the NFL in total defense, and the defensive unit itself has allowed 6, 17 and 12 points.\nThe first was in 1970 at Lutcher Stark High School in Orange (yes, Orange), Texas, where he was born.\nOn the eve of taking over the Broncos, John Elway said his objective was to re-create Denver\u2019s old defense.\nOnce Gary Kubiak took the \u201cpistol\u201d out of its holster, Manning and the Broncos got their groove back.\nLast year, the Broncos finished with 41 sacks, 18 interceptions and 15 fumbles recovered."}
