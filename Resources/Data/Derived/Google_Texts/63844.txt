The parent corporation of Memorial University Medical Center is seeking a “strategic partner” by year’s end to help maintain its mission in the face of a rapidly changing health care industry.

Memorial’s board of directors is driving the effort to find an appropriate partner to work with Memorial Health and is not looking for a buyout, said Maggie Gill, Memorial’s president/CEO.

“The reason we are doing this is to make Memorial stronger,” Gill said. “We’re not in a defensive posture.”

Gill said the action has been in discussion for about two years as the health care provider — anchored by its 604-bed hospital — works to maintain progress achieved over the past several years.

Central to the move is a dedication to maintaining Memorial’s mission and keeping it in place as the major community and regional health care provider, she said.

Included in that is a commitment to maintaining all services and retaining all employees, Gill said. Memorial Health employs about 4,650 people or the equivalent of 3,800 full-time employees, plus about 600 people on the medical staff and 140 individuals employed by physicians and 141 residents.

Gill said the move opens the “possibility of increasing reach in resources, services and capability.”

The proposed partnership would not be Memorial’s first such venture. In 2012 it entered into a shared-services agreement with Novant Health Inc., which is based in Winston-Salem, N.C. Gill said that move placed Memorial in a lead position in the changing health care environment.

Harry Haslam Jr., who chairs Memorial’s 18-member governing board, said the newest move is a proactive effort that has been discussed by board members for the past two years.

“We have seen the changing environment in health care,” Haslam said. “Like everyone else we are facing the headwinds of the Affordable Care Act, and we need to be proactive.”

Included in Memorial’s needs is access to capital to allow the system to support clinical services unique in this region such as a neonatal intensive care nursery and the hospital’s trauma center.

“Above all else we want to fulfill our mission at the very highest level of quality for all patients, which include the uninsured,” Haslam said. “We have a very strong system. I believe we’re a very attractive entity for someone to partner with.”





Chatham County input

A core element in the proposed partnership is to support the health system’s debt, including the Chatham County Commission’s agreement in 2011 to guarantee $195 million in bonds.

That action included an independent review of Memorial’s finances, an analysis to evaluate certain risks such as a reduction in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements and a determination of whether the county’s bond rating would be affected.

Commissioners’ support for the health care provider’s bond proposal included recognition of almost $18 million in health care services that the hospital provided for the area’s indigent population.

As a result of the agreement, the hospital was able to free up about $60 million in capital improvement projects, including a $15 million emergency room expansion.

“Now it’s time for us to stop and relieve Chatham County of the obligation and make our own way,” Gill said.

Memorial officials said the move will not materially alter what a patient sees — Gill and her leadership team will remain in place and physicians will continue as will staff.

But additional resources would allow Memorial to increase its reach in services and capability and would fund infrastructure needs for the facility that opened in 1955 as Memorial Hospital of Chatham County, a 300-bed general hospital, which was dedicated to the memory of the county’s World War II veterans.

Since 2008, it has included Mercer University medical school’s Savannah campus and is the region’s only Level One Trauma Center.

“We view it (a potential partnership) as a very positive thing that will strengthen Memorial Health,” said Don Waters, chairman of the nine-member Chatham County Hospital Authority that owns the land and leases it to Memorial.

Among various obligations in the lease is a commitment to community benefit and the mission of the hospital, Waters said.

Memorial’s total community benefit for 2013 — the most recent year available — was about $54 million, including almost $30 in charity care.

“We feel that anything that strengthens Memorial Health will further our mission and allow the community access to health care and the community benefit of the institution,” Waters said.





National trend

The trend nationally, and in Georgia, is for independent hospitals to seek partners to help them stay competitive, Gill said.

“This is happening all around us and all around the country,” she said. “We believe this is a proactive step to be able to grow and expand.”

The board will act only if it can find an appropriate partner, she said, adding there is no guarantee it will be in place by year’s end.

“This is a board decision,” Gill said. “We want to get ahead of the curve.”

“We are not at a point where we can provide any further details,” Gill said, adding it is a process that involves many stakeholders.

Those include several major donors:

• Curtis and Elizabeth Anderson: The Curtis and Elizabeth Anderson Cancer Institute at Memorial University Medical Center

• Judith Thomas Solomon: The Heart and Vascular Institute at Memorial

• Gulfstream Aerospace: Children’s Wellness Program

• Greg Parker and Parker’s Emergency and Trauma Center at Memorial

Memorial also has forged clinical partnerships with several regional hospitals, including Meadows Regional Medical Center in Vidalia, Bacon County Hospital in Alma, Jeff Davis Hospital in Hazlehurst and Liberty Regional Medical Center in Hinesville.

Additional factors include a reduction in the number of uninsured patients as more people enroll in health exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, affiliations with regional partners such as HealthSouth and Apple Care urgent care, and increases in the number of residents and facilities.





Gill factor

Gill, who became president/CEO in April 2011, inherited a $27 million gross operating loss at the end of a string of five years when the system operated in the red.

Within a year, Gill and the board were able to report a $29.1 million turnaround and an operating income of $1.5 million with a system net income of $4.8 million.

But Gill repeatedly has cautioned that margins were slim and would need constant attention to preserve the turnaround.

Key to the financial picture have been repeated reductions in reimbursements for services the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, federal budget issues, high-deductible health care plans and penalties having to do with patients who have to return to the hospital after receiving care.

Over a six-year period beginning in 2013, Memorial will have lost $42 million in reimbursements, Gill said.
