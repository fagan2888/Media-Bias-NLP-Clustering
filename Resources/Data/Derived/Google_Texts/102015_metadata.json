But the magnitude of coverage gains in Minnesota was surprising, researchers said, and noteworthy because the benefit was concentrated among low-income and nonwhite residents.\n\n\u201cThis drop from 2013 to 2014 is really historic,\u201d said Elizabeth Lukanen, a public health researcher at the U. \u201cWe feel pretty confident that we can attribute these gains to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe new report can\u2019t prove a link between coverage gains and the health law, but Lukanen said the link seems particularly strong in Minnesota where the state opted to expand eligibility in public insurance programs. The state also created the MNsure health insurance exchange, she said, which heavily advertised coverage options for 2014 and coordinated a statewide network of health insurance counselors.\n\nRates in Minnesota A new report finds the share of children who lacked health insurance in Minnesota fell significantly in 2014. Uninsured Rate in 2013 Uninsured Rate in 2014 Source: SHADAC/University of Minnesota How we stack up The state had one of the lowest rates for uninsured children age 0 to 18 during 2014. Ranks States Percent #1 Vermont 1.2 #5 Iowa 3.2 #8 Minnesota 3.5 #21 Wisconsin 5.1 #36 North Dakota 6.6 #40 South Dakota 7.5 #51 Alaska 12.3 Ranking includes all 50 states plus District of Columbia Source: SHADAC/University of Minnesota\n\nCoverage for children\u2019s health care needs is becoming more important as the cost of care continues to rise, and studies show links between better health outcomes and insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely the case that more children gained coverage as eligible parents signed up for free or low-cost health insurance, and we\u2019re likely to see that trend continue,\u201d said Lynn Blewett, director of a research center at the U that compiled the report, in a statement.\n\nOverall, the numbers in the report are encouraging, particularly for the gains seen in coverage for low-income children in the state, said Liz Doyle, associate director of TakeAction Minnesota, a policy group that supported Minnesota\u2019s efforts to implement the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAt the Minnesota Council of Health Plans, Jim Schowalter credited community groups and county workers who \u201cdo the hard work of helping Minnesotans figure out what they qualify for,\u201d said the trade group\u2019s chief executive in a statement.\n\nBut Peter Nelson, a vice president with the conservative Center of the American Experiment in Golden Valley, questioned whether those with public insurance in 2014 actually qualified for the coverage.\n\nA January report from Legislative Auditor James Nobles that suggested 28 percent of people with public coverage in early 2015 didn\u2019t qualify, and Nelson suggested there likely were more problems with eligibility determinations in 2014.\n\n\u201cIf nearly 30 percent weren\u2019t eligible, that\u2019s a big number and that could easily influence the state\u2019s uninsured rate,\u201d Nelson said.\n\nFunded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the new report is the latest in a series based on U.S. Census Bureau data that found a stable or decreasing uninsured rate for children between 2010 and 2013.\n\nThe nationwide 1.2 percentage point drop in the rate from 2013 to 2014, however, is the largest year-over-year decrease since the census added certain information about health insurance in 2008, according to the report.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2014, Minnesota was one of 23 states that saw a significant decrease in children lacking coverage. No state saw a significant increase, researchers said.\n\nMinnesota saw the second largest percentage-point decline (2.8), behind Nevada\u2019s drop of 4.4 percentage points. In terms of the number of uninsured children, Minnesota saw the fifth largest decline.\n\nDropping 38,000 kids from the ranks of the uninsured between 2013 and 2014 puts Minnesota \u201camong the top five states, which is typically dominated by states with just really large populations,\u201d Lukanen said. \u201cWe were all surprised to see it on both of those top-five lists.\u201d\n\nImprovements were particularly strong among nonwhite children, who saw a 5.9 percentage point decline in their uninsured rate, to 3.4 percent in 2014, according to the report. The rate of uninsured children in households with income near or below the poverty level declined to 5.8 percent, a drop of 4.6 percentage points.\n\n\u201cThere was a significant impact on a group of children that\u2019s historically had low rates of coverage \u2014 that\u2019s nonwhite kids and low-income kids,\u201d Lukanen said. \u201cThey\u2019re more on parity with their white counterparts.\u201d\n\nHistorically, Minnesota has been among the leaders nationally in the share of children covered by private health insurance. Public health insurance rates for kids in the state have lagged, Lukanen said, even though Minnesota has generous benefits for children through state public programs.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear from the new report whether the gains in 2014 were driven more by private or public health insurance, although Lukanen expects that future reports will find public coverage is the driver.\n\nIn 2014, Lukanen and colleagues at the U\u2019s State Health Access Data Assistance Center reported the state\u2019s uninsured rate across all populations fell from 8.2 percent in 2013 to 4.9 percent in 2014 \u2014 the lowest rate ever recorded for the state. The earlier report suggested that much of the coverage gains in Minnesota came from state public programs, Lukanen said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that some gains in coverage between 2013 and 2014 were a function of a stronger economy in some states, she said, as opposed to the Affordable Care Act. But Lukanen added: \u201cEven when we\u2019ve seen improvements in the economy in years past, we have not seen coverage gains that are this large.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The number of Minnesota children lacking coverage fell from about 86,000 in 2013 to fewer than 48,000 in 2014, according to the report being released Thursday from researchers at the University of Minnesota.", "title": "More kids found coverage with health law", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/more-kids-found-coverage-with-health-law/368408401/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1455159062_10069141+1kids021116.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1455159062_10069141+1kids021116.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The number of Minnesota children lacking coverage fell from about 86,000 in 2013 to fewer than 48,000 in 2014, according to the report being released Thursday from researchers at the University of Minnesota.", "title": "More kids found coverage with health law", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/more-kids-found-coverage-with-health-law/368408401/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1455159062_10069141+1kids021116.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1455159062_10069141+1kids021116.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The number of Minnesota children lacking coverage fell from about 86,000 in 2013 to fewer than 48,000 in 2014, according to the report being released Thursday from researchers at the University of Minnesota."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a4d\"", "article_summary": "Declines were expected since the federal Affordable Care Act in 2014 expanded public health insurance coverage and provided tax credits to many buying private coverage.\nThe state also created the MNsure health insurance exchange, she said, which heavily advertised coverage options for 2014 and coordinated a statewide network of health insurance counselors.\n\u201cThis drop from 2013 to 2014 is really historic,\u201d said Elizabeth Lukanen, a public health researcher at the U.\nPublic health insurance rates for kids in the state have lagged, Lukanen said, even though Minnesota has generous benefits for children through state public programs.\nThe earlier report suggested that much of the coverage gains in Minnesota came from state public programs, Lukanen said."}
