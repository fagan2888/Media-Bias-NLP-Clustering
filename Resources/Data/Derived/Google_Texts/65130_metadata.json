The grassroots social justice network was mobilizing support to reform the health insurance model in the state, and they were asking people like Sandra to share their stories about why the current system wasn\u2019t working. All of a sudden, she was part of a movement of people insisting that health care is a human right. She was connecting with other Vermont residents who had similar frustrations with their own medical debt and lack of affordable insurance options, and who were taking to the streets to fight for universal coverage.\n\nIn the spring of 2011, they succeeded. Thanks largely to the constant pressure that the Vermont Workers\u2019 Center helped put on the legislature, the state approved Act 48, which requires lawmakers to build the first single-payer system in the country by 2017 \u2014 a nationalized health care system in which every resident is covered under a program run by the government.\n\nA powerpoint presentation on Vermont\u2019s \u201chealth care breakthrough\u201d CREDIT: Vermont Workers\u2019 Center\n\nConventional wisdom suggests Vermont got that done only because of its liberal political leader, Peter Shumlin, who campaigned on single payer during the 2010 gubernatorial race. But activists in the state say that\u2019s not exactly the whole story. The legislative victory actually dates back to 2008, when a lot of people said universal health care wasn\u2019t politically possible, even in the small, progressive state. Back then, the Vermont Workers\u2019 Center worked to build a network of people \u2014 people whom Shumlin has credited for putting him in the governor\u2019s mansion in the first place \u2014 who were energized about health care reform. Those activists were eager to hold their lawmakers accountable to the vision that every individual deserves insurance, in the same way that people simply deserve air to breathe and water to drink and a roof over their head.\n\n\u201cSeeing the political support was amazing,\u201d Schlosser, who continues to volunteer with the organization, said. She noted that she was initially surprised to see Act 48 pass after previous failed attempts in the legislature. \u201cIt really showed me that the government belongs to us and it\u2019s part of our democratic right to speak out. I had never been empowered in that way before.\u201d\n\nEnshrining human rights principles into law\n\nDarya Marchenkova, the communications coordinator for the Vermont Workers\u2019 Center, calls Act 48 \u201ca pretty groundbreaking law.\u201d When it was approved, the rest of the country was embroiled in a debate over President Obama\u2019s considerably less progressive health reform law. And while that shift may have felt big for the country, it was small compared to what Vermonters were trying to accomplish. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to create a pretty huge paradigm shift in the way that health care is thought about,\u201d Marchenkova said.\n\nVermont wants no part in President Obama\u2019s signature health law. The Workers\u2019 Center sees it as simply a piecemeal reform \u2014 according to Marchenkova, \u201cit\u2019s trimming at the leaves of a very big problem, but it doesn\u2019t get to the root of the problem\u201d because it\u2019s still within the context of a system that gives control to the insurance industry. But the state couldn\u2019t immediately opt out of Obamacare, and was required to set up a health insurance marketplace under the law. Vermont plans to apply for a waiver to sidestep the Affordable Care Act beginning in 2017 so it can implement its own single-payer system.\n\nOn paper, the concept is pretty simple. Activists like Marchenkova and Schlosser want a health care system that\u2019s built around people\u2019s needs rather than profit margins. They don\u2019t want anyone to struggle to get medical care because they can\u2019t afford it, or because they work at a job that doesn\u2019t provide a generous health insurance package. They want the government to recognize health care as a public good, an intrinsic human right that every resident is entitled to receive regardless of their income or influence.\n\nWe\u2019re looking to create a pretty huge paradigm shift in the way that health care is thought about.\n\nAnd Act 48 actually enshrines that human rights perspective into law. The legislation stipulates that the forthcoming single-payer system must be based upon five fundamental principles of human rights: universality (everyone has to be included), equity (people pay what they can and get what they need), accountability (guided by people rather than by industries), transparency (decisions are being made in the public sphere), and participation (the people have the power to appeal to the legislature and change parts of the system).\n\nThe Vermont Workers\u2019 Center modeled that human rights framework after several international treaties \u2014 including the United Nations\u2019 International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which declares the right to \u201cthe highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,\u201d and which the United States has not ratified. Rather than pushing for a specific policy framework for a universal health care system, they lobbied for a new approach that honors human rights by sticking to those guiding principles. Now, lawmakers in the state will have to figure out how to make it work in practice.\n\nMarchenkova acknowledged that activists are up for a tough fight during the state\u2019s next legislative session, which is when the specific policies necessary to craft the new system \u2014 called Green Mountain Care \u2014 will begin to be hammered out. Her group will have to make sure the final law isn\u2019t weakened by insurers, lobbyists, or lawmakers. That\u2019s much easier said than done. Compared to every other sector in the country, the pharmaceutical and insurance industries are the ones that have spent the most money on influencing lawmakers over the past 16 years, nearly $400 billion dollars between the two in 2013 alone.\n\nIn Marchenkova\u2019s words, they\u2019re up against the entire status quo.\n\nNonetheless, grassroots organizers remain optimistic. They\u2019re hopeful about Vermont\u2019s future, as well as about the slow shift spreading across the country to reframe health care in terms of human rights.\n\n\u201cThis came about because of years of grassroots organizing on the ground. That\u2019s really what it takes,\u201d Marchenkova said. \u201cIt\u2019s a model that people can use in their own communities \u2014 it can be done. We want to be an inspiration to other parts of the country. I think it\u2019s really important that we start telling this story about the domino effect around the country because of grassroots movements that\u2019s going to change the way that health care looks in the United States.\u201d\n\nBringing more people into the conversation\n\nBut as the country remains embroiled in heated discussions over the Affordable Care Act \u2014 which is continually derided as socialism, even though it\u2019s not as dramatic of a reform as the type of universal health system that Vermont is fighting to enact \u2014 is it really possible that other states could make a similar move toward single payer? Is that a realistic goal, or mostly wishful thinking?\n\nIn response to that question, several activists who spoke with ThinkProgress pointed to Canada, whose single-payer system began in one province and eventually spread to the rest of the country. Saskatchewan, a rural and sparsely populated province that political scientists say didn\u2019t initially appear to be ripe for that kind of innovation, passed a law in 1946 to provide free hospital care to most residents. If the spark started in Saskatchewan and grew into national reform, perhaps the same process could be set in motion by Vermont.\n\nSome people outside of the center of the movement think that\u2019s a real possibility. \u201cIf the Vermont experiment works, other states will follow. American pragmatism will trump ideology,\u201d a recent New York Times op-ed argued. The progressive advocacy group Public Citizen has developed a guide for other states that want to follow in Vermont\u2019s footsteps; the first step, according to the legislative road map, is to pass a law like Act 48.\n\nPlus, \u201chuman rights\u201d activists think they\u2019ve hit on a messaging strategy that will propel them forward. Another volunteer with the Vermont Workers\u2019 Center pinpointed the problem with previous campaigns that have advocated for sweeping health care reform: \u201cWhen you talk to people about single payer, their eyes gloss over,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cThe human rights framework is much more straightforward. There\u2019s something very basic about the idea that we all get sick and want to stay healthy.\u201d\n\nOur legislators are not ready for this\u2026It\u2019s got to come from the ground up.\n\nDrew Christopher Joy, who works with the Southern Maine Workers\u2019 Center to lead a health care campaign in his own state, concurred with that assessment. \u201cWe think that people get really bogged down and have a lot of baggage around legislative terms and policy terms. Universal health care. Single payer. People have a lot of associations with those words, and it\u2019s a barrier for having the conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we all understand what it means to get health care and need health care, and we understand that better than single payer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of frustration around the way things work currently \u2014 like, \u2018this is broken,\u2019 \u201d Joy added. \u201cI think all of us have felt alienated at one point or another in trying to access health care. People are really ready to connect the dots and they\u2019re ready for an actual answer.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Maine, there are similar \u201chealth care as a human right\u201d campaigns growing in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and New York. Just as Marchenkova suggested, those efforts are modeling themselves after the groundwork that was laid in Vermont.\n\n\u201cOur legislators are not ready for this. But I think that the grassroots is,\u201d Joy said. \u201cSo our job is really to find supporters, move folks to action, build that power from the grassroots, and really show our legislators that people in the state are ready and they need to get with the times. It\u2019s got to come from the ground up.\u201d\n\nA human rights framework for health reform\n\nObamacare\u2019s coverage expansion certainly hasn\u2019t gone exactly as planned. Even as health reform marks its first milestones \u2014 surpassing its inaugural enrollment goal and contributing to a historic drop in the national uninsurance rate \u2014 it\u2019s not making equal gains in every area of the country. More than 20 states are still refusing to implement its Medicaid expansion, which the Supreme Court ruled optional when it upheld the law. It\u2019s part of a larger resistance among GOP-led states that don\u2019t want to be seen as facilitating reform, and it\u2019s particularly damaging to the millions of low-income Americans who are now caught in a coverage gap: making too much to qualify for public health insurance, but too little to qualify for federal subsidies to purchase a private plan on the new marketplaces. They\u2019re locked out of the promise of affordable health care altogether.\n\nBert Skellie, of Decatur, Georgia, protests for Medicaid expansion CREDIT: AP Photo/David Goldman\n\nFor thousands of activists across the country, this is the most prescient health care fight. They\u2019re filling their state capitols, engaging in acts of civil disobedience, holding \u201csick-ins\u201d in front of their governors\u2019 mansions, and using coffins as a symbol for the people who will die without access to affordable health care. They\u2019re not asking for single payer, but they are basing their rhetoric on the argument that resisting Medicaid expansion is a violation of human dignity and the right to life.\n\n\u201cThese are people, not statistics,\u201d Paul Gibbs, an activist in Utah who filmed a documentary called Entitled To Life to urge his lawmakers to expand Medicaid, explained. \u201cOnce you hear about someone who\u2019s working two jobs to support their kids while they\u2019re dying of cancer, or who is going to college despite a neurodegenerative disease, you start seeing it really differently. When you really look at the individual people who are affected by the loss of health care, that changes people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\nThe individuals working on \u201chealth care as a human right\u201d campaigns are conflicted about their role in advocating for Medicaid expansion as an incremental step toward their larger goal. The Southern Maine Workers\u2019 Center did lend its support to the statewide campaign to pressure the legislature to expand Medicaid. But in retrospect, Joy isn\u2019t sure that was the right strategic move \u2014 they didn\u2019t succeed, and he worries it distracted them from their primary grassroots push toward something bigger and better. He noted that the Affordable Care Act \u201ccomplicates the landscape\u201d for his work.\n\n\u201cWe do want to advocate for more people to have access to health care,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all a question of framing \u2014 how do we continue to have a conversation that says, when we say everyone needs health care, we really do mean everyone? How do we frame health care as a public good?\u201d\n\nOnce they start seeing it in those human rights terms, and seeing that people can\u2019t survive without it, there\u2019s real hope.\n\nFor Medicaid proponents, however, the push to extend public insurance coverage to additional low-income Americans is something that\u2019s perhaps winnable even before more states attempt their own versions of Act 48.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic about a future in which all states accept some form of Medicaid expansion,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cI really think that people care about each other \u2014 and once they start seeing it in those human rights terms, and seeing that people can\u2019t survive without it, there\u2019s real hope. It\u2019s hard for me to think of much of anything that\u2019s more of a fundamental human right than the right to stay healthy and alive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Is this the path to getting the country closer to a universal health care system?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Is this the path to getting the country closer to a universal health care system?", "title": "Beyond Obamacare: Health Care As A Human Right", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/18/3457941/health-care-human-right/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/healthcare_human_right-141.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is this the path to getting the country closer to a universal health care system?", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/healthcare_human_right-141-321x214.jpg", "title": "Beyond Obamacare: Health Care As A Human Right", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/healthcare_human_right-141.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/healthcare_human_right-141.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-18T13:10:24+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "All of a sudden, she was part of a movement of people insisting that health care is a human right.\n\u201cBut we all understand what it means to get health care and need health care, and we understand that better than single payer.\u201d\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of frustration around the way things work currently \u2014 like, \u2018this is broken,\u2019 \u201d Joy added.\nActivists like Marchenkova and Schlosser want a health care system that\u2019s built around people\u2019s needs rather than profit margins.\nIt\u2019s hard for me to think of much of anything that\u2019s more of a fundamental human right than the right to stay healthy and alive.\u201d\nThey want the government to recognize health care as a public good, an intrinsic human right that every resident is entitled to receive regardless of their income or influence."}
