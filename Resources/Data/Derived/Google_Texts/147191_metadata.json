Drivers on Arizona\u2019s main north-south freeway watched in shock as muddy waters submerged the road. Rescuers across the state rushed to save people trapped in cars and homes.\n\nThe Phoenix area was battered by torrential rain storms Tuesday that caused severe flooding across the desert region. The National Weather Service said some areas received more rain Tuesday than they had all last summer.\n\n\u201cIt looked absolutely devastating,\u201d said Gov. Jan Brewer, who was glued to the TV all day watching the rescues. \u201cFor the last 10, 15 years, we\u2019ve never seen anything the likes of this.\u201d\n\nA helicopter crew rescued two women and three dogs from a home surrounded by swift-moving waters in a town about 30 miles north of Phoenix, while elsewhere a small trailer park was evacuated, a school was flooded and first-responders pulled motorists from partially submerged vehicles.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for much of the metro area and north of the city, where up to 8 inches of rain fell by midday in some of the mountainous regions along Interstate 17, the main north-south freeway in Arizona.\n\nA river of muddy water rushed down I-17 about 25 miles north of Phoenix as motorists changed lanes to avoid the deluge. A stretch of freeway was shut down and reopened later in the day.\n\nIn another dramatic rescue, authorities pulled an elderly woman from a van stuck in rushing floodwaters, scenes repeated across the region throughout the day as motorists became trapped.\n\nOfficials said nearly 5 inches of rain fell around the town of New River, where a helicopter dropped two rescuers onto the roof of a home after one had been waving a white piece of fabric from a window to draw attention. The rescuers later walked the women and dogs to safety as the water receded.\n\n\u201cIt looks like the heavy rain is pulling out to the east and northeast out of that area,\u201d Woodall said Tuesday afternoon. \u201cBut with all the rain that fell this morning, we\u2019re going to see continued flooding, continued runoff probably into the early evening.\u201d\n\nKathy Mascaro said her typical 15-minute commute from home to work in the Phoenix area more than doubled because of the traffic nightmares caused by the flooding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy. You\u2019d think, how could the desert flood, but it really does,\u201d Mascaro said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this bad. I\u2019ve been here over 20 years and it has never flooded this bad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Floods force dramatic rescues in Phoenix area", "title": "Floods force dramatic rescues in Phoenix area", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Floods force dramatic rescues in Phoenix area", "title": "Floods force dramatic rescues in Phoenix area", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/20/floods_force_dramatic_rescues_in_phoenix_area/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/phoenix-flooding.jpeg16-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Floods force dramatic rescues in Phoenix area", "title": "Floods force dramatic rescues in Phoenix area", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/phoenix-flooding.jpeg16-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Skoloff and Paul Davenport", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Phoenix area was battered by torrential rain storms Tuesday that caused severe flooding across the desert region.\nA river of muddy water rushed down I-17 about 25 miles north of Phoenix as motorists changed lanes to avoid the deluge.\n\u201cIt looks like the heavy rain is pulling out to the east and northeast out of that area,\u201d Woodall said Tuesday afternoon.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Workers at a farm saw hundreds of cactuses sweep away in a flood.\nThe National Weather Service said some areas received more rain Tuesday than they had all last summer."}
