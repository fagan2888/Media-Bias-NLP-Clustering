Many of those people will be eligible for subsidies to help pay the monthly premiums of those plans.\n\nCovered California, the organization charged with creating this new insurance marketplace, estimates that about half of 5.3 million Californians needing individual insurance will be eligible for financial assistance with their premiums.\n\n\u201cThe great unknown in all this is when those people will choose to buy health insurance. One possibility is that many will wait to apply for coverage until a major health problem surfaces,\u201d Gilbert said, which will be bad for the financial health of the exchange.\n\n\u201cIt would be kind of like people waiting to get fire insurance until their house begins to catch fire,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGilbert said that estimates of how many of those 150,000 will sign up for a health plan offered through the exchange \u201cjump all over the place. I wouldn\u2019t want to even hazard a guess,\u201d he said.\n\nTo get the word out about new benefits and the insurance exchange, Loma Linda University Health and the Community Clinic Association of San Bernardino County, have won a $990,000 grant to conduct outreach and education programs.\n\nThe first effort is set to start Tuesday at SAC Health Systems, 1455 East Third St., on the former Norton Air Force Base.\n\nSan Bernardino County\u2019s Community Clinic Association, which incorporated in 2011, took a lead role in the grant proposal and is the main contractor for the grant, having hired seven employees to work full time on spreading information about the insurance exchange and other health care reform changes, said Matthew Keane, the clinic association\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nThe association staff will shelter the organization\u2019s 13 members, from having to send staff to education seminars and shift their duties to health care reform information education, Keane said.\n\nOf the San Bernardino County clinics, SAC Health Systems has navigated the most dramatic transformation to get ready, Keane said.\n\nTo qualify for certification as a Federally Qualified Health Center, which is where the Obama administration has been funneling money to support the Affordable Care Act, SAC Health Systems needed to disengage from the Loma Linda health system and incorporate as a separate entity, said Nancy Young, SAC\u2019s chief executive officer.\n\nAs a result of that action, SAC obtained the funding to let it move, on July 1, the Family Medical Practice internship program over to its building, where residents and attending physicians can be tapped to provide care to the poor.\n\nThe SAC organization is planning to request architectural plans be drawn for a proposed 150,000-square-foot downtown campus, on Interstate 215 freeway frontage property west of San Manuel Stadium.\n\nWhen it opens, which is expected in 2015, other primary care residency programs will move into it and eventually all Loma Linda University residency programs are expected to be folded into the new downtown campus, meaning that specialized medical services will be available to underserved residents as well, Young said.\n\nSan Bernardino-based Inland Behavioral and Health Services recently opened a new clinic in Banning and has been focused on building that operation, said Temetry Lindsey, president and chief executive officer.\n\nBeverly Speak, executive director and CEO of Kids Come First, said that even if some of her patients go elsewhere, there will still be a large number who are likely undocumented who will continue to see its specialists.\n\nDr. John Testerman, chairman of the Loma Linda Department of Family Medicine, said that the Inland Empire is going into the coming period of increased demand for primary care physicians with the lowest number in any region in California, only 40 per 100,000.\n\nThe recommended level is 60 to 80 per 100,000, with the state average of 63 \u201cbarely reaching the low end\u201d of the recommendation, Testerman said.\n\nThe recommended level of specialists is 85 to 105 per 100,000, while the two-county Inland Empire has 70 per 100,000, again the lowest in the state, he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Community clinics across the Inland Empire are scrambling to get ready for
