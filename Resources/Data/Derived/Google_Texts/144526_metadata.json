Rand Paul (R-Ky.) gets it. He knows that without young people there is no future for the Republican Party \u2014 and he\u2019s not afraid to be their champion.\n\nPaul appeared on Fox News Sunday this week, where host Chris Wallace asked the Senator about what winning the 2014 CPAC straw poll meant for his viability as a presidential candidate in 2016.\n\n\u201cWell you know, the one thing about CPAC is it\u2019s chock full of young people,\u201d Paul responded. \u201cThere\u2019s young people everywhere.\u201d\n\nAs a generation that is very connected through technology, the Senator told Wallace that he believes young people are very aware of their right to privacy. According to Paul, the government\u2019s invasion of data privacy is something that young people just don\u2019t \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 accept.\n\n\u201cI think not only conservative young people from colleges and high school, I think young people across the country are fed up with the government that says, \u2018Hey, the Fourth Amendment doesn\u2019t apply to your records, doesn\u2019t apply to your cell phone,'\u201d he said.\n\nPaul pointed out that President Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating among young people has fallen dramatically, even though the demographic overwhelmingly supported him in the 2012 presidential election. And that is an open invitation for Republicans to bring the \u201cenergy\u201d of young people into their party, the Kentucky Senator added.\n\nWallace also asked the question that everyone continues to wonder: will Paul actually be running for President in 2016? Although the Senator is still thinking about his options, he believes that he has a strong platform for the job.\n\n\u201cI think that the message that I\u2019m trying to promote, whether I do it [run for President] or not, of bringing our message to minority voters, to people who have been persecuted throughout history, to young people who feel like the government has grown too big \u2014 I think it\u2019s a message that can grow the party,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the party\u2019s got to grow bigger or we\u2019re not going to win again.\u201d\n\nPaul also tweeted about the youth vote on Sunday morning, around the same time as his TV appearance.\n\nThe Republican party needs to reach out to young people if we are going to win again. \u2014 Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) March 9, 2014\n\nYoung people have certainly taken notice of Paul\u2019s commitment to young people, as the CPAC straw poll made evident. With 42 percent of voters in the poll being students \u2014 and 46 of the voters being between the ages of 18-25 \u2014 it\u2019s no question that Paul\u2019s commanding win in the presidential preference category signals his support among Millennials.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Sen.
