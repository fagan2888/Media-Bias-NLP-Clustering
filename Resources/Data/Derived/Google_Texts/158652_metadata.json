Neuman and Kim Novak may all be headed to Chicago to live under the same roof.\n\nThe Windy City this week was tapped as the future home of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, the dream project of director George Lucas, whose credits include \"Star Wars,\" \"Indiana Jones\" and other blockbusters.\n\n\"LMNA will be a gathering place to experience narrative art and the evolution of the visual image\u2014from illustration to cinema to digital arts,\" reads a statement from the museum.\n\n\"I'm actually super excited about the Lucas museum because there hasn't been anything that looks at quite what they're going to look at,\" said Brooks Peck, a curator at the EMP Museum in Seattle, which focuses on music, sci-fi and pop culture. The Lucas project, which is still somewhat under wraps, looks like it will be \"highlighting very American art forms\" including the work of Norman Rockwell, special effects and sci-fi blockbusters, Peck said. \"These are all American inventions.\"\n\n\n\nThe website for the planned museum includes a neo-classical painting from Maxfield Parrish, a 1963 cover of MAD magazine, a pinup-style drawing of actress Kim Novak by Alberto Vargas and a still from the movie \"Rango.\" Peck said he's hoping the museum includes a lot of behind-the-scenes items, such as storyboards and technical equipment that is gaining in popularity at other museums,\n\nThe Lucas museum will \"be a gathering place to experience narrative art and the evolution of moving images\u2014from illustration to cinema to the digital mediums of the future. The museum's seed collection\u2014a gift from founder George Lucas\u2014spans a century-and-a-half and features the images and the mediums that have profoundly shaped our cultural heritage,\" according to the website.\n\nSeattle's EMP museum, co-founded by Microsoft's Paul Allen, has had some experience in this realm, including \"Icons of Science Fiction, Battlestar Galactica\" and \"Avatar: The Exhibition.\" The Avatar exhibition was a technical behind-the-scenes exhibition while the Battlestar Galactica show focused more on the story and themes, said Peck, who worked on both shows. \"Sci-fi allows you to explore different social problems a little bit removed because it makes it easier to talk about,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, this won't be the first time Lucas' work has found its way into a museum. In 1997, the hugely popular \"Star Wars: The Magic of Myth\" exhibition made its debut at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum and toured internationally for several years after.\n\n\n\nThat exhibition drew heavily on Joseph Campbell's view of the \"hero's journey\" drawing on mythical themes such as a young hero with faithful companions, an endangered maiden, a wise guide, monster combat, sacrifice and resurrection. And of course it included scale models of the Imperial Star Destroyer and the Millennium Falcon and costumes from the likes of R2-D2, C-3PO, Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Yoda, Boba Fett, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Maul and Jabba the Hutt.\n\n\"George was a good friend of Joseph Campbell, and has been a good friend to the Foundation,\" the not-for-profit Joseph Campbell Foundation said in a statement to CNBC. \"We admire and respect George's decision to share his extensive art collection with the public, and wish him success in finding an appropriate venue.\"\n\n\n\nRead MoreBucket list summer camps for grown-ups\n\n\n\nChicago this week was chosen as the winning city for the museum, which is planned to open by 2018. On Wednesday, the location was approved by Lucas' museum board members; their names have not yet been made public, a spokeswoman for the museum said.\n\n\"Choosing Chicago is the right decision for the Museum, but a difficult decision for me personally because of my strong personal and professional roots in the Bay Area,\" said Lucas, who set \"American Graffiti\" in his hometown of Modesto, California.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art aims to open in 2018, based on the personal collection of the \"Star Wars\" director.", "author": "Amy Langfield", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art aims to open in 2018, based on the personal collection of the \"Star Wars\" director.", "title": "George Lucas to open 'Star Wars' museum in Chicago", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/28/may-the-force-be-with-you-george-lucas-chooses-chicago-for-museum.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/27/101795916-129326805.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art aims to open in 2018, based on the personal collection of the \"Star Wars\" director.", "title": "May the force be with you: George Lucas chooses Chicago for museum", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/28/may-the-force-be-with-you-george-lucas-chooses-chicago-for-museum.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/27/101795916-129326805.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@AmyLangfield", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Road Warrior, Life, Road Warrior, Travel, Tourism, US: News, Entertainment, Chicago, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-06-28T09:51:51-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Road Warrior", "modified_time": "2014-06-28T09:51:52-0400", "tag": "Chicago"}, "pageNodeId": 101789370, "news_keywords": "Star Wars museum.
