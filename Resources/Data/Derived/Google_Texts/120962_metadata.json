The world may scoff, but there\u2019s always a contrarian to love what\u2019s loathed, a \u201cchic debunker of current anti-L.A. mythology,\u201d as Peter Plagens once labeled the English architecture critic Reyner Banham. In 1971, Banham wrote a book lauding the democratic virtues of Angeleno urbanism; the next year he produced the charming BBC documentary \u201cReyner Banham Loves Los Angeles.\u201d Joan Didion, another enamored arrival, famously savored the city\u2019s freeways. In this month\u2019s GQ, Brett Martin mounts a defense of Downtown L.A., of \u201cBlade Runner\u201d fame, which he calls \u201ca Great City in the heart of the City That Destroyed Cities.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s another piece of Los Angeles mythology that can be laid to rest: The city is not just for cars.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite the pristine, skyscraping Los Angeles of \u201cHer\u201d \u2014 whose protagonist never enters an automobile \u2014 but it is equally far from the sticky stereotype of the Missing Persons lyric, \u201cNobody walks in L.A.\u201d In fact, if that song, \u201cWalking in L.A.,\u201d maintains a curious cultural relevance here, it is precisely as a foil for planners, journalists and politicians defending the city\u2019s peripatetic appeal. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to the Missing Persons,\u201d Mayor Garcetti said in October. \u201cPeople do walk in L.A.!\u201d\n\nIndeed, the city is in the midst of a renaissance of walking, biking and public space. Since 2010, eight CicLAvia events have shut down miles of road for cyclists, walkers and joggers \u2014 the latest drawing over 100,000 people. Two weeks ago, the city drew 25,000 revelers to its inaugural New Year\u2019s Eve gathering in newly created Grand Park. WalkScore gives L.A. a higher rating than Portland, Pittsburgh and New Orleans. And sometime over the course of the next month, Garcetti will announce the candidates for his \u201cGreat Streets\u201d program, intended to remodel dozens of L.A.\u2019s thoroughfares as pedestrian destinations.\n\nBefore I could even begin to debunk the myth of auto-centric Los Angeles, however, L.A.\u2019s own complete streets advocates \u2014 aware of the conventions of the genre \u2014 gave me a preliminary debunking. \u201cThere\u2019s this recycled myth that L.A. was built around the car, and pretty much everyone who ever writes anything starts with that,\u201d explained Malcolm Carson, the policy director for environmental health at Community Health Councils, a local nonprofit. \u201cEmpirically, it\u2019s just not true. The vast majority was built around streetcar lines, the most extensive rail system in the world.\u201d\n\nSupporters of redesigned streets tend to recount this history, which offers a window on their mission in Los Angeles. \u201cThis vision of L.A. as the freeway capital of the world is only a small piece of what L.A. really represents,\u201d says Manal Aboelata, a managing director at Prevention Institute, which has pushed for more walkable communities in the city\u2019s poorer neighborhoods. \u201cIt has great bones. It has fantastic neighborhoods, many of them built at a time when designing was really for walkability.\u201d\n\nIn their view, building the freeways was the great experiment, the imported philosophy, the reshaping. And it never really worked. Traffic and air pollution pushed the city to reorganize its transportation future around a heavy rail system, which opened in 1990 and continues to expand. Banham had a bon mot for his assimilation \u2014 \u201cLike earlier generations of English intellectuals who taught themselves Italian in order to read Dante in the original,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI learned to drive in order to read Los Angeles in the original\u201d \u2014 but his premise was flawed. An older city was there. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to unearth that original blueprint,\u201d Carson says.\n\nNobody walks in L.A.? \u201cTotally wrong!\u201d exclaims urban designer Deborah Murphy, the founder of Los Angeles Walks, the city\u2019s pedestrian advocacy organization. \u201cLos Angeles is not a car community.\u201d\n\nThis has been true in parts of Central Los Angeles for some time, but the movement has certainly picked up steam since Murphy started L.A. Walks in 1998, which she attributes to the influence of a new generation of Angelenos. \u201cYounger people have decided not to own cars, take public transit, and be generally part of the solution rather than the problem. My generation had those ideals. But they weren\u2019t necessarily committed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The notoriously car-centric metropolis is reinventing its smoggy identity", "title": "L.A. ditches traffic jams: A Hollywood renaissance for walking and biking", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The notoriously car-centric metropolis is reinventing its smoggy identity", "title": "L.A. ditches traffic jams: A Hollywood renaissance for walking and biking", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/11/l_a_ditches_traffic_jams_a_hollywood_renaissance_for_walking_and_biking/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bicyclist_dream_city.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The notoriously car-centric metropolis is reinventing its smoggy identity", "title": "L.A. ditches traffic jams: A Hollywood renaissance for walking and biking", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bicyclist_dream_city.jpg", "creator": "@HenryGrabar", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Henry Grabar", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, biking, Cars, Dream City, Editor's Picks, L.A., Los Angeles, public spaces, traffic, Walking", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b53\"", "article_summary": "Topics: biking, Cars, Dream City, Editor's Picks, L.A., Los Angeles, public spaces, traffic, Walking, Innovation News, Sustainability NewsLos Angeles, like the maligned experiment of a famous artist, attracts its self-appointed champions.\n\u201cTotally wrong!\u201d exclaims urban designer Deborah Murphy, the founder of Los Angeles Walks, the city\u2019s pedestrian advocacy organization.\n\u201cLos Angeles is not a car community.\u201dThis has been true in parts of Central Los Angeles for some time, but the movement has certainly picked up steam since Murphy started L.A.\n\u201cPeople do walk in L.A.!\u201dIndeed, the city is in the midst of a renaissance of walking, biking and public space.\nAnd sometime over the course of the next month, Garcetti will announce the candidates for his \u201cGreat Streets\u201d program, intended to remodel dozens of L.A.\u2019s thoroughfares as pedestrian destinations."}
