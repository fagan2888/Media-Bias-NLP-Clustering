Barack Obama spent Valentine's Day with what appears to be his first love - golf.

He arrived in Palm Springs on Saturday morning, meeting up with childhood friends who had flown in from Hawaii, leaving his wife and children behind.

It is the second consecutive year they have been apart while the president played golf in Florida.

He did not forget his wife, however, and managed to show his romantic streak with a mention for her at the end of his weekly, televised address, which for the most part focused on education policy.

"Thanks, and before I go - Happy Valentine's Day, Michelle," he said. "Have a great weekend, everybody."

For her part, Michelle Obama had to send her Valentines greetings to her husband via her official twitter account, where she posted a picture of the two of them in a tender moment and quoted Beatles lyrics.

For the rest of the day, Mt Obama played several rounds on a nine-hole course. His playing partners were his old friends from Hawaii, Bobby Titcomb and Greg Orme, along with Marty Nesbitt, from Chicago, according to the White House.

Mr Obama's fondness for golf - particularly at times of crisis - has been frequently seized on by his critics.

Meanwhile, Bill and Hillary Clinton also took to Twitter for a gentle dose of Valentine's Day flirting.

The former president posted a picture of the couple dancing.

I hope you dance, especially today. pic.twitter.com/gd1e306gNT — Bill Clinton (@billclinton) February 14, 2015

Which prompted this response from his wife.
