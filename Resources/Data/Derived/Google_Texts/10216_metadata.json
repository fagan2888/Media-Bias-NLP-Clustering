For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly \u201cCurrent Wisdom.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nOn Page 3 of Friday\u2019s Washington Post is (yet another) lurid climate story, this time about mega-droughts of several decades that are going to pop up in the Pacific Southwest around 35 years from now. The findings are based upon the UN\u2019s climate model suite that, according to our presentation to the American Geophysical Union, is in the process of failing, because it just isn\u2019t warming at the rate they project. Here, for example, is a graphic from John Christy and Dick McNider of the University of Alabama-Huntsville, showing the growing disparity.\n\nThe work cited in the Post ignores this teensy-weensy little problem and, instead drives the models with the UN\u2019s biggest scenario for future carbon dioxide emissions, something that natural gas, which emits much less carbon dioxide than coal when used for electrical generation, is in the process of burying.\n\nBut it gets worse.\n\nDroughts in the Pacific Southwest are usually broken by the big pacific climate oscillation known as El Ni\u00f1o. They occur every four to eight years or so. So, in order to have decades of drought, there has to be decades without El Ni\u00f1os.\n\nThe overdriven, overheated climate models used in this study cannot simulate them with any degree of realism.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in the Post article, study co-author Toby Ault\n\nhad a word of caution. Weather conditions can vary, climate impacts can be mitigated, and the warnings of the study might not come to pass. A single El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern in the West could interrupt periods of prolonged drought.\n\nAt least younger climate scientists like assistant professor Ault are getting wiser. The fates willing, he\u2019s going to live another 35 years, and we hope much longer. And when those pesky El Ni\u00f1os (along with many other potential co-conspirators) destroy the forecast of gloom and doom, he\u2019ll be able to say that he warned that could happen, because the models his team used didn\u2019t have a good handle on them.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Overheated rhetoric about the potential for global warming-spawned Southwest megadroughts.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Overheated rhetoric about the potential for global warming-spawned Southwest megadroughts.", "title": "Mega Drought in the Pacific Southwest?", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/mega-drought-pacific-southwest", "image": "http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/wp-content/uploads/gsr_021315_fig1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/mega-drought-pacific-southwest", "creator": "@CatoInstitute", "description": "Overheated rhetoric about the potential for global warming-spawned Southwest megadroughts.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mega Drought in the Pacific Southwest?"}, "site": "Cato Institute", "robots": "noodp", "node_creation_date": "2015/2/13", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "publication_date": "2015/2/14", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T20:32:13-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Droughts in the Pacific Southwest are usually broken by the big pacific climate oscillation known as El Ni\u00f1o.\nThe overdriven, overheated climate models used in this study cannot simulate them with any degree of realism.\nSo, in order to have decades of drought, there has to be decades without El Ni\u00f1os.\nA single El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern in the West could interrupt periods of prolonged drought.\nThe findings are based upon the UN\u2019s climate model suite that, according to our presentation to the American Geophysical Union, is in the process of failing, because it just isn\u2019t warming at the rate they project."}
