They can be incredibly rewarding, but disagreements have a way of creating very tense\u2013and sometimes awkward\u2013family gatherings. In Wisconsin, Democrat Mary Burke is trying to get enough votes to hand incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker a pink slip come Election Day. Burke is trying to run as a moderate, business oriented Democrat that will work in a bipartisan way to get Wisconsin back on track. Politico did an interesting profile on her this past August:\n\nThe 55-year-old Burke could hardly be more different than Walker. She\u2019s a Harvard-educated multimillionaire who rarely goes to church; he\u2019s a middle-class son of a preacher who is just now trying to complete his college degree. She\u2019s spent her career in the family business and philanthropy; he\u2019s been in government for two decades. She\u2019s spent much of her campaign trying to win over progressives wary of her background in finance; he became a conservative icon after beating back the unions in an epic clash two years ago. \u201cI knew I probably didn\u2019t fit the typical mold,\u201d Burke said during an interview, as her campaign bus rolled from a hops farm in Mazomanie to a brewery in Potosi. \u201cWhile I have the business background, I really \u2014 how should I say this? \u2014 I prefer the work in the public sector.\u201d Burke is pitching herself as a nonideological antidote to the rancor and polarization of the Walker years. She introduces herself as \u201ca fiscal conservative\u201d and promises to work with the Republican-controlled Legislature. Though she talks around it on the trail, she would not, for instance, work to fully repeal the union-weakening law that has defined Walker\u2019s tenure. Burke\u2019s bet is twofold: First, that liberals despise Walker enough to mobilize for her in spite of her pro-business profile. Second, that her corporate bona fides will attract a critical mass of moderates worried about Wisconsin\u2019s lagging economy.\n\nThere\u2019s only one problem: her own family reportedly fired her for incompetence.\n\nBurke\u2019s family co-founded the Trek Bicycle Corporation, with Mary becoming their director for European Operations. Let\u2019s just say it was sort of a disaster. She was called \u201cAttila the Hun\u201d and a \u201cpit bull on crack\u201d (via Watchdog):\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a pretty picture. The European operations were in disarray, [Gary] Ellerman[ Trek\u2019s human resources for 21 years] said. Full disclosure: Ellerman is chairman of the Jefferson County Republican Party. As to the possibility that his accounts are politically colored, Ellerman said, \u201cI was there. This is what went down.\u201d A former employee with the company told Wisconsin Reporter that John Burke, Mary\u2019s brother and current Trek president, had to let his sister go. \u2026 In her campaign against Republican incumbent Gov. Scott Walker, Mary Burke has bragged that European sales climbed to $50 million on her watch. She originally said the increase was closer to $60 million in a 2004 resume to officials in Gov. Jim Doyle\u2019s administration, the Democrat who in 2005 tapped Burke to be his secretary of the now-defunct state Commerce Department. Ellerman and the other employees tell Wisconsin Reporter that Burke\u2019s sales boasts are lies, that the European division did significantly lower numbers \u2014 at least $10 million lower \u2014 during her tenure as director. Most of the sales increases, they said, were in Trek\u2019s United Kingdom market, which was well established before Burke arrived, and in the Japan operations, which Burke had nothing to do with. Any growth in sales was well offset by the losses sustained in Germany and other European countries, according to the former executives. Trek is a privately held company and does not disclose its sales or earnings figures. Mary Burke, too, has refused to provide documentation of the numbers. When asked to apologize to staff before her departure from the company in 1993, Mary Burke struggled and stammered through the apology much as she appears to do in a video clip of the gubernatorial candidate trying to define the word \u201cplagiarism,\u201d according to one former Trek employee. The Democrat has been dogged throughout her campaign by revelations she lifted large sections of her policy plans from other sources.\n\nYes, Ellerman is a Republican operative and unnamed sources could lead to disaster when it comes to getting a story straight, but as Guy wrote over at Hot Air, \u201cgiven how unfairly Walker\u2019s been treated by the local and national media throughout this campaign, I guess Burke is due for some negative press of possibly dubious provenance.\u201d\n\nIt is just food for thought.\n\nIn other news, Walker is surging, up 7 points over Burke 50/43 in the latest Marquette Law School poll. It was taken out of a sample of 1,164 likely voters. With women voters, the poll found Walker competing nicely with Burke, only trailing by 6 points 49/43. Independent voters are splitting overwhelmingly for Walker 52/37 over Burke\u2013and more Walker supporters say they will vote next week than Burke\u2019s.\n\nSounds like he\u2019s in good shape.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She was called \"Attila the Hun\" and a \"pit bull on crack\".05/27/2016 0:20:58AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "She was called \"Attila the Hun\" and a \"pit bull on crack\"", "title": "Matt Vespa - Oh Geez: Mary Burke's Family Reportedly Terminated Her For 'Incompetence'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/10/29/oh-geez-mary-burkes-family-reportedly-terminated-her-for-incompetence-n1911613", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/290/0ad4c3d0-2c5a-46b0-a5f3-a8b8ca6db0df.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "She was called \"Attila the Hun\" and a \"pit bull on crack\"", "title": "Matt Vespa - Oh Geez: Mary Burke's Family Reportedly Terminated Her For 'Incompetence'", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/10/29/oh-geez-mary-burkes-family-reportedly-terminated-her-for-incompetence-n1911613", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/290/0ad4c3d0-2c5a-46b0-a5f3-a8b8ca6db0df.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Oh Geez: Mary Burke's Family Reportedly Terminated Her For 'Incompetence', Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Scott Walker, Mary Burke has bragged that European sales climbed to $50 million on her watch.\nIn Wisconsin, Democrat Mary Burke is trying to get enough votes to hand incumbent Republican Gov.\nMary Burke, too, has refused to provide documentation of the numbers.\nBurke\u2019s family co-founded the Trek Bicycle Corporation, with Mary becoming their director for European Operations.\nIndependent voters are splitting overwhelmingly for Walker 52/37 over Burke\u2013and more Walker supporters say they will vote next week than Burke\u2019s."}
