When it comes to getting the nutrients we need, the best possible source is food, specifically fruits and vegetables. They lend support to our bodies, which can’t produce enough of the nutrients necessary for it to function properly. When the food necessary to attain the recommended daily intake of these vitamins isn't available, however, there are supplement pills. But what role do specific vitamins play when it comes to our health?

Vitamins A to K all have important jobs in the body. They can be grouped into two categories: fat-soluble vitamins, which are stored in the body’s fatty tissue (vitamins A, D, E, and K), and water-soluble vitamins, which the body uses right away. Vitamin B12 is the only water-soluble vitamin that can be stored in the liver for many years.
