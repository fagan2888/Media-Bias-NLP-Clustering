He put his hands on his hips and slouched off the mound. \u201cDouble,\u201d he thought. \u201cNo-doubt double.\u201d\n\nThe ball was tailing to the gap in left-center field, sailing toward no-man\u2019s land between two reserve outfielders. The left fielder, rookie Steven Souza Jr., tracked it toward the warning track. The ball dipped toward the ground. Souza dove. The ball dove. Souza won. And in the middle of the infield, Zimmermann stopped in his tracks and threw his hands up in the air.\n\n\u201cWhatever [Souza] wants, he can have,\u201d Zimmermann said. \u201cI\u2019ll buy him anything.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: MLB playoffs set as A\u2019s, Tigers, Cardinals clinch on final day\n\nAfter throwing the first no-hitter in Washington Nationals history in a 1-0 victory over the Miami Marlins, Zimmermann didn\u2019t know how to act, or what to do. His teammates sprinted from the dugout, from the bullpen, from the outfield, mobbing him at the pitcher\u2019s mound. He later took a shaving cream pie to the face. When Doug Fister and Tyler Moore came with the Gatorade bath, Zimmermann turned and faced the celebration head on.\n\n\u201cWhen I first got called up [to the majors], I thought there was no way this would ever happen,\u201d Zimmermann said. \u201cMy career numbers are something like one hit per inning, so I figure if I can make it out of the first, the hit\u2019s coming in the second. But today was one of those special days.\u201d\n\nZimmermann struck out 10 batters, walked one and threw 104 pitches. Only two batters reached base against him: Justin Bour on a fifth-inning walk and Garrett Jones, who struck out on a wild pitch in the seventh but beat the throw to first base.\n\nIt was the first no-hitter for the franchise since Montreal Expos right-hander Dennis Martinez threw a perfect game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 28, 1991. And it was the first no-hitter in Washington, D.C., since Aug. 8, 1931, when Senators left-hander Bobby Burke blanked the Red Sox, 5-0, at Griffith Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen very often,\u201d manager Matt Williams said. \u201cHe was in command from the beginning. His pitch count was low, which helps. There was never a thought of taking him out until he gave up a hit.\u201d\n\nZimmermann exuded calm from the moment he arrived at Nationals Park on Sunday morning. He walked into the clubhouse with a smile. He changed into a pair of Zubaz pants. He joked with Moore about remembering to set his fantasy football lineup.\n\nThat demeanor stayed with Zimmermann when he walked to the mound in the first inning. He battled through a 10-pitch at-bat against Marlins leadoff hitter Christian Yelich. Then he went to work.\n\nZimmermann retired the next two hitters in seven pitches. He got through the second inning in 10. The third and fourth innings were clinical: an 11-pitch third, featuring two strikeouts, and a six-pitch fourth.\n\nIt was around that time when pitching coach Steve McCatty leaned over to Williams in the dugout. Zimmermann had been hit by a line drive in his previous start, leaving a mess of black and blue bruises on his right shoulder. With the playoffs approaching, the coaching staff had planned to only let him pitch six innings Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do if we\u2019re going to give him six and he doesn\u2019t have a hit?\u2019 McCatty asked.\n\nWilliams glared back. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d he said.\n\nBut as the hitless innings passed by, the reality of the situation became more and more clear. Zimmermann walked Bour with two outs in the fifth \u2014 \u201cStill burns me a little bit,\u201d he said afterwards \u2014 but was otherwise dialed in. In the final regular-season game for both teams, the Marlins were swinging freely, playing to Zimmermann\u2019s strength as a pitch-to-contact starter.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of the game to the end of the game, he was aggressive,\u201d catcher Wilson Ramos said. \u201cHe was aggressive all game long. That\u2019s a guy like that we need in the playoffs.\u201d\n\nRamos didn\u2019t start thinking about the possibility of a no-hitter until the eighth inning. The thought first passed through Zimmermann\u2019s head in the fifth. He hit a one-out single in that frame, then added another base hit in the seventh.\n\nThe feeling on the field was otherwise normal. Zimmermann comfortable and confident. He was \u201ctalking trash, especially about the two hits that he had,\u201d Kevin Frandsen said. \u201cThat\u2019s Jordan.\u201d\n\nIn the dugout, however, the tension was there. The bench was silent. Williams, McCatty and bench coach Randy Knorr walked down the tunnel to the clubhouse when they had to talk. In the bullpen, the situation was acknowledged but never spoken out loud.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just the biggest elephant in the world in the room,\u201d closer Drew Storen said.\n\nBy the time Souza entered the game in the ninth, Zimmermann was pumping fastballs down the middle of the plate. His last, a 2-1 four-seamer to Yelich, found Souza, the organization\u2019s minor league player of the year and the MVP of the International League with Triple-A Syracuse.\n\nFifteen players took the field behind Zimmermann as Williams cycled his regular position players out of the game. The last to come on, Souza, made the most important play.\n\n\u201cJust an epic day for an epic season,\u201d Denard Span said. \u201cThere\u2019s just no other fitting way to end a storybook regular season than to end it with a no-hitter.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals will take Monday off then return to the park on Tuesday for the first of three days of workouts. The postseason, and a first-round meeting with either the San Francisco Giants or the Pittsburgh PIrates, awaits.\n\nBut on Sunday, it was all about the now. It was about basking in the glow of history, if only for a day. It was about Zimmermann walking through the clubhouse, his arm wrapped in ice to the shoulder, and finding Souza to share a hug. \u201cLove you bro,\u201d Souza said.\n\nFor one day, the playoffs could wait.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only two batters reached base against him: Justin Bour on a fifth-inning walk and Garrett Jones, who struck out on a wild pitch but beat the throw to first base.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Only two batters reached base against him: Justin Bour on a fifth-inning walk and Garrett Jones, who struck out on a wild pitch but beat the throw to first base.", "title": "Jordan Zimmermann throws no-hitter vs. Marlins in Nationals\u2019 regular-season finale", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/28/jordan-zimmermann-throws-no-hitter-vs-marlins-nati/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/28/marlins-nationals-bas_lanc7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/28/marlins-nationals-bas_lanc7.jpg", "description": "Only two batters reached base against him: Justin Bour on a fifth-inning walk and Garrett Jones, who struck out on a wild pitch but beat the throw to first base.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jordan Zimmermann throws no-hitter vs. Marlins in Nationals\u2019 reg"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jordan Zimmermann, Steven Souza Jr, Matt Williams"}, "article_summary": "Ball met bat Sunday afternoon and Jordan Zimmermann threw his head back in disgust.\nZimmermann walked Bour with two outs in the fifth \u2014 \u201cStill burns me a little bit,\u201d he said afterwards \u2014 but was otherwise dialed in.\nAnd in the middle of the infield, Zimmermann stopped in his tracks and threw his hands up in the air.\nBy the time Souza entered the game in the ninth, Zimmermann was pumping fastballs down the middle of the plate.\nFifteen players took the field behind Zimmermann as Williams cycled his regular position players out of the game."}
