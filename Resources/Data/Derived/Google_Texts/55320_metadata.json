Bill Cassidy, R-La., is launching a new Senate ad Saturday featuring former supporters of Democratic Sen. Mary L. Landrieu.\n\nThe spot, shared first with CQ Roll Call, showcases three women who say they've previously voted for the three-term incumbent and list Landrieu's support for the Affordable Care Act as the main reason they now back her leading Republican challenger.\n\n\"We're voting for Bill Cassidy,\" one of the women says. \"He stands up to Barack Obama,\" says another. \"And he'll vote to repeal and replace Obamacare,\" says the third.\n\nThe ad will run statewide and is initially backed by a $400,000 buy, according to a Cassidy campaign aide. www.youtube.com/watch?v=us7RnWIu7u8\n\nWith multiple candidates running in the November jungle primary, Landrieu and Cassidy are likely to advance to the Dec. 6 runoff. The contest is a top target of national Republicans, who need a net gain of six seats to win the Senate majority.\n\nThe race is rated a Tossup by the Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call.\n\nRelated Stories: Bill Cassidy Dips Into Landrieu Territory for Votes Voters, Tigers and Beers \u2014 Oh My!
