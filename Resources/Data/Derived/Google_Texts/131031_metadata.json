Dave Brat (R-VA). (AP photo)\n\n(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) gave his own Republican congressional leadership a failing grade for not going \u201call in\u201d to solve the nation\u2019s fiscal problems and for not fighting President Obama\u2019s executive overreach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d give them all F\u2019s. Fail. We did not fight. We didn\u2019t win. My district sent me up here to score some points,\u201d Brat said Friday after C-SPAN Washington Journal host Peter Slen asked the Tea Party-backed freshman congressman what he thought about House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s leadership over the past year.\n\nBrat noted the Republican-controlled Congress\u2019 failure to defund Planned Parenthood in the wake of graphic undercover videos released by the Centers for Medical Progress showing the harvesting of fetal organs by the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider as just one example of the GOP leadership\u2019s failure to make an impact.\n\n\u201cOur leadership has said we\u2019re going to fight, we\u2019re going to fight, we\u2019re going to fight. And then Planned Parenthood, we\u2019ve got these horrendous videos now that everybody is\u2026nobody can even watch them and think through what that is. The human mind just recoils from having to picture that.\n\n\u201cAnd so, am I happy with leadership? No, we\u2019re not winning. If those were my students\u2019 papers, on those range of papers I\u2019d give them all F\u2019s. Fail. We did not fight. We didn\u2019t win.\n\n\u201cMy district sent me up here to score some points,\u201d he added.\n\nBrat also pointed out that the GOP leadership did not stop the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from imposing increasingly harsh regulations on ranchers, farmers and small business owners, and allowed the Obama administration to push through its nuclear deal with Iran without getting the approval of two-thirds of the Senate.\n\nHe said he hoped Congress would not repeat the same mistake it made last year when it passed a \u201ccromnibus\u201d bill to keep the federal government funded that also contained funding for President Obama's executive amnesty.\n\n\u201cAnd so we ended up funding something that in my mind and most peoples\u2019 minds was unconstitutional. Our leadership said we\u2019re going to fight tooth and nail, right? This was the first round \u2013 maybe not the first \u2013 but it was a round of extreme executive overreach, right, presidential powers. And the entire year, that has continued.\u201d\n\nRelated: Conservatives Lambaste 20 GOP Senators Who Voted for Amnesty\n\nRelated: Congressman-Elect Dave Brat on Obamacare: 'It's Moved to the Kitchen Table'", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-hollingsworth/conservatives-lambaste-20-gop-senators-who-voted-amnestyRep.
