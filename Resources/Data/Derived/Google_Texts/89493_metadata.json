But whatever your view on the proper level for the minimum wage, an increase will benefit a relatively small segment of the workforce. Here's a look at three other labor issues that deserve increased attention and have the potential to affect more people.\n\nAn aging workforce: Perhaps no issue will have a greater influence on workplaces over the next decade than baby boomers' march toward retirement. By 2020, when all baby boomers will have reached age 55, workers 55 or older are projected to comprise more than 20 percent of the labor pool. That has two important effects: It puts pressure on employers find the most productive way to use these experienced employees, and it reduces opportunities for younger workers.\n\nBalancing the desire of many older workers to remain on the job, whether for financial reasons or personal fulfillment, and the need of young employees to gain experience and move up the career ladder will be one of the trickiest workplace issues of the next decade. The only scenario that provides adequate opportunity for both groups is robust economic growth that creates new jobs.\n\nRetirement savings: Perhaps the most important thing that young workers can learn from baby boomers is the importance of saving. Many are headed toward an underfunded retirement, which puts pressure on them to work past the traditional retirement age of 65.\n\nRetirement planning underwent a sea change between the time today's older workers took their first jobs and today. In 1964, when the first baby boomers turned 18, defined-benefit pensions were common. It still was a realistic goal to graduate from high school, get a good job, stay with one employer and retire with a pension. That path has become a dead end for most private-sector workers. Defined-contribution plans, which did not exist until Congress authorized creation of individual retirement accounts in 1974, have become the primary retirement tool. But most workers have contributed too little to IRAs or 401ks.\n\nThe Oregon Legislature this year authorized a new state retirement program for workers whose employers don't offer one. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez praised it in a recent trip to Portland, but it must be noted that the plan is intended to be only a steppingstone for workers. Its contribution limits are too low to allow participants to accumulate adequate retirement savings.\n\nNo single program can come close to averting the nation's looming retirement crisis, but for younger workers the most important step may be improved financial education. Those who make wise decisions early in their working lives have the best chance to retire financially secure.\n\nThe cost of child care: Oregon is tied with California for the second-highest child-care costs, as a percentage of median income, in the nation. The annual cost of $11,078 is 15.3 percent of median income for a working couple in Oregon. If the state increases the minimum wage to $13.50 or $15, those costs are almost certain to climb since child care is a low-margin, labor-dependent business.\n\nIn a recent meeting with The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, Labor Secretary Perez acknowledged that workers need help with child care, though he argued that restraining wages is the wrong way to achieve that goal. He has logic on his side. Surely most parents care more about the quality of workers taking care of their children than the ones pumping their gas or taking their orders at fast-food restaurants. Unfortunately, most parents simply can't afford to pay providers what they probably think they deserve.\n\nPerez suggested offsetting child-care costs through tax credits and other subsidies. Of course, the money that goes toward child care won't be available for other government programs. Child advocates would like to see more employers embrace flexible scheduling, but increased government mandates like Oregon's new sick leave law actually make it more difficult for some businesses \u2013 particularly small ones \u2013 to be flexible.\n\nThe complexity of the problem is one reason it hasn't been solved. But fewer than one-third of children have a stay-at-home parent. They would benefit from a serious discussion about how to make child care more affordable without reducing quality.\n\nAs campaigns for mayor, governor and president heat up in the coming year, these three issues deserve attention. Making progress on even one would help more people and do more to boost the economy than raising the minimum wage.\n\n--The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Oregon, editorial-opinion, labor day, labor day 2015, mark hester editorials, unions, opinion", "title": "Labor Day issues with a bigger impact than the minimum wage: Editorial", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Labor Day issues with a bigger impact than the minimum wage: Editorial\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/09/labor_day_issues_with_a_bigger.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/2015/09/04/18689986-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"16878615\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-06T22:30:45Z\", \"author\": \"The Oregonian Editorial Board\", \"tags\": [\"@business\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"editorial-opinion\",\"labor day\",\"labor day 2015\",\"mark hester editorials\",\"unions\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/2015/09/04/18689986-standard.jpg", "creator": "@oregonian", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Three workplace issues that deserve increased attention from businesses and political leaders."}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, September 06, 2015,  3:30 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"Labor issues overshadowed by minimum wage: Editorial\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/opinion_impact/photo/2015/09/04/labor-dayjpg-419ea253c27059b7.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"oliveoregedb\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Oregonian Editorial Board\", \"author_id\": \"1826714\", \"source_blog_name\": \"The Stump\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Three workplace issues that deserve increased attention from businesses and political leaders.", "title": "Labor Day issues with a bigger impact than the minimum wage: Editorial", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/09/labor_day_issues_with_a_bigger.html", "image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/opinion_impact/photo/2015/09/04/18689986-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article": {"author": "http://"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, September 06, 2015,  3:30 PM", "article_author": "The Oregonian Editorial Board", "Description": "Three workplace issues that deserve increased attention from businesses and political leaders."}, "article_summary": "There's little doubt what the most popular topic will be at many union-sponsored rallies this Labor Day: the minimum wage.\nMaking progress on even one would help more people and do more to boost the economy than raising the minimum wage.\nBut whatever your view on the proper level for the minimum wage, an increase will benefit a relatively small segment of the workforce.\nThey would benefit from a serious discussion about how to make child care more affordable without reducing quality.\nThe cost of child care: Oregon is tied with California for the second-highest child-care costs, as a percentage of median income, in the nation."}
