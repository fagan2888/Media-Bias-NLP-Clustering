Watching Jon pace the stage with a tiny microphone talking politics while saying the F-word in a place designed for the most beautiful music in the world. There was still hope.\n\nSee, there was a time in America when Jon Stewart, the host of \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d was for many Americans the most trusted name in news. Not the most trusted name in comedy, but news.\n\nThat time has passed.\n\nMore than fifteen years after its debut on a network whose name should have given us a clue to the show\u2019s true allegiance, \u201cThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart\u201d (which premiered in 1999 after giving Craig Kilborn the old heave-ho as the original \u201cDaily Show\u201d host) has gone from an invaluable bullshit detector on a government waging unjust wars on a mad hunt for nonexistent weapons of mass destruction, to, at best, an armchair activist\u2019s watercooler conversation starter (\u201cHey, did you hear what Jon Stewart said last night?\u201d \u201cYeah, I feel like I know everything there is to know about the Middle East now. Want to hit up the falafel cart for lunch?\u201d) and at worst, a \u201cnews\u201d program that\u2019s as guilty of cheerleading some of President Obama\u2019s worst offenses as Fox \u201cNews\u201d was of rooting for Dubya\u2019s never-ending wars.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There was once a time when \"The Daily Show\" was truly groundbreaking.
