Both men can take some consolation in having beaten a 21-year-old girl, the misbehaving singer Miley Cyrus.\n\nIf only all Sisi\u2019s ambitions were so harmless.\n\nIn the name of countering the threat of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Sisi-headed Egyptian military, which ousted the Brotherhood-backed president, Mohammad Morsi, in July, has drafted a new constitution.\n\nOddly, the draft is even more \u201cIslamic\u201d than the three constitutions approved and then canceled since the fall of then-president Hosni Mubarak in 2011.\n\nIt was ostensibly in response to mass demonstrations against Morsi that the military, led by Gen. Abdul-Fattah al-Sisi, staged its coup. Yet the draft imposes a virtual ban on \u201cunauthorized\u201d public gatherings. (Last week, a group of women were sentenced to long prison terms for participation in a small \u201cunauthorized\u201d demonstration.)\n\nThe draft also declares Islam to be the official religion of the Egyptian state, thus dashing hopes of having Christian Egyptians, some 15 percent of the population, treated as equal citizens. It also states the Islamic shariah is \u201cthe principal source of legislation,\u201d rather than \u201ca source,\u201d as in previous drafts.\n\nAnd the draft revives the Ottoman system of millat, which grants non-Muslims the right to manage their personal affairs in accordance with the rules of their respective religions. So non-Muslim Egyptians could consume alcohol, give their daughters an equal share in inheritance and adopt children. Denied those \u201cprivileges,\u201d Muslim men would enjoy the right to take four legal wives.\n\nWith its 244 articles, the military\u2019s text may be the longest constitution in the world. It covers a wide range of issues, from special rights for the military to \u201csupervise\u201d the affairs of the nation to state protection for Egyptian fishermen in the Mediterranean.\n\nMore important, the draft tries to perpetuate the structures of the dictatorship of 1952- 2011, with the military maintaining its position as a state within the state and the top brass enjoying exceptional economic and social privileges.\n\nApart from those craving for democracy, the biggest losers would be women and Egyptian Christians. Yet there will also be losers on the Islamist front.\n\nEver since it emerged as a major trend in Egypt in the 19th century, political Islam there has featured different ideological groups competing against one another. Even within the two main camps, the Brotherhood and the Salafists, various factions have been at odds, thus preventing the imposition of a monolithic version of political Islam.\n\nBut the new draft tries to end that diversity by promoting a single Islamist brand in alliance with the military.\n\nWill Egyptians agree to such a big step backward? Will they not wonder how their mass movement, proudly dubbed \u201cour revolution,\u201d ended with so fusty an agenda?\n\nSo far, none of the parties and groups that staged the mass demonstrations in Tahrir Square has endorsed the draft. The only endorsement has come from the an-Nour (Light) Party, a Salafist outfit.\n\nStill, Sisi plans to fast-track his draft in a referendum dominated by the military and its allies. The media, now again under state control, offer little opportunity for critics to make their case.\n\nSisi has also opted to fast-forward to presidential election, presumably with himself as the favorite. Despite official denials, groups to \u201cdraft\u201d Sissi for president are mushrooming across Egypt.\n\nSisi\u2019s supporters say he wants to adopt the \u201cTurkish model,\u201d wherein Islam is controlled by the state that is itself controlled by the military. Oddly, the Turkish leader Erdogan is trying to ditch that model by shaking off state control of religious institutions in Turkey.\n\nBoth men are making the same mistake from two different directions. Each refuses to understand that what Egyptians and Turks want is a clear demarcation between the political and religious spaces in societies that aspire after democracy.\n\nSisi may have \u201cwon\u201d a Man of the Year poll, but for most Egyptians the year which he is man of is not 2013, but 1952, when the generals seized power.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "So Egypt\u2019s Gen.
