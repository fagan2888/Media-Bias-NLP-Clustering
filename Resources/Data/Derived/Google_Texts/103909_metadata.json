Hundreds of UCSB faculty and staff gathered on campus Thursday to voice their concerns about the changes, railing against being left out of the negotiations and now being asked to decide on new plans in the next several weeks before they take effect in January.\n\nFor the entire UC system, Anthem plans will no longer be available in 2014, and neither will an existing Health Net HMO plan. To replace the Anthem plans, the university system will offer UC Care, a three-tiered system, and a Blue Shield Health Savings Plan. Two of its current HMO plans \u2014 one through Kaiser and another called Health Net Blue & Gold \u2014 will remain as options.\n\nUCSB employees are upset, though, over the first tier of UC Care, a $20 copay PPO plan which has contracted primarily with UC medical centers, which UCSB doesn\u2019t have. And the only medical facilities in the area that have agreed to accept Tier 1 so far \u2014 negotiations with insurance representatives for Sansum and Cottage are still ongoing, UC officials say \u2014 are in Lompoc, Santa Maria, and Ventura. The second tier of UC Care \u2014 also a PPO plan \u2014 will work at Sansum and Cottage, but it will charge patients for 20 percent of their services (with a $3,000 cap for individuals and $9,000 for families). Sansum and Cottage will also be available through the aforementioned Health Net Blue & Gold HMO.\n\nStill, UCSB employees are crying foul, saying that the Office of the President should have taken Santa Barbara\u2019s medical provider landscape into account when making its changes. On Thursday, they said they were angry about the lack of a Tier 1 plan in the area and resented having to wait and see if negotiations with Sansum and Cottage result in Tier 1 eventually becoming an option. \u201cIf that\u2019s the best the Office of the President can do right now, you\u2019ve failed,\u201d said Stuart Feinstein, a professor of molecular biology for the past 27 years. \u201cThis is reneging on a responsibility. This is a completely unacceptable and unsatisfying situation.\u201d\n\nDwaine Duckett, the vice president of human resources for the university system\u2019s Office of the President (UCOP), answered questions at the meeting, and said that the university\u2019s pending separation from Anthem \u2014 750 UCSB employees are currently enrolled in Anthem plans, according to UCSB\u2019s HR director, Tricia Hiemstra \u2014 is due to the company\u2019s slated price increases, with plans scheduled to go up by $60 to $175 per month. Duckett noted repeatedly that UCSB employees will still be able to get treated at Sansum and Cottage, but acknowledged their strong frustration over losing that top-tier PPO option. \u201cI understand when people talk about change and couch it as minor change,\u201d he said. \u201cMinor change is something that somebody is going through.\u201d\n\nNelson Lichtenstein, a history professor and the president of the UCSB Faculty Association, chalked up the UC\u2019s changes to pure dollars and cents. \u201cThe UCOP is looking for ways to save money \u2014 that\u2019s what they do,\u201d he said, adding that he resented that UCSB employees have been made into \u201cnegotiating pawns\u201d between the university system and Sansum and Cottage. \u201cWe have to demand the university to solve it so we have the same benefits as before,\u201d he said, adding that an electronic petition circulated to UCSB staff could make their anger loud and clear. Attendees suggested that the other UC campuses that won\u2019t be without the Tier 1 plan subsidize the cost for UCSB employees until an agreement can be reached between the university and medical providers, a suggestion Duckett said wasn\u2019t an option.\n\nAs of deadline, further details on possible negotiations between Cottage, Sansum, UCOP, and UCSB were unavailable.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: University officials originally stated the Tier 2 cap was $5,000.
