State workers have long argued that they could be doing many of these jobs for less.\n\nThe latest report, for fiscal 2014, shows state agency spending on outside services is up for the fourth straight year. This has happened despite the Act 10 benefit changes under Gov. Scott Walker that arguably make state workers more cost-effective, compared to the private sector.\n\n\u201cDuring a time of alleged austerity, the administration continues to spend taxpayers\u2019 money like an inebriated sailor,\u201d said Bill Franks, a retired state employee and union steward who follows this issue. \u201cYou would have thought, if anything, those numbers would be going down.\u201d\n\nThe new report was quietly released Dec. 22, more than two months past its statutory due date. Late filings are not uncommon, under both Republican Walker and his Democratic predecessor, Jim Doyle. One report from the Walker team was more than eight months late.\n\nState agencies, the report shows, spent $451 million on outside services in fiscal 2014, which ended June 30. That\u2019s up 56 percent from fiscal 2010, before Walker became governor. During this same four-year period, the UW\u2019s spending on outside services declined nearly 11 percent, to $114 million.\n\nWisconsin Department of Administration\n\nState agency spending on outside services has been higher in the past. In 2003, it totaled $556 million. But this sum fell each year after that, to just $290 million in fiscal 2010.\n\nDOA spokeswoman Stephanie Marquis, to whom the governor\u2019s office referred questions, noted that Walker was governor for just half of fiscal 2011, which saw the largest increase. The rise in state agency spending is just 24 percent if this entire year is not counted.\n\n\u201cWe prefer to use our own employees in providing services and programs to the taxpayers,\u201d Marquis said in an email. But contractors are used when required by federal or state law, when necessary to maintain a license or warranty, when the state lacks infrastructure or expertise, or when contracting is \u201cmore efficient or cost-effective.\u201d\n\nThe top state agency spender, by far, is the Department of Health Services, at $178 million in 2014. That\u2019s slightly higher than in 2011, when a Legislative Audit Bureau report questioned DHS\u2019s use of outside providers and urged it to \u201cidentify whether cost savings could be achieved by using state employees.\u201d\n\nDHS spokeswoman Stephanie Smiley said the agency has had to continue using external contracted services to comply with Medicaid changes and the Affordable Care Act. But it \u201ccontinues to review the efficacy of using contractors and will seek approval to convert contracted services to state positions to achieve cost savings when appropriate, as it has since the 2011 audit.\u201d\n\nThe report summarizes the cost-benefit analyses required for each proposed state agency service procurement over $50,000. (The UW System is exempt from this rule.) It does not tally the numbers or say whether a given analysis led to a job being contracted out.\n\nBut a review by the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism shows the estimated cost of contracting was higher than the estimated cost of using state workers in 152 of the 250 analyses, as well as for the total sums.\n\nAccording to the report, 75 percent of these cost-benefit analyses were for information technology services. It recommends agencies \u201ccontinue to examine the availability of state employees\u201d before contracting out for IT jobs. And it cites ongoing efforts \u201cto reduce the state\u2019s use of contracted employees.\u201d\n\nThis same language has appeared in past reports. Franks considers it \u201cdisingenuous,\u201d not backed by political will. Actual progress in this direction, he said, \u201cwould mean doing something no administration wants to take credit for: increasing the size of state government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest report, for fiscal 2014, shows state agency spending on outside services is up for the fourth straight year.
