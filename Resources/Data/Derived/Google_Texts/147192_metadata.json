For the full year, Berkshire earned $17.36 billion in operating profit, and $4.67 billion in the fourth quarter. Overall, Berkshire's profit increased to $24.08 billion over the year.\n\n\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha was also dismissive of the idea that the current state of the U.S. economy boded ill for the future.

The five collectively earned $13.1 billion last year, a rise of $650 million from the comparable year-ago, Berkshire said.
