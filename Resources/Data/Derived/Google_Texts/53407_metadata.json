Keith Rothfus, R-Sewickley, voted against the bill on Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blasted him in a statement for clinging to \u201cirresponsible, reckless dysfunction until the bitter end.\u201d\n\nRothfus said on Thursday that he shares in the frustration Americans felt during the shutdown, but he wants the country to have a discussion about how to pay its bills.\n\nHe joined four other Pennsylvania Republicans \u2014 including Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Zionsville \u2014 in voting \u201cno.\u201d Rothfus was the only member of the House delegation from Western Pennsylvania who refused to say how he intended to vote on the package hours before it was introduced in the House.\n\nThe bill funds the government though Jan. 15 at pre-shutdown levels, expands the country's borrowing limit enough to last through Feb. 7, and forms a joint House-Senate committee to negotiate a budget by mid-December. The Senate voted 81-18 for the package. The House passed it in a 285-144 vote.\n\nThe deal did not end what Rothfus called \u201cspecial treatment\u201d carved out for members of Congress and large corporations in the Affordable Care Act. It also did not include reforms to curtail government spending while increasing the nation's debt, he said.\n\n\u201cThose concerns remain,\u201d Rothfus said.\n\nRothfus, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th District stretching from Beaver County to Somerset County, faces re-election in 2014.\n\nHe has a primary challenger, Larry Stiles of Johnstown, who did not respond to requests for comment on the vote.\n\nToomey also did not disclose his vote before casting it in the Senate floor. The state Democratic Party quickly attacked him as \u201cTea Party Pat Toomey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere has been no clearer indication that Tea Party Pat Toomey is completely out of touch with Pennsylvania,\u201d the Democratic Party said in a statement.\n\nToomey said he could not support adding billions of dollars of debt without reforms to control government spending. The first-term senator faces re-election in 2016.\n\nConservative groups took shots at GOP House members who voted to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.\n\nAmericans for Limited Government President Nathan Mehrens said Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, disappointed his constituents by voting for the bill.\n\n\u201cWhen it finally mattered, Kelly turned around and voted to allow funding for the implementation of Obamacare to take effect. By voting to fund it, Kelly now owns Obamacare just as much as if it had been a vote to adopt it in the first place,\u201d Mehrens said in a statement.\n\nHis office said Kelly \u201chas never missed an opportunity to defund, delay, or repeal\u201d the Affordable Care Act. \u201cAny other interpretation of the congressman's record amounts to plain nonsense,\u201d spokesman Tom Qualtere wrote in an email.\n\nLawmakers, regardless of their vote, might not feel the public's backlash until November.\n\nNearly three-quarters of registered voters would like to see most members of Congress out of office, a record-high sour mood toward incumbents, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center. Nearly 40 percent of voters do not want their own representative to return to Washington.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. Aaron Aupperlee is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
