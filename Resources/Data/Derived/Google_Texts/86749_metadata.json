However, the American Psychological Association has said there\u2019s no scientific basis that gay couples are unfit parents based on sexual orientation, AP reported.\n\nAshley Sumner, spokeswoman for the Utah Division of Child and Family Services, said the revised order released Friday doesn\u2019t rule out the chance that the judge could order the child removed following a custody hearing on Dec. 4, AP reported.\n\nShe said child welfare officials are working to keep the family together.\n\nThe couple\u2019s plight drew the attention of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who tweeted her support Wednesday.\n\n\u201cBeing a good parent has nothing to do with sexual orientation \u2014 thousands of families prove that,\u201d the post read.\n\nThe couple said the baby\u2019s biological mother has asked them to adopt.\n\n\u201cWe love her and she loves us, and we haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d Ms. Peirce said Wednesday, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. \u201cAnd the law, as I understand it, reads that any legally married couple can foster and adopt.\u201d\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign said Friday that it had filed a formal complaint with the Utah Judicial Conduct Commission and called for a full investigation into Judge Johansen.\n\n\u201cIt is unconscionable that any judge would let bias interfere with determining the true best interest of a child and we strongly encourage the commission to take appropriate action to hold this Judge accountable and to affirm that personal bias has no place in judicial decisions in Utah,\u201d HRC Legal Director Sarah Warbelow said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Utah judge has reversed his decision to remove a baby from the foster home of a lesbian couple next week, following widespread backlash from the LGBT community.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Utah judge has reversed his decision to remove a baby from the foster home of a lesbian couple next week, following widespread backlash from the LGBT community.", "title": "Scott Johansen, Utah judge, reverses decision to remove baby from lesbian foster parents", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/13/scott-johansen-utah-judge-reverses-decision-to-rem/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/13/April_Hoagland_and_Beckie_Peirce_.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/13/April_Hoagland_and_Beckie_Peirce_.jpg", "description": "A Utah judge has reversed his decision to remove a baby from the foster home of a lesbian couple next week, following widespread backlash from the LGBT community.", "card": "summary", "title": "Scott Johansen, Utah judge, reverses decision to remove baby from lesb"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Scott Johansen"}, "article_summary": "A Utah judge has reversed his decision to remove a baby from the foster home of a lesbian couple next week, following widespread backlash from the LGBT community.\nHowever, the American Psychological Association has said there\u2019s no scientific basis that gay couples are unfit parents based on sexual orientation, AP reported.\n\u201cBeing a good parent has nothing to do with sexual orientation \u2014 thousands of families prove that,\u201d the post read.\nIt comes after Mr. Johansen said in court Tuesday that the baby must be transferred to a heterosexual foster couple, citing research that showed children do better when raised by heterosexual families.\nCourt officials on Friday released an order signed by Judge Scott Johansen that will allow the 9-month-old girl to stay with April Hoagland and Beckie Peirce in Carbon County, The Associated Press reported."}
