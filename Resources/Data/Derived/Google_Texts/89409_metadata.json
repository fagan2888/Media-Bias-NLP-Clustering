The program, designed for scalable delivery, incorporated identification of high readmission\u2013risk patients, assessment of individual needs, medication reconciliation, discharge planning, care coordination, and telephonic postdischarge follow-up.\n\n\n\nMethods: The treatment group of program enrollees (N = 560) and the comparison group with no program contact (N = 3340) were matched on 8 coarsened demographic, diagnosis, and severity variables associated with readmission risk. Assessed outcomes included relative risk and odds of readmission within 30 days postdischarge and overall within the 6-month evaluation period. Zero-inflated Poisson multivariate models were used to estimate intervention effects controlling for matching-generated weights, age, disease status, and period of evaluation.\n\n\n\nResults: Treatment group risk of readmission was 22% lower overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.78; P <.01) and 30-day readmission risk was 25% lower (IRR, 0.75; P = .01) relative to the comparison group. Odds of any or 30-day readmission were 0.47 (95% CI, 0.35-0.65) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.41-0.77), respectively, for treatment relative to comparison.\n\n\n\nConclusions: Participation in the CTS resulted in significantly lower rates of readmissions among patients with readmission-sensitive conditions, offering a scalable and sustainable approach to reduce the number of preventable hospital readmissions.\n\n\n\nAm J Manag Care. 2016;22(1):28-34\n\n\n\nMETHODS\n\nStudy Design and Data Overview\n\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\nStudy Population\n\nThe changing healthcare landscape has amplified the need to improve healthcare quality while also lowering healthcare spending, which reached $2.8 trillion in the United States in 2012.A comparison of 12 countries showed the proportion of US gross domestic product spent on healthcare was more than 40% higher than in second-ranked France, yet measures of quality for US healthcare are often lower than in countries that spend far less. High rates of hospitalization for chronic conditions in the United States are one example; they have been attributed to low performance in care coordination and safety, and only average levels of care effectiveness and patient-centered care.Although these observations could reflect a dysfunctional system, they are more likely the result of a healthcare system increasingly strained by a surging prevalence of complex conditions and concomitant care needs.A focus on reducing hospital readmissions\u2014which contribute to overall hospitalization rates\u2014is recognized as an opportunity to improve care while also reducing avoidable costs. A study of nearly 12 million Medicare hospital discharges in 2004 found that approximately 20% resulted in 30-day readmissions, with only one-tenth of those readmissions likely planned. The total costs of these unplanned readmissions were over $17 billion.Diagnoses that are particularly readmission-sensitive include heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia. In one study, 30-day readmission rates for these diagnoses were 24.8%, 19.9%, and 18.3%, respectively, in a Medicare population.These conditions also account for a significant amount of hospitalization and cost in Medicaid, commercially insured, and uninsured US populations.Readmission rates are concerning for these and other serious conditions across all age and payer groups.In 2012, the Affordable Care Act established strong financial incentives for hospitals and physicians to reduce readmissions. The law required CMS to establish the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, which penalizes, through reduced reimbursement, those hospitals whose risk-adjusted readmission rates for HF, pneumonia, and AMI exceed the national average. In 2015, the program expanded to include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and elective hip or knee replacement as readmission penalty conditions.Commercial payersand state Medicaid agencies will likely follow with similar programs to raise quality and reduce readmissions.High rates of unplanned readmissions are a reflection of the fact that the US healthcare system has traditionally functioned in a fragmented and poorly coordinated fashion, often leaving discharged patients and their family members uneducated, confused, and unprepared for the ongoing management of conditions to avoid future adverse events.Inadequate hand-off of patient management among providers, poorly coordinated hospital discharge processes, discharge instructions for the patient that lack sufficient education and follow-up, and lack of medication reconciliation before and after hospitalization all amplify the likelihood that a patient will return to the hospital. Illustrating the consequences of these problems, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission\u2019s 2007 report to Congress estimated that 76% of 30-day readmissions are potentially preventable.Although broad efforts to address gaps in the discharge and hand-off process can benefit all hospitalized patients, complex cases at higher risk for readmission often require additional resource-intensive planning and follow-up processes. Full implementation of comprehensive approaches established in the literaturefor large populations or across multiple hospitals is a formidable initiative given resource constraints in the current healthcare environment. Thus, there is a need for scalable approaches delivering effective readmission prevention models that augment what hospitals, health plans, and providers are already doing to prevent unplanned readmissions.Texas Health Resources (THR), a nonprofit, faith-based health system located in north Texas, is innovating through exploration and testing of scalable approaches to prevent readmissions. Specifically, THR\u2014through partnership with Healthways, a global well-being improvement company\u2014implemented the Healthways Care Transitions Solution (CTS) in 14 acute care hospitals. CTS uses predictive identification of admitted patients at high risk of readmission, then invokes a collaborative care model for discharge planning and follow-up that extends from the hospital to the home. The current study was conducted to assess the initial effectiveness of CTS participation in preventing readmissions among patients with readmission-sensitive conditions.A quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study was conducted to test the hypothesis that CTS program participation among admitted patients with readmission-sensitive conditions was associated with reduced readmission risk relative to a matched nonparticipant group. Data originated from 14 acute care hospitals in the Texas Health Resources network; specifically, admission-discharge-transfer data documenting patient admissions during the initial 6-month intervention time period of January 1 to July 1, 2013, were used for this study. Because this study was a retrospective analysis of a quality improvement initiative conducted anonymously, it did not require informed consent from participants and was exempt from institutional review board approval based on exclusion criteria outlined in the US Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR \u00a746.101).Implementation of the CTS intervention was staggered over a 6-week period beginning in mid-January 2013; the program initiated at 2 to 3 hospitals each week. By March 2013, the CTS intervention program was fully functioning at all 14 sites. The CTS program was designed to deliver thorough and personalized patient education and discharge planning/preparation, provide regular individualized follow-up, and facilitate care coordination in order to avoid unnecessary visits/time spent in medical facilities or doctors\u2019 offices, while encouraging appropriate medical care to avoid additional exacerbations of the patient\u2019s condition.Basic principles of the CTS program include the following: 1) Identification of patients at high risk of readmission using a predictive model, and clinical assessment to ensure alignment of resources with need; 2) Early engagement of admitted patients by a nurse transition coach to establish a strong relationship with the patient; 3) Detailed collection of contact information to facilitate postdischarge patient interactions; 4) Assessment of medical, psychosocial, functional, literacy, adherence, and support needs, and of capabilities such as functioning and self-efficacy, to tailor interactions accordingly; 5) Reconciliation of medications before hospitalization to medications after hospital discharge; 6) Provision and review of a patient-oriented Care Transition Record, with documented discharge plan; 7) Coordination of medical providers and service agencies for postdischarge patient care; and 8) Postdischarge telephonic follow-up (4 calls over 4 weeks) to track and support the patient\u2019s recovery and ongoing self-management, and to encourage discharge plan adherence.The study-eligible population included all patients admitted to 1 of the 14 evaluated hospitals during the study period who were documented to have at least 1 of the following readmission-sensitive conditions that are also CMS readmission-penalty diagnoses: AMI, HF, pneumonia, or COPD. In accordance with intention-to-treat research design, all CTS enrollees were eligible for the treatment group, regardless of their level of participation or completion of the CTS program, to provide a realistic assessment of program effectiveness. The eligible population had an average age of 59.3 years (range = 18-96 years). Eligible comparison group members did not have any documented interaction with the CTS program. The staggered implementation across hospital sites provided a population of program-eligible patients admitted to sites where the program was not yet available, and although the comparison group was not constrained to patients admitted pre-implementation, the availability of these patients in the matching process diminished the potential for selection bias and availed a more equivalent group for comparison.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "readmission, care transition, Care Transition Solution, discharge planning, telephone, high-risk patient, 30-day readmission, heart failure, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD pneumonia", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "site_name": "AJMC", "description": "The 30-day readmission risk was reduced 25% by a collaborative program model employing discharge planning and telephonic follow-up for high-risk patients with CMS penalty diagnoses.", "title": "Impact of a Scalable Care Transitions Program for Readmission Avoidance"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJMC_Journal", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "description": "The 30-day readmission risk was reduced 25% by a collaborative program model employing discharge planning and telephonic follow-up for high-risk patients with CMS penalty diagnoses.", "card": "summary", "title": "Impact of a Scalable Care Transitions Program for Readmission Avoidance"}, "description": "The 30-day readmission risk was reduced 25% by a collaborative program model employing discharge planning and telephonic follow-up for high-risk patients with CMS penalty diagnoses."}, "article_summary": "Specifically, THR\u2014through partnership with Healthways, a global well-being improvement company\u2014implemented the Healthways Care Transitions Solution (CTS) in 14 acute care hospitals.\nResults: Treatment group risk of readmission was 22% lower overall (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.78; P <.01) and 30-day readmission risk was 25% lower (IRR, 0.75; P = .01) relative to the comparison group.\nEligible comparison group members did not have any documented interaction with the CTS program.\nMethods: The treatment group of program enrollees (N = 560) and the comparison group with no program contact (N = 3340) were matched on 8 coarsened demographic, diagnosis, and severity variables associated with readmission risk.\nThe 30-day readmission risk was reduced 25% by a collaborative program model employing discharge planning and telephonic follow-up for high-risk patients with CMS penalty diagnoses."}
