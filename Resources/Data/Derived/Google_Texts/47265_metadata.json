Imagine having a condition like diabetes, which should be easy to treat, spiral so far out of control that you lose your sight. Think of the loss \u2014 to your own life, your own family, to your work, to your community \u2014 and to the economy, too.\n\nAs a country and as a state, we\u2019ve recognized that this shouldn\u2019t happen. We\u2019ve recognized that ensuring health for all not only makes tremendous common sense, but it makes tremendous economic sense as well.\n\nHowever, one group is still left out, because Congress unjustly and purposefully excluded undocumented community members from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHere in California, only two out of five undocumented residents are covered from employment-based insurance, while more than one million are shut out from affordable care.\n\nWith Sen. Lara\u2019s Health for All Act, we can right this wrong and create an efficient, cost-effective health system that benefits us all.\n\nThe act would expand Medi-Cal to all low-income Californians and also create a parallel health exchange, similar to Covered California.\n\nSo, how do we pay for this?\n\nThe fact is, that expanding affordable health care to all Californians is incredibly cost effective. For a modest investment in a stronger and healthier California, we\u2019ll secure a powerful return.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the math. According to the UC-Berkeley Labor Center, California could expand Medi-Cal to undocumented immigrants by paying just two cents more for every general fund dollar our state is already spending on the program.\n\nAnd the good news doesn\u2019t end there.\n\nTo expand Medi-Cal to all, we can leverage funding from hospital presumptive eligibility and funds in the existing emergency Medi-Cal program, which already enrolls 800,000 Californians. Additionally, we can take advantage of substantial offsets from state sales tax revenue from health care insurers through the MCO tax. Meanwhile, counties would experience a natural reduction in spending on the uninsured population.\n\nFor the mirror exchange that Health for All would create, undocumented consumers would contribute a share of premiums ranging from 2% to 9.5% of their income, as well as copays, deductibles and coinsurance just as other Californians covered by Covered California do today.\n\nAs the legislative process moves forward, if it becomes clear that despite the mathematical reality, we\u2019ll need to generate additional revenue for such a program, then we must find progressive solutions that aren\u2019t going to further deepen poverty.\n\nAccess to health care is a public concern, and undocumented immigrants should not be singled out and made to pay a disproportionate share of the cost of a program that benefits the public well-being. Undocumented immigrants contribute over $2 billion in taxes to the state of California, and they are keeping our state\u2019s economy healthy. Don\u2019t we owe them the same?\n\nAt the end of the day, investing in immigrant families is investing in our state\u2019s future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>We asked legislators and consumer advocates to weigh in on a proposal to offer subsidized health care coverage to California's undocumented immigrants and to suggest ways the state could pay for it. </p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "We asked legislators and consumer advocates to weigh in on a proposal to offer subsidized health care coverage to California\u2019s undocumented immigrants and to suggest ways the state could pay \u2026", "title": "How To Pay for Health for All?", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/how-to-pay-for-health-for-all/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-09-25T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-25T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba97\"", "article_summary": "With Sen.
