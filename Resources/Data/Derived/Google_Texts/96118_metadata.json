No youth should be turned away for lack of insurance.\n\nThe expanded program becomes active May 15. Families should enroll their children now in what\u2019s known as restricted-scope Medi-Cal, or \u201cemergency\u201d Medi-Cal, in order to take advantage of full-scope Medi-Cal as soon as the full program kicks in.\n\nFamilies shouldn\u2019t wait for an emergency situation to enroll. Take action now. The information they share with the state agencies or nonprofit health-care outreach groups they work with, such as the Solano Coalition for Better Health, will remain confidential.\n\nFull-scope Medi-Cal means access for children to free or low-cost preventive services, such as annual check-ups, dental and vision care, hearing tests and mental health assessments. Children should be enrolled through local county human services office, or a local clinic. For more information, parents can visit www.localclinic.net, call toll-free (855) 899-PLUS (7587); visit www.solanocoalition.org or call (800) 978-7547; or visit www.calendow.org.\n\nVacaville Unified School District lead nurse Toni McCallum said this week that the county is able to insure nearly 100 percent of students. If VUSD parents indicated they have no health insurance, district officials contact the Solano Kids Insurance Program, whose representatives set up insurance for them.\n\nTamara Owens, director of operations for the Solano Coalition, said the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, tries to make it possible for everyone to have health coverage.\n\nThe latest expansion of Medi-Cal \u2014 or the state\u2019s version of Medicaid \u2014 the federal-state program that helps pay for health care for the needy, aged, blind, disabled and the poor with children \u2014 enabled nonprofit outreach groups, such as the coalition, to go out and get the word out further to those in need.\n\nWhat the new program does is help agencies stress to families with undocumented children that they don\u2019t need to fear repercussions \u2014 or risk deportation \u2014 from federal immigration officials during their application for full-scope Medi-Cal.\n\nThis is a big step because those without health insurance in the state often end up using \u201csafety nets\u201d services, including costly emergency room visits for situations that could often be handled cheaper and easier by doctor visits. Regular, periodic visits to physicians will make an enormous difference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost Californians support the latest change to Medi-Cal and a further expansion for wider coverage for children and they should. It\u2019s an important step for our state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California political leaders took a very positive step, enabled by the Affordable Care Act, to expand the full-scope Medi-Cal to cover all children in the state until 19 years old, regardless of immigration status.Children need to be cared for", "title": "Editorial: Medi-Cal for undocumented children right", "og": {"url": "http://www.thereporter.com/article/NG/20160320/NEWS/160329995", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.thereporter.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/thereporter.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Editorial: Medi-Cal for undocumented children right"}, "twitter": {"domain": "thereporter.com", "description": "California political leaders took a very positive step, enabled by the Affordable Care Act, to expand the full-scope Medi-Cal to cover all children in the state until 19 years old, regardless of immigration status.Children need to be cared for", "title": "Editorial: Medi-Cal for undocumented children right", "url": "http://www.thereporter.com/article/NG/20160320/NEWS/160329995", "image": {"src": "http://local.thereporter.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/thereporter.png?052016"}, "site": "@vacareporter", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id499680399", "iphone": "id509333965", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.vacavillereporter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Editorials, Editorials news, Vacaville Editorials news, CA Editorials news, US Editorials news, world Editorials news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Editorials, Editorials news, Vacaville Editorials news, CA Editorials news, US Editorials news, world Editorials news."}, "article_summary": "If VUSD parents indicated they have no health insurance, district officials contact the Solano Kids Insurance Program, whose representatives set up insurance for them.\nFamilies should enroll their children now in what\u2019s known as restricted-scope Medi-Cal, or \u201cemergency\u201d Medi-Cal, in order to take advantage of full-scope Medi-Cal as soon as the full program kicks in.\nAdvertisementMost Californians support the latest change to Medi-Cal and a further expansion for wider coverage for children and they should.\nFull-scope Medi-Cal means access for children to free or low-cost preventive services, such as annual check-ups, dental and vision care, hearing tests and mental health assessments.\nChildren need to be cared for and coverage for all is the right move."}
