"One of the most touted benefits of President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul law is the provision allows parents to keep their adult children on their health insurance until age 26.\n\nHowever, Trace Gallagher reported on \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d Monday, this benefit is not being extended to a significant group of Americans: members of the U.S. military.\n\nTRICARE, the Department of Defense program that provides health coverage to active duty and retired military members and their families, only covers young adult dependents up until age 21, or age 23 if they are enrolled full-time in college.\n\nTRICARE recipients can then purchase a plan for their young adult dependents, according to their website.\n\nAir Force veteran Eddie Grooms said he was disappointed to learn he could not add his 21-year-old daughter to his insurance provided by the military, as he thought he had been promised under the health care overhaul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if they leveled with everybody and let them know so that people could make plans, because this is going to hit all, I mean it\u2019s going to hit thousands of retirees over time,\u201d Grooms said.\n\nJessie Jane Duff of Concerned Veterans for America told Megyn Kelly the reason the benefit has not been extended to military members is the rates under TRICARE are very low because they are subsidized by U.S. taxpayers.\n\nShe said \u201cunfortunately\u201d this means adult children cannot be covered, saying there has to be some \u201cgive and take\u201d for the reduced rates.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very fortunate because legislation was passed that exempted TRICARE from a lot of the ObamaCare standings, so that actually has benefited veterans to keep the rates that they\u2019ve had,\u201d Duff said.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/DEFENSE/Armed Forces,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:25:45 EST", "dcterms.abstract":
