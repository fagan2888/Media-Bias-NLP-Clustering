Broncos owner Pat Bowlen and his team wanted to help their fans and fellow Coloradans affected by the flooding, so the Broncos reached out to the Mile High Chapter of the American Red Cross. The team will donate $50,000, the same amount it donated in 2012 during the wildfires, and the money will be designated to disaster relief.
