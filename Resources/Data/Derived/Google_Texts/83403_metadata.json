Consumers may buy less soda because of the higher cost, for example, but it\u2019s difficult to track whether individuals replace soda with water or energy drinks.\n\nGearing said a 10-percent sugar tax is estimated to decrease obesity by only one to three percentage points.\n\nShe said the decline, even if slight, does matter. But, she added, given the current obesity rate\u2014more than one-third of Americans are obese\u2014such a slight drop is not going to \u201cget rid of the crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like it if people change behavior without having a tax,\u201d Gearing said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unlike with smoking, researchers from the Urban Institute say, taxing unhealthy foods and drinks isn't likely to alter consumption behavior.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Unlike with smoking, researchers from the Urban Institute say, taxing unhealthy foods and drinks isn't likely to alter consumption behavior.", "title": "Would Higher Taxes on Junk Food Make Us Eat Less?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151215_SugarTax_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-17T22:01:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QKD56A"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Unlike with smoking, researchers from the Urban Institute say, taxing unhealthy foods and drinks isn't likely to alter consumption behavior.", "title": "Would Higher Taxes on Junk Food Make Us Eat Less?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151215_SugarTax_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-12-17T10:29:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-17T22:01:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "sugar tax, Berkeley, Urban Institute, obesity, diabetes, junk food, sugary drinks"}, "article_summary": "Taxing sugary foods and drinks likely would impose increased costs on consumers without significantly altering behavior, researchers argued this week.\nLawmakers across the U.S. for years have tried and failed to levy taxes on sugary foods and beverages after consumer pushback and criticisms of government overstepping.\nGearing said a 10-percent sugar tax is estimated to decrease obesity by only one to three percentage points.\n\u201cWhen you get to nutrition, it\u2019s a little less clear.\u201dPolicymakers concerned about obesity hitting an all-time high in the United States are debating whether to tax sugary drinks and junk food to motivate Americans to select healthier options.\nThis year, Berkeley, Calif., became the first city to implement a tax on sugary beverages such as sodas and energy drinks."}
