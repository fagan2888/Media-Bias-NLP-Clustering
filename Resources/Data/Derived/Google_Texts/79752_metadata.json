Well that has happened and photos were taken to prove it.\n\nThese photographs were captured by the California-based Phoo Chan. Chan said that crows are known to be aggressive when flying in and around their territories, but the crow here did not harass the eagle or seem to care the eagle was there.\n\nThe crow actually landed on the eagles back for a moment while in mid-flight and used the eagle like a plane.
