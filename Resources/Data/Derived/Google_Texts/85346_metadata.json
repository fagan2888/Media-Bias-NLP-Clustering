And, yeah, maybe Manning threw the football as part of a 2007 \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d commercial parody for the United Way, the punch line of which was, \u201cSpend time with your kids so Peyton Manning doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s not too tough to imagine that Manning isn\u2019t feeling so forgiving or loved in real life, either, at the moment. Not after the Broncos were booed at halftime by their own fans during last Sunday\u2019s game because they only had a two-point lead, or after Monday\u2019s headline in The Post declaring their 35-19 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars had \u201cblemishes.\u201d\n\nAt a time when bigger is almost always preferred to better, a simple win isn\u2019t nearly as attractive as a plus-size, obnoxious, run-up-the-score win. Whopping triumphs also often go hand-in-hand with great shows \u2014 think tantrums, fights, giddy end-zone dances \u2014 that can come at the expense of sportsmanship.\n\nThe Kentucky High School Athletic Association recently did its part to contribute to sportsmanship\u2019s obituary by announcing that the postgame handshake is not of paramount importance if it means there\u2019s a chance they might result in fistfights, of which there have been more than two dozen in the last three years in Kentucky alone.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t properly supervise [postgame handshakes], you shouldn\u2019t do them,\u201d Julian Tackett, the association\u2019s commissioner said.\n\nPerhaps it might have been more productive for the Kentucky association to issue an edict saying players or entire teams risk suspension for fighting instead of suggesting civility is the first to go, but that would have been out of character with the direction in sports these days.\n\nNot long ago, ESPN started broadcasting high school football games, which is undoubtedly a celebration for the schools and athletes being shown in prime time (or, really, at any other time). Kids who\u2019ve only dreamed of being on TV now get to showcase their talent to an exponentially larger audience and play the part of the pros they\u2019ve watched primping, preening and showboating for the camera.\n\nThe difference is that pros get paid big bucks to win games and further their brand, which means acting virtuous is not necessarily high on their list of priorities. And they even get paid to listen to the boos on Sunday afternoons \u2014 even if they\u2019re more accustomed to hearing them from the other team\u2019s fans, or if they\u2019re actually losing.\n\nOn the other hand, according to the NCAA, only an estimated 0.13 percent of high school athletes will end up going to the big leagues, which raises the question of what the vast majority of them are actually taking from their years on the court and field if not integrity. Shouldn\u2019t handshakes and gamesmanship be at the forefront of every program? And shouldn\u2019t their parents demonstrate to them that booing and fighting \u2014 whether at pro or amateur games \u2014 is never OK? (But especially when your team is ahead?)\n\nAs far as my 5-year-old daughter knows, the high-fives that she lines up to give the opposing team at the end of her soccer games are as integral to the process as the one-in-every-four-minute snack breaks and the minimum of three kids who will cry and/or need a bandage before the end of the first quarter.\n\nThen again, she sometimes forgets she\u2019s even playing soccer because she\u2019s too busy searching the clouds to find one in the shape of a unicorn. But even if she\u2019s not exactly a good athlete, at least she\u2019s a good sport.\n\nHow many of the Broncos fans who were at Sports Authority Field last Sunday can honestly say the same about themselves and their kids?\n\nMeredith C.
