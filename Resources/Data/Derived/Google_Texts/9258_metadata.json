It\u2019s kind of like that flu bug going around except the shit comes out your mouth!\u201d\n\n\n\nWith those words, outspoken satirist Bill Maher began his protracted verbal devastation of 2016 presidential candidate Ted Cruz (R-TX), who recently became the first Republican candidate to throw his hat in the ring, on Friday night\u2019s Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nThe mauling didn\u2019t stop there. As you probably know, Cruz was born in Calgary, Albert, Canada, the son of a Cuban who fought for Fidel Castro in the Cuban Revolution as a teenager, and eventually fled to Austin, Texas a the age of 18. And the world\u2019s most notorious Canadian is, of course, Justin Bieber.\n\n\n\n\u201cTed Cruz, who presents himself as the most all-American guy ever, was born in Canada and his father\u2019s Cuban. He\u2019s half-Canadian and half-Cuban,\u201d Maher said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the gravitas of Justin Bieber combined with the people skills of Scarface.\u201d\n\nBieber comparisons aside, Maher spent the bulk of his hour-long HBO show throwing verbal jabs at Cruz\u2019s perceived hypocrisy and shameless opportunism. Cruz notoriously devoted a great deal of his time to defunding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (a.k.a. Obamacare), embarking a nationwide tour in 2013 sponsored by The Heritage Foundation; conducting a 21-plus hour filibuster on the floor of the Senate; and has even been accused of being an integral part of the 2013 government shutdown over his objection to the terms of Obamacare. And yet, just this week Cruz announced that he would be signing up for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe day after he declared, he signed up for Obamacare,\u201d said Maher. \u201cHe filibustered it for 21 hours two years ago, and now he\u2019s signed up because his wife is quitting her job, he got his health insurance through his wife, and now she\u2019s quitting to help him on the campaign trail, so he doesn\u2019t have health insurance, so he signs up for Obamacare. He was asked why and he said, \u2018I believe we should follow the text of every law\u2014even laws I disagree with.\u2019 Ah. Well you know what, Ted? If you need some medical marijuana, call me.\u201d\n\nBut his Obamacare flip-flop paled in comparison to his recent pandering comments concerning why he switched from digging classic rock to country in an interview with CBS This Morning.\n\n\u201cI grew up listening to classic rock. My music taste changed on 9/11\u2026 I actually intellectually find this very curious, but on 9/11, I didn\u2019t like how rock music responded,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd country music, collectively, the way they responded, it resonated with me. I had an emotional reaction that said, \u2018These are my people.\u2019 So ever since 2001, I listen to country music.\u201d\n\n\n\nCruz, as is his wont, didn\u2019t name any of the rock acts that \u201cresponded\u201d in a strange way to 9/11, or any of the country acts that \u201cresponded\u201d in a way that made him completely revamp his musical taste. Cue Maher.\n\n\u201cI looked up how rock responded: with three giant fundraisers!\u201d said a bewildered Maher. \u201cSeptember 21, all four networks showed America: A Tribute to Heroes\u2014Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Bon Jovi, Pearl Jam. A virtual roster of classic rock! October 20, Paul McCartney\u2019s Concert For New York\u2014The Who, the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Elton John, Eric Clapton. The next day, Michael Jackson had the few rock classic people who were left\u2014Aerosmith, Rod Stewart. Paul McCartney wrote a song called \u2018Freedom,\u2019 Bruce Springsteen \u2018The Rising,\u2019 Bon Jovi \u2018Undivided,\u2019 Neil Young \u2018Let\u2019s Roll.\u2019\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "marlownyc"}, "keywords": "HBO, Ted Cruz, Real Time With Bill Maher, Justin Bieber, entertainment, Google, U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201503280335, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/entertainment", "news_keywords": "HBO, Ted Cruz, Real Time With Bill Maher, Justin Bieber, Entertainment, Google, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Bill Maher Compares Ted Cruz to Justin Bieber", "tags": "hbo,entity:person/ted_cruz,entity:tvshow/real_time_with_bill_maher,entity:person/justin_bieber,topic:entertainment,syndication:syndication-google,u_s_politics0", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The late-night host of Real Time with Bill Maher eviscerated the Republican presidential candidate on his show Friday.", "title": "Bill Maher Compares Ted Cruz to Justin Bieber", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/27/bill-maher-compares-ted-cruz-to-justin-bieber.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/27/bill-maher-compares-ted-cruz-to-justin-bieber/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1427514223380.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "The late-night host of Real Time with Bill Maher eviscerated the Republican presidential candidate on his show Friday.", "sectionTaxanomies": "entertainment", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Marlow Stern", "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2015-03-28T03:35:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/marlow-sternhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/27/bill-maher-compares-ted-cruz-to-justin-bieber", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Bill Maher Compares Ted Cruz to Justin Bieber\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/27/bill-maher-compares-ted-cruz-to-justin-bieber.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/27/bill-maher-compares-ted-cruz-to-justin-bieber/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47583807.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/27/bill-maher-compares-ted-cruz-to-justin-bieber\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-28T03:35:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Entertainment\",\"author\":\"Marlow Stern\",\"tags\":[\"hbo\",\"ted_cruz\",\"real_time_with_bill_maher\",\"justin_bieber\",\"entertainment\",\"syndication-google\",\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/marlow-stern", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTed Cruz, who presents himself as the most all-American guy ever, was born in Canada and his father\u2019s Cuban.\nBURN\u201cPeople have Ted Cruz fever!\nThe next day, Michael Jackson had the few rock classic people who were left\u2014Aerosmith, Rod Stewart.\nMy music taste changed on 9/11\u2026 I actually intellectually find this very curious, but on 9/11, I didn\u2019t like how rock music responded,\u201d Cruz said.\n\u201cI looked up how rock responded: with three giant fundraisers!\u201d said a bewildered Maher."}
