And this I tell to the American people: \"Wake up, listen carefully to this false prophet, who could not tolerate this ... that could be a reality tomorrow.\"\n\nIsn't some of this overheated campaign rhetoric?\n\nWe have all followed, especially myself, the electoral process in the United States, and I have never seen something like this. I am absolutely shocked that the Republican Party has let this guy go so far. So I really want American citizens to really consider, is that really the best option that you have?\n\nYour grandfather was born in Ohio and crossed the border in the opposite direction. What motivated him to do this?\n\nExactly the same spirit that motivates Mexicans, that motivates Syrians, that motivates Americans also \u2014 to go out and look for your American dream, look for making a little more money. I know that has to be done legally. I know that migration should be an issue that has plenty of order, plenty of regulations. But speaking like he does is not the way to stop something like that. That is not the United States, that is not the land of my grandfather.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Former Mexican President Vicente Fox is a fierce critic of presidential candidate Donald Trump, repeatedly denouncing what he says are his &quot;racist and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/former-mexican-president-looks-trump-and-sees-dictator", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201604/473552477.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Former Mexican President Vicente Fox is a fierce critic of presidential candidate Donald Trump, repeatedly denouncing what he says are his &quot;racist and", "title": "A Former Mexican President Looks At Trump And Sees A 'Dictator'"}, "story_id": 473551450, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "NPR Staff", "org_id": 1, "dc": {"title": "A Former Mexican President Looks At Trump And Sees A &#039;Dictator&#039;"}, "nid": 56941, "datePublished": "2016-04-10", "wordCount": 434, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In his frequent tweets about Trump, Fox has called him \"crazy,\" \"pathetic\" and a \"loser.\"\nFox, who served as president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, also says he views Trump as a \"dictator.\"\nWe have all followed, especially myself, the electoral process in the United States, and I have never seen something like this.\nThat is not the United States, that is not the land of my grandfather.\nFormer Mexican President Vicente Fox is a fierce critic of presidential candidate Donald Trump, repeatedly denouncing what he says are his \"racist and ignorant ideas.\""}
