ST. AUGUSTINE, Fla. - Despite some low temperatures and heavy winds, many people were still out at St. Augustine's Nights of Lights Sunday night taking in the sights.

Some people walked around to keep warm, others depended on heavy layers.

Despite the winds and cold, the Christmas spirit was alive and well in St. Augustine.

"Regardless of the cold or not, it's just an amazing sight," said Seth Mathis, who was out enjoying the sights. "With the Nights of Lights and the Holly Jolly Trolley, all these white lights, it's almost surreal actually."

"She doesn't like to be bundled up, but we make it work," said Jeremy Gerondal. "She always tries to pull off her hat and mittens every chance she gets."

Several yards away was the pavilion where vendors display products they wish to sell.

Lindaliz Jiminez sells jewelry and was one of those who stuck around the longest.

"It's very cold, it's not that busy today," said Jiminez. "But we are here, getting warm now."
