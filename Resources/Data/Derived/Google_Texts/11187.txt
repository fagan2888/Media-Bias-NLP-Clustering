Two dogs were killed in a structure fire in Superior on Sunday afternoon that likely rendered the building — a duplex — a total loss.

The blaze was first reported about 2 p.m. in the 300 block of 3rd Avenue, according to a Boulder County dispatcher.

The fire — which began while one family was home — is contained, though crews are working to fully extinguish the blaze, The Daily Camera reported.

No injuries were reported, though one cat remains unaccounted for.

Crews, including those from Lafayette, Louisville and the Rocky Mountain Fire Department, fought the fire, the dispatcher said.

“Due to the hot weather and intense fire, multiple agencies responded either in mutual aid to fight the fire or provide fire and medical protection in parts of the county,” the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.

Fire officials are investigating the fire’s origin.
