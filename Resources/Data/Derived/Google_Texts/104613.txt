In early December Jeff Bezos told “60 Minutes” one of Amazon’s long term goals: delivery drones. Prime Air, as it’s known, would deliver packages under 5 pounds via drone to customers within 30 minutes of clicking “purchase.” At that time, Bezos laid out a five year time-line, and it seems he wasn’t kidding.

In a letter to shareholders published by the SEC, Bezos said that Prime Air was “already flight testing our fifth and sixth generation aerial vehicles, and we are in the design phase on generations seven and eight.” The letter, which can be viewed here, does not highlight how much work has been done to the drones, or when they’ll make their eventual debut.

The drones face many hurdles: battery power, safety, GPS, landing abilities, security, legality and FAA approval to name a few. Yet the idea itself — dripping with consumer instant gratification and whiffs of surveillance — is terrifying enough.
