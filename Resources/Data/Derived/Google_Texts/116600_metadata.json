July has arrived, and so we must disband, but I want to leave you all with a few closing thoughts on what I am (cautiously) calling a not-too-pivotal term at the court. This term left us with few new certainties about the justices. Instead, it showed us a Roberts court torn among multiple potential visions of itself.\n\nFrom my seat at the table, three trends defined the term. As David Cole has noted, we saw opinions noteworthy in their incrementalism\u2014narrow holdings in McCutcheon, Harris, and McCullen (among other also-rans) that moved the law haltingly to the right but left intact important precedents. So, too, did we see a trend toward unprecedented unanimity: huge decisions on controversial issues (abortion-related speech, presidential power, privacy rights) delivered by a unified court\u2014faux unanimous, perhaps, but unanimous nevertheless.\n\nLurking beneath this unanimity, as Dahlia pointed out, there emerged as well both deep divisions and an undeniable trend towards conservatism. Incrementalism, unanimity, and divisive conservatism: each a clear theme in the 2013\u2013\u201914 term, all braiding together into our understanding of an increasingly complex court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFirst, though many of us feared that this term the court might issue a series of blockbuster decisions eviscerating many key values and freedoms established by earlier precedents, we instead exited the last week of June sharing Emily\u2019s feeling: \u201cIt Could Be Worse.\u201d It\u2019s hard to deny that nothing transformative actually happened this term. McCutcheon moved campaign finance reform laws further to the right, yet left in place Congress\u2019 ability to regulate campaign contributions. Harris failed to overrule Abood, preserving public-sector unions, perhaps to the consternation of four justices. Despite Emily and Dahlia\u2019s need for a break from the First Amendment, McCullen, limited sharply to its facts, left open the extent to which speech outside abortion clinics may be regulated, just as Hobby Lobby, at least for now, applies only to closely held corporations. While it hurts me to hear about the scene outside abortion clinics in the wake of McCullen, Dick, I am optimistic that the court\u2019s decision, along with the decision in Hobby Lobby, is already motivating Democrats to continue fighting for reproductive rights in state legislatures and the court of public opinion.\n\nIncrementalism, unanimity, and divisive conservatism: all braiding together into our understanding of an increasingly complex court.\n\nSecond, just as the term was defined by incrementalism, so too was it the year of unanimity. Neal Katyal pointed out last week that this court has decided cases unanimously more than 60 percent of the time\u2014the highest percentage of unanimity since 1940. Neal argues that this is a sign of a \u201cnew consensus\u201d among the justices; others, such as Justice Scalia in his McCullen concurrence, argue that it is a mere \u201cspecious unanimity.\u201d And Eric thinks it\u2019s a one-year blip. As I discussed last week, the truth is somewhere in between. On one hand, this term was not lacking in ideologically divisive cases divided along the much-criticized 5\u20134 lines\u2014McCutcheon, Greece v. Galloway, Hobby Lobby, and Harris v. Quinn. So too were cases that purported to be divisive ultimately decided unanimously by the court\u2014Bond, Riley, Lane v. Franks, McCullen, and Noel Canning. The price for unanimity in these cases may have been the narrowness of their rulings\u2014unanimity breeds incrementalism. But unanimity\u2014even specious unanimity\u2014may indeed be a sign that Chief Justice Roberts is working hard to achieve the consensus he promised in his confirmation hearings.\n\nBut third, unanimity notwithstanding, there are clearly deep divisions on the court, as in the nation at large, and the wind is blowing in a conservative direction. Dahlia notes that Harris and Hobby Lobby belied the faux-nanimity of the previous week. I agree with her and others that Hobby Lobby and Harris were wrongly decided, and like my colleague Noah Feldman, I am fearful of Justice Alito\u2019s vision for the future of religious exemptions and public-sector unions. I\u2019ve already described how I feel about Harris. As to Hobby Lobby, I remain concerned about its scope and I don\u2019t think that a plausible reading of the phrase \u201cexercise of religion,\u201d as that language appears in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, includes what the family-owned businesses in the case were doing. Most of all, the decision does not evince sufficient sensitivity to the importance to women of often highly expensive contraceptive care.\n\nHobby Lobby and Harris demonstrate a consistent theme of this term: The seeds of conservative transformations lurk in the court\u2019s narrow decisions. Will Hobby Lobby remain merely a rule for closely held corporations, or does it herald a sea change in the court\u2019s willingness to carve gaping holes in laws of general application for failing to accommodate religious objectors? Does Harris symbolize the first chess move (or, more accurately, the second) in a game that ends with the destruction of public-sector unions? It may be too soon to tell.\n\nIn short, we cannot be sure where the court\u2019s cautious incrementalism, \u201cspecious\u201d unanimity, and strategic chess game will lead. Indeed, above all, the term reminds us that we must embrace, at times, our uncertainty. No single narrative\u2014be it ideological partisanship, conservative activism, or consensus\u2014is adequate to define a diverse set of jurists with diverse views. We should not expect otherwise.\n\nNor can we be certain just yet what Chief John Roberts\u2019 true legacy will ultimately be. Cautious incrementalist, consensus-builder, or strategic conservative? We\u2019ll have to wait until the fall to see what happens next.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "It wasn\u2019t a pivotal year, but the wind blows conservative.", "sailthru.tags": "Supreme Court 2014, Supreme Court unanimity, Supreme Court 9-0, Supreme Court 5-4, Roberts unanimity, Rehnquist unanimity, Rehnquist fragmented court, vote split Supreme Court", "sailthru.author": "Laurence H.
