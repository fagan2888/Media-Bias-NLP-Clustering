It\u2019s referring to the time a Dave Obey staffer called the Capitol Police after she tried to manhandle me in a futile effort to stop us from asking the congressman about bizarre expenditures buried in Obamacare.\n\nAfter a short detention, which scared the crap out of a 22-year-old me, we were released. We went on to film more interviews with guys like Alan Grayson and Jim Moran. Jason used them to promote his first bestseller, Obama Zombies.\n\nFor Crapitalism, Mattera is returning to form. He\u2019s gone after the likes of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi. The video of him confronting Lois Lerner has drawn the most attention, even sparking outrage and handwringing from some.\n\nI can understand where they\u2019re coming from. When I first watched I thought maybe Jason shouldn\u2019t have gone to where Lerner lives or confronted her as she walked her dogs. (Though it\u2019s pretty interesting that her neighbors won\u2019t let her in when she tries to take refuge from Mattera and his cameraman in their home.)\n\nThen I realized this was nothing new. Jason was simply doing what TV reporters have done for decades. It is something they still do to this day. He wasn\u2019t conducting some sort of needless intrusion into a private citizen\u2019s life. He was doing a tough interview with an important public figure who didn\u2019t want to answer the questions he was posing.\n\nIt\u2019s something that goes on everyday across the country. TV journalists always loved doing it.\n\nJust watch CBS News\u2019 retrospective on Mike Wallace\u2019s career. There\u2019s a whole sequence, beginning around the 6:30 mark, glorifying his ambush interviews.\n\nIf you turn on the local news right now you\u2019ll probably see some reporter showing up at the door of a city official accused of fraud or a local business owner accused of running a scam.\n\nThe only real differences between those reports, which draw no outrage, and the ones Mattera does are the targets and the lines of questioning.Mattera goes after corrupt liberal politicians, bureaucrats, and activists. He asks them questions the rest of the media won\u2019t. That\u2019s why his videos are treated differently.\n\nThe same is true of another friend of mine: James O\u2019Keefe.\n\nEvery time O\u2019Keefe releases a new video the left tries to dismiss it based on his tactics alone, as though undercover investigations or stings are something new. Or something that O\u2019Keefe hasn\u2019t brought a new level of transparency to by releasing all of his raw video.\n\nCompare, for example, any of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s videos with this 1991 ABC investigation of crisis pregnancy centers, which condense three months\u2019 worth of undercover video down into a few short clips, and which include as much editorializing as any O\u2019Keefe or Mattera video has ever had.\n\nThere was no media outrage over that report, or the nearly identical one from Vice News this year, because of the target.\n\nThe same paradigm can be applied to Crapitalism itself.\n\nIf Mattera were documenting the corruption of Mitch McConnell, the Koch brothers, and Bill O\u2019Reilly instead of Harry Reid, Tom Steyer, and Jay Z, you can be sure he\u2019d receive a glowing reception from the Today Show to MSNBC.\n\nInstead, he\u2019s getting challenged to knife fights.\n\nThat\u2019s too bad, because the book is impressive. In typical Mattera form, Crapitalism coats serious analysis in a layer of snark. He documents a myriad of different ways in which politicians, business owners, and activists rip off taxpayers in order to line their own pockets.\n\nThose expecting a typical bomb-throwing conservative concoction won\u2019t be disappointed, but they may be surprised. Mattera\u2019s rhetoric wouldn\u2019t be out of place on an AM radio talk show. He doesn\u2019t hesitate to skewer his targets. However, his takedowns are meticulously researched.\n\nMattera\u2019s tactics aren\u2019t new. But his targets are.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "\u201cTo Steve: the only other person I\u2019ve been detained with.\u201d    That\u2019s inscribed on the first page of my copy of Crapitalism by its author, Jason Mattera.
