Sessions has repeatedly called on Congress to reduce the number of green cards issued, including in an op-ed last week one day prior to the Paris attack.\n\n\u201cEighty-three percent of voters want to see projected immigration growth reduced \u2014 which means Congress must take up and pass a bill to reduce the number of visas handed out each year,\u201d Sessions wrote. \u201cCongress should immediately begin to move popular immigration reforms that would be backed by overwhelming majorities of voters, including\u2026 blocking the president from using federal funds to unilaterally expand the costly refugee resettlement program.\u201d\n\nIn his question, Hannity asked Ryan point blank about some of Sessions\u2019 recent analysis. Hannity said:\n\nWe have resettled 1.5 million Muslim migrants in the United States. Senator Sessions had put out a piece where all these people that we took in to the country then come here and then get involved in terror activity. I put it up on my website, I urge you to take a look at it. And we take in 100,000 Muslim immigrants into the United States every year. Do we have to think about somebody who grows up under Sharia\u2014 believes that women can\u2019t drive, can\u2019t be seen in public without a male relative, four eyewitnesses for rape\u2014 do we have a clash of cultures we\u2019ve got to consider? How do we know if they want to assimilate? How do we know if they want to bring terror into the United States? How will we ascertain that?\n\nRyan replied:\n\nWell, first of all, I don\u2019t think a religious test is appropriate. That\u2019s not who we are. We believe in the first amendment of religious freedom. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the appropriate test because anybody can come under the guise of something else. It\u2019s not hard for a person to claim that they are something that they\u2019re not\u2014 like a Christian or something like that to get into the country. That is why we are calling for a security test. I think the test that maters is a security test because anybody can try and infiltrate this country by posing as something that they are not, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the proper test. I think a security test is the proper test.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nRyan\u2019s view stands opposed to that of his Congressional colleagues Sen. Rand Paul, Reps. Cynthia Lummis, Brian Babin, Dave Brat, Randy Weber and Steve King, who\u2014as Breitbart News recently reported\u2014have all expressed support for a reduction or suspension of visa issuances to Muslim countries with jihadist movements.\n\nBy declaring that it would not be \u201cproper\u201d or \u201cappropriate\u201d for the United States to consider the religion of a visa applicant\u2014 or whether the applicant supports Sharia law or Muslim theocracy\u2014 Ryan is effectively suggesting that the United States should not be allowed to select whom we admit based on likelihood of assimilation.\n\nThis view is consistent with Ryan\u2019s two decade long history of pushing open borders immigration policies. As NumbersUSA President Roy Beck has said, \u201c[Ryan] has spent his entire adulthood ideologically connected to the open borders crowd. Open Borders is in his ideological DNA\u2026 Open borders seeps out of every pore of his being\u2026 It\u2019s just who he is.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Ryan insisted that it is the job of a U.S. lawmaker to put oneself in the shoes of a foreign national\u2014who does not live in the United States, but would like to come here\u2014 and then work to find solutions to improve the life of that foreign citizen:\n\nPut yourself in another person\u2019s shoes, which if you\u2019re in elected office, that\u2019s what you kind of have to do that almost every single day. The job we have\u2013 and what we do is we take different people\u2019s perspectives. The gentleman from India who\u2019s waiting for his green card\u2026 We take all these different perspectives. We process it through our values and our morals and our principles. And then we come up with the answer to try and solve this problem. That\u2019s basically what we do in our jobs.\n\nIndeed, Ryan was instrumental in defeating an effort to cut visa issuances during the mid-90s, thus derailing the effort to codify into law Civil Rights leader Barbara Jordan\u2019s plan for substantial immigration cuts in order to protect the American worker. As Game Change author John Heilemann wrote in 1996, \u201c[Ryan\u2019s] ties to the pro-immigration mafia ran deep.\u201d\n\nHannity pressed Ryan specifically about the House\u2019s legislation that will allow Obama to continue the Syrian refugee resettlement plan, which is opposed by a majority of all voters. Hannity asked Ryan about Babin\u2019s amendment, which as Breitbart News reported, was \u201cblocked [tonight] by House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions (R-TX) \u2013 that would have placed a six-month moratorium on allowing refugees into the United States.\u201d\n\nHannity asked:\n\nAre you including the Babin amendment, which would put a pause for six months on it, or are you not including that part [to the House\u2019s legislation]?\n\nRyan replied:\n\nThis would put a pause, I believe, for longer than that. This effectively puts a pause on the program and it will take longer than six months, I believe, to put these kind of security\u2026\n\nHowever, Sen. Sessions specifically debunked this claim in a statement released earlier on Wednesday. Sessions explained that Ryan\u2019s plan\u2014far from blocking Obama\u2019s refugee resettlement project\u2014would allow for unlimited immigration and does nothing to strengthen the security of the American people:\n\nThe current proposal being considered in the House in response to the President\u2019s dangerous refugee plan \u2013 the American SAFE Act \u2013 fails to defend the interests of the American people\u2026 The American SAFE Act allows the President to continue to bring in as many refugees as he wants from anywhere in the world. With respect to Syria and Iraq, the American SAFE Act requires only that the President direct his Secretary of Homeland Security, Director of National Intelligence, and FBI Director (all his appointees) to sign off on the administration\u2019s screening process \u2013 a process that the White House continually asserts is adequate and \u2018ensures safety.\u2019 The plain fact is that this bill transfers the prerogative from Congress to President Obama and ensures the President\u2019s refugee resettlement initiative will continue unabated.\n\nNumbersUSA, a pro-security immigration group, echoed Sessions\u2019 criticism of the Ryan\u2019s plan:\n\nNumbersUSA is extremely disappointed in the legislation that the House intends to put on the floor on Thursday to respond to the threat of Islamic State-inspired terrorists infiltrating the refugee flow to the United States\u2026 Instead of legislating that pause, or even bringing to the floor an existing bill (H.R. 3314 by Rep. Babin) that would pause the refugee flow, the House instead will vote to cede its responsibility for America\u2019s safety to the FBI, the DNI, and DHS in the hopes that they can pick and choose correctly from a limited number of \u201ccovered\u201d aliens.\n\nIn the interview, however, Ryan seemed determined to convey that the House\u2019s bill would, in fact, \u201cpause\u201d refugee resettlement\u2014despite the contrary analyses of Sen. Sessions and NumbersUSA.\n\nThroughout the course of the short interview, Ryan specifically declared seven times that the House\u2019s legislation would \u201cpause\u201d refugee resettlement.\n\nBreitbart News has compiled Ryan\u2019s uses of the word \u201cpause\u201d throughout the interview:\n\nHe [Obama] just said he\u2019s going to veto our bill putting a pause on the refugee program\u2026 We obviously know that ISIS wants to infiltrate the refugee population, that\u2019s very clear, so we need to put a pause on this program\u2026 We have to put this bill in place which pauses the program effectively\u2026 This [legislation] would put a pause, I believe, for longer than [the Babin measure]. This effectively puts a pause on the program and it will take longer than six months, I believe, to put [in place] these kinds of security\u2026 The FBI cannot right now certify these standards, so this [legislation] does pause the program\u2026 We are asking all of our colleagues to support fixing this\u2014 pausing this\u2014 and getting this right.\n\nRyan\u2019s emphatic insistence that the legislation will \u201cpause\u201d the refugee resettlement program may be fueled by polling data, which shows that the American people overwhelmingly want to see the program blocked.\n\nAs Hannity explained:\n\nHere\u2019s my question though\u2026 Why don\u2019t we just cancel it? Why don\u2019t we just say, \u2018You cannot come here, it\u2019s too big a risk to the American people.\u2019 I don\u2019t think we can fully ascertain what\u2019s in people\u2019s hearts. I don\u2019t think anybody can assure us that ISIS wouldn\u2019t lie and create documents and the document trail, I think they would do anything to get here. Why don\u2019t we just end the program and that might mean defunding the program. Wouldn\u2019t that be a better idea? [\u2026] We have two polls\u2014 two polls that are out that show two-to-one the American people are against Obama bringing in Syrian refugees altogether. I would prefer\u2014 I don\u2019t know if we can really fully vet anybody like this. Nor do we have the resources. I personally am of the belief that we shouldn\u2019t taking them in. I think it\u2019s too big a risk.\n\nRyan said, in part, that the reason the program could not simply be canceled is because, \u201cWe\u2019re a compassionate country. The refugees laws are important laws and we don\u2019t want terrorists to dictate how we run\u2014whether we have a law or not.\u201d\n\nWhile throughout the interview Ryan seemed to ground his argument on the premise that we cannot apply a religious test as a basis for admissions to the United States, both Rush Limbaugh and Andrew McCarthy have explained how U.S. law does, in fact, require a religious test when it comes to making considerations about visa issuances.\n\nMcCarthy explained:\n\nUnder federal law, the executive branch is expressly required to take religion into account in determining who is granted asylum. Under the provision governing asylum (section 1158 of Title 8, U.S. Code), an alien applying for admission must establish that \u2026 religion [among other things] \u2026 was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant. Moreover, to qualify for asylum in the United States, the applicant must be a \u201crefugee\u201d as defined by federal law. That definition (set forth in Section 1101(a)(42)(A) of Title , U.S. Code) also requires the executive branch to take account of the alien\u2019s religion: The term \u201crefugee\u201d means (A) any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality \u2026 and who is unable or unwilling to return to \u2026 that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of \u2026 religion [among other things] \u2026[.] The law requires a \u201creligious test\u2026 it is downright dishonest to claim that taking such religious distinctions into account is \u201cnot American\u201d\u2026 How can something American law requires be \u201cnot American\u201d?\n\nLimbaugh said:\n\nWhen I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who\u2019s fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, that\u2019s shameful. That\u2019s not American. That\u2019s not who we are. We don\u2019t have religious tests to our compassion.\u201d I would venture to say that virtually everybody who hears him say that probably has to nod their head in agreement. \u201cYeah, yeah, that\u2019s probably right.\u201d Except you\u2019d all be wrong\u2026 It\u2019s in federal law. There are religious tests and requirements through the United States law.. the law requires a religious test, and the reason for the religious test is obvious\u2026 Asylum is a discretionary national act of compassion directed by law, not a whim to address persecution\u2026 There is no right to emigrate to the United States of America\u2026 Nowhere does the law say we must put ourselves at risk in order to exercise this compassion\u2026Therefore, us \u2014 we \u2014 by maintaining our standards as established by law, protecting our national security and sovereignty are not violating anybody\u2019s rights by standing up for our own.\n\nMoreover, a provision in the Immigration and Naturalization Act states, \u201cIn general \u2013 any immigrant who is or has been a member of or affiliated with the communist or other totalitarian party (or subdivision or affiliate thereof), domestic or foreign, is inadmissible.\u201d\n\nThis arguably could apply to individuals who hold theocratic or totalitarian ideologies. In fact, in recent video footage captured on the streets of Cedar Riverside, Minnesota, showed a number of U.S. Muslims explaining that they preferred Sharia Law to American law.\n\nRegardless, every year, under Ryan\u2019s vision the United States can expect to continue to bring in two Muslim migrants for every one Iowa Republican primary voter. According to Pew, by 2040, the United States\u2019 Muslim population is expected to surpass the nation\u2019s Jewish population. It is unlikely that the Muslim migrants brought in under the nation\u2019s current federal policy will support Ryan\u2019s limited government platform as only 11% of U.S. Muslim, according to Pew, are Republican or lean-Republican. Ryan\u2019s continued support for the visa gusher, however, is consistent with his past statements on the matter.\n\nWhen radio talk show host David Webb asked Ryan last year whether he thought, \u201cimmigrants from the third world are more likely or less likely to support conservative policies,\u201d Ryan answered that he thought \u201cimmigrants from the third world\u201d were \u201csome of the best Americans\u201d.\n\nRyan declared:", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is ruling out making any cuts to Muslim immigration.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is ruling out making any cuts to Muslim immigration.", "title": "Paul Ryan Tells Sean Hannity He Will Not Support Any Cuts To Muslim Immigration: 'That's Not Who We Are' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 642, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/GettyImages-497506788.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-11-19T07:00:49-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/19/paul-ryan-tells-sean-hannity-will-not-support-cuts-muslim-immigration-thats-not/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is ruling out making any cuts to Muslim immigration.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/GettyImages-497506788.jpg", "title": "Paul Ryan Tells Sean Hannity He Will Not Support Any Cuts To Muslim Immigration: 'That's Not Who We Are' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Immigration,Paul Ryan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-11-19T06:15:43-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration", "modified_time": "2015-11-19T07:00:49-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "According to Pew, by 2040, the United States\u2019 Muslim population is expected to surpass the nation\u2019s Jewish population.\nHannity said:We have resettled 1.5 million Muslim migrants in the United States.\nAnd we take in 100,000 Muslim immigrants into the United States every year.\nRegardless, every year, under Ryan\u2019s vision the United States can expect to continue to bring in two Muslim migrants for every one Iowa Republican primary voter.\nHow do we know if they want to bring terror into the United States?"}
