UnitedHealth, citing its losses, has threatened to pull out of the exchanges in 2017, and Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers are also facing losses tied to individual market products.\n\nBut Counihan says that during the ACA's third open enrollment period, \"we're seeing the maturing of a marketplace--people getting a bit more experienced and comfortable on how to buy coverage,\" The Hill reports.\n\nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt concurred during an earlier presentation at the AHIP forum Tuesday, adding that health plans, too, are still learning what products and services work best for consumers on the exchanges.\n\nFor the 2016 open enrollment period, that has often meant more narrow-network plans, which appeal to price-conscious customers and also help insurers trim costs. CMS plans to start labeling Healthcare.gov plans according to network breadth, but it has backed off on some proposals that would more strictly regulate network adequacy.\n\nCMS also is working with the state-run ACA marketplaces to monitor any issues they're experiencing, Counihan said during his presentation. So far, he said, he's met with about 20 exchange CEOs and he and his state have visited 13 states. Lawmakers have criticized CMS' oversight of the state-run exchanges, as some have struggled with IT troubles and decided to switch instead to the federal enrollment platform.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read The Hill article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nQ4 earnings roundup: Big five insurers' ACA exchange woes deepen\n\nMore than 8 million enroll in Healthcare.gov plans, including more young customers\n\nIn struggle over future of ACA exchanges, consumers caught in the middle\n\nFitch expects BCBS companies' 2015 earnings to fall\n\nCMS' Andy Slavitt defends oversight of state exchanges", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though major U.S. health insurers have increasingly raised concerns about the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, Healthcare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan says there are reasons to be optimistic that the market is stabilizing.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "Though major U.S. health insurers have increasingly raised concerns about the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, Healthcare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan says there are reasons to be optimistic that the market is stabilizing.", "title": "Kevin Counihan, Andy Slavitt try to ease insurers' ACA worries", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/kevin-counihan-andy-slavitt-try-ease-insurers-aca-worries/2016-03-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act Exchanges,America's Health Insurance Plans,Andy Slavitt,Health Insurance Exchanges,Kevin Counihan,Open Enrollment", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance Exchanges"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26cd\"", "article_summary": "For the 2016 open enrollment period, that has often meant more narrow-network plans, which appeal to price-conscious customers and also help insurers trim costs.\nThough major U.S. health insurers have increasingly raised concerns about the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, federal officials say there are reasons to be optimistic that the market is stabilizing.\nCMS also is working with the state-run ACA marketplaces to monitor any issues they're experiencing, Counihan said during his presentation.\nBut Counihan says that during the ACA's third open enrollment period, \"we're seeing the maturing of a marketplace--people getting a bit more experienced and comfortable on how to buy coverage,\" The Hill reports.\nRecent earnings reports from the nation's five largest health insurers have pointed to worrying signs, with the companies saying high numbers of older and sicker ACA plan enrollees have driven up medical costs."}
