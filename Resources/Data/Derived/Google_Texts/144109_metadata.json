The links to health and wellness topics will cover selected national and international sources to help you keep your finger on the pulse of what\u2019s new and useful in achieving and maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle, and stay abreast of healthcare news.\n\nRETAILERS IN FLORIDA MAY HAVE RECEIVED TAINTED BEEF\n\nYou might want to be extra careful with those Memorial Day weekend charcoal-grilled burgers. CNN reports that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because they could be contaminated with Escherichia coli.\n\nThe USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service named retailers in 9 states, with Gordon Food Service (GFS) Marketplace stores in Florida, Surf N Turf Market in Sebring, and Giorgio\u2019s Italian Delicatessen in Stuart listed as having possibly received the tainted products. GFS Marketplace has stores throughout Central and South Florida, including Melbourne, Orlando and Daytona Beach.\n\nRESEARCHERS STUDY EFFECTS OF MOBILE PHONES ON TEENAGE BRAINS\n\nA large prospective study of mobile phone use and cognitive impairments in teens is launching in Britain. According to Reuters, the researchers aim to recruit around 2,500 11 to 12 year-old school children and follow their cognitive development over two years while collecting data on how often, for what, and for how long they use mobile or smart phones and other wireless devices.\n\nTOO MANY MEN AND WOMEN IN BLACK SUITS?\n\nNow that healthcare reform is a reality, Dr. Kevin Campbell says, \u201cAs the number of hospital administrators and insurance company executives grow, hospital staff and services continue to be cut\u2014nurses and doctors are asked to care for more patients with fewer resources,\u201d and addresses the pressing question: \u201cWhich one do you think will positively impact patients more \u2014 fewer nurses or fewer dark suits?\u201d\n\nEXERCISE: CAN THERE BE TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING?\n\nExcessive exercise may be detrimental to one\u2019s health according to two new studies suggesting that the relationship between health and exercise is more complicated than previously thought. The researchers\u2019 summary suggests that for exercise \u201cmaximum cardiovascular benefits are obtained if performed at moderate doses, while these benefits are lost with (very) high-intensity and prolonged efforts.\u201d\n\nBRINGING BACK THE \u2018ART\u2019 OF BEDSIDE MEDICINE\n\nIn this new millennium age of medicine it seems that a physician\u2019s diagnostic acumen is increasingly primarily dependent on the incredible anatomic resolution afforded by the plethora of scans, grams and digital imaging technology, and the electronic decision support now available to us.\n\nRealizing that the \u201cart\u201d of medicine has taken a back seat to technology and hurt some doctors\u2019 abilities to use physical exams to make accurate diagnoses, Kaiser Health News reports that some medical schools have made reviving bedside medicine a new priority.\n\nED VISITS JUMP AS OBAMACARE KICKS IN, DOCTORS SAY\n\nOne of the projected benefits of extending health coverage to more people under the Affordable Care Act was less need for emergency department (ED) visits.\n\nHowever, an American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) survey reveals that ED visits have not decreased. In fact, 46 percent of physicians surveyed reported increases in patients coming through their doors since Jan. 1, the day coverage took effect for millions under Obamacare, with only 23 percent reporting a decrease.\n\nThe Huffington Post notes that it \u201cunderscores the challenges beyond extending health coverage to more people, including improving access to primary care and changing the habits of patients accustomed to using the emergency room as a one-stop-shop for medical care.\u201d\n\nAs Rebecca Parker, an emergency room doctor in Chicago who is on ACEP\u2019s board of directors, said, \u201cCoverage does not equal access. Just because you gave somebody Medicaid doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s a place for them to go in terms of a primary care, outpatient facility.\u201d\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ed visists increase,effect of mobile phones,excessive exercise,gfs marketplace,healthcare costs,healthcare executive compensation,slider,tainted beef,the art of medicine", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Health-Headlines-435-2.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "Welcome to SpaceCoastDaily\u2019s Healthcare Headlines.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6209\"", "article_summary": "Space Coast Daily Healthcare Headlines of the WeekBy Dr. James Palermo // May 24, 2014TOPICS INCLUDE TAINTED BEEF, TOO MANY BLACK SUITS, BRINGING BACK THE ART OF MEDICINE AND MOREBREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA \u2014 Welcome to SpaceCoastDaily\u2019s Healthcare Headlines.\nHowever, an American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) survey reveals that ED visits have not decreased.\nRETAILERS IN FLORIDA MAY HAVE RECEIVED TAINTED BEEFYou might want to be extra careful with those Memorial Day weekend charcoal-grilled burgers.\nCNN reports that 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because they could be contaminated with Escherichia coli.\nGFS Marketplace has stores throughout Central and South Florida, including Melbourne, Orlando and Daytona Beach."}
