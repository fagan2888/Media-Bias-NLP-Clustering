— Thousands of people put on pink Saturday for the 18th annual Susan G. Komen Triangle Race for the Cure at Meredith College in Raleigh.

The competitive Open 5K race kicked off at 7 a.m. Race day activities also included a survivor breakfast, tribute and photo; Zumba warm-up; Competitive Open 5K (co-ed), Women’s-Only 5K, Recreational Open 5K, One Mile Fun Run and Kids Dash.

WRAL News was a proud sponsor of the event.

"There are women that come here to this race recently diagnosed. They need to see that there is hope out there to get through this disease and get to the other side of it," said race Chairwoman Kathy Burns. "You take a look at this event and you see that hope and inspiration in all these faces, and to me, that is worth everything."

Pam Kohl, executive director of the Susan G. Komen North Carolina Triangle to Coast Chapter, says the race is the charity's biggest day. She draws her inspiration from those crowds and from individuals who share their stories of fear and hope in the fact of breast cancer.

"I had a friend and colleague who had breast cancer twice," she said.

In honor of that woman's battle, Kohl first participated in the Race for the Cure in 2000.

Ten years later, she would rely on the very funds she raised for research to help save her own life.

Kohl said it's because of the Komen name that women diagnosed with breast cancer are surviving longer and that a new generation is ready to step up to fight for a cure.

"It's not going away, but we can find a cure, and we can make it manageable, and that's what matters."
