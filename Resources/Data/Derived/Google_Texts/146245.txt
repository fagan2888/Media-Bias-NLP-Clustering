French President François Hollande was so eager to be with his scrumptious side dish, actress Julie Gayet, that he plotted to get his live-in girlfriend to sign an announcement of their split — while she lay in the hospital.

It was “the least worst solution,” Le Nouvel Observateur magazine reports.

But Hollande thought better of it after Valérie Trierweiler took “a pill too many” amid reports that he was slipping out of Elysée Palace to be with Gayet.

Trierweiler was not attempting suicide, but has been in a Paris hospital for a week, a source close to her told weekly newsmagazine Le Point.

It also now appears Hollande began l’affaire Gayet earlier than thought.

Gayet told a friend “more than a year ago” that she had hooked up with an “older” man “in politics,” French Elle reported, suggesting the affair began when Hollande was running for the presidency in 2012.

Hollande “had a dream” about his future with Gayet, said Le Nouvel Observateur.

He was “cold and ruthless” when he told Trierweiler of his affair Jan. 9. She overdosed the next day.

Nevertheless, he planned to get her to sign a joint announcement of their separation the next day, Saturday. But by Sunday night, he realized she would be hospitalized for days — and so abandoned his “dream.”
