A DOL spokesman also said that after the public hearing, another comment period will begin about two weeks after the hearing transcript is released. In total, that will mean there will be 140 days of comment on the proposal.\n\nThe Financial Services Roundtable (FSR), which has taken the lead among financial services trades group in pushing against the proposal, urged the DOL to further consider granting a full extension to its comment period that would simply move the comment letter deadline from July 4 to the middle of August.\n\nFrancis Creighton, FSR executive vice president of government relations, said the extra time is needed because the proposed new regulatory framework will require broad changes in policies, practices and computer systems.\n\n\u201cThe industry also needs time to assess any potential conflicts the proposal might have with other federal and state laws, as well as industry rules and regulations that impact firms\u2019 day-to-day business activities,\u201d Creighton said.\n\nThe DOL said in a statement that the comment period, \u201cis considerably longer than the typical comment period for the Employee Benefits Security Administration\u2019s (EBSA) other proposed rulemakings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe length of the extension takes into account the views of stakeholders who have asked the department not to alter its timeline for the comment period at all,\u201d the DOL spokesman said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of Labor (DOL) extended the comment period on its fiduciary standard proposal by 15 days...", "og": {"site_name": "InsuranceNewsNet", "description": "The Department of Labor (DOL) extended the comment period on its fiduciary standard proposal by 15 days...", "title": "DOL Extends Comment Period On Fiduciary Proposal - InsuranceNewsNet", "url": "http://insurancenewsnet.com/innarticle/dol-extends-comment-period-on-fiduciary-proposal", "updated_time": "2015-05-16T17:54:00+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Department of Labor (DOL) extended the comment period on its fiduciary standard proposal by 15 days...", "site": "@insnewsnet", "card": "summary", "title": "DOL Extends Comment Period On Fiduciary Proposal - InsuranceNewsNet"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-16T17:53:26-04:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insnewsnet", "published_time": "2015-05-16T17:53:26+00:00", "author": "http://insurancenewsnet.com/author/arthur-postalinnfeedback-com", "section": "INN Daily Newsletter Featured Story", "modified_time": "2015-05-16T17:54:00+00:00", "tag": "2015-05-17"}, "keywords": "insurance news, life and health, annuity news, financial news, inn daily newsletter featured story, top stories, washington insider newsletter, 2015-05-17", "google-site-verification": "tjN7Q5WvF9Qfl-Gnlk5Dtbk78wjlFGdQX6Ab6EbzPFw", "'yandex-verification'": "'4b822c768d77b153'", "yandex-verification": "4b822c768d77b153"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc026\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON\u2014 The Department of Labor (DOL) extended the comment period on its fiduciary standard proposal by 15 days.\nThe DOL said in a statement that the comment period, \u201cis considerably longer than the typical comment period for the Employee Benefits Security Administration\u2019s (EBSA) other proposed rulemakings.\u201d\u201cThe length of the extension takes into account the views of stakeholders who have asked the department not to alter its timeline for the comment period at all,\u201d the DOL spokesman said.\nA DOL spokesman also said that after the public hearing, another comment period will begin about two weeks after the hearing transcript is released.\nIn total, that will mean there will be 140 days of comment on the proposal.\nThe announcement of the extension, as well as the dates of public hearings, will be published next week in the Federal Register, the DOL said."}
