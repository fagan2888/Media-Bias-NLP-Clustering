Bashar Al-Ba'noon, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nResearchers from the University of Pennsylvania have discovered a potential new method for gum disease treatment, a new study reports. If successful, the treatment could prevent, halve, and even reverse the effects of the disease periodontitis.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, nearly half (47.2 percent) of adults over the age of 30 suffer from some form of periodontal disease, and the prevalence only increases with age: Above 65 years, 70.1 percent of adults have some form of the disease. While the disease is preventable with proper oral care, after bacteria has spread to beneath the teeth, deep under the gum line, the inflammation that results can often require surgery to fix.\n\nNow researchers believe their method, which involves a key component of the immune system, known as the \u201ccomplement system,\u201d may offer a non-invasive, therapeutic form of relief. They relied on prior research that found the bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) recruits the immune system to inflame the gums surrounding the bacteria. In their current study, they took a closer look at exactly which part of the immune system could be suppressed to avoid this inflammation.\n\n\u201cP. gingivalis has many mechanisms to escape killing by the immune system, but getting rid of inflammation altogether is not good for them because they \u2018feed\u2019 off of it,\u201d Penn researcher Evlambia Hajishengallis said in a news release.\n\nTo eradicate this inflammation, Hajishengallis and his colleagues looked at the complement system. This system serves as part of the body\u2019s overall innate immune system, which doesn\u2019t change over time and isn\u2019t adaptable, and which consists of roughly 30 proteins. In their study, the researchers looked specifically at C3, which occupies a central position in signaling circuits that trigger activation of the innate immune system along with inflammation.\n\nTheir tests of mice and non-human primates showed that mice bred to lack C3 since birth had much less bone loss and inflammation in their gums several weeks after P. gingivalis infection compared with normal mice. These results persisted even after the team tied a silk string around the mice\u2019s teeth to spur microbe collection and after they observed the disease\u2019s formation on aging mice, to mimic human aging. Monkeys who then received a human version of the drug that inhibits C3 showed the same effects, with reduced risk for bone loss.\n\n\u201cWe think this drug offers a promising possibility for treating adults with periodontitis,\u201d co-researcher John Lambris said. \u201cBlocking C3 locally in the mouth helps shift the balance of bacteria, producing an overall beneficial effect.\u201d\n\nTo the researchers\u2019 knowledge, this is the first time anyone has demonstrated the involvement of complement in inflammatory bone loss in non-human primates. They argue this could set the stage for translation to human treatments and \u201cprovide proof-of-concept that complement-targeted therapies can interfere with disease-promoting mechanisms,\u201d Hajishengallis said.\n\nSource: Maekawa T, Abe T, Hajishengallis E, et al.
