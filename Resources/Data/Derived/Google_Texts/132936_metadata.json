Some would even wish you a Happy New Year.\n\nAnnoying, maybe, but they had their own \u201890s cyber-kiddie sense of charm.\n\nSome viruses, of course, were incredibly disruptive. Now, though, viruses and malware have become even more malicious. They\u2019re out for more than just hacker cred \u2013 they\u2019re out for your money.\n\nFor a long time, malware scammers used tactics known as Scareware. The malicious software fraudulently claims that your computer has a serious virus infection then sends you to a page to buy their (useless) anti-virus software.\n\nRelated: Porn, Drugs, Hitmen, Hackers: This Is the Deep Web\n\nWhile this is certainly still around, many people have gotten wise to the fraud. Now some scammers are playing hardball. Enter Ransomware.\n\nRansomware is a form of malware that encrypts files on your hard drives with a highly complicated algorithm then presents you with an ultimatum: Pay up or you lose your files forever. The inherent brilliance in the software is this: While the software can be removed, the files remain encrypted. Paying the ransom is the only chance you have to see your files again.\n\nAlthough this scam has been around since 1989, only recently has it become widespread due to advancements in cryptography algorithms, the ability to extort via the anonymous currency Bitcoin, and the digitization of once-analog items of sentimental value like family photos and home videos.\n\nSome consumers are aware of the latest and most notable iteration of this trend known as CryptoLocker, which encrypts the user\u2019s data with a 2048-bit RSA Algorithm. The scammers weren\u2019t fooling around when they invented this complicated algorithm, which is incredibly difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to crack without a key, which will cost victims about $150 to $300.\n\nCryptolocker has been incredibly successful. Owing to surprisingly good \u201ccustomer service\u201d \u2014 the majority of people who pay the ransom have their files restored \u2014 the men behind the Cryptolocker curtain have raked in over $27 million in Bitcoin over a period of three months, according to an examination of the Bitcoin blockchain by ZDNet.\n\nRelated: Cyber Crime Pays: A $114 Billion Industry\n\nDue to the inherent success of the software, it seems only logical that a bevy of copycats would show up.\n\nAnd they have. In droves.\n\nOne version, which claimed the owner of the computer had been caught with illicit material on his computer, demanded a fine. The ordeal caused a Romanian man to take his own life and that of his son two weeks ago.\n\nWhile Ransomware has evolved as a threat to home computer users, it bears a sizeable risk to the business world as well. After all, the earlier versions of Cryptolocker actually targeted business professionals, hiding itself within emails claiming to be a \u201cconsumer complaint.\u201d\n\nMcAfee, the prominent maker of anti-virus products, predicts that Ransomware in 2014 will evolve to further target businesses and business owners, and that the software will shift to the mobile realm this year. Scammers will, according to McAfee, use the information gleaned from business owners' mobile devices to gain a \u201ctactical advantage\u201d over the businesses, which could end up costing them untold amounts of money.\n\nIt's scary stuff certainly, but home users and business owners still have one easy way out \u2013 ensuring all their files are backed up using a cloud-based service, untouchable to any scammers.\n\nIn terms of which service to pick, there are hundreds of them out there.\n\nBox for Business is an affordable option, offering a terabyte of storage per user, at a price of $15 a user.\n\nAmazon\u2019s S3 offer\u2019s a pay-per-use monthly pricing scale at 10 cents a gigabyte.\n\nAt $55 a month for 3 users, SugarSync for Business is a slightly pricier option, but boasts a collaborative sharing platform and mobile access.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuffice it to say, regardless of the particular needs of your family or your organization, there\u2019s a service out there\u2019s that caters to them. There\u2019s no excuse to keep only data stored locally.\n\nOnce everyone does this, Ransomware will seem much less threatening.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Viruses and malware have become more malicious.
