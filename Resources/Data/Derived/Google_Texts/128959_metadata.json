But then, well, there is the unexpected.\n\nHow do you stop any president from trampling on the United States Constitution?\n\nWhat health care reforms would you enact for active US Coast Guard members and their families?\n\nWould you support 100 percent funding of the federal Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund?\n\nWhile so much of presidential campaigning is about super PACs and national polls, media buys and televised debates, in New Hampshire, with its first-in-the-nation primary, candidates are still expected to open themselves up to unscreened questions of all types \u2014 questions that can lead to some unlikely conversations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd candidates go out of their way to let voters know they are not afraid to participate.\n\n\u201cI want to leave a lot of time for questions \u2019cause I want to hear from you,\u201d Bobby Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, told an audience in Manchester late last month.\n\nMore than anyone else, Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, has made himself available for unscripted questions from the public. Last Wednesday\u2019s town hall meeting in Ashland \u2014 his 12th in New Hampshire since January \u2014 was no different, providing a microcosm of what is on the minds of voters.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of rules here,\u201d Christie told a standing-room-only crowd at the American Legion post. \u201cYou raise your hands, and I\u2019ll call on you.\u201d\n\nAnd one after another, for more than an hour, Christie did just that, answering about a dozen questions. There were the anticipated queries \u2014 those often cited in polls as the most important issues to primary voters \u2014 about paying down the national debt and reforming the Affordable Care Act. Then there were the unforeseen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a little bit more on a personal note, a family note,\u201d Janet Moorehead, 75, of Plymouth, began her question to Christie. \u201cFor the past seven years or so we\u2019ve been protecting a house in a Chicago that\u2019s just sitting there. And this Father\u2019s Day, the president was off in California while his wife and two kids were over in Europe. How would your family life be different?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo here\u2019s an answer to your question, by giving you an example of what Mary Pat and I did when I became governor,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWe had a young family back then, and the promise I made to her was if I won, we wouldn\u2019t move to the governor\u2019s mansion.\u201d\n\nThat way, he said, his children wouldn\u2019t have to change schools and could keep a sense normalcy in their lives.\n\nA move to the White House is inevitable, should he win the presidency. Still, Christie said: \u201cOur family will remain as normal as we can possibly remain if this happens. We sat and talked about it as a family. This was a family decision to do this.\u201d\n\nDominick Reuter/Reuters/File 2015 \u201cI want to leave a lot of time for questions \u2019cause I want to hear from you,\u201d Bobby Jindal, the Republican governor of Louisiana, told an audience in Manchester late last month.\n\nKameron Theos had a hard-hitting follow-up.\n\n\u201cIf you become president of the United States,\u201d the 6-year-old from Belmont said as Christie stooped over so the little boy could talk into a microphone. \u201cWould you invite me to the White House?\u201d\n\n\u201cKameron, here\u2019s the deal,\u201d Christie started, as the room erupted in laughter and applause. \u201cWhen I was running for governor for the first time in 2009, I had a young man who said to me: \u2018If you get elected governor, will you invite me to the governor\u2019s office and let me sit at your desk?\u2019 And I said \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018Not a lot of rules here. You raise your hands, and I\u2019ll call on you.\u2019 Chris Christie, GOP presidential candidate, addressing a crowd at an American Legion post in Ashland, N.H.\n\nChristie said he made good on that promise and promised to do the same if elected president.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m not encouraging every child who comes to a town hall meeting to ask this question. However, Kameron, there is something special about being the first.\u201d\n\nNext came Caitlin Patenaude, who read her question from a piece of paper, having given the topic much thought beforehand.\n\n\u201cAffordable housing and health care are very strongly linked, and studies show that stable housing can lead to a healthier America,\u201d said the law student and intern at J. Ronald Terwilliger Foundation for Housing America\u2019s Families. \u201cAs president, what policies would you implement to make housing more affordable to allow Americans to live healthier lives?\u201d\n\nStates and the federal government must work together to rehabilitate the available housing stock to make it more affordable, Christie responded.\n\n\u201cThe second thing we have to do is have a growing economy,\u201d he continued.\n\nCourtney Pelletier of Belmont told Christie \u2014 and the crowd \u2014 that when she turned 18 last year, \u201cI voted at the first opportunity that I could.\u201d But, she continued, many of her friends did not.\n\n\u201cI wondered if you have an idea of how you can begin to pique young people\u2019s interest in their civic duty?\u201d she asked.\n\nIt\u2019s simple, Christie said: \u201cCandidates have to excite people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.3648009488", "eomportal-id": 494834, "description": "Presidential candidates are still expected to answer unscreened questions from New Hampshire voters.
