A brilliant AT reader ThinkingOutLoud compares the "red line" is everyone's responsibility blather by Obama to this:

"But you can't hold a whole fraternity responsible for the behavior of a few sick, perverted individuals. If you do, shouldn't we blame the whole fraternity system? And if the whole fraternity system is guilty, then isn't this an indictment of our education institutions in general? I put it to you, Greg. Isn't this an indictment of our entire American society? Well, you can do what you want to us, but we won't sit here and listen to you badmouth the United States of America!" - Animal House, 1978
