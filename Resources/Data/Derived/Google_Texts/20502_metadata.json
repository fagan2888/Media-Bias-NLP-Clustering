Trey Gowdy (R-SC) must be wondering why he bothers. The chair of the House Select Committee that is investigating the attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi in 2012 has gone to great lengths to create the appearance of a committee dedicated to uncovering the truth and to avoid creating the perception that the committee is an exercise in partisanship meant to derail Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe has assiduously avoided mentioning Clinton\u2019s name in hearings and has pushed back hard against Democrats\u2019 claims that the 17-month, $4.5 million investigation is a witch hunt. But his fellow Republicans keep making it tough for him.\n\nRelated: Gowdy\u2019s Dream of an Unsullied Committee Dashed\n\nJust a few weeks ago, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, in an appearance on Fox News, gave the committee credit for driving down Clinton\u2019s poll numbers, in a way that made it sound as though that was the whole point of the investigation.\n\nJust as McCarthy\u2019s comments were subsiding, a conservative Republican Air Force major who had worked on the committee announced that he was filing a lawsuit claiming that he was wrongfully terminated. The reason? Objecting to what he characterized as the committee\u2019s obsession with targeting Clinton.\n\nGowdy spent much of the weekend pushing back against that story, challenging the honesty of the former staffer\u2019s account and vigorously defending the committee\u2019s conduct.\n\nBut as soon as those headlines began to fade, another Republican member of the House repeated the claim that the purpose of the hearings was to damage Clinton.\n\nRelated: Sensing an Advantage, Clinton Skewers GOP on Benghazi Probe\n\nIn an interview with the Utica, N.Y., radio station WIBX, Rep. Richard Hanna (R-NY) said, \u201cKevin McCarthy basically blew himself up with that comment over the Benghazi committee \u2026 Sometimes the biggest sin you can commit in D.C. is to tell the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis may not be politically correct,\u201d Hanna said, \u201cbut I think there was a big part of this investigation that was designed to go after an individual, Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter what Kevin McCarthy said, it\u2019s difficult to accept at least a part of it was not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way Washington works. But you\u2019d like to expect more from a committee that\u2019s spent millions of dollars and tons of time.\u201d\n\nHanna didn\u2019t completely dismiss the committee\u2019s mission, however, saying, \u201cI also think there is a lot of it that is important, and we needed to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nRelated: Clinton Finally Catches a Break on Benghazi, from the Mis-Speaker of the House\n\nThe Clinton campaign was quick to jump on the comments, saying in a statement, \u201cYet another House Republican has admitted the House Select Committee on Benghazi is a politically motivated sham intended to damage Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nHanna\u2019s comments give Clinton a boost as she prepares for her testimony before the Benghazi Committee on October 26. The growing sense that the committee is, at least in part, a political witch hunt gives her an obvious target for pushback against any negative stories that come out of the hearing next week, and might make her seem like a more sympathetic figure in the public eye when the inevitable footage of the questioning is aired.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Rep.
