In June, both hands got caught in a hay baler while Adcock worked alone on Straight Mountain.\n\nThe machine yanked off his right ring and pinkie fingers, along with most of the muscle and bones connecting them to his wrist. He pulled the right hand out with his left, which then got caught, crushed and cut in the machine.\n\nAdcock estimates that it took nearly 10 minutes to free himself from the machine. Then he wrapped up his mangled right hand and drove his truck \u2013 a stick shift \u2013 to the nearest house.\n\n\"Us country folk are tough,\" he said.\n\nBut they aren't particularly rich, which is why the Adcocks didn't have health coverage since the late 1980s. The family couldn't afford to pay nearly $1,200 a month for a policy.\n\nThe Obamacare policy they signed up for last year cost $102 a month, and it completely covered Hank's $63,000 hospital bill. Without it, the family could have been financially ruined.\n\n\"I tell everyone I can about Obamacare, but some people don't want nothing to do with it.\" Adcock said.\n\nThis year, even fewer people may be open to hearing his story. Experts are predicting slower enrollment in Alabama and across the nation in 2016. Open enrollment begins on Sunday.\n\nOfficials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released estimates earlier this month that only about 1 million to 1.5 million people would gain health insurance through the marketplace this year. About 9 million gained coverage during the first two enrollment periods.\n\nMarketplace coverage in Alabama has grown more slowly than the national average in the first two years of the program. Only 28 percent of eligible Alabamians have purchased coverage on the insurance exchange, compared to 36 percent nationwide, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe uninsured rate in Alabama has fallen from 17.7 percent to 14.5 percent since the launch of Obamacare, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn Alabama, about 160,000 people who haven't enrolled are eligible for tax credits that would offset the costs of healthcare coverage through the marketplace, according to Kaiser.\n\nThose tax credits made it possible for the Adcocks to afford their Blue Cross health plan.\n\nAn analysis of premium changes in 50 U.S. cities for 2016 shows that the benchmark silver plan \u2013 which is the most popular, will cost approximately 9 percent more next year in Birmingham, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But customers eligible for tax credits could end up paying much less.\n\n\"While you are seeing premiums going up in Alabama, it's pretty much on par with the average you're seeing across the country,\" said Cynthia Cox, associate director of the Program for Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nGrowth has been slower in many of the states that didn't expand Medicaid. In many cases, people who would qualify for tax credits under Obamacare may not want to get coverage because they don't trust it, said Doug Hoffman, a navigator for Enroll Alabama.\n\nHank Adcock was wary of Obamacare coverage when he first spoke to Hoffman. His suspicions weren't driven by politics, but by concerns about the legitimacy of the coverage.\n\n\"There are just so many con artists out there these days,\" he said.\n\nAlthough there is still distrust in Alabama, cost is not as big an obstacle as it is in parts of Tennessee, where premiums are expected to increase by more than 38 percent.\n\nMany states with low enrollment are experiencing bigger increases in cost than Alabama, Cox said. One of the reasons that costs aren't increasing more may be due to the participation of the state's young people. Only about 28 percent of those enrolled nationwide are young, but in Alabama, it's 32 percent.\n\n\"Despite the relatively few people enrolled, Alabama has a large number of young adults,\" Cox said.\n\nMany Alabamians who already have Obamacare coverage will be shopping for new policies this year. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama \u2013 which dominates the insurance market in the state \u2013 announced that it would discontinue its only platinum plan and one of its gold offerings. The more expensive plans are less popular with consumers than bronze and silver plans, and the insurer sought hefty premium increases in the summer.\n\nThe good news for customers who are reenrolling and looking for a different plan is that shopping on the marketplace seems to save customers money, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. In Alabama, customers who changed plans between 2014 and 2015 saved an average of $16 a month according to the department.\n\nHoffman said the state still struggles with a large number of people who fall into the \"Medicaid gap.\" Since the state opted out of expanding Medicaid, many of its lowest-income residents who would have been covered by the program do not qualify for tax subsidies that would help them afford private insurance on the exchange. In Alabama, 185,000 people fall into the Medicaid gap.\n\n\"About half of them are working,\" Hoffman said.\n\nThe Adcocks could fall into that gap starting next year, with the decrease in income resulting from Hank's injury.\n\nHe and his wife Sharon will do whatever it takes to keep their income above the level required to qualify for tax credits. They are considering selling a couple cows.\n\n\"It's the best thing that ever happened to us,\" Adcock said. \"We'll do anything to keep it.\"", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Amy Yurkanin | ayurkanin@al.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Hank Adcock, Alabama, news", "title": "Without Obamacare 'I'd have lost the farm,' says Alabama farmer", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Premiums in Birmingham will increase by about 9 percent for silver plans, which could depress enrollment in 2016.", "title": "Without Obamacare 'I'd have lost the farm,' says Alabama farmer", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/10/slow_growth_higher_premiums_ex.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/hank-smallpng-3709bd4153448a3d.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Premiums in Birmingham will increase by about 9 percent for silver plans, which could depress enrollment in 2016.", "title": "Without Obamacare 'I'd have lost the farm,' says Alabama farmer", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_impact/photo/hank-smallpng-3709bd4153448a3d.png", "creator": "@AmyKingsley4", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, October 29, 2015, 10:00 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/amy.kingsley.5"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, October 29, 2015,  6:56 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Premiums in Birmingham will increase by about 9 percent for silver plans, which could depress enrollment in 2016."}, "article_summary": "Many Alabamians who already have Obamacare coverage will be shopping for new policies this year.\nBut they aren't particularly rich, which is why the Adcocks didn't have health coverage since the late 1980s.\nHe and his wife Sharon will do whatever it takes to keep their income above the level required to qualify for tax credits.\nHank Adcock was wary of Obamacare coverage when he first spoke to Hoffman.\nBut customers eligible for tax credits could end up paying much less."}
