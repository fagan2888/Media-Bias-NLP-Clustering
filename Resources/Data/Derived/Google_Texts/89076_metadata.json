Gen. (Ret.) Jerry Boykin.\n\nA scheduled appearance by retired Lt. Gen. William G. \u201cJerry\u201d Boykin, a noted conspiracy theorist who has called President Obama a \u201cMarxist\u201d and warns incessantly of a \u201cMuslim threat,\u201d this morning at a civic \u201cprayer breakfast\u201d in Washington has stirred controversy.\n\nMuslim-American community leaders in Seattle last week raised concerns about Boykin\u2019s appearance, saying he is an \u201canti-Muslim bigot\u201d with a history of hateful remarks about both Muslims and President Obama.\n\n\u201cWhile Mr. Boykin has the right to hold extremist anti-Muslim views, his un-American bigotry should not receive the endorsement of elected officials who serve citizens of all faiths,\u201d said Arsalan Bukhari, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations for Washington, based in Seattle.\n\nAlongside a history of many other controversial remarks, Boykin has said that \u201cAmericans need to have more babies\u201d to counteract the world\u2019s growing Muslim population; called President Obama a \u201cCommunist dictator\u201d who is using psychological operations on Americans; claimed that the repeal of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d doctrine has led to the \u201cabsolute destruction\u201d of the military; warned that Obama is \u201ccreating a Marxist nation\u201d with an agenda \u201cstraight out of the Communist Manifesto\u201d; and even theorized that Obamacare is part of a conspiracy to create a \u201cBrownshirt army.\u201d\n\nApparently, Clark County Mayor\u2019s and Civic Leaders\u2019 Prayer Breakfast planning committee were unaware of that history and voted to retain Boykin as their keynote speaker for this morning\u2019s event, the Columbian reported. But that came in spite of many dissenting voices.\n\nRoger Button, a spokesman for the local chapter of the YMCA, one of the event\u2019s key sponsors, told the paper that the organization had voted to rescind the invitation, saying when it invitation was first made, most committee members \u201cdidn\u2019t really look into it.\u201d\n\nThe YMCA issued a statement: \u201cThe purpose of the mayor\u2019s prayer breakfast is to pray for, encourage and uplift our civic leaders, first responders and those that serve and protect our community. It is meant to be an uplifting event, one in which we call on the risen Christ to bless our leaders. Originally we had asked our keynote to speak based on his Christian testimony. In recent days statements made by the speaker have come to our attention that detract from the purpose and mission of the prayer breakfast. Therefore the YMCA does not support bringing this speaker to the Clark County Mayors\u2019 & Civic Leaders\u2019 Prayer Breakfast.\u201d\n\nSeveral other public officials also claimed that Boykin\u2019s presence would keep them away from the public event. Vancouver City Council member Jack Burkman said he had already planned to skip this year\u2019s breakfast, a decision underscored by the keynote speaker.\n\n\u201cWow, how did they make that decision?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not new information. Boykin has been getting a lot of negative publicity for quite some time. This is a clear signal to me not to attend this event.\u201d\n\nVancouver City Council member Alishia Topper also posted on Facebook: \u201cI\u2019m in New York this Friday, but if I were home I would not attend this year\u2019s prayer breakfast because of the keynote speaker. I do not support hate and am shocked the event organizers chose such a polarizing guest speaker. Organizers should reconsider their invitation and event sponsors should think about how sponsoring this event will make their business look.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/10/17/boykin%E2%80%99s-speech-civic-breakfast-stirs-controversy-washington-state", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.splcenter.org/sites/default/files/10426930_10152512727559700_2647771730634151427_n.png", "site_name": "Southern Poverty Law Center", "title": "Boykin\u2019s Speech at Civic Breakfast Stirs Controversy in Washington State"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2014/10/17/boykin%E2%80%99s-speech-civic-breakfast-stirs-controversy-washington-state", "title": "Boykin\u2019s Speech at Civic Breakfast Stirs Controversy in Washington State", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "@splcenter", "id": 65698096}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4b97\"", "article_summary": "Vancouver City Council member Jack Burkman said he had already planned to skip this year\u2019s breakfast, a decision underscored by the keynote speaker.\nIn recent days statements made by the speaker have come to our attention that detract from the purpose and mission of the prayer breakfast.\nA scheduled appearance by retired Lt.
