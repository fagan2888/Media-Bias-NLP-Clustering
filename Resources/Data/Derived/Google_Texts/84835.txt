Green Bay - Brett Favre and Mike Holmgren clashed during their early years together.

But you could tell from Holmgren's words Saturday night that he has nothing but love for Favre now.

"People think that we didn't get along very well and that I was probably too hard on him," Holmgren said during his speech at Favre's Packers Hall of Fame induction and number retirement. "At times, I was.

"But the reason I was, I recognized how talented he was and what he could do. I wasn't right about everything, but I was right about that. And I knew it was my job, I was hired to harness that energy and to teach him, team him the offense and help him be a better player."

When Holmgren assessed their time together he began to choke up.

"I've had the privilege to coach some great quarterbacks in my career," he said. "I've been fortunate that way. But I have to tell you he was like the son I never had...."

After a pause, he continued: "I've never forgotten our time together and tonight I'd just like to say congratulations and thank you."

Earlier in the day, Holmgren, during a news conference, said the relationship he has with Favre gets better as they both get older.

"Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of coaching this young man, and then competing against him, and then most recently, we probably talk once a year: ‘Happy birthday, how’s the family?’" Holmgren said. "But it’s special. Every single time, it’s special. Because I believe I know him better now than I did when I was coaching him, and I’m very proud of everything he’s accomplished."
