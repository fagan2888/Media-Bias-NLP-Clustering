Sioux Falls, SD

A local biker was remembered in Sioux Falls Saturday. A 63-year-old man recently died after being injured in a bike and car collision, so cyclists held a bike memorial to honor him.

Bikers held a moment of silence, remembering avid cyclist Dale Kimpton. They said they want to make sure other cyclists don’t suffer his same fate.

John Shelso said he knows how dangerous some roads can be and tries to steer clear of busy streets.

"Then if you’re on a really busy street like 41st street and Minnesota, you're almost asking for trouble because they don't want to slow down for a bicyclist," Shelso said.

Biker Jonathan Larson's wife was hit by a car while cycling. He said road conditions should be better for bikers and drivers.



"I believe we really need to come together as a community, both drivers and bicyclists, to just understand that each of us do belong here," Larson said.

Cyclists started their commute at Dunham Park. Then they made their way up 41st street from Shirley Avenue.

They stopped at the gas station near Empire Mall to take a moment of silence.

The accident happened right on 41st street. Bikers placed a white painted ghost bike in memory of the biker that passed.

Cyclist said there's no reason why they can't safely ride alongside drivers. Falls Area Bicyclists say everyone should be able to share the road safely.

"There are a lot of different types of people that use the road. People driving cars, people riding bicycles, and there is a way for all of us to coexist and share the road, and hopefully this sends a message, that here's the right way to do it,” Chris Parsley, FAB President, said.

Bicyclists said whether you’re riding a bicycle, driving a car, or using your legs, you should be able to do it safely.

FAB officials said bikers should never ride against traffic flow. They should always be riding in the right direction where drivers can see them.
