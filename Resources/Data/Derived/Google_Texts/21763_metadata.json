But starting in 2016, some start-ups that have less than $5 million in gross receipts can apply the credit to the Social Security portion of an employer\u2019s payroll taxes, up to $250,000, said Magda Szabo, a tax partner at Grassi & Company in New York.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother obscure-sounding provision may be even more useful: Section 179 write-offs were made permanent.\n\nWhy is this so important? Because those deductions are related to equipment, and the tax break can apply \u201cto pretty much anything you can touch,\u201d said Barbara Weltman, author of \u201cJ.K. Lasser\u2019s Small Business Taxes 2016: Your Complete Guide to a Better Bottom Line.\u201d That is, with the exception of most real property.\n\nConstruction companies, for example, can\u2019t use this provision to write off a building. But the purchase of a cement mixer may count, Ms. Weltman said. And \u201cif you own a small motel, all the new ironing boards you buy for each room qualify, too,\u201d she added. So do basic computers and software. \u201cEven new desk lamps qualify.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, small-business owners could use the Section 179 provision to write off up to $500,000 toward the purchase of new or used equipment as well as off-the-shelf software.\n\nBut at the beginning of last year, that limit was set to fall to just $25,000. That is, until the PATH Act made the provision permanent and reset the limit at $500,000 for the 2015 tax year. That amount will also be adjusted for inflation.\n\nBefore small-business owners take this deduction, though, they need to be aware of another option: In November, the Internal Revenue Service issued new guidance on the ability of small businesses to simply expense tangible property.\n\nSmall businesses have long had the ability to immediately write off smaller equipment purchases of up to $500 instead of taking depreciation deductions and carrying those assets on their balance sheets.\n\nStarting in the 2016 tax year, the agency will raise the amount small businesses can immediately deduct to $2,500 \u2014 provided those purchases can be substantiated by an invoice. This has the effect of sweeping in larger purchases, including office equipment and computer equipment.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThis just simplifies a lot of lives,\u201d Ms. Weltman said. \u201cThere are a lot of small businesses that don\u2019t care about their balance sheets. They\u2019re not likely to be applying for a commercial loan where someone looks at their balance sheet. They\u2019re more concerned about keeping things simple.\u201d\n\nCrystal Stranger, a tax expert in Hawaii who works with many small businesses, cautioned that entrepreneurs should base their expensing decisions not just on the nature of the equipment in question, but \u201con the business and what is needed at that time.\u201d\n\nShe noted, for example, that a start-up company with little current income might not need to deduct purchases immediately for upfront tax relief. Instead, it might choose to stretch out depreciation, as the I.R.S. allows. \u201cWhen income does eventually come in, you will be able to reduce your tax exposure at that time,\u201d Ms. Stranger said.\n\nShe also cautioned entrepreneurs to be careful when deducting expenses like the cost of a car. \u201cThe majority of entrepreneurs don\u2019t have a vehicle that\u2019s used entirely for business purposes,\u201d Ms. Stranger said.\n\nSection 179 does allow small-business owners to write off purchases of vehicles that are used more than 50 percent for business purposes. But for most passenger cars, the first-year deduction limit is $3,160. It is $3,460 for many lightweight sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. That\u2019s not counting an additional $8,000 in potential bonus depreciation if the vehicle qualifies.\n\nFor many business-use vehicles weighing from 6,000 to 14,000 pounds \u2014 which tend to be S.U.V.s, vans and trucks \u2014 small-business owners can deduct up to $25,000 under Section 179 rules, plus 50 percent in bonus depreciation for new vehicles.\n\nIf they go this route, though, small-business owners must maintain records and receipts of a wide range of expenses including repairs, tires, parking fees, registration fees, insurance, tolls, gas and oil.\n\nThe other option is for small-business owners to use the standard mileage deduction.\n\nWith the price of gasoline falling, though, for the 2016 tax year, the I.R.S. reduced that deduction slightly to 54 cents per mile for business use, down 3.5 cents a mile from last year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn another tax rule category, the absence of inflation is why contribution limits to most retirement savings plans geared to small-business owners and the self-employed will be the same this year as in 2015. With Simple I.R.A.s, employees of small businesses can contribute up to $12,500 in 2016 ($15,500 for workers 50 or older) while employers can generally match up to 3 percent of participant compensation.\n\nThe self-employed or freelancers may choose to go with an individual 401(k) retirement plan. Like an employer-sponsored 401(k), these plans let a worker stash as much as $18,000 a year in 2016, while workers 50 or older can save an additional $6,000. Regardless of which plan a person chooses, it\u2019s particularly important for the self-employed and entrepreneurs to take advantage of tax breaks to save. With highly variable income and no large employer to prompt them to save, \u201cthe self-employed need to make their own retirement planning a priority as early as possible,\u201d said Maria Bruno, a senior investment analyst at the Vanguard Group.\n\nAnother change that\u2019s noteworthy for the 2016 tax year: rising penalties under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSelf-employed people or entrepreneurs who do not have coverage for \u201cessential health benefits\u201d for three consecutive months or longer this year \u2014 and who don\u2019t qualify for an exemption \u2014 will be subject to a stiff fine. In 2016, the penalty rises to 2.5 percent of annual household income (up from 2 percent in 2015), or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family \u2014 up substantially from $975 for a family in the 2015 tax year.\n\nMs. Stranger warned, \u201cThis is now a big risk for entrepreneurs who don\u2019t carry health insurance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160219162611, "twitter": {"description": "Congress saved the vegan marshmallow, gluten-free doughnut tax credit.", "title": "For Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs, Some Welcome Clarity", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/business/yourtaxes/for-small-businesses-and-entrepreneurs-some-welcome-clarity.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004202460"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/21/business/21SMALL/21SMALL-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/business/yourtaxes/for-small-businesses-and-entrepreneurs-some-welcome-clarity.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004202460", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/business/yourtaxes/for-small-businesses-and-entrepreneurs-some-welcome-clarity.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/yourtaxes", "hdl_p": "For Small-Business Owners, Some Welcome Clarity", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 19, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Small Business,Tax Credits  Deductions and Exemptions,Corporate Taxes,Freelancing  Self-Employment and Independent Contracting", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Paul J.
