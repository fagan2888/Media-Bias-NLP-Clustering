In the case, Hobby Lobby, a craft-store chain owned by Southern Baptists, is suing the government to seek religious exemption from the ACA's requirement that it offer insurance plans to employees that cover contraception at no extra cost. On the one hand, Roberts is confronting the ACA for the first time since the conservative firestorm over his decision largely upholding the Act. There\u2019s little doubt that he\u2019ll be tempted to throw conservatives a bone, siding with Hobby Lobby and against the ACA.\n\nOn the other hand, a vote in favor of Hobby Lobby requires the chief justice to do at least three things that threaten major disruptive consequences and present serious downstream risks for the Court as an institution. First, he must conclude that corporations have the same rights to religious freedom as living, breathing humans\u2014something that the Supreme Court has never done. Second, he must unsettle centuries of well-established corporate law practice\u2014a move at loggerheads with the Roberts Court\u2019s (and John Roberts\u2019s own) pro-corporate leanings. And, third, he must extend unprecedented protections to a secular employer, therefore opening the floodgates to new religious freedom challenges to countless other laws. In short, a vote for Hobby Lobby means endorsing a radical departure from well-settled precedent\u2014perhaps nowhere more strikingly than in the realm of religious freedom.\n\nIn the decades leading up to the Supreme Court\u2019s 1990 landmark decision in Employment Division v. Smith, courts heard many free exercise challenges. For the most part, they followed a familiar pattern: A law applied to everyone in a given jurisdiction; someone came to court and claimed a religious objection to that law; and the court ultimately rejected that challenger\u2019s claim. This was true in the Supreme Court and, as explained by Professor James Ryan, it was also true in the lower courts. The bottom line\u2014whether you were an Amish employer refusing to pay Social Security taxes or an army doctor wishing to wear a yarmulke while on duty, you were probably going to lose your free exercise claim.\n\nThen along came Smith\u2014a free exercise decision that hit the legal and political world like a thunderbolt. The case involved Native Americans dismissed from their jobs for failing a drug test. (They had smoked peyote during a religious ceremony.) Because of this drug use\u2014religiously motivated or not\u2014Oregon then denied them unemployment benefits. When they challenged this action on free exercise grounds, the Court rejected their claim. However, rather than simply applying the Court\u2019s traditional balancing test (where the Court weighed a given law\u2019s burden on religion against the governmental interest advanced by the law), Justice Scalia struck a radical pose, shelving it for a bright-line rule that was even less protective of religious objectors\u2014and hence the controversy.\n\nOf course, under the pre-Smith test, religious objectors were already losing these cases. Following Smith, they were only slightly more likely to do so. Nevertheless, Congress responded to Scalia\u2019s decision by enacting a new law explicitly overturning Smith and restoring the pre-Smith status quo, but all that really did was reestablish an environment where free exercise claims rarely succeeded.\n\nGiven this legal backdrop, the key question for Roberts leading up to the Hobby Lobby argument is whether he\u2019ll stick with this traditional approach or adopt a new, more stringent test\u2014one even stricter than anything that existed in the pre-Smith world. If the chief justice takes the more radical path\u2014and, more importantly, if he convinces at least four of his colleagues to go along with him\u2014Hobby Lobby could, indeed, live up to the hype and become a truly revolutionary case.\n\nFor instance, such a ruling would entangle lower courts and the Roberts Court itself in knotty free exercise challenges (and a lot of them)\u2014challenges that would potentially require judges to define what counts as \u201creligious belief,\u201d assess the sincerity of those beliefs that pass muster, and apply the traditional balancing test with serious bite. Courts have balked at going down this path in the past\u2014and for good reason. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has never granted a religious accommodation to a secular business that comes at the expense of its employees\u2014an unprecedented move that would allow secular employers to effectively impose their own religious views on the employees, even in the face of contrary laws.\n\nIn the end, however tempted Chief Justice Roberts may be to strike a blow to Obamacare in this highly publicized, blockbuster case\u2014and however much his conservative colleagues may be pulling him in that direction\u2014Roberts can\u2019t give in to these pressures without tarnishing his carefully cultivated image as a cautious jurist and, in the process, unleashing a wave of unpredictable (and risky) consequences.\n\nTom Donnelly is counsel at Constitutional Accountability Center.
