Bringhurst, 47 years old, this week was sentenced to five years of probation\u2014including 60 days of intermittent imprisonment\u2014according to federal prosecutors. Last year, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud.\n\nMr. Bringhurst joins former DBSI President Douglas L. Swenson and three other former officials in receiving sentences for their roles in the fraud that brought DBSI several years ago.\n\nProsecutors say Mr. Swenson and others publicly held the unprofitable DBSI out as profitable to try to lure investors, essentially operating the company like a Ponzi scheme by relying on funds from new investors to pay old investors. DBSI entered bankruptcy proceedings in November 2008.\n\nIn August, Mr. Swenson was sentenced to 20 years in prison after being convicted of 44 counts of securities fraud and 34 counts of wire fraud. Mark Ellison, DBSI\u2019s former general counsel, received a five-year sentence. Mr. Swenson\u2019s sons\u2014David Swenson and Jeremy Swenson, both assistant secretaries\u2014received three-year sentences. Mr. Ellison and the Swenson brothers were also convicted of 44 counts of securities fraud, but all four men have appealed their convictions.\n\nA federal jury reached its verdict on Mr. Swenson and his colleagues after a 42-day trial that began in February. The trial was marked by tragedy when a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent testifying in the case was found of dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The agent\u2019s death took the shine off prosecutors\u2019 victory, prompting U.S. Attorney Wendy J. Olson to call the \u201chuman price of this case\u2026too high.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jacqueline Palank at jacqueline.palank@wsj.com.
