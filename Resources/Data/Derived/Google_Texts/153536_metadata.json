She described how she assisted a lady named Mrs. Smith, who couldn't afford her preventative medicines.\n\n\"The very first thing Obamacare did was allow people to have their insurance. If it was preventative services, we're required to cover the co-pay. So if nothing else, it's worked, for Mrs. Smith, in getting her preventative medicine.\"\n\nBenjamin was invited to speak to the general public and UWA students and participants in the Project Engage STEM initiative, a program funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education to help recruit and retain minority students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.\n\nBenjamin served as the 18th U.S. Surgeon General under President Obama. At the time, she led the nation's 6,700 uniformed public health officers who serve in locations around the world to promote and protect Americans' health.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Former U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Regina Benjamin, visited the campus of the University of West Alabama Tuesday.", "language": "english", "author": "Deana Day", "og": {"description": "Former U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Regina Benjamin, visited the campus of the University of West Alabama Tuesday.", "title": "Former Surgeon General Visits UWA", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Former-Surgeon-General-Visits-UWA-280711642.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0FB/CFF/0FBCFF7F31074C76BA90A5E3CF3D5EF0", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/83A/29D/83A29DED49D444238658A61890FC72A1.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Former U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Regina Benjamin, visited the campus of the University of West Alabama Tuesday.", "title": "Former Surgeon General Visits UWA", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Former-Surgeon-General-Visits-UWA-280711642.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/dr.+regina+benjamin+uwa.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Former Surgeon General Visits UWA", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Former Surgeon General Visits UWA"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7160\"", "article_summary": "Surgeon General under President Obama.\nSurgeon General, Dr. Regina Benjamin, visited the campus of the University of West Alabama Tuesday.\nDr. Regina Benjamin speaks to students at the University of West Alabama Oct. 28, 2014.\nShe described how she assisted a lady named Mrs. Smith, who couldn't afford her preventative medicines.\nBenjamin, a native of Fairhope, Ala., served in the office from July 2009 to July 2013."}
