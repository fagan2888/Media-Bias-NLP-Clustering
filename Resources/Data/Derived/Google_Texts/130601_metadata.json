The announcement is set to take place at the Detroit Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts, but the campaign says they are hardly finished hammering out some pretty important details.\n\nAside from the decision that the event will be ticketed, the rest of the details, including how many tickets will be distributed to supporters or the substance of the actual announcement itself, spokeswoman Deana Bass says are all still up in the air.\n\n\u201cHe will make an announcement,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s still very much in the exploratory phase, so he hasn\u2019t made a decision yet.\u201d\n\nCarson, a political newcomer who rose to prominence after giving a speech criticizing the ObamaCare in front of the president at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013, would be the first African-American candidate to jump into the growing Republican field.\n\nThe 2016 presidential race on the Republican side kicked off with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in late March, followed by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul a few weeks later. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio announced his presidential candidacy at the Miami Freedom Tower Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, Hillary Clinton became the first Democrat to announce her presidential campaign on Sunday via social media, and is now in Iowa attempting to convince voters she \u201cwants to be that champion\u201d this time around. The earlier-than-anticipated announcement comes after several polls show the email controversy hurt the former secretary of state, and now voters in key battleground states no longer view her as honest and trustworthy.\n\nThe retired neurosurgeon has been traveling the nation over the past six months, giving paid speeches and meeting with supporters to gauge interest in a bid. He recently traveled to Iowa and New Hampshire, and spoke last weekend at the National Rifle Association\u2019s meeting in Tennessee, where he attempted to clear up past comments suggesting the Second Amendment does not apply to Americans who live in cities.\n\nCarson\u2019s nonexistent political inexperience has led to several gaffes already, however, he\u2019ll look to turn it into an asset. He has repeatedly argued political newcomers such as himself are a common-sense solution to the problems created by life-long Washington politicians.\n\nAccording to the PPD average of polls, Carson polls at a surprisingly strong 8.2 percent in nationwide Republican primary surveys. That\u2019s just behind Paul (8.6 percent), Cruz (8.6 percent) and Rubio (6.2 percent). But PPD\u2019s senior political analyst says the polls mean nothing at this point in the cycle.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too early to draw any conclusions about firm support,\u201d PPD\u2019s Richard D. Baris says. \u201cThese numbers will go up and down. Some are even likely to stay sideways and go nowhere. Name recognition and news cycle headlines won\u2019t win the nomination in the end.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ben Carson 2016, Carson 2016, Ben Carson announcement, Ben Carson president", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson will make a presidential announcement on May 4 in Detroit, Michigan according campaign officials who allegedly spoke to CNN Monday.", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson Sets Presidential Announcement For May 4 In Detroit", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ben-Carson-speech.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-26T11:13:58-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2015/04/14/dr-ben-carson-sets-presidential-announcement-for-may-4-in-detroit/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Ben Carson will make a presidential announcement on May 4 in Detroit, Michigan according campaign officials who allegedly spoke to CNN Monday.", "creator": "@PPDNews", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Ben-Carson-speech.jpg", "title": "Dr. Ben Carson Sets Presidential Announcement For May 4 In Detroit | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2015/04/14/dr-ben-carson-sets-presidential-announcement-for-may-4-in-detroit/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/24262", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/24262", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "headlines", "published_time": "2015-04-14T19:01:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T11:13:58-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "Dr. Ben Carson will make a presidential announcement on May 4 in Detroit, Michigan according campaign officials who allegedly spoke to CNN Monday."}, "article_summary": "Dr. Ben Carson will make a presidential announcement on May 4 in Detroit, Michigan according campaign officials who allegedly spoke to CNN Monday.\nAccording to the PPD average of polls, Carson polls at a surprisingly strong 8.2 percent in nationwide Republican primary surveys.\nThe 2016 presidential race on the Republican side kicked off with Texas Sen.
