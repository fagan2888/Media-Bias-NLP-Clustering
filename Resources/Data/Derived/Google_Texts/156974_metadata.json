Like every other pollster since then, he believed he could not only accurately predict the outcome of elections with his new statistical-survey tool, within a margin of sampling error; but he could also measure public opinion on social, economic and political issues with the same precision. It was just a matter of applying the same methodology, plus careful attention to how the questions were asked.\n\nBy asking questions that are vaguely worded about topics that the average citizen poorly understands, pollsters create subjective reality.\n\nWith some notable exceptions, polls taken just prior to presidential elections have proved to be quite accurate. Fortunately, we can validate the accuracy of those predictions on Election Day.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the case when pollsters ask survey respondents about policy issues such as how President Obama or the Congress is dealing with \u201cthe economy\u201d and \u201cthe federal budget deficit\u201d or \u201cforeign affairs.\u201d Here pollsters often create an illusion of public opinion by asking respondents questions that are vaguely worded about topics on which the average citizen is poorly informed. Even worse, respondents are often asked to answer questions they\u2019re psychologically incapable of answering, such as the \u201creasons\u201d why they prefer a given candidate or why they favor this or that policy. Cognitive neuroscientists tell us that we simply do not have introspective access to the unconscious processes that drive our opinions and preferences. We\u2019re clueless.\n\nTake, for example, the Gallup question on presidential approval. \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as president?\u201d What does \u201chandling his job as president\u201d mean to respondents? The same goes for the \u201cAffordable Care Act.\u201d Do many respondents know much about it other than that it\u2019s \u201cObamacare\u201d and that they\u2019re for or against him? Do the meanings of questions vary across respondents and over time? If so, it violates a cardinal assumption of survey practice: that a survey question should mean the same thing to all respondents. Otherwise we\u2019re comparing apples with oranges.\n\nIf we ask respondents \u201cwhy\u201d they approve or disapprove of how President Obama is handling this or that problem, they really don\u2019t know why. All they can do is come up with plausible justifications or \u201creasons\u201d for their opinions after-the-fact. Willing respondents will answer our questions if you ask them, however vague those questions might be and however uninformed they might be \u2014 unless you give them a chance to admit they don\u2019t know much about the issue. If you build the questions, they will answer them. And that\u2019s how pollsters -- unwittingly perhaps -- manufacture the \u201cwill of the people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Opinion on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/roomfordebate.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"thumbnail_75": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/11/26/opinion/rfdpolls/rfdpolls-thumbStandard.jpg", "twitter": {"image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/11/26/opinion/rfdpolls/rfdpolls-articleInline.jpg"}, "communityAssetTaxonomy": "opinion/roomfordebate/does-polling-undermine-democracy", "applicationName": "shell", "PT": "blogs", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/11/26/opinion/rfdpolls/rfdpolls-articleInline.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "thumbnail_75_width": 75, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/11/26/opinion/rfdpolls/rfdpolls-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "By asking questions that are vaguely worded about topics that the average citizen poorly understands, pollsters create subjective reality.
