REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS ELECTIONS USA PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION) - RTR39KQX\n\n3986739\n\nA Republican state senator in Virginia who has run a health-care company tells The Daily Caller he is mulling the possibility of running for the Senate in 2014.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Jeffrey McWaters, the founder and former CEO of health-care company AMERIGROUP, said he has been encouraged to take a look at entering the race to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Warner.\n\nReached by phone Monday, McWaters said, \u201cI\u2019ve taken a look at it like most politicians do from time to time. I would like to see a strong Republican run. Mark is very popular, though. He\u2019s a very likable guy. But some of the policies he\u2019s supported haven\u2019t been.\u201d\n\nMcWaters has been urged to run by John Fredericks, a syndicated morning radio talk show host in Virginia. \u201cWho better to take on Warner on the issue of Obamacare than McWaters \u2013 an entrepreneur who built one of the most successful health care companies in America?\u201d Fredericks wrote on his website.\n\n\u201cAs tough as it will be to unseat a very powerful Mark Warner, his primary vulnerability is the fact that he cast the tie-breaking vote that foisted Obamacare on Virginians and the nation,\u201d Fredericks added.\n\nThe 2014 Senate race will be an uphill battle for Republicans. A Public Policy Polling poll this summer of hypothetical match ups indicated that Warner holds double-digit leads over numerous possible GOP opponents.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s health-care law is expected to play a starring role in the 2014 elections, though McWaters said that\u2019s not the only reason he would run. \u201cWhile I think that the president\u2019s health care plan is an exceeding disaster, I think there are a lot of other issues that the Senate has not dealt with effectively.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "GOP looking for someone to challenge popular Democrat", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A Republican state senator in Virginia who has run a health-care company tells The Daily Caller he is mulling the possibility of running for the Senate in 2014.
