Could I get a morning appointment? Was I one of the \u201cimportant people\u201d?\n\nAfter an awkward 15-minute conversation with the office manager, it turned out I was\u2014though only after she realized the story I was writing might not reflect well upon the practice. It also helped that I am not enrolled in Medicaid, because Spring Valley, the upper northwest D.C. suburb where Foxhall resides, does not, I was told, have the \u201cdemographics for it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nJohn Foust has made his wife the face of his campaign for Virginia\u2019s 10th District. Dr. Marilyn Jerome is an OBGYN, who practices alongside Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s wife at Foxhall.\n\nDr. Jerome claims that her husband is a better candidate because he will never get between a woman and her doctor. \u201cAs an OBGYN,\u201d Foust attacks his Republican opponent Barbara Comstock for opposing Medicaid expansion. Failure to expand Medicaid to rural hospitals could be \u201cdevastating,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Jerome has also written in support of the Affordable Care Act on the Foxhall website, citing the Medicaid expansion as beneficial to low-income women.\n\n\u201cFor over 30 years, John\u2019s wife, Dr. Marilyn Jerome has practiced obstetrics and gynecology with Foxhall Ob-Gyn, a practice dedicated to providing compassionate reproductive healthcare for women in NW Washington, D.C., and the surrounding communities,\u201d Foust\u2019s campaign website reads.\n\nIt turns out, however, that not all women can receive \u201ccompassionate reproductive healthcare\u201d from Foxhall. The practice doesn\u2019t accept Medicaid.\n\nThat fact seemed noteworthy. I wrote a story for the Washington Free Beacon highlighting how, in public, Dr. Jerome is preaching the Affordable Care Act and praising the Medicaid expansion while, in her practice, she doesn\u2019t accept it.\n\nThe next day, a former patient of Eric Holder\u2019s wife, Dr. Sharon Malone, reached out to me with another interesting detail about Foxhall. The woman claimed she was a patient for 15 years, and always wondered why she could never get a morning appointment. It seemed worth an interview.\n\n\u201cFinally, in one of the last years I said, \u2018Why? Why can I never get a morning appointment? You say they\u2019re all taken,\u2019\u201d the woman said, relaying a conversation she\u2019d had with a receptionist at Foxhall several years ago. \u201cWhen do I need to call to get one?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018Those are reserved for important people.\u2019\u201d\n\nIs Foxhall an \u201celitist\u201d practice, as the woman claimed? I decided to call myself to make an early morning appointment.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your doctor?\u201d the receptionist asked me when I called last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been, I\u2019m a new patient,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cOh, new patients can\u2019t get in before 10 A.M.,\u201d the woman said. Besides, they didn\u2019t have any openings until late August or September.\n\n***\n\nOn Monday, I called Foxhall back with some follow up questions, this time identifying myself as a reporter. I spoke with the office manager and asked about the former patient\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not accurate,\u201d the office manager said. \u201cNo one here would ever say that, so that\u2019s not true. Where are you getting that from?\u201d\n\nThe office manager said it sounded like a \u201cdisgruntled patient.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just that \u201cthose appointments tend to fill up first,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have special appointments for special people,\u201d she added.\n\nI told her I had tried to make an appointment for myself and couldn\u2019t get one before 10 a.m.\n\n\u201cWell, we don\u2019t typically start the day that early for a new patient,\u201d she said.\n\nI moved on to a different topic.\n\n\u201cI know that you do not accept Medicaid, and Dr. Jerome had written a post on your website in support of the Affordable Care Act and part of it mentions how the Medicaid expansion will benefit low-income people,\u201d I said. \u201cI was just wondering why the practice itself\u2014your practice does not accept Medicaid?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of getting the feeling that the information you\u2019re getting has nothing to do with our practice but that it\u2019s more that you have a political agenda,\u201d the office manager said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on our website, we don\u2019t have a blog. We don\u2019t take political positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that\u2019s not on the website?\u201d I asked, referring to Dr. Jerome\u2019s \u201cmedical news\u201d release on Obamacare. \u201cIt\u2019s not associated with Foxhall at all?\u201d\n\nI guided the office manager to the link on their website, noting that Dr. Jerome\u2019s picture appears below the post.\n\n\u201cAll in all, the ACA is good for women,\u201d Jerome wrote, noting that millions of low-income women \u201ccould benefit from Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\n\u201cWell, I just did a basic search, and I have an appointment for you tomorrow at 8:45 a.m.,\u201d the office manager informed me. \u201cFor a new patient. They are available.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe office manager said Drs. Jerome and Malone are both \u201cprimarily fee-for-service\u201d OBGYNs.\n\n\u201cYou could probably paint that fact in a negative way, too, if you wanted,\u201d she said.\n\nJerome only accepts the Johns Hopkins health insurance plan, while Malone takes United. Both have positive reviews on Vitals.com, a medical review site, even though many patients are forced to pay without insurance.\n\n\u201cDr. Jerome is my favorite doctor, even though she does not take insurance,\u201d said one patient in 2012. \u201cThat\u2019s saying a lot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been seeing Dr. Malone for several years. Even though the practice doesn\u2019t accept my insurance, her knowledge of my healthcare and wellbeing is what keeps me going back,\u201d said a patient of Holder\u2019s wife in 2010. \u201cFor the type of service and bedside manner I receive everytime I make an appointment, I don\u2019t mind paying out of pocket for the services offered.\u201d\n\nHer former patient, whom I spoke with, said she was forced to switch doctors after Malone stopped taking the woman\u2019s Blue Cross Blue Shield federal insurance plan. When she ran into Dr. Malone in the hallway, Malone tried to convince her to switch back.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not that expensive out-of-pocket, you might want to check to see what the benefits are,\u2019\u201d Dr. Malone said, according to the woman.\n\nThe woman said she \u201cjust didn\u2019t have the money\u201d and switched to another doctor at Foxhall, whose \u201ccondescending\u201d and \u201celitist\u201d attitude ultimately caused her to leave the practice entirely.\n\n***\n\n\u201cIt is not about politics or power, it is about affecting [sic] change, making our lives and our community a better place,\u201d Jerome said in support of her husband\u2019s campaign.\n\nHowever, in her own practice Medicaid is not accepted because the community in Spring Valley doesn\u2019t \u201chave the demographics for it.\u201d\n\nDespite informing her of my name and news organization, the office manager seemed surprised when I asked if she wanted to give me her last name for attribution.\n\n\u201cI feel like you\u2019re being disingenuous,\u201d she said.\n\nI asked her again if she wanted to comment on why Foxhall does not accept Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not a plan that we participate in,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think in this area we have the demographics for it.\u201d\n\nThe office manager added that \u201cthere are several reasons,\u201d and that I should check whether Sibley Memorial, the hospital where Foxhall is located, takes Medicaid, speculating that the hospital might not accept it.\n\nA search of gynecologists on the D.C. Medicaid database returned two physicians who participate in Medicaid at Sibley.\n\nThe conversation nearing its end, the office manager declined to give me her name, but made sure to take down mine.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name? And who do you work for? The Beacon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one of the \u2018important people,\u2019\u201d Dr. Malone\u2019s former patient had told me. \u201cI\u2019ve never been one of the \u2018important people.\u2019\u201d\n\nIf only she worked for the Washington Free Beacon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FEATURE: What happens when a reporter tries to make an appointment at the OBGYN office of Eric Holder\u2019s wife", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "I was told the OBGYN practice where the wives of two prominent Democrats are partners reserves its morning appointments for \u201cimportant people.\u201d It was an intriguing claim, especially given the fac", "title": "One of the \u2018Important People\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/one-of-the-important-people/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Jerome-Malone-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I was told the OBGYN practice where the wives of two prominent Democrats are partners reserves its m", "title": "One of the \u2018Important People\u2019", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Jerome-Malone-150x150.png", "creator": "@LizWFB", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd895b\"", "article_summary": "The Beacon?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not one of the \u2018important people,\u2019\u201d Dr. Malone\u2019s former patient had told me.\n\u201cWhen do I need to call to get one?\u2019\u201d\u201cShe said, \u2018Those are reserved for important people.\u2019\u201dIs Foxhall an \u201celitist\u201d practice, as the woman claimed?\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been one of the \u2018important people.\u2019\u201dIf only she worked for the Washington Free Beacon.\nDr. Jerome claims that her husband is a better candidate because he will never get between a woman and her doctor.\nThe conversation nearing its end, the office manager declined to give me her name, but made sure to take down mine."}
