On August 18, she would announce the date of her new album release, just as she did in the summers of 2012 (Red) and 2010 (Speak Now). The album would come out sometime in October, as it always does. And there\u2019d probably be a new song before then.\n\nIndeed, all of that has now come to pass. On Monday, Swift announced in a Yahoo livestream that she has a new single (\u201cShake it Off\u201d), complete with music video, and her new album, called 1989, will come out on October 27.\n\n\u201cShake It Off\u201d is about haters, what they will do (\u201chate hate hate hate hate\u201d) and what you should do in response to them (\u201cshake shake shake shake shake\u2026 shake it off\u201d). It has some good grumpy trombones in the background. It has a horrible break in which Swift\u2026 talks? I can\u2019t in good conscience say \u201craps.\u201d The video is a montage of Swift dancing poorly in different styles, from ballet to twerking, in front of some background dancers who are dancing well in those different styles. It is fine. I have already listened to it 15 times.\n\nSwift's look tends to change with every album she makes. She purposefully arranges her whole aesthetic to reflect her latest album. Her fans don't mind. It's a helpful visual cue.\n\n\u201cI like to make a new album every two years,\u201d Swift explains during the livestream to her fans who have not already figured out her pattern, noting that two years is enough time to change your hairstyle, where you live, everything about your life. Two years has also probably exactly how long the people can go without a new T-Swift album, just enough time to leave them aquiver with anticipation, but not so long as to incite a rebellion.\n\nTwo years is also the perfect amount of time for a reinvention. She calls her new album a \u201crebirth,\u201d which is why it\u2019s called 1989, after the year of her first birth. During the Q&A portion of the livestream, the first question she takes (from Instagram, of course) is from a fan who notices that her look tends to change with every album she makes (The Speak Now era was spiral curls and floral dresses, Red was all hot pants and bangs.) Swift does not deny this. She can divide her life into perfectly demarcated two-year increments in which she purposefully arranges her whole aesthetic to reflect whatever image best encompasses her latest album. Her fans don\u2019t mind. It\u2019s a helpful visual cue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Her new single and livestream showcase her honest-yet-savvy image.", "author": "Julie Beck", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Her new single and livestream showcase her honest-yet-savvy image.", "title": "Taylor Swift's Predictably Perfect Reinvention", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/08/RTR4227V/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/08/the-business-of-being-taylor/378733/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8664\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShake It Off\u201d is about haters, what they will do (\u201chate hate hate hate hate\u201d) and what you should do in response to them (\u201cshake shake shake shake shake\u2026 shake it off\u201d).\nEver since Taylor Swift posted an Instagram video two weeks ago of herself repeatedly pushing the \u201c18\u201d button on an elevator, savvy fans knew exactly how this was going to play out.\nThe album would come out sometime in October, as it always does.\nOn Monday, Swift announced in a Yahoo livestream that she has a new single (\u201cShake it Off\u201d), complete with music video, and her new album, called 1989, will come out on October 27.\nIt has a horrible break in which Swift\u2026 talks?"}
