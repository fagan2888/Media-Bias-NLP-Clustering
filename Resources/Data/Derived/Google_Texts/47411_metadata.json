Scott Walker blamed President Barack Obama on Sunday for the recent spate of attacks on police.\n\nAppearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d the Republican presidential contender said the president's \u201cabsence of leadership\u201d is creating an environment where people attack law enforcement officers just because of their uniforms.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI think his absence of leadership, as speaking out as a leader on this issue,\u201d has contributed to the murder of police officers, Walker said. \u201cWhen people are going after the men and women in uniform \u2026 it is the duty of the president to stand up and say something about that.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Walker wrote an op-ed for the conservative website Hot Air that said anti-police rhetoric has worsened under Obama. If he's elected president, Walker said he'd unite Americans.\n\n\u201cIn the last six years under President Obama, we\u2019ve seen a rise in anti-police rhetoric. Instead of hope and change, we\u2019ve seen racial tensions worsen and a tendency to use law enforcement as a scapegoat,\u201d Walker wrote. \u201cThis inflammatory and disgusting rhetoric has real consequences for the safety of officers who put their lives on the line for us and hampers their ability to serve the communities that need their help.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a president who first and foremost says that law enforcement professionals across this country are doing the job,\u201d Walker said. \u201cHe has been silent on this and that\u2019s an outrage.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, CNN host Jake Tapper pointed out that Obama has in fact praised law enforcement, but Walker said Obama avoids speaking out against hateful rhetoric.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Gov.
