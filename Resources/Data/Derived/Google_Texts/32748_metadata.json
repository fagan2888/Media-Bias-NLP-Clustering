We don't want people to be taken care of? It's crazy.\u201d\n\nNavratilova, now a retired tennis player and coach and one of the best tennis players of all time, next to Billie Jean King was born in Czechoslovakia, a former U.S.S.R. communist satellite nation, defected when she was eighteen to the United States on political asylum reasons.\n\nNavratilova comments are in stark contrast on how communist health care worked in communist nations and then considering that, she fled her communist nation.\n\nRichard Pipes, a Polish-American academic who specializes in Russian history, especially the former Soviet Union wrote in his book, \u201cCommunism: A History\u201d on the effects of healthcare in communist Cuba, \u201cIn the pre-Castro years of the 1950s, the Cuban population as a whole had access to good medical care through association clinics. The clinics, predated the American concept of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) by decades, as well as through private clinics.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that time, the Cuban medical system ranked among the best in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut today, under the communist regime, with its system of socialized medicine that Castro first instituted decades ago, hospitals for ordinary Cubans possess a dearth of even the most basic medicines and medical equipment. They have virtually no access to antibiotics, insulin, heart drugs, sphygmomanometers to measure blood pressure, sterile gloves, clean water, syringes, soap, or disinfectants,\u201d said Pipes.\n\nIn 2009, Human Events ran a story about Katrina Alexis Belova, a young American medical student from Ukraine, who was distraught that anyone would embrace Obamacare and compared the old Soviet medicine and President Obama\u2019s health care policies as being equal.\n\nBelova told Human Events that her mother, who was a physician, were forced to practice medicine without allowance for conscience, under communist rule in Ukraine.\n\nKatrina said, \u201cAbortion was never an issue in the Soviet Union, simply because the communist government dictated that it was not an ethical dilemma, and all physicians were required to perform the procedure. Those who disobeyed could not obtain their medical license or continue their practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI became very concerned when I learned about President Obama\u2019s plan to rescind the conscience clause,\u201d Katrina continued. \u201cIt made me uneasy to think that my adopted country, which was always proud of its democratic heritage, had begun to remind me of a communist country my family fled ten years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere will I flee next?\u201d\n\nWhile no one on Navratilova\u2019s twitter account has opposed her \u201chealthcare was good in communist countries\u201d comment, there were plenty of anti-Tea Party and radical remarks about conservatives from her followers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While most oppose Obamacare in recent polls, former tennis player Martina Navratilova told CNN that at least communism gave health care to its people and praise", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/martina-navratilova-at-least-communism-gave-people-health-care", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/52/64/5264c9bd4036ae4e8b065d977952ab19.jpg?itok=WWMXEP_1", "type": "article", "title": "Martina Navratilova: \u2018At least communism gave people health care\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "While most oppose Obamacare in recent polls, former tennis player Martina Navratilova told CNN that at least communism gave health care to its people and praised it as a good thing CNSNews reported on", "creator": "@PCGOPExaminer", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/52/64/5264c9bd4036ae4e8b065d977952ab19.jpg?itok=WWMXEP_1", "title": "Martina Navratilova: \u2018At least communism gave people health care\u2019", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2013-10-08T17:24:05-06:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Government Topics, Obamacare, Communism, Martina Navratilova, Health Care, Government", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-08T17:24"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbbfd\"", "article_summary": "Navratilova comments are in stark contrast on how communist health care worked in communist nations and then considering that, she fled her communist nation.\nWhile most oppose Obamacare in recent polls, former tennis player Martina Navratilova told CNN that at least communism gave health care to its people and praised it as a good thing CNSNews reported on Monday.\nNavratilova told CNN that she was not happy with those who do not want Obamacare and said, \u201cBecause we don't want for people to be healthy?\nIn 2009, Human Events ran a story about Katrina Alexis Belova, a young American medical student from Ukraine, who was distraught that anyone would embrace Obamacare and compared the old Soviet medicine and President Obama\u2019s health care policies as being equal.\nWe don't want people to be taken care of?"}
