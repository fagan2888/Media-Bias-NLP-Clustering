An 87-year-old man who suffers from advanced Alzheimer’s disease, arrested for beating his 76-year-old roommate to death at their assisted living facility, was found incompetent Thursday.

The Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo conducted the evaluation of Homer Castor.

After a hearing to review the competency evaluation, the office of the Jefferson County district attorney said no criminal charges would be filed. It is expected that Castor would be housed at the Pueblo facility for the remainder of his life.

Castor beat Gerald Propp to death in February at the Atria Applewood assisted-living facility in Lakewood.

Three weeks before the fatal beating, Propp’s wife heard Castor say, “He makes me so mad I want to punch him out.” However, at the time of the attack, officials characterized the beating as one that appeared to be of confused and misguided rage.

The competency evaluation was ordered after Castor’s arrest on suspicion of homicide and crimes against an at-risk adult but before charges were filed.
