The 90-year-old monarch is said to have told aides the helicopters were \u2018over the top\u2019 and they would be limited to three.\n\nUS Secret Service claimed it needed all twelve so agents could be in close proximity to the President when he came to the castle on Friday. The service also demanded to post guards inside the private dinner with the Queen and Obama, presumably to prevent the pensioner attacking the President.\n\nCommenting on the three helicopter limit an insider told the Daily Star newspaper: \u201cVarious US aides said that wouldn\u2019t be possible. The President has a small army of Secret Service agents who follow him all over.\n\n\u201cThey said they needed to be within reach of the President at all times. They also wanted guards posted inside the dining hall when he had lunch with the Queen. But Her Majesty refused to back down and said, \u2018three helicopters only\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Secret Service had to go away and think about their plan. The President\u2019s officials were told that the Queen regarded Windsor Castle as her family home and the most important of all royal residences.\n\n\u201cThey were told that the Queen was particularly sensitive to any potential damage to the castle and grounds. Eventually the President\u2019s aides accepted her wishes. She rarely imposes her will but when she does people listen \u2013 it just took the US Secret Service agents a little time to realize that.\u201d\n\nDuring the Obama State Visit of 2011 the heat generated by the helicopters destroyed one of the oldest lawns at the 900 year old castle. The Queen was said to be \u201cnot amused\u201d by having to fix the \"write off\".\n\nThe castle is so important the Queen's grandfather, King George V, changed the name of the dynasty from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor in 1917.\n\nThe Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are spending more of their time in Windsor as they get older. The Duke is the head ranger of Windsor Great Park, a job he is said to take very seriously.\n\nDespite not being allowed to bring in all his helicopters London airspace was closed to private planes during Obama\u2019s visit. Several US F-22 Raptor combat jets were also on standby to neutralize any potential threat.\n\nPresident Obama is now in Germany, where he faced protests about his policies towards the EU. He had already caused outrage in the UK by threatening to cut economic ties with Britain if the country votes to leave the EU in June.\n\nThis is expected to be his final visit to Europe before he leaves office.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Queen banned Obama from landing a dozen helicopters at Windsor Castle because last time he visited six of them ruined the lawn. .05/26/2016 20:32:19PM EST.", "author": "Andre Walker", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Queen banned Obama from landing a dozen helicopters at Windsor Castle because last time he visited six of them ruined the lawn.", "title": "Andre Walker - Queen: Obama\u2019s \u2018Over The Top\u2019 Copters Wrecked My Garden", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/andrewalker/2016/04/24/queen-obamas-over-the-top-copters-wrecked-my-garden-n2153056", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/113/5ffaaac2-ab43-4896-b01d-0de473854f7d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The Queen banned Obama from landing a dozen helicopters at Windsor Castle because last time he visited six of them ruined the lawn.", "title": "Andre Walker - Queen: Obama\u2019s \u2018Over The Top\u2019 Copters Wrecked My Garden", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/andrewalker/2016/04/24/queen-obamas-over-the-top-copters-wrecked-my-garden-n2153056", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/113/5ffaaac2-ab43-4896-b01d-0de473854f7d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Queen: Obama\u2019s \u2018Over The Top\u2019 Copters Wrecked My Garden, Andre Walker, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "President Obama is now in Germany, where he faced protests about his policies towards the EU.\nThe President\u2019s officials were told that the Queen regarded Windsor Castle as her family home and the most important of all royal residences.\nWINDSOR, United Kingdom - The Queen banned Obama from landing a dozen helicopters at Windsor Castle because last time he visited six of them ruined the lawn.\n\u201cThe Secret Service had to go away and think about their plan.\nThe President has a small army of Secret Service agents who follow him all over."}
