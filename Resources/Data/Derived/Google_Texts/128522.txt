BCBSNC CEO calls ACA losses 'unsustainable'

Certain insurers — like UnitedHealth and Humana — are dropping from the Affordable Care Act exchanges due to financial losses, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina's CEO feels no differently, according to the Charlotte Business Journal.

During the Charlotte Chamber's annual Health Care Summit, CEO Brad Wilson said the 3.9 million ACA customers in North Carolina used $1.3 billion in medical claims in 2015. These claims have caused more than $400 million in ACA-related losses over the past two years.

"Those kind of losses are unsustainable," Mr. Wilson said, according to the report. "Something has to change."

Mr. Wilson addressed additional difficulties related to the ACA, including too small of a risk pool and too many special enrollment periods.

BCBSNC is also facing challenges outside the ACA, according to Mr. Wilson, such as the rising cost of prescription drugs and a focus on quantity over quality. "As yourself the question why our healthcare system still receives [payment] for quantity rather than quality," he said, according to the report.
