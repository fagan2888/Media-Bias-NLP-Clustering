Patrick Neville, R-Castle Rock, said his bill would serve as a warning to armed assailants looking to take advantage of gun-free zones.\n\n\u201cPeople are not deterred by some flashy sign on a door,\u201d Neville told The Daily Signal. \u201cIf we have a law like this, it\u2019s going to make [criminals] find a different target instead of our schools, where we have our most vulnerable among us.\u201d\n\nNeville lived through the April 20, 1999, massacre at Columbine High School near Littleton, Colo., in which Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, both seniors, killed 13 and injured 20 before shooting and killing themselves.\n\nNeville, who was outside the school at the time of the shooting, predicted more of his friends and fellow students would be alive today if even one staff member had been armed:\n\nIf you had this back then, I think it might have been a deterrent from the shooting ever occurring in the first place. If a criminal intent on doing harm knows that they might be faced with opposition, they\u2019re going to think twice about it.\n\nNeville\u2019s legislation would eliminate Colorado\u2019s ban on individuals who hold a permit to carry a concealed handgun from taking the firearm on the grounds of elementary, middle, and high schools.\n\nUnder the bill, school employees who wish to arm themselves would have to obtain a concealed carry permit if they do not already hold one. The process to receive a permit in Colorado includes background checks and fingerprinting. Staff also would have to complete a mandatory training class before getting the permit.\n\nNeville said individual school districts would have the discretion to impose stricter requirements or to compel more rigorous training for employees who want to have a gun on school grounds.\n\n\u201cWhat I want to prevent is my daughter from having to go through the same experiences and losing friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really tired of sending them to school in blind faith that they\u2019re going to come home safe.\u201d\n\nNeville\u2019s father is state Sen. Tim Neville, R-Littleton.\n\nNeville and his father co-sponsored a similar bill last year. It didn\u2019t get out of a House committee on veterans and military affairs.\n\nThe newspaper The Hill reported that the new legislation would face a similar fate in the House, which, unlike the state Senate, is held by Democrats.\n\nBut Neville told The Daily Signal he is optimistic the bill will pass because of a shift in committee makeup. He said reaction across the state has been positive and called the plan a \u201ccommonsense\u201d step toward deterring mass shootings on school grounds.\n\n\u201cIf you empower people to protect themselves, you actually make society safer,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"If we have a law like this, it\u2019s going to make find a different target instead of our schools.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"If we have a law like this, it\u2019s going to make find a different target instead of our schools.\"", "title": "Columbine Survivor Pushes Giving Teachers Guns", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160229_ColumbineSurvivor_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-01T17:55:36+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1oTH2fA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"If we have a law like this, it\u2019s going to make find a different target instead of our schools.\"", "title": "Columbine Survivor Pushes Giving Teachers Guns", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160229_ColumbineSurvivor_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "firearms", "published_time": "2016-03-01T08:01:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-01T17:55:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Patrick Neville, Colorado guns, gun rights, gun control, school shooting, Columbine High School, massacre, mass murder, gun-free zone"}, "article_summary": "A Colorado lawmaker who survived the 1999 mass murder at Columbine High School is sponsoring state legislation that would allow teachers to carry firearms on school grounds.\nUnder the bill, school employees who wish to arm themselves would have to obtain a concealed carry permit if they do not already hold one.\nState Rep.
