CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Roughly half a million North Carolinians could soon lose money they depend on for health insurance. The U.S. Supreme Court will rule soon on a key part of the Affordable Care Act. It governs federal subsidies for insurance in states like North Carolina that did not set up their own exchange or marketplace. The result could be disastrous for many low-income Americans and for insurance markets in about three dozen states.

A few years ago, Harlena Harris lost her health insurance after she stopped working to care for her husband, who was battling lung cancer.

“He couldn’t even raise his hands or do anything for himself,” she says. “I had to feed him. I kept him clean. I did everything for him.”

As he got better, her own health deteriorated. The 62-year-old has Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Without insurance, she couldn’t afford her medications.

“When I did get to go to the doctor, I was very, very, very ill,” she said. “My doctor told me that she didn’t know how I was still standing.”

That doctor’s visit was the first thing Harris did after getting insurance on the Obamacare exchange in 2014. Since then, she’s been doing much better with the help of doctor’s visits and medication.

She can afford it because of a federal subsidy that leaves her paying about $20 a month for insurance. Across North Carolina, more than 90 percent of people insured through healthcare.gov receive a subsidy.

But the Supreme Court case King v. Burwell has put those subsidies in jeopardy.

“I think there is a reasonable argument that the statute is ambiguous,” said Neil Siegel, who teaches constitutional law at Duke University in Durham, N.C.

In one section of the Affordable Care Act, it reads that subsides are available through “an exchange established by the state.” But North Carolina and about three dozen other states decided not to establish an exchange. They use the federal healthcare.gov instead.
