Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent, pushed for better coverage for these families who need dental care the most, and are least likely to get it.\n\n\u201cMillions and millions of people live in towns where it is difficult to access dental care,\u201d he said. \u201cLow-income Americans with Medicaid in nearly half the states have no dental benefits, or can receive services only in case of a dental emergency.\u201d\n\nIn parts of the country, low-income Americans rely on dental clinics that come around maybe once per year to provide free dental care to uninsured adults.\n\nDr. Debony Hughes, a public health dentist working in Maryland, recently participated in one such clinic and recalled being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the number of patients seeking treatment.\n\n\u201cFor two days, dental professionals treated hundreds of adults each day,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople slept overnight in hopes to receive care.\n\nMany received quality care but I believe patients should not have to endure those conditions to receive treatment.\u201d\n\nGreg Nycz, executive director of Family Health Center of Marshfield, Inc., in Wisconsin, said there was \u201ctremendous prevention potential\u201d in dentistry.\n\n\u201cWe believe there is also a tremendous potential to improve health and reduce costs,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Nycz has helped build dental centers throughout Wisconsin that are accessible in lower-income neighborhoods. Because the centers are not privately owned, they are able to provide more affordable care.\n\n\u201cOur approach to health care can create offsetting savings by substituting quality dental services for more expensive emergency room treatments,\u201d Mr. Nycz said.\n\nStates like Alaska and Minnesota have enlisted the help of dental therapists to provide affordable care for children and low-income adults that does not need to be provided by dentists.\n\n\u201cWe need an oral health workforce that is less expensive than dentists to deliver routine services,\u201d Dr. Catalanotto said.\n\nMr. Sanders vowed to fight for new funding for dental care and to explore a range of options to make dental care more affordable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to fight for more money for the community health centers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a look at the issue of dental therapists. We\u2019re going to take a look at models that seemed to be high quality and cost-effective. Our job is to dedicate ourselves to make very significant improvements in the dental care system in this country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With much of the capital's attention focused on doctors and Obamacare, a panel of witnesses told a Senate hearing that rising costs and the lack of quality care for lower-income Americans is leading to a national dental crisis as well.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/12/rising-cost-lack-of-care-affecting-dentistry-as-we/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "With much of the capital\u2019s attention focused on doctors and Obamacare, a panel of witnesses told a Senate hearing that rising costs and the lack of quality care for lower-income Americans is leading to a national dental crisis as well.", "title": "Rising cost, lack of care affecting dentistry as well"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "With much of the capital's attention focused on doctors and Obamacare, a panel of witnesses told a Senate hearing that rising costs and the lack of quality care for lower-income Americans is leading t", "card": "summary", "title": "Rising cost, lack of care affecting dentistry as well"}, "Author": "Matthew Lounsberry", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Politics, Social Issues, Bernie Sanders, Frank Catalanotto"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ba1\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Sanders vowed to fight for new funding for dental care and to explore a range of options to make dental care more affordable.\nAmericans spent an estimated $108 billion on dental care in 2011, the latest year for which figures are available.\nOur job is to dedicate ourselves to make very significant improvements in the dental care system in this country.\u201d\n\u201cMillions and millions of people live in towns where it is difficult to access dental care,\u201d he said.\nSubcommittee Chairman Sen.
