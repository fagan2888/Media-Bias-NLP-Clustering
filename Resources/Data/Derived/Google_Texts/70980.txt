The sign-up surge, which is expected to grow in coming days, came as the Obama administration ramped up advertising and visits around the country by health officials urging people to beat Sunday's cutoff for enrollment in individual health plans.



Both President Barack Obama and first lady MIchelle Obama, along with other health officials, have done interviews with local TV news stations this week to push that theme.

Officials also emphasized Thursday that there will be no extension of the sign-up deadline.

"If people plan to get covered, and they want to get coverage this year, now is the time to do it," said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Obamacare. "Now is the time to get coverage."



"As expected, we're continuing to see energy increasing and momentum build as we approach the deadline," Slavitt said.
