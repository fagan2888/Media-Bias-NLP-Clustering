None of the looks could rightly be called unisex - or at least as the term has been used until now, reserved for looks that possess a gender neutrality. These outfits had a decidedly feminine point of view, emphasized even more by the female models who wore versions of the same.\n\nAnd even on the menswear runways less committed to the strategy, there were touches of femininity, with softer fabrics, colors and cuts.\n\nAt the same time there was an emphasis on utilitarian looks, including anoraks, safari coats, trousers and shorts fitted with big pockets and flip flops.\n\nHere are some highlights from the last day of men\u2019s preview shows in Milan for next spring and summer, featuring Armani, Ermanno Scervino, Stella Jean and DSquared2.\n\n___\n\nLIGHTNESS AT ARMANI\n\nThe Armani man knows how to kick back in style - as confident as the stylist himself, who is celebrating 40 years in the fashion business this year with nothing to prove.\n\nHis warm-weather styles for 2016 communicate comfort and lightness, from the elegant, light fabrics to the comfortable, roomy cuts to the easy way of dressing. An off-skew vest is all the shirt an Armani man needs under his jacket.\n\nColors were cool Mediterranean blues, with shades of nude and gray.\n\nThe trouser defined the look. Roomy pleated pants had three lengths: ankle, cropped at mid-calf or pedal pushers, ready to hop on a city bike like one pushed down the runway by a model.\n\nWomen\u2019s looks punctuated the show, including a pair of skirt-like shorts with a camisole top, all in deep blue.\n\nArmani himself seeks to be above the trends. He told reporters backstage after the show that he finds \u201ctoo excessive the provocations that are counterproductive,\u201d expressing doubts that some of the more extreme fashion proposals seen in Milan would find a market.\n\n\u201cYou need provocations and courage - and we were courageous with jackets with flowers in the 1960s - but this kind of excess produces garments mostly to put on exhibit to demonstrate creative liberty,\u201d the designer was quoted by ANSA as saying.\n\n___\n\nROBERT DE NIRO IN THE DARK\n\nArmani kept the showroom dark ahead of its preview show, certainly to show off the Giorgio Armani signature cast on the wall but perhaps also to give cover to actor Robert De Niro in the front row.\n\nStill, photographers spotted him and his wife Grace Highland and swarmed the couple with flashes. After the show, De Niro, dressed in a white shirt and dark jacket with a granite look, posed for photos with the designer.\n\n___\n\nLONG LIVE LIBERTY\n\nErmanno Scervino\u2019s collection offered a more voluminous silhouette than his usual tailored cuts, with oversized jackets and pant hemlines that dragged along the ground. The designer purposely left the edges of the garments slightly frayed for a more relaxed, devil-may-care look.\n\nEven his military looks were less regimented than the type would suggest, with camouflage jackets quilted, not stiff, and worn with a touch of pink lace peeking out of the sleeve. Soft sweaters were in pink, with matching bags carried under the arm.\n\nFor Scervino, feminine touches for men marked a \u201ccourageous\u201d choice, but he reasoned that if women can be bold dressers \u201cI don\u2019t see why men can\u2019t as well.\u201d\n\nThe shoe of choice: a flip flop, covered in crystals for special occasions, complementing crystal-studded pullovers or sequined T-shirts for night. Even ties lacked formality -left unknotted and hung around the neck as if to signal that the work day was over.\n\n\u201cLong live liberty,\u201d Scervino said backstage.\n\nThe Florence-based designer is a friend of Italian Premier Matteo Renzi and created delicate knitwear looks for Renzi\u2019s wife, Agnese Landini, to wear during last week\u2019s visit by U.S. first lady Michelle Obama.\n\n___\n\nDEEP-SURF DSQUARED2\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter on which continent the surf is up, the DSquared2 man is ready to travel the world to grab the next big wave.\n\nHe wears a big anorak over his baggy shorts and neoprene leggings, undeterred by rain. Beaded necklaces swing as he walks energetically to his next destination - where he just may dons a Peruvian-style blanket poncho to fit in with the locals.\n\nDesigning twins Dean and Dan Caten have outfitted him with a big colored nylon trekking pack, oversized hiking shoes with an exaggerated tongue or slip-on beach loungers. He keeps his head warm with an egg-shaped shearling cap that covers his damp curls but exposes his ears.\n\nHe\u2019s well tattooed but with a secret: He gets the bad boy effect with no pain by pulling on body tights printed with intricate ink drawings.\n\n____\n\nSTELLA IN WONDERLAND\n\nItalian-Haitian designer Stella Jean composed a fable for her new collection about a dandy named Ernest who discovers a group of \u201cindustrious hands\u201d weaving patterns into fabric when he falls into hatch at New York\u2019s Chelsea Hotel.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect dream scenario for the designer who blends Western tailoring with colorful patterned fabrics sourced in Burkina Faso.\n\nJean presented a kaleidoscope of patterns for next summer, with elegant striped suits cut from fabric woven in Africa. A white suit with blue stripes was paired with a rainbow-colored T-shirt, which also took a turn with woven shorts.\n\nJean also tapped the Milan Expo 2015 World\u2019s Fair ethos - whose motto is \u201cFeeding the planet, energy for life\u201d - with tops printed with a turnip and pomegranates.\n\nThe whimsy also included matching patterned man rompers of crew-neck T-shirts and slim Bermuda shorts, suggesting more play than work.\n\n\u201cOr maybe they bring play to work?\u201d Jean suggested backstage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is it a provocation or the next big thing?", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Is it a provocation or the next big thing?", "title": "De Niro lights up Armani front row as menswear goes feminine", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/23/de-niro-lights-up-armani-front-row-as-menswear-goe/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/23/de0a798d03c6361c7a0f6a706700f664.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/23/de0a798d03c6361c7a0f6a706700f664.jpg", "description": "Is it a provocation or the next big thing?", "card": "summary", "title": "De Niro lights up Armani front row as menswear goes feminine"}, "Author": "COLLEEN BARRY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "An off-skew vest is all the shirt an Armani man needs under his jacket.\n___LIGHTNESS AT ARMANIThe Armani man knows how to kick back in style - as confident as the stylist himself, who is celebrating 40 years in the fashion business this year with nothing to prove.\nAnd even on the menswear runways less committed to the strategy, there were touches of femininity, with softer fabrics, colors and cuts.\nThese outfits had a decidedly feminine point of view, emphasized even more by the female models who wore versions of the same.\nHere are some highlights from the last day of men\u2019s preview shows in Milan for next spring and summer, featuring Armani, Ermanno Scervino, Stella Jean and DSquared2."}
