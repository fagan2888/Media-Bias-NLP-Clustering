This was the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history by the amount of debt ($18\u201320 billion), and Detroit was the largest city ever to officially go bust.\n\nA few months before the bankruptcy, the state of Michigan appointed an emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, to sort things out in Motor City. Orr was given extraordinary powers to rewrite contracts and liquidate some of the city\u2019s most valuable assets. The burning question: Who would be responsible for the enormous debt? Soon enough it became clear that the folks who would be asked to take the hit were not those who created the problems. Just as in so many other parts of the world in the wake of the 2007-\u201908 financial meltdown, innocent people who did nothing but get up every day and go to work would be asked to pay the bill.\n\nLast week, Orr blasted retirees for resisting his plan to drastically cut their pensions \u2014 26 percent for general retirees and 6 percent for police and fire, and even more, 34 percent and 10 percent, respectively, if they do not agree quickly.\n\nThe fight is on. Other cities and states are paying close attention to what goes down in Detroit. But there\u2019s something much bigger than bankruptcy going on, and it concerns the future of American society. The answer to the question of who we defend and who we punish when the going gets tough is being written into our future.\n\nIf you think of Detroit as far away and unrelated to life in your hometown, think again. The next victim could be your town, your community, your retirement.\n\nWe Are All Detroit\n\nMore than 50 percent of the children in Detroit live in poverty. Property crime is twice the American average, violent crime three times greater. The statistics are shocking, but they only whisper the misery endured by the people who call this city \u2014 once among America\u2019s crown jewels, and believe it or not, known as the \u201cCity of Champions\u201d \u2014 their home.\n\nRobert Johnson, executive director of the Institute of New Economic Thinking, is an economist who has worked closely with the likes of Joseph Stiglitz and has served in Washington as chief economist of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee under William Proxmire.\n\nJohnson, who was my colleague when I served as Media Fellow at the Roosevelt Institute from 2009-2011, is an economist who believes that his work is about more than abstract mathematical models. It\u2019s about human experience \u2014 the vivid hopes and challenges of ordinary people. When I asked Johnson how he came to think that way, a wistful smile crosses his lips: \u201cI grew up in Detroit.\u201d\n\nI sat down with Johnson in his New York City home, where his voice thickened with sorrow as he described the pain of looking on as the thriving city of his boyhood sank into an apocalyptic wasteland of crumbling buildings and bewildered people who mostly played by the rules but saw their lives \u201ccompressed and crushed.\u201d\n\nHe recalled for me the Detroit of the 1960s, a great engine of the American economy and the cradle of many of the country\u2019s most illustrious political figures, like Representative John Dingell (whose district started out in Detroit and gradually moved to the western suburbs through redistricting). It was also a cauldron in which the great currents of America\u2019s deepest conflict swirled: the deadly race riots of 1967, the labor wrangling of the UAW and the Teamsters, the turmoil of the Vietnam War, and the drugs that flooded the city in the wake of deindustrialization.\n\nJohnson reflects upon the work of his friend, john a. powell of Berkeley, a scholar of American culture who explores how we perceive some people and communities as \u201cothers.\u201d Many things can be the basis of otherness, like race, or economic status, or gender. When we decide something is other, we absolve ourselves from having to care about it. Detroit, as Johnson explains, has become America\u2019s urban other. As a city is liquidated for the creditors, the victims are blamed, the people become traumatized, and the trust in American institutions breaks down. Johnson\u2019s work has shown that far from being a necessity, the decision to cut the pensions of teachers and other public workers is a choice \u2014 one that will hurt both them and future generations. As he talks about Detroit, Johnson eshews the antiseptic terms common among economists, pouring out visceral words like \u201cpain,\u201d \u201ccrushing\u201d and \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d to describe what\u2019s at stake for all of us.\n\n\u201cDetroit is the canary in the coal mine of America,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more evident that you can\u2019t count on social institutions, or your fellow citizens, or your money managers, or your healthcare system.\u201d Detroit is not an isolated case, he cautions, but will serve as a precedent for how the country works in the future. When the weak and vulnerable are asked to pay for our sins, we will all pay in the end.\n\nThe Real Pension Story\n\nAt a recent conference on pensions convened by the Roosevelt Institute, Johnson, along with Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, political scientist Thomas Ferguson, economists Lisa Cook, Dean Baker, and others gathered to explore the meaning of America\u2019s so-called pension crisis and its alarming connection to the country\u2019s political underbelly.\n\nTo understand this story, first you have to understand the truth of what is happening with pensions across America. Media accounts, often influenced by the campaigns of well-funded organizations and individuals like billionaire anti-pension activist John Arnold, have too often promoted the false image of a widespread crisis in which overpaid public workers have been promised unaffordable and bloated pensions. That\u2019s far from reality, Johnson\u2019s work shows. In a new paper that will serve as an antidote to a distorted national narrative, he makes several facts clear:\n\n1. Pension underfunding is not widespread. Despite a devastating Wall Street-driven financial crisis which decimated sales, property and state income tax receipts and which led to big cuts in federal aid, many American cities and states have managed to keep their pensions reasonably healthy. In fact, gross underfunding is concentrated in certain states, such as Illinois and Kentucky, and in cities like Chicago. These areas seem to have a few things in common, such as poor governance and unreliable public officials who have mishandled funding. Outright corruption is also common. Detroit\u2019s government would certainly win no prizes for responsible governance, and its pension funds\u2019 accounting practices were less than perfect, but as Johnson reports, as of 2012, the \u201cfunding ratios\u201d (actuarial assets divided actuarial liabilities) of the city\u2019s two big pensions funds stood at 99.9% and 87.1 respectively. That\u2019s hardly the emergency many media accounts portray.\n\n2. State and local employees are not overcompensated. Johnson explains that the widespread perception that public workers are overpaid is highly exaggerated. Citing studies by economist Alicia Munnell and others, his paper shows that at the lower levels, overall rates of pay vary little between workers in the public and private sectors. At the higher levels, public workers actually make less than their public sector counterparts. Cases of overcompensation exist, but they are not the norm and don\u2019t significantly contribute to underfunding problems. Overcompensation clearly did not cause the pension crisis in places like Detroit, where levels of staffing and pay per employee are well under large Midwestern cities like Cleveland and St. Louis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why the next victim of Chapter 9 bankruptcy could be your town, your community and possibly your retirement account", "title": "We are all Detroit: The real story behind the city\u2019s pension fight", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Why the next victim of Chapter 9 bankruptcy could be your town, your community and possibly your retirement account", "title": "We are all Detroit: The real story behind the city\u2019s pension fight", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/09/we_are_all_detroit_the_real_story_behind_the_citys_pension_fight_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/detroit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why the next victim of Chapter 9 bankruptcy could be your town, your community and possibly your retirement account", "title": "We are all Detroit: The real story behind the city\u2019s pension fight", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/07/detroit.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynn Stuart Parramore", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 99 percent, AlterNet, bankruptcy, chapter 9, Detroit, Pension", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 99 percent, AlterNet, bankruptcy, chapter 9, Detroit, Pension, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlterNetWhen the city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy in July 2013, America sucked in a collective gasp.\nAt the higher levels, public workers actually make less than their public sector counterparts.\nAs he talks about Detroit, Johnson eshews the antiseptic terms common among economists, pouring out visceral words like \u201cpain,\u201d \u201ccrushing\u201d and \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d to describe what\u2019s at stake for all of us.\nJohnson explains that the widespread perception that public workers are overpaid is highly exaggerated.\nIf you think of Detroit as far away and unrelated to life in your hometown, think again."}
