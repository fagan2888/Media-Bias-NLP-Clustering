Michael Adams, executive director of SAGE announced that the initiative was dedicated to providing care for LGBT elders within the housing systems, including a pilot housing development in the Bronx. The launch at SAGE came ahead of an unpublicized national LGBT Housing Summit at the White House on February 10.\n\nThe need is not small. According to SAGE, conservative estimates show 3 million LGBT people over 55 years old live in the U.S. This number is set to double by 2030. A panel of speakers joined Adams, all from organizations involved in planning the initiative\u2014the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Equal Rights Center, HELP U.S.A., Enterprise Community Partners, and the Los Angeles LGBT Center. Together they announced a plan to build LGBT friendly elder housing, train housing providers, educate LGBT elders about their rights, and expand services that are LGBT friendly. They will also advocate for further policy change.\n\nThough few specifics were available, the nationwide plan includes training and education in places like nursing homes and hospices, as well as the development of LGBT elder housing in the Bronx. Officials said details about the Bronx development\u2014including where and when\u2014will be available when the funding has been finalized.\n\n\u201cThis is a lifesaver for us,\u201d said Jay Kallio, 59, in the audience at the announcement. He hopes that the cultural competency training offered as part of this initiative will help people like himself. Kallio believes the only reason his partner, Eleanor Cooper, received compassionate care at the end of her life five years ago was because they were treated as a heterosexual couple for the first time. Jay (formerly Joy) had transitioned by then and finally looked male. \u201cAs long as we were LGBT we were going to be treated like garbage,\u201d said Kallio. He said he had faced prejudice his whole life, first as a lesbian, then as a transgender person. Once he was thrown out of a job \u201cfor being a lesbian,\u201d Kallio said. \u201cLiterally thrown out with my belongings.\u2019\n\nMany LGBT elders in New York, who have lived through the civil rights movement and the AIDs epidemic, say they now face one of their biggest battles yet\u2014for a place to live out their final years peacefully and die with dignity.\n\nPart of the problem is economic. In a national survey of nearly 6,500 transgender and gender non-conforming people across 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands reported 90% of those surveyed said they had experienced harassment, mistreatment, or discrimination in employment. The survey\u2014Injustice at Every Turn\u2014was a collaboration between National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and National Center for Gender Transgender Equality. Nearly half of those surveyed said they had experienced under-employment and had been fired, not hired, or denied a promotion because of their gender identity. The figures of the 540 surveyed in New England were similar to the national numbers.\n\nKallio said he was 18 he met his life partner, Cooper. She had earned a masters degree in library science at Columbia University, but both found themselves working low-paid jobs with LGBT employers in order to get by. Both were involved in the Lesbian Feminist Movement in the 1970s, and in the mid-1980s, \u201cAIDs hit and we were serial caregivers,\u201d said Kallio. Unable to get health insurance, Cooper\u2019s diabetes went untreated, Kallio said, and she suffered from a debilitating stroke at the age of 56. According to Kallio, in the 12 years that Cooper lived after her stroke, she experienced discrimination and abuse in the health care and elder housing system.\n\nAccording to No Golden Years at the end of the Rainbow, a 2013 report by The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, \u201cOver 55% of LGB people report being mistreated in a medical setting and 70% of transgender people report mistreatment when seeking healthcare.\u201d They cite Lambda Legal\u2019s 2010 book When Health Care Isn\u2019t Caring: Lambda Legal\u2019s Survey of Discrimination Against LGBT People and People with HIV as their source.\n\nCooper died five years ago, at 68. Two years later, in 2012, Kallio made headlines in New York\u2014including the NY Daily News and the local ABC News\u2014when Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act passed with a clause prohibiting discrimination against LGBT persons by healthcare professionals. This gave Kallio a chance to speak up about discrimination he said he had been victim of when diagnosed with breast cancer. Kallio told the Daily News and ABC News that the doctor didn\u2019t immediately diagnose him, because of his male hormone levels.\n\n\u201cI have faced absolute rejection even as a cancer patient with a horribly aggressive cancer, of getting denied care by doctors,\u201d he said in an interview at the SAGE conference last week.\n\nThis breast cancer eventually gave Kallio the means with which to complete his transition. \u201cMany transgender people never transition at all, so I\u2019m probably one of the lucky ones who managed to get diseases that allowed it,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, Kallio is living in the Robert Fulton Houses development and suffering from stage-four cancer. Since coming out to his housing development as a transgender person, he said he has experienced support and love, \u201cIt has been absolutely been the warmest most supportive community of people I have ever lived with.\u201d He said he hopes to continue living at home in Chelsea with his cats, Mia and Clio. \u201cI want to die with my cats,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NY City Lens", "description": "An economically stressed group faces one of their toughest battles yet:  to find a place to live.", "title": "A New Housing Focus: the LGBT Elderly - NY City Lens", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://nycitylens.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/McGoogan_LGBT-Housing-Jay-Kallio_2.15.15.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-19T22:12:04+00:00", "url": "http://nycitylens.com/2015/02/a-new-housing-focus-the-lgbt-elderly/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nycitylens/", "section": "Politics & Policy", "tag": "LGBT Housing", "published_time": "2015-02-16T13:49:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-19T22:12:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=0.9, minimum-scale=0.9", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4a8\"", "article_summary": "Together they announced a plan to build LGBT friendly elder housing, train housing providers, educate LGBT elders about their rights, and expand services that are LGBT friendly.\nThe launch at SAGE came ahead of an unpublicized national LGBT Housing Summit at the White House on February 10.\nMichael Adams, executive director of SAGE announced that the initiative was dedicated to providing care for LGBT elders within the housing systems, including a pilot housing development in the Bronx.\nOnce he was thrown out of a job \u201cfor being a lesbian,\u201d Kallio said.\nThough few specifics were available, the nationwide plan includes training and education in places like nursing homes and hospices, as well as the development of LGBT elder housing in the Bronx."}
