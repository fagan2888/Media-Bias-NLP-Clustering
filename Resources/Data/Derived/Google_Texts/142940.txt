An interesting fight came to a head in Austin this week as contract reimbursement negotiations broke down between the public health plan there and the city’s largest health system.

The Austin American-Statesman reports the Travis County taxpayer-funded Sendero health plan no longer includes the 11 Seton Healthcare Family hospitals and its four outpatient clinics. The Texas Department of Insurance is investigating whether Sendero has enough in-network facilities to treat all of the members throughout an eight-county swath of Central Texas.

The fight comes as national insurance oversight officials debate on what exactly makes up an adequate network. On Nov. 22, members of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners will vote on a new template to update the current adequacy suggestions for states. Those have been on the book since 1996.

Calls to reevaluate adequacy mandates have grown louder since the passing of the Affordable Care Act. Insurance companies are narrowing their networks to rein in spending, resulting in some providers—including specialists and dedicated cancer hospitals—being left out of health plans. You’re seeing it in Dallas this open enrollment period, as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, the state’s largest insurer, vanished its PPO plans from the marketplace exchange. Cigna nixed its. UnitedHealth did, too.
