Talk about getting health insurance. #GetTalking.\u201d\n\nAnd, sure enough, Pajama Boy is wearing pajamas \u2014 a zip-up onesie in classic Lamar Alexander plaid \u2014 and drinking hot chocolate. He is in his 20s, sporting hipster glasses he could have bought at Warby Parker and an expression of self-satisfied ironic amusement.\n\nPajama Boy is about as threatening as Michael Cera and so nerdy he could guest-host on an unwatched MSNBC show.\n\nHe is probably reading \u201cThe Bell Jar\u201d and looking forward to a hearty Christmas meal of stuffed tofurkey. If he has anything to say about it, Obamacare enrollments will spike in the next few weeks in Williamsburg and Ann Arbor.\n\nPerhaps the goal of OFA was to create a readily mockable image to draw attention to its message, in which case Pajama Boy was a brilliantly successful troll.\n\nThe right immediately Photoshopped him into the Nelson Mandela funeral selfie and emblazoned his photo with derisive lines like \u201cHey girl, I live with my parents\u201d and \u201cHow did you know I went to Oberlin?\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s hard not to see Pajama Boy as an expression of the Obama vision, just like his forbear Julia, the Internet cartoon from the 2012 campaign. Pajama Boy is Julia\u2019s little brother.\n\nShe progressed through life without any significant family or community connections. He is the picture of perpetual adolescence.\n\nNeither is a symbol of self-reliant, responsible adulthood.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville wrote long ago of the infantilizing tendency of all-encompassing government.\n\n\u201cIt would be like the authority of a parent,\u201d he wrote in a famous passage, \u201cif, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood.\u201d\n\nIf you wanted to illustrate what Tocqueville was getting at in one meme, Pajama Boy would be good way to do it.\n\nPajama Boy\u2019s mom probably still tucks him in at night, and when she isn\u2019t there for him, Obamacare will be.\n\nA less nurturing reaction is, as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie put it in a counter tweet, \u201cGet out of your pajamas.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason President Barack Obama is underwater by a 2-1 margin among men in the latest Quinnipiac poll.\n\nFor all the ridicule directed at Julia during last year\u2019s campaign, she got at something important: Single women do look to government as a cushion against their economic insecurities.\n\nPajama Boy isn\u2019t so apt.\n\nHe might be glad to pay more for his health insurance to include maternity benefits he doesn\u2019t need as a blow against gender stereotyping, but most young people will presumably consider Obamacare more rationally and realize it\u2019s a scheme to get them to subsidize insurance costs for older people.\n\nGood luck, Pajama Boy, if you hope to talk them out of that.\n\nRich Lowry is editor of the National Review.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Hometown News LLC", "description": "Pajama Boy\u2019s place in Internet infamy was secured as soon as the insufferable man-child was tweeted out by Organizing for America.", "title": "Pajama Boy: Peter Pan in Obamacare Land", "url": "http://www.hngnews.com/sun_prairie_star/opinion/columns/article_c34ddc8e-7254-11e3-b896-0019bb30f31a.html", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/hngnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/33/f33b5c1e-7254-11e3-8aeb-0019bb30f31a/52c3208b73e3b.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C380", "height": 380}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CMertesSPStar"}, "description": "Pajama Boy\u2019s place in Internet infamy was secured as soon as the insufferable man-child was tweeted out by Organizing for America.", "fb": {"app_id": 135817296433862}, "google-site-verification": "b5DWcQyZo6r6p_nbm7JxnBBpvsgvDVW9i1lP4_VFXhM", "keywords": "columns", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Christopher Mertes"}, "news_keywords": "columns"}, "article_summary": "#GetTalking.\u201dAnd, sure enough, Pajama Boy is wearing pajamas \u2014 a zip-up onesie in classic Lamar Alexander plaid \u2014 and drinking hot chocolate.\nPajama Boy is about as threatening as Michael Cera and so nerdy he could guest-host on an unwatched MSNBC show.\nPerhaps the goal of OFA was to create a readily mockable image to draw attention to its message, in which case Pajama Boy was a brilliantly successful troll.\nGood luck, Pajama Boy, if you hope to talk them out of that.\nPajama Boy isn\u2019t so apt."}
