Syracuse, N.Y. -- With the March 31 Obamacare enrollment deadline fast approaching, readers still have plenty of questions about signing up.

Here's another one:



I am a U.S. citizen living abroad for more than 18 months with my family. I will be returning to the United States in June, after the March 31 enrollment deadline. Is there any way to enroll in June? -- Arvind Lonkar

Yes.

March 31 is the last day to enroll in Obamacare without incurring a penalty for not having insurance in 2014. The penalty is $95 or 1 percent of your income, whichever is greater.

After March 31, most people will not be able to sign up until the next open enrollment period which will run from Nov. 14 through Jan. 15, 2015.

People can sign up outside the open enrollment period if they experience what the government calls a "qualifying life event."

Moving is one of those events, whether you are moving back here from another country or relocating within the United States.

Here are some of the other circumstances that would allow you to sign up outside the open enrollment period:

Getting married;

Having or adopting a child;

Losing other health coverage because of a job loss, divorce or loss of Medicaid eligibility.

People eligible for Medicaid or Child Health Plus are not subject to the open enrollment periods and can sign up any time.
