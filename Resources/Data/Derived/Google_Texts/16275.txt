Democratic senator Joe Manchin on Obama: ‘People just don’t believe he cares’

Alas, President Obama continues to receive criticism from his supposed Democratic allies even after the midterm election.

Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) said in a phone interview with Time magazine Thursday that Americans “just don’t believe” Obama cares about representing his country.

“There’s an old saying my grandmother would say, ‘People don’t care how much you know, until they know how much you care,'” detailed Manchin. “And the president is bright and very articulate and speaks very well. People just don’t believe he cares. That’s the disconnect that I’m seeing.”

Manchin, recognized as a rather conservative Democrat, expressed his optimism following the midterm election that saw Republicans take hold of Congress.

“I liked everything I heard — that we’re going to have a process that’s going to work,” explained Manchin, referencing Mitch McConnell’s remarks following his reelection and his own conversations with GOP lawmakers. “Now the Republicans are saying, ‘Listen, we’re going to have an open process, we’re going to have a committee system.'”

Looking ahead to the new Congress, Manchin described himself as “anxious for change.”

The West Virginia senator specifically said an authorization vote on the Keystone XL pipeline would be a “slam-dunk” and advocated for raising the Obamacare workweek to 40 hours.

“To say that now we’re going to verify the 30 hours — we’ll be worse than Europe,” he said of the Affordable Care Act workweek. “I can’t go to West Virginia and try to sell that crap.”

Meanwhile, President Obama assured Friday that he will not “judge ideas based on whether they’re Democratic or Republican” and will instead attempt to work with the Republican-led Congress.
