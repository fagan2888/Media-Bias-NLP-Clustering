Under the law, the federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost of Medicaid expansion until 2017, with that support dropping to 95 percent in 2017 and to 90 percent after 2020, with states having to pick up the shortfalls after 2017.\n\nBut in a 2012 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal government could not withhold all Medicaid funding from states that chose not to expand their Medicaid programs, effectively giving states the opportunity to opt out of expanding Medicaid. Thus far, Georgia has been among the states opting out of the expansion, with officials citing concerns about the funding gap that would have to be made up with state funds after 2017.\n\nAt last week\u2019s pre-legislative session, Bailey argued, in part, that expanding Medicaid in Georgia could help stem the tide of rural hospitals closing around the state, and went on to claim that expanding Medicaid would create thousands of jobs in the state.\n\nCommissioner Melissa Link also expressed her support for Medicaid expansion, arguing the federal funds are coming from taxpayers across the nation, including in Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already paying for this through our federal taxes,\u201d Link said, before going on to claim that \u201cpeople are dying\u201d because of Georgia\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid.\n\nThe claim that 600 Georgians will die in 2016 without Medicaid expansion, referenced by the Athens For Everyone signs at the pre-legislative session, has been used by the Moral Monday movement at the state level in making the case for Medicaid expansion. The \u201cMedicaid gap\u201d noted in the signs displayed at last week\u2019s meeting is a reference to people whose incomes are above Medicaid eligibility limits but who don\u2019t qualify for tax credits in connection with obtaining insurance under terms of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAt last week\u2019s pre-legislative session, commissioners expressed wide agreement with the expansion of Medicaid in Georgia, but only one member of the legislative delegation \u2014 Spencer Frye of Athens, the lone Democrat in the delegation \u2014 expressed agreement with that goal.\n\nThe state legislature is set to convene on Jan. 11 for its 2016 session.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Mobile, Local News, Jim Thompson", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "In a prelude to what the group says will be an all-out effort in the upcoming state legislative session, members of the local activist organization Athens For Everyone showed up for a recent pre-legislative meeting of Athens-Clarke County\u2019s mayor and commission and the five members of the state legislative delegation to press for Medicaid expansion in Georgia.", "title": "Athens For Everyone presses case for Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/mobile/2015-12-23/athens-everyone-presses-case-medicaid-expansion", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/health-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "Following the session, Athens For Everyone members buttonholed the Republican members of the legislative delegation to argue further for Medicaid expansion.\nThe claim that 600 Georgians will die in 2016 without Medicaid expansion, referenced by the Athens For Everyone signs at the pre-legislative session, has been used by the Moral Monday movement at the state level in making the case for Medicaid expansion.\nCommissioner Melissa Link also expressed her support for Medicaid expansion, arguing the federal funds are coming from taxpayers across the nation, including in Georgia.\nAt last week\u2019s pre-legislative session, commissioners expressed wide agreement with the expansion of Medicaid in Georgia, but only one member of the legislative delegation \u2014 Spencer Frye of Athens, the lone Democrat in the delegation \u2014 expressed agreement with that goal.\nAt last week\u2019s pre-legislative session, Bailey argued, in part, that expanding Medicaid in Georgia could help stem the tide of rural hospitals closing around the state, and went on to claim that expanding Medicaid would create thousands of jobs in the state."}
