But if she were the CEO of a company, she might have faced not Congress but a grand jury for launching an unsafe product without proper testing based on a fraudulent sales pitch and misleading information.\n\nSebelius has admitted that Healthcare.gov\u2014the federal online shopping exchange that is the lynchpin of the program\u2014required one year of successful testing before launch. Instead it got two weeks of failed testing. If an automaker had knowingly put a vehicle on the road without appropriate crash tests, this administration, the self-appointed guardian of consumers, would have taken it to the mat.\n\nBut just like a defective car, Obamacare\u2019s defective exchange is not just a nuisance; it will destabilize the health insurance industry and jeopardize coverage. Yet the administration\u2019s march to enforce its law continues unabated.\n\nThe \u201cglitches\u201d in the exchange, many fear, will accelerate Obamacare\u2019s insurance death spiral. The folks who\u2019ll take the trouble to sign up will be the sick and poor who qualify for subsidies. The rest\u2014especially the young invincibles\u2014will likely go elsewhere, forcing them to raise rates.\n\nBut because Obamacare bars participating companies from offering different prices to their exchange and non-exchange customers, these rates will go up for all their customers. This will allow non-participating competitors\u2014that face no similar stricture\u2014to bid away their healthier and wealthier customers.\n\nThe participating companies will then face this choice: Stay in the exchange and risk extinction or quit. Either way, exchange patients will have fewer choices and pricier plans compared to non-exchange patients\u2014defeating the whole purpose of Obamacare.\n\nTo head off this dynamic, the administration has engaged in what can only be described as deception.\n\nThe exchange initially wouldn\u2019t let people even window shop without first submitting their income information so that it could offer them subsidized quotes and prevent them from walking away in sticker shock. But when this crashed the website, the administration switched tactics.\n\nThe exchange lumped all shoppers into two groups\u2014those under 49 and those over 50. The first group got quotes based on what a healthy 27-year-old would pay and the older group what a 50-year-old pay. The actual prices for specific policies obtained from the websites of insurance companies were much higher, prompting an expert interviewed by CBS, which broke the story, to call this feature \u201cincredibly misleading.\u201d\n\nBut the administration\u2019s lies don\u2019t end there.\n\nPresident Obama had been claiming till as recently as last year that his law would force no one to give up coverage. \u201cIf you like your plan, you can keep it.\u201d But the administration\u2019s own internal communication shows that it knew back in 2010 that 12 to 93 million policy holders might well lose their policies.\n\nThat\u2019s when Sebelius issued regulations grandfathering policies so long as they didn\u2019t change. If insurers so much as inflation-adjusted premiums, they lost their protected status, becoming subject to Obamacare\u2019s mandates requiring them to cover everything from maternity services for elderly couples to drug rehab for teetotalers.\n\nAll of this prompted even Washington Post\u2019s \u201cfact\u201d checkers this week to give Obama Four Pinocchios.\n\nThe whole point of Obamacare\u2014aka the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u2014was to protect patients from greedy insurers who lure them when they are healthy only to use some arcane fine print to jack prices or dump them when they fall sick.\n\nBut the administration has engaged in similar subterfuge, showing that the profit motive is not the only corrupter in human affairs. Partisanship, ideology and\u2014above all\u2014a president\u2019s need to leave a legacy are even more so.\n\nWhen companies put profits ahead of people, the government can go after them for fraud and falsehood. But what should people do when the government puts politics ahead of people?\n\nDon\u2019t ask this president because Obama-don\u2019t-care.\n\nThis column was originally published in the Washington Examiner", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/11/05/obama-dont-care", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The lies that the president told to sell his defective product would land a CEO in big trouble", "title": "Obama-don't-care"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obama-don't-care", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius last\ngot a good grilling in Congress about the Obamacare debacle.
