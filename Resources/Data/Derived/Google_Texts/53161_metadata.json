About 495,000 enrollees supposedly pay some amount of monthly cash premium payments, and 779,000 are completely subsidized through an expansion of Medi-Cal. But no one knows yet how many of the enrollees are eligible for subsidies or Medi-Cal because of rampant Obamacare fraud.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there were 11.7 million persons signed up for Obamacare in January 2015. About 84 percent of them were receiving some amount of subsidy, known as \u201cadvance payment of the premium tax credit\u201d (APTC), through their healthcare exchanges. The average APTC subsidy per enrollee for 2015 was $272 per month, or $3,264 for the year.\n\nThe APTC is called an \u201cadvance,\u201d because if an enrollee\u2019s income is too high by the end of the year to qualify for the subsidy received, or the person is an illegal alien, the U.S. government has the right to \u201cclaw-back\u201d the cash advanced from enrollees.\n\nBut 2.9 million, or 25 percent, of enrollees dropped out at some time before the end of the year. It is believed that many of the drop-outs were not eligible for the subsidies.\n\nThe U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) released the results of an audit on February 23 that found 431,000 applications from the 2014 enrollment period, involving $1.7 billion in associated subsidies, still had unresolved inconsistencies as of April 2015 \u2014 several months after close of the coverage year.\n\nThe GAO audit also revealed 35,000 \u201cSocial Security number inconsistencies,\u201d with about $154 million in associated subsidies, and 22,000 of \u201cincarceration inconsistencies,\u201d with about $68 million in associated subsidies.\n\nDuring the GAO\u2019s undercover sample testing, the federal Obamacare Exchange approved subsidized coverage for 11 of 12 fictitious GAO phone or online applicants for 2014. The GAO fictitious applicants obtained a total of about $30,000 in annual advance premium tax credits and maintained subsidized coverage throughout 2014, even though the GAO sent fabricated documents, or no documents, to resolve inconsistencies.\n\nAlthough Covered California could have received about $1,357,171,200 in APTC subsidies for 2015, that would assume all Covered California enrollees were legitimately eligible for Obamacare subsidies. But if 25 percent of the enrollees dropped out because they were not qualified or decided not to pay their healthcare premiums, Covered California could be shorted by as much as $339,292,800 from the federal government.\n\nThe GAO was appalled that 87.5 percent of its sample fraudulent applications were approved and remained in force for the entire year.\n\nGiven that states that operate their own Obamacare exchanges are at risk to pay back the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars, it should not be surprising that Peter Lee as executive director for Covered California, just announced, \u201cWe are now shifting our attention to changing the underlying delivery system to make it more cost effective and higher quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first few years were about getting people in the door for coverage,\u201d said Lee, quoted by National Public Radio. \u201cWe are now shifting our attention to changing the underlying delivery system to make it more cost effective and higher quality. We don\u2019t want to throw anyone out, but we don\u2019t want to pay for bad quality care either.\u201d\n\nLee added that it is time for the exchange to move beyond enrollment, and to flex its market power on behalf of its 1.5 million members. He said insurers haven\u2019t been tough enough on hospitals and doctors.\n\nThe trustees of Covered California are scheduled to vote next month on a plan to start identifying hospital \u201coutliers\u201d on cost and quality by 2018. Doctors would be subject to the same rating system shortly thereafter. Covered California would then start expelling so called \u201cpoor performers\u201d from the exchange in 2019.\n\nDoctors and hospitals that have endured Obamacare\u2019s low fees and administrative mess are furious at the latest Covered California move, claiming the action is just a \u201cbait and switch\u201d move back to narrow networks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California just announced it will restrict access to doctors and hospitals to slash costs.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "California just announced it will restrict access to doctors and hospitals to slash costs.", "title": "Covered California Restricts Networks to Cuts Costs - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Covered-California.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-03-22T07:41:52-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/03/22/covered-california-moving-back-to-narrow-networks-to-slash-costs/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California just announced it will restrict access to doctors and hospitals to slash costs.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Covered-California.jpg", "title": "Covered California Restricts Networks to Cuts Costs - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "advance payment of the premium tax credit, APTC, California, claw-back, Covered Califonria, GAO, Golden State, narrow network, U.S. General Accounting Office,Breitbart California, Economics,covered california", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-03-22T12:30:55-07:00", "section": "Breitbart California", "modified_time": "2016-03-22T07:41:52-07:00", "tag": "U.S. General Accounting Office", "categories": "Breitbart California,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Although Covered California could have received about $1,357,171,200 in APTC subsidies for 2015, that would assume all Covered California enrollees were legitimately eligible for Obamacare subsidies.\nDespite being rated with only one star on Yelp, Covered California announced in March that 1,274,073 million \u201cconsumers\u201d had signed up.\nThe trustees of Covered California are scheduled to vote next month on a plan to start identifying hospital \u201coutliers\u201d on cost and quality by 2018.\nCovered California would then start expelling so called \u201cpoor performers\u201d from the exchange in 2019.\nDoctors and hospitals that have endured Obamacare\u2019s low fees and administrative mess are furious at the latest Covered California move, claiming the action is just a \u201cbait and switch\u201d move back to narrow networks."}
