How can Anna accept sarkari lokpal bill? Sarkari lokpal is a \"jokepal\". Who is misguiding Anna? None of the 3 conditions which were agreed upon when Anna broke his fast in Aug 2011 are there in this jokepal\", he tweeted on Saturday.\n\nThe AAP leader has so far refrained from directly criticising any member of team Anna, but came close to it today when he retweeted one Amit Khalla. The tweet read, \"@thekiranbedi is now supporting a version of Lokpal she herself fought against. Her website says so #CongressKraned\"\n\nKejriwal also retweeted a tweet from the Aam Aadmi Party that said the party would now carry on the fight for a strong Lokpal bill.\n\nThis comes as AAP leader Kumar Vishwas told television channels that although the party bore no ill will towards Anna, that the movement for a strong Lokpal did not belong to him. \"The nation does not want to compromise on the Lokpal bill. It doesn't belong to Anna or to Kejriwal\", he said.\n\nAnna Hazare for his part, said that AAP was perfectly welcome to start its own agitation for the bill.\n\n\"We have separated now and are walking our separate ways. If he and his party are unhappy with the draft, they can start a new agitation. I am not with them\", he said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Aam Aadmi Party, AAP, Anna Hazare, Arvind Kejriwal, Janlokpal Bill, Lokpal Bill, NewsTracker, TheySaidIt", "og": {"site_name": "Firstpost", "description": "Kiran Bedi's comments come in the wake of a series of tweets by AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal who alleged that Anna had been misled into settling for a 'Jokepal'.", "title": "Kiran Bedi jumps into Lokpal fight, questions AAP's motives - Firstpost", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kiranbedi-afp.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-15T13:50:08+05:30", "url": "http://www.firstpost.com/india/kiran-bedi-jumps-into-lokpal-fight-questions-aaps-motives-1287969.html", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "firstpost.com", "description": "Kiran Bedi's comments come in the wake of a series of tweets by AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal who alleged that Anna had been misled into settling for a 'Jokepal'.", "title": "Kiran Bedi jumps into Lokpal fight, questions AAP\u2019s motives", "image": {"src": "http://s4.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/kiranbedi-afp.jpg"}, "creator": "@firstpost", "site": "@firstpost", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 500851548, "pages": 165818073477856}, "w18tracking_cdata": "India||FP+Staff", "article": {"section": "India", "tag": "TheySaidIt", "published_time": "2013-12-15T13:46:00+05:30", "modified_time": "2013-12-15T13:50:08+05:30"}, "bitly-verification": "cf8654d2b6b1"}, "article_summary": "Her website says so #CongressKraned\"Kejriwal also retweeted a tweet from the Aam Aadmi Party that said the party would now carry on the fight for a strong Lokpal bill.\n\"The nation does not want to compromise on the Lokpal bill.\nHow can Anna accept sarkari lokpal bill?\nThe Lokpal rift is wide open and a couple of tweets by Kiran Bedi, questioning the motives behind the continuing agitations against the bill, have just added fuel to the fire.\nHer comments come in the wake of a series of tweets by AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal who alleged that Anna had been misled into settling for a 'Jokepal'."}
