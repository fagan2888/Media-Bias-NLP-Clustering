So weird. pic.twitter.com/oD8c4D7tw3 \u2014 Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) March 10, 2016\n\nEarlier today Washington Post reporter Ben Terris, who witnessed the incident, published a lengthy piece detailing what happened.\n\nAs security parted the masses to give him passage out of the chandelier-lit ballroom, Michelle Fields, a young reporter for Trump-friendly Breitbart News, pressed forward to ask the Republican front-runner a question. I watched as a man with short-cropped hair and a suit grabbed her arm and yanked her out of the way. He was Corey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s 41-year-old campaign manager.\n\n\n\nFields stumbled. Finger-shaped bruises formed on her arm.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a little spooked,\u201d she said, a tear streaming down her face. \u201cNo one has grabbed me like that before.\u201d\n\n\n\nPOLITICO published audio this evening backing up Field's side of the story.\n\nFields: \u201cMr. Trump, you went after the late Scalia for affirmative action, do you -- are you still against affirmative action?\"\n\n\n\nVoice (allegedly Corey Lewandowski): \u201cExcuse me, thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\nA few moments later (noise of the room can be heard)...\n\n\n\nTerris: \u201cYou OK?\"\n\n\n\nFields: \u201cHoly sh*t.\"\n\n\n\nTerris: \u201cYea he just threw you down.\"\n\n\n\nFields: \u201cI can\u2019t believe he just did that that was so hard. Was that Corey?\"\n\n\n\nTerris: \u201cYeah, like, what threat were you?\"\n\n\n\nFields: \"That was insane. You should have felt how hard he grabbed me. That's insane. I\u2019ve never had anyone do that to me from a campaign.\"\n\n\n\nTerris: \u201cCan I put that in my story?\"\n\n\n\nFields: \u201cYeah, go for it \u2014 that was really awful. That\u2019s so unprofessional.\u201d\n\n\n\nTerris: \u201cHe really just almost threw you down on the ground.\"\n\n\n\nFields: \u201cHe literally went like this and was grabbing me down. I don\u2019t even what to do [about] what he just did to me. Oh my God, that really spooked me that someone would do that.\"\n\n\n\nTerris: \u201cWhat threat were you?\"\n\n\n\nFields: \u201cNothing. I was asking about affirmative action.\"\n\n\n\nTerris: \u201cAnd he probably knows you, right?\"\n\n\n\nFields: \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t understand. That looks horrible. You\u2019re going after a Breitbart reporter, the people who are nicest to you?\"\n\n\n\nTerris: \u201cI know, I\u2019m going to put it in my story.\"\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, Lewandowski told Breitbart reporter Matt Boyle yesterday he did in fact manhandle Fields because he thought she was part of a hostile press. This morning, Lewandowski and the Trump campaign denied the incident ever occurred and Lewandowski took to Twitter to further attack Fields.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Except someone did it..05/27/2016 9:02:22AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Except someone did it.", "title": "Donald Trump on Allegations Campaign Manager Yanked Female Reporter: \"Didn't Happen\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/03/10/donald-trump-on-allegations-campaign-manager-yanked-female-reporter-it-didnt-happen-n2131910", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/10/21.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Except someone did it.", "title": "Donald Trump on Allegations Campaign Manager Yanked Female Reporter: \"Didn't Happen\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/03/10/donald-trump-on-allegations-campaign-manager-yanked-female-reporter-it-didnt-happen-n2131910", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/10/21.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Donald Trump on Allegations Campaign Manager Yanked Female Reporter: \"Didn't Happen\" , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "This morning, Lewandowski and the Trump campaign denied the incident ever occurred and Lewandowski took to Twitter to further attack Fields.\nYou\u2019re going after a Breitbart reporter, the people who are nicest to you?\"\nFields: \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t understand.\nMiami, Fla. - Speaking to reporters in the spin room after the CNN GOP primary debate, candidate Donald Trump denied campaign manager Corey Lewandowski roughed up or assaulted Breitbart political reporter Michelle Fields at a campaign event earlier this week.\nAccording to the Daily Beast, Lewandowski told Breitbart reporter Matt Boyle yesterday he did in fact manhandle Fields because he thought she was part of a hostile press."}
