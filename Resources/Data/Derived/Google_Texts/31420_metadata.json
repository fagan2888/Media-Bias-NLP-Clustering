There wasn\u2019t rampant abuse and fraud, and the sky certainly didn\u2019t fall. But nothing good lasts forever; the party for the medical marijuana industry and its consumers is officially over.\n\nWith new regulations comes a brand new state agency (The Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation) that will oversee the licensing of all facets of the medical cannabis industry, and with new regulations comes new taxes. After all, someone has to pay for the new agency and oversight, and that \u201csomeone\u201d would be the taxpayers, whether they consume cannabis or not. Taxes don\u2019t discriminate.\n\nCalifornia officials are also contemplating a 15% sales tax, which would be added to whatever taxes local communities decide to impose. The revenues will be divided among the new BMMR, state parks, the state\u2019s \u201cgeneral fund,\u201d the state\u2019s Natural Resources Agency, and drug treatment programs.\n\nThe effect of all this will be to suppress future growth in the medical marijuana industry and keep a certain portion of consumers going to the unregulated and untaxed black market for their medicine. Not the best outcome, but taxes and regulations are inevitable when it comes to cannabis legalization.\n\nDoes anyone really think various levels of government officials will allow the re-legalization of marijuana without getting their beaks wet?", "article_metadata": {"description": "California has imposed more taxes and regulations on the medical marijuana industry.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "California has imposed more taxes and regulations on the medical marijuana industry.", "title": "Medical Marijuana in California: More Taxes, More Regulations!", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/55454.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/medical-marijuana-in-california-more-taxes-more-regulations/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/55454.jpg", "title": "Medical Marijuana in California: More Taxes, More Regulations!", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "California has imposed more taxes and regulations on the medical marijuana industry."}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "Economics of Liberty", "tag": "weed", "published_time": "2016-02-26T10:14:12+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/Joseph.Klare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For years, the medical marijuana industry in California went mostly unregulated, and it worked pretty well.\nBut nothing good lasts forever; the party for the medical marijuana industry and its consumers is officially over.\nMedical Marijuana in California: More Taxes, More Regulations!\nWith new regulations comes a brand new state agency (The Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation) that will oversee the licensing of all facets of the medical cannabis industry, and with new regulations comes new taxes.\nThe effect of all this will be to suppress future growth in the medical marijuana industry and keep a certain portion of consumers going to the unregulated and untaxed black market for their medicine."}
