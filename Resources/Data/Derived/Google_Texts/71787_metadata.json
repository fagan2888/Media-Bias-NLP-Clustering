A number of issues have been reported regarding the care of Desi Elwell, a minor tribal member currently residing with family in Tennessee.\n\nDesi is in need of medical care and a number of allegations have been made regarding how the tribe has handled his case. First and foremost, our commitment is to his health, safety and wellbeing.\n\nBecause nothing is more important than the welfare of all of our Yakama Nation children, we have carefully reviewed claims made by Mandi Lumley-Sage, who has been awarded temporary custody of Desi.\n\nMany of the claims reported by media outlets are not accurate.\n\nOur investigation found Yakama Nation never denied permission for Desi\u2019s heart surgery and medical therapy. The tribe has not pursued removal of Desi from Ms. Lumley-Sage\u2019s home, nor has the tribe sought a gag order on the case.\n\nWe will continue to monitor this situation carefully to ensure Desi\u2019s safety, health and wellbeing. Our prayers are with him for a successful surgery and a quick recovery.\n\nJoDe L. Goudy is the Yakama Nation Chairman.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Yakama Nation takes the welfare of our children seriously and we are committed to making decisions in the best interests of our members.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "JoDe L.
