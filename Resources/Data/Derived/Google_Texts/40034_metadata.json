Both Democrats and Republicans issued statements of support for the selection on Monday.\n\nChristie's last choice for the post was controversial. He previously picked Paula Dow, a Democrat and the state's first African-American top cop. As attorney general, she declined to join other mostly Republican-led states in a lawsuit challenging Obamacare.\n\nChristie appointed his previous attorney general, Jeffrey Chiesa, in June to fill the state Senate seat left vacant when Frank Lautenberg died. Jay Hoffman has been acting attorney general since then.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Election Day 2013 Election Day 2013\n\n1 of 13 Ken Cuccinelli Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, votes at Brentsville District High School in Nokesville, Va., Tuesday, Nov. 5, 2013.
