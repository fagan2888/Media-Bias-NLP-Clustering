Though Gov. Jerry Brown\u2019s new plans call for spending an additional $7.5 billion more than originally budgeted\u2013an increase that is larger than the entire budgets of some states\u2013Democrats in the state legislature are predicting a $2.5 billion surplus in the year to come, and bickering over which of the state\u2019s generous social welfare programs will benefit from the new cash.\n\nAs the Los Angeles Daily News reports, rival proposals from the State Senate and State Assembly agree that some of the surplus must be spent on the state\u2019s new \u201crainy day\u201d fund, approved by voters in 2014, as well as on programs that were cut during the lean years of the recession. But they disagree over funding to students and child care to low-income families\u2013both under the rubric of providing for future \u201ceconomic growth,\u201d according to Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De L\u00e9on.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Los Angeles Times notes that Democrats want to renew a subsidy for the United Farm Workers\u2019 health insurance that was enacted last year as a \u201cone-time stopgap measure\u201d to help the union comply with Obamacare. There is little interest in spending on infrastructure, such as the state\u2019s crumbling highways, which Gov. Brown\u2019s budget proposal says are short of money for basic maintenance.\n\nThe legislature must pass a budget by June 15 or work without pay, the Daily News notes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California Democrats Disagree: How Much Surplus to Waste?", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "California Democrats Disagree: How Much Surplus to Waste?", "title": "California Democrats Disagree: How Much Surplus to Waste? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/CA-State-Assembly-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-05-27T05:55:17-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/27/california-democrats-disagree-how-much-surplus-to-waste/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California Democrats Disagree: How Much Surplus to Waste?", "creator": "@joelpollak", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/CA-State-Assembly-ap.jpg", "title": "California Democrats Disagree: How Much Surplus to Waste? - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "California, democrats, State Legislature, surplus, Waste, welfare,Big Government, Breitbart California, Economics,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-05-27T05:53:37-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joelpollak", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-05-27T05:55:17-07:00", "tag": "welfare", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba41\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCalifornia is enjoying another year of budget surplus\u2013and the state\u2019s Democrats cannot wait to spend the spoils.\nThe legislature must pass a budget by June 15 or work without pay, the Daily News notes.\nThere is little interest in spending on infrastructure, such as the state\u2019s crumbling highways, which Gov.\nBut they disagree over funding to students and child care to low-income families\u2013both under the rubric of providing for future \u201ceconomic growth,\u201d according to Senate President Pro Tem Kevin De L\u00e9on.\nBrown\u2019s budget proposal says are short of money for basic maintenance."}
