I can\u2019t say too much [about it],\u201d but he did indicate the cutting-edge platforms would be both manned and unmanned, according to Russia Today.\n\nSukhoi\u2019s production line is humming these days: The state-controlled company recently signed a slew of deals for its Su-35S multirole fighters with Moscow, China and Indonesia. It\u2019s also testing its fifth-generation fighters, the Sukhoi T-50 PAK-FA, which are meant to compete directly with the Lockheed Martin-manufactured F-22 Raptor and likely will enter into service before the end of 2016.\n\nThe T-50, which can reach Mach 4 in seconds, will also carry anti-ship bombs capable of hitting maritime targets over 150 miles away and will have storage space in its fuselage so that the aircraft can fly sorties without appearing armed.\n\nRelated: Russia\u2019s Latest Weapons Sale to Iran Shifts the Balance of Mideast Power\n\nA new fighter from Moscow likely wouldn\u2019t be airborne for years, if not decades. But it does raise the stakes for the U.S., which is trying to determine what comes after the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, America\u2019s own fifth-generation warplane.\n\nLast month a top official at Northrop Grumman sketched the company\u2019s vision of what that might look like, proposing a possibly unmanned aircraft complete with lasers and advanced \u201ccyber resiliency,\u201d according to Defense News. Lockheed and Boeing have also started working on their own concepts.\n\nAny U.S. proposal would face incredible scrutiny both inside the Defense Department and on Capitol Hill after the F-35\u2019s troubled development. The program has been, and remains, plagued with technical glitches that have driven its price tag up to around $400 billion, making the jet the most expensive weapons effort in U.S. history.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s the New, Secret Warplane Everyone Will Soon Be Talking About\n\nA sixth-generation fighter program would be another multibillion addition to the Air Force\u2019s development \u201cto-do\u201d list, which already includes finishing the F-35 effort and developing new tankers and bombers.\n\nMoscow doesn\u2019t seem to have those fiscal concerns, though, and is moving ahead.\n\n\"If we stop, we will stop forever,\u201d Bondarev said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russia is looking far into the future of war in the air.", "title": "Move Over, F-35: Russia Has Raised the Stakes for Next-Generation Fighters", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/02/Move-Over-F-35-Russia-Has-Raised-Stakes-Next-Generation-Fighters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/3dnmple.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/02/Move-Over-F-35-Russia-Has-Raised-Stakes-Next-Generation-Fighters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/3dnmple.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Russia is looking far into the future of war in the air.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd235d\"", "article_summary": "I can\u2019t say too much [about it],\u201d but he did indicate the cutting-edge platforms would be both manned and unmanned, according to Russia Today.\nBut it does raise the stakes for the U.S., which is trying to determine what comes after the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, America\u2019s own fifth-generation warplane.\nIt\u2019s also testing its fifth-generation fighters, the Sukhoi T-50 PAK-FA, which are meant to compete directly with the Lockheed Martin-manufactured F-22 Raptor and likely will enter into service before the end of 2016.\nRussia is looking far into the future of war in the air.\nSukhoi\u2019s production line is humming these days: The state-controlled company recently signed a slew of deals for its Su-35S multirole fighters with Moscow, China and Indonesia."}
