Hartington, NE

A father and son from South Dakota were injured after their single-engine plane crashed in a northeast Nebraska farm field.



The Cedar County, Nebraska sheriff's office says 56-year-old Ronald Feimer and 16-year-old Alan Feimer of Yankton, South Dakota, were taken to a Yankton hospital after the crash Saturday afternoon.



Authorities say Ronald Feimer was flying the Cessna 172G aircraft when it crashed near an intersection about three miles south of Yankton just before 5 p.m.



Their injuries were not disclosed, but a hospital official says they are no longer patients at the facility.



The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the crash.
