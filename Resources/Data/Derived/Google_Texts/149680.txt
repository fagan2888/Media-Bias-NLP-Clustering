Brokaw continued, "What is striking to me about that statement... I would think, given the importance of Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, eight months ago the president would have started every meeting with, 'How we doing? Is that going to be ready? That's going to be our big play for the second term," and demanding from Kathy Sebelius and other people involved in it that they were ready and sending people over there to take a look at the rollout. That it suddenly landed the way that it did in utter chaos and it's not going to be an easy fix is just inexplicable."
