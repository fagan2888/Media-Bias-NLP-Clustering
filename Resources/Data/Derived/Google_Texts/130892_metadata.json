She was 85.\n\nBorn in Toronto in 1926, Madoff came to Pittsburgh in 1961 with her then-husband and found that pollution from industry was causing her frequent asthma attacks. Her testimony before the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy in 1969 led her to join the volunteers founding GASP that year.\n\n\u201cShe just was unwavering in her belief that the air should be cleaner, that citizens had a right to fight for clean air,\u201d said Rachel Filippini, GASP's executive director. \u201cWhen polluters claimed there was no technology to clean up their plants, she'd show them reports from engineers on how it could be done. When they said they couldn't afford it, she'd say, \u2018Show me your profit and loss statements.' \u201d\n\nMadoff was elected to council in 1978 and served four often combative terms.\n\n\u201cEven at times, if she had a vituperative tongue, it was always in service of moving the city forward,\u201d said state Sen. Jim Ferlo, who served a term on council with Madoff. \u201cPeople would cast their first, second, third votes for the Democratic party-endorsed candidates, but they'd always throw Michelle that fourth or fifth vote, because they wanted her to be there and shake things up.\u201d\n\nMadoff famously waited at Fifth and Smithfield at high noon when council President Eugene \u201cJeep\u201d DePasquale promised to kiss her behind, under the Kaufmann's clock, if one of her proposals succeeded. Her tip to the FBI led to the arrest and conviction of former council President Ben Woods and she established a local services tax so non-residents working in the city would help pay for emergency services.\n\nFailing to win a fifth term, Madoff moved to Las Vegas, where she met Scheske, 84, through an online dating site. They married and moved to Peoria, Ariz., where she pushed for stricter air-quality monitoring at the quarry.\n\nMadoff is survived by her daughter, Karenlin Madoff, 52, of Los Angeles; stepson, Daniel Scheske, 48, of Scottsdale, Ariz.; and stepdaughter, Catherine Scheske Dallal, 50, of Dallas. Arrangements are pending.\n\nMatthew Santoni is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=Ns4XrZpEwuk5$bKVTrl7w8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYs1_L54$Wnl32KZ9b6hIUngWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Santoni", "description": "Forty years after co-founding Pittsburgh's Group Against Smog and Pollution to stop steel mills' pollution, former Pittsburgh Councilwoman Michelle Madoff stood in front of gravel ...", "pubdate": "2013-10-13 20:18:00", "author": "Matthew Santoni", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "Forty years after co-founding Pittsburgh's Group Against Smog and Pollution to stop steel mills' pollution, former Pittsburgh Councilwoman Michelle Madoff stood in front of gravel ...", "title": "Michelle Madoff, former Pittsburgh councilwoman, dies in Arizona", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=Ns4XrZpEwuk5$bKVTrl7w8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYs1_L54$Wnl32KZ9b6hIUngWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "updated_time": "2013-10-14 13:48:10.631", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/4877662-74/madoff-scheske-ariz", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Forty years after co-founding Pittsburgh's Group Against Smog and Pollution to stop steel mills' pollution, former Pittsburgh Councilwoman Michelle Madoff stood in front of gravel ...", "title": "Michelle Madoff, former Pittsburgh councilwoman, dies in Arizona", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "creator": "@triblive", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=Ns4XrZpEwuk5$bKVTrl7w8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYs1_L54$Wnl32KZ9b6hIUngWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-13 20:18:00", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/adminpage/4877662-74/madoff-scheske-ariz", "sailthru.title": "Michelle Madoff, former Pittsburgh councilwoman, dies in Arizona", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Breaking", "headline": "Michelle Madoff, former Pittsburgh councilwoman, dies in Arizona", "keywords": "madoff, scheske, council, pittsburgh, ariz", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2013-10-13 20:18:00", "subcategory": "Admin Page", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2013-10-13 20:18:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-14 13:48:10.631", "tag": "madoff, scheske, council, pittsburgh, ariz", "subsection": "Admin Page", "title": "Michelle Madoff, former Pittsburgh councilwoman, dies in Arizona", "author": "Matthew Santoni"}, "docauthor": "Matthew Santoni", "sailthru.description": "Forty years after co-founding Pittsburgh's Group Against Smog and Pollution to stop steel mills' pollution, former Pittsburgh Councilwoman Michelle Madoff stood in front of gravel ..."}, "article_summary": "Michelle Madoff, former Pittsburgh councilwoman, dies in ArizonaEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\nFailing to win a fifth term, Madoff moved to Las Vegas, where she met Scheske, 84, through an online dating site.\nBorn in Toronto in 1926, Madoff came to Pittsburgh in 1961 with her then-husband and found that pollution from industry was causing her frequent asthma attacks.\nMadoff is survived by her daughter, Karenlin Madoff, 52, of Los Angeles; stepson, Daniel Scheske, 48, of Scottsdale, Ariz.; and stepdaughter, Catherine Scheske Dallal, 50, of Dallas.\n\u201cThey operated mostly at night, when the air monitors weren't running ... later, she went back and did it again with a reporter from the Arizona Republic.\u201dA longtime environmental advocate and outspoken, colorful member of City Council for nearly 16 years, Michelle Madoff died Saturday morning in an Arizona hospice of leukemia."}
