Rock Rapids, IA

Rock Rapids Iowa was one of the hardest hit towns after recent flooding, and local businesses are being severely affected by the damage that's left over.

Five feet of water flooded this auto body shop earlier in the week, and now, family and friends are helping to salvage what's left from the building. Today, they're pushing out what's left of the mud and water, and are cleaning off tools and equipment for future use.

I'm Kathleen Serie, and on KELOLAND News tonight at 10, we'll talk to a local business owner about how he's picking up the pieces.
