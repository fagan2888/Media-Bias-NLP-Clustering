The bishops say it\u2019s a matter of religious freedom.\n\nBut a new poll by Belden Russonello Strategists, commissioned by Catholics for Choice, asked Catholics aged 18 to 34 about a broad range of social justice issues, including religious freedom. It shows that younger Catholics disagree.\n\n1. Catholic millennials take a strong stand against discrimination.\n\nA large majority believe it should be illegal for Catholic institutions \u2014 such as churches, schools, hospitals, or social service agencies \u2014 to fire or refuse to hire a person who is:\n\nOpenly gay or lesbian (71%)\n\nSupports abortion rights (75%)\n\nUses birth control (79%)\n\nUndergoes artificial insemination in order to have a baby (80%)\n\nIs in a couple, living together but unmarried (78%)\n\nAnd 79% of Catholic millennials do not think that businesses should be able to refuse to serve LGBT individuals because of the business owner\u2019s religious views.\n\n2. They don\u2019t support the bishops\u2019 battles against contraception.\n\nRegarding the bishops\u2019 fight against contraception coverage in the Affordable Care Act, 78% of young Catholics think that health insurance companies should be required to include birth control in their insurance coverage.\n\nIn particular, they showed disbelief over the Hobby Lobby decision. \u201cFrom a legal standpoint, the Hobby Lobby decision gives corporations certain rights that are generally reserved for individuals,\u201d said a 28-year-old male participant. \u201cA corporation should not be able to claim freedom of religion. A corporation is a business.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. They don\u2019t want the bishops to follow Catholics into the ballot box.\n\nMore than three-quarters (80%) do not feel they have to vote the way the bishops tell them to. \u201cIf you wanted to disagree with the bishops on something political \u2026 you should have that right,\u201d said a 22-year-old male participating in the focus group.\n\n4. They embrace our diverse society \u2014 and wish the Church did the same.\n\nA 2014 Pew survey found that millennials are America\u2019s most racially diverse generation. A deep respect for others\u2019 experiences and points of view came up a number of times in the focus groups in terms of women\u2019s rights in society and in the Church, as well as separation of church and state. According to our poll, 82% of Catholic millennials believe abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances. Seventy-five percent of Catholic millennials want women to serve an equal role as men in the Catholic Church.\n\n5. They affirm their Catholic identity, but think for themselves.\n\nThe millennials in our focus groups pointed to core Catholic values like social justice, compassion, and community when they criticized the Catholic hierarchy for not living up to these same ideals. \u201cPart of being Catholic is helping others. It shouldn\u2019t be just picking and choosing who you want to help,\u201d said a 25-year-old female participant.\n\nAs millennials come into power and bring their belief that religious freedom is both freedom of, and freedom from, religion, I have to wonder if the bishops will change their tune. It doesn\u2019t seem like anyone else will be singing along with them.\n\nJen Girdish is the associate director of communications for Catholics for Choice.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBelden Russonello Strategists conducted a nationwide survey from March 25\u2013April 7, 2015 for Catholics for Choice. The survey consisted of 819 Catholics born between 1981 and 1997, using a GfK Knowledge Panel sample, which is probability\u2010based and web\u2010enabled. The margin of sampling error for a probability sample of this size is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. BRS followed the survey with two focus groups among Catholic Millennials in Chicago on May 5, 2015 \u2014 one group with 18- to 25-year-olds, and one with 26- to 34-year-olds. The group discussions helped to explain and illustrate many of the findings in the survey.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/life/2015/07/22/do-catholic-millennials-buy-the-us-bishops-religious-freedom-argument/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/library/images/favicons/favicon-200.png", "type": "article", "description": "As millennials come into power and bring their belief that religious freedom is both freedom of, and freedom from, religion, they are increasingly at odds with US bishops.", "title": "Do Catholic millennials buy the US bishops\u2019 religious freedom argument?"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d1d2d3", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/themes/crux/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e1c\"", "article_summary": "Seventy-five percent of Catholic millennials want women to serve an equal role as men in the Catholic Church.\nAccording to our poll, 82% of Catholic millennials believe abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances.\nAs millennials come into power and bring their belief that religious freedom is both freedom of, and freedom from, religion, I have to wonder if the bishops will change their tune.\nCatholic millennials take a strong stand against discrimination.\nThe bishops say it\u2019s a matter of religious freedom."}
