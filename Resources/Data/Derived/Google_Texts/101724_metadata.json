The firing was a salute to the Coast Guard Cutter Eagle and the Pride of Baltimore II, a replica of a topsail schooner that sank in the Caribbean in 1986.\n\nNo spectators were injured during the incident, though one crew member sustained minor flash burns and cuts during the explosion.\n\nThe boom did, however, shake the Maryland-based cannon manufacturer's standing with the parks service \u2014 at least temporarily.\n\nIn a Sept. 19 internal safety alert sent to all parks with historic weapons demonstrations and obtained by The Associated Press, the parks service announced that all makes and models of cannons from the manufacturer Cannons Online will be taken out of service until further notice.\n\nA call to Cannons Online was not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the memo, metal debris was flung as far as 400 feet from the cannon after the explosion. The memo also directs all parks with historic weapons demonstrations to review their safety policies and operating procedures.\n\nThe park service says it has suspended the black powder historic weapons firing program at Fort McHenry.\n\nNational Parks Service spokesman Mike Litterst said Fort McHenry and the National Parks Service have opened an investigation into the incident, and called a representative from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to the scene.\n\nATF spokesman Ken Ryan said the agency is not involved in the investigation, but confirmed that one representative did temporarily assist park staff after the explosion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cannon backfires at Fort McHenry in Baltimore - AP News: BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 In late-breaking news from the 19th century, .05/25/2016 21:42:24PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 In late-breaking news from the 19th century, there's been a cannon recall.The", "title": "AP News - Cannon backfires at Fort McHenry in Baltimore", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2014/09/24/cannon-backfires-at-fort-mchenry-in-baltimore-n1896329", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 In late-breaking news from the 19th century, there's been a cannon recall.The", "title": "AP News - Cannon backfires at Fort McHenry in Baltimore", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2014/09/24/cannon-backfires-at-fort-mchenry-in-baltimore-n1896329", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Cannon backfires at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0368\"", "article_summary": "The park service says it has suspended the black powder historic weapons firing program at Fort McHenry.\nNational Parks Service spokesman Mike Litterst said Fort McHenry and the National Parks Service have opened an investigation into the incident, and called a representative from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to the scene.\nThe boom did, however, shake the Maryland-based cannon manufacturer's standing with the parks service \u2014 at least temporarily.\nThe memo also directs all parks with historic weapons demonstrations to review their safety policies and operating procedures.\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 In late-breaking news from the 19th century, there's been a cannon recall."}
