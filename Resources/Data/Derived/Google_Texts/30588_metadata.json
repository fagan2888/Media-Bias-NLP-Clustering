The carrier suffered financial losses and declining membership in the state for a decade.\n\n\u201cAs we looked head, given LifeWise Oregon\u2019s relatively small size and the market conditions in Oregon, we decided to focus on our other markets, where we serve more than two million members,\u201d Jeff Roe, president and CEO of LifeWise Oregon\u2019s parent company, Premera Blue Cross, said in a statement.\n\nUnder the ACA\u2019s risk corridors program, LifeWise was slated for $5.4 million in 2014. So far, it has received only $609,000, according to the Portland Business Journal.\n\nThe carrier\u2019s exit follows that of one of the non-profit Affordable Care Act-created CO-OPs in Oregon - Health Republic Insurance Company, which announced in October that it was pulling out of the market.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nPortland Business Journal: Another Oregon health insurer exits market amid losses\n\nHealthcare Dive: Health insurance market entrants face cold, lonely path ahead", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/4c/d0/4cd08d33a3e397f3e4d81269329423ef.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer", "news_keywords": "Payer", "category": "News Post", "title": "Oregon health plan to exit market amid steep competition, falling revenues", "pub_date": "apr 22, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-22T09:00:00", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, April 22, 2016, 09:00 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-04-10T09:00:00", "teaser": "<p>LifeWise&rsquo;s existing members will continue being&nbsp;served through the duration of their current plan year.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-22", "sailthru.description": "LifeWise\u2019s existing members will continue being\u00a0served through the duration of their current plan year.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "LifeWise\u2019s existing members will continue being\u00a0served through the duration of their current plan year.", "title": "Oregon health plan to exit market amid steep competition, falling revenues", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/oregon-health-plan-to-exit-market-amid-steep-competition-falling-revenues/417901/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Portland_and_Mt_Hood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/e2/e3/e2e32599ac11288eaf8e5f56ea466149.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingPortland Business Journal: Another Oregon health insurer exits market amid lossesHealthcare Dive: Health insurance market entrants face cold, lonely path ahead\nDive Insight:Despite considerable efforts and investments, the company was unable to turn things around in the Oregon market, LifeWise officials said.\nDive Brief:LifeWise Health Plan of Oregon decided to bow out of the Oregon healthcare exchange market at the end of this year due to fierce competition and financial losses, the Portland Business Journal reports.\nSo far, it has received only $609,000, according to the Portland Business Journal.\nThe carrier\u2019s exit follows that of one of the non-profit Affordable Care Act-created CO-OPs in Oregon - Health Republic Insurance Company, which announced in October that it was pulling out of the market."}
