The assailant, identified as 78-year-old John McGraw, said the protester \u201cdeserved it,\u201d and that \u201cnext time we see him, we might have to kill him.\u201d RedState\u2019s Sara Gonzalez noted that the victim, 26-year-old Rakeem Jones, was acting rambunctiously in his own right; giving the middle finger to attendees in the rally as he was being escorted off the premises. Yet, she observed that it\u2019s a bit interesting that police didn\u2019t do anything after the punch, or more accurately elbow, was thrown.\n\nYet, McGraw didn\u2019t escape the long arm of the law; he was arrested for assault yesterday (via WRAL):\n\nA 78-year-old Linden man has been charged with assaulting a protester at the rally held in Fayetteville Wednesday for Republican front-runner Donald Trump. John Franklin McGraw was arrested Thursday morning and charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff\u2019s Office. [\u2026] \u201cI was walking up the stairs. The railing was in front of me, as a matter of fact there was two other people in front of me, they walked past and I was really not paying attention to them so I\u2019m walking and as soon as I turned, he hit me,\u201d said Jones. \"He hit me dead in my eye.\" 4 Jones was part of a group who started shouting in protest minutes after Trump took the stage Wednesday night. He said he gave McGraw the middle finger after he and many other attendees began yelling at the protesting group. Jones' group was the first of many protesters to be thrown out of the event.\n\nIn the video, taken by Inside Edition, where McGraw said that Jones deserved to be punched by him, he also said that he could be part of a terrorist organization:\n\nINSIDE EDITION tracked down the supporter, 78-year-old John McGraw, who was unrepentant. When asked if he liked the rally, he said: \u201cYou bet I liked it. Knocking the hell out of that big mouth.\u201d And when asked why he punched the protester, he said: \"Number one, we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ISIS. We don\u2019t know who he is, but we know he\u2019s not acting like an American, cussing me... If he wants it laid out, I laid it out.\" He added: \u201cYes, he deserved it. The next time we see him, we might have to kill him. We don\u2019t know who he is. He might be with a terrorist organization.\u201d\n\nWell, it\u2019s come to this, folks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's come to this...05/27/2016 8:07:50AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "It's come to this..", "title": "Stay Classy: Trump Supporter Who Suckered Punched Protester, Says 'We Might Have To Kill Him' Next Time", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/11/stay-classy-trump-supporter-who-suckered-punched-protester-says-we-might-have-to-kill-him-next-time-n2131700", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/10/18.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "It's come to this..", "title": "Stay Classy: Trump Supporter Who Suckered Punched Protester, Says 'We Might Have To Kill Him' Next Time", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/03/11/stay-classy-trump-supporter-who-suckered-punched-protester-says-we-might-have-to-kill-him-next-time-n2131700", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/10/18.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Stay Classy: Trump Supporter Who Suckered Punched Protester, Says 'We Might Have To Kill Him' Next Time, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "***A Trump supporter sucker punched a protester at a rally for billionaire Donald Trump in North Carolina on Wednesday.\nWe don\u2019t know who he is, but we know he\u2019s not acting like an American, cussing me...\nJones' group was the first of many protesters to be thrown out of the event.\nKnocking the hell out of that big mouth.\u201d And when asked why he punched the protester, he said: \"Number one, we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s ISIS.\nWe don\u2019t know who he is."}
