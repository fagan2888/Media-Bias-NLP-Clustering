Standing in the produce aisle was the guy they had just voted for: U.S. Sen. Mark Udall.\n\nEarlier that morning at the breakfast table, Jim turned to his wife and jokingly said, \u201cWe\u2019re voting for Cory Gardner, right?\u201d \u2014 referring to the Republican Senate candidate.\n\n\u201cIf you vote for you-know-who, you can walk out that front door and not come back,\u201d Kathy said, getting a huge grin from Udall when she retold the story.\n\nUdall and Gardner, a Republican congressman, are engaged in what is one of the hottest U.S. Senate battles in the country and one that could decide which party controls the Senate after November. Udall, down in several polls, has a packed calendar over the next four days; Gardner had only one public event today.\n\nKathy Faulk was equally excited to run into Jill Biden, the wife of the vice president, who accompanied Udall on campaign stops in Boulder, Longmont, Loveland and Fort Collins, where the faithful were urged to get out the vote.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go gaga. I contained myself,\u201d Kathy said. \u201cBut I admire Jill Biden so much and there she was in front of me. She was just as gracious as can be.\u201d\n\nOther shoppers and store workers were just as stunned to see the Udall entourage, which also included U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and Congressman Jared Polis. Mike Reid took a break from pushing his shopping cart to point out his hat, which said \u201cObama.\u201d He said it was from 2008. Andrew Apperson told Udall that when he had trouble getting his birth certificate in 2000 he enlisted then Congressman Udall\u2019s office for help \u2014 and got the document from Frankfurt. Yes, he told Udall, he was a military brat.\n\nForrest Wold-McGimsey, who was sacking groceries, got his picture taken with the senators and Biden but did offer one lament. \u201cI\u2019m only 17,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nThe stop wasn\u2019t planned but Udall\u2019s campaign bus arrived in Longmont early after a campaign event in Boulder. The campaign already had ordered sandwiches at Lucky\u2019s to eat before the next stop, in Loveland, so everybody decided to go inside.\n\nThat\u2019s the same market where Gardner bagged groceries in February as part of \u201cgovernment in the grocery,\u201d an idea Gardner\u2019s Democratic colleague, Congressman Ed Perlmutter of Golden, has perfected in the 7th Congressional District.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cory Gardner,Ed Perlmutter,Jared Polis,Jill Biden,Lucky's Market,Mark Udall,Michael Bennet", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Sen.
