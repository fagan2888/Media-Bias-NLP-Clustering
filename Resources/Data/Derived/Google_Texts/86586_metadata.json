Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of \u201cThe Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cJury service is a serious, meaningful and important responsibility,\u201d says Cook County Court in Illinois and many other courts in the United States. Yet the courts pay jurors far less than minimum wage. In Cook County, jurors are paid $17.20 a day; working eight hours at the state\u2019s minimum wage would pay almost quadruple that.\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.\n\nEmployers are sometimes forced by state law to pay jurors while they serve the court, but that is no help for the self-employed, students and people without jobs.\n\nJurors are selected randomly from state-compiled lists of residents and forced to participate unless excused by the court for specific circumstances, such as a medical condition that prevents service. People who do not report for duty can be punished at to the court\u2019s discretion, including jail time.\n\nWith random selection, low pay, medical excuses and the potential for severe punishment, a jury summons has a lot in common with a Vietnam-era draft notice, although, of course, the skill and activities associated with the service itself is far different for jurors than for Vietnam soldiers.\n\nMany people summoned for jury duty search desperately for excuses. Their efforts increase the burden on the court system, which has to summon and process a large number of people in order to empanel its juries.\n\nThe court system might alleviate these problems by following the example of the modern military: recruit people for service by paying them far more than minimum wage. Jurors could still be selected randomly, but with a nice paycheck waiting for them, they would not try as hard (or at all) to be excused by the court.\n\nCritics of a market-oriented recruitment system might say the pool of jurors would not fully represent the population because, among other things, people getting high pay in their normal jobs would be less willing to serve on a jury because of the loss of pay. But let\u2019s not pretend that the conscripted jurors we have today are a random sample of the population.\n\nIf jurors were paid at a generous hourly rate, might they deliberate longer? And would that be a good thing or not? If it were desirable to shorten juror deliberation time, jurors could be paid a flat rate for that part of their service.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the taking of private property \u201cfor public use, without just compensation.\u201d Did the founding fathers really think that it was much worse to take property without just compensation than to take a citizen\u2019s time?\n\nTaking property and drafting citizens into government service without market compensation have many of the same economic problems: they fail to spread the burden of supporting government activity, they encourage socially wasteful avoidance behaviors, and enforcement runs the risk of special treatment for the politically connected.\n\nThe modern military pays soldiers with both appreciation and money. Jurors should be paid that way, too.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140122000144, "twitter": {"description": "Paying jurors at least the minimum wage might make jury duty more palatable to many people, an economist writes.", "title": "Just Compensation for Jurors", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/just-compensation-for-jurors/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002663915, "DISPLAYDATE": "January 22, 2014", "keywords": "Draft and Recruitment (Military),Jury System,Minimum Wage,Cook County (Ill),Today's Economist,Uncategorized,_featured", "GBLC": "Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/Just Compensation for Jurors ( 20140122 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Casey B.
