It\u2019s a thought experiment that pops up in fervent fandoms, ones that are also eagerly reimagining beloved characters in different settings or with new adventures. The gender swap is even simpler than any of that\u2014it merely asks, well, what if all the female characters were men, and the male characters were women? What might change about them? What might stay the same?\n\nAs with so many elements of fandom, it\u2019s casually subversive\u2014a re-creation that grapples with the social construction of gender and imagines its infinite fluidity. And as with so many elements of fandom, it is a long-standing tradition\u2014one that Shakespeare made regular use of in his plays, which itself was a commentary on the fact that all the female roles were played by men. As storytelling, though, it\u2019s not always cogent. Even for Shakespeare, swapping genders just because you can isn\u2019t story, it\u2019s stunt. And on television, it\u2019s understandably kind of difficult to get average viewers on board with a new episode of \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d where Lady Mary is all of a sudden dressed in a smart waistcoat and trousers, going by \u201cLord Mark,\u201d and Cousin Matthew is instead distant, middle-class cousin Mattie, taking on the daring task of riding a bicycle while wearing a dress and three petticoats.\n\nBut what you do see happening in mainstream narratives is the gender-swapping of characters\u2019 roles, if not of the characters\u2019 genders, themselves. It works best in a setting that has traditionally quite strong gender roles. \u201cMad Men,\u201d for example, did this with Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), starting out by writing her character into the cookie-cutter secretarial role before inserting her into the traditionally male role of copywriter and creative director. She was swapped, and in later seasons, her relationship with Stan (Jay R. Ferguson) highlights that\u2014he\u2019s her employee, content (mostly) with not being in charge, and more naturally maternal and sensitive than Peggy ever demonstrates. Especially in the 1960s, it\u2019s an illustrative dynamic, one that is thoroughly at odds with nearly every other relationship in the series. (Joan is so stymied by the era that she ends the show as she began it: single.)\n\nAnd for an entirely different example, take \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d the post-apocalyptic action film that has dominated critical conversation in the weeks since its release. There\u2019s so much to say about the film, but above all, what\u2019s astounding is how the film upends\u2014reverses\u2014the prevailing ideas of what a male character is supposed to do versus a female character. As my friend Genevieve Valentine wrote for the Dissolve, \u201c\u2019Fury Road\u2019s\u201d plot is nothing special. (It is, in effect, a gloriously kinetic U-turn.) Its narrative interest stems from the shift it brings to the context of the desert itself, from Max\u2019s masculine to Furiosa\u2019s feminine.\u201d The narrative U-turn is in part a manifestation of the film\u2019s emphasis on reversal\u2014it\u2019s Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is the action-star hero, not Mad Max (Tom Hardy). It\u2019s not just a revealing commentary on gender, it\u2019s a vision of a different, better world, made from the ashes of one much worse.\n\nTexas in 1984, the setting of AMC\u2019s \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d isn\u2019t exactly post-apocalyptic America\u2014but then again, it\u2019s not so far off, is it? Desert still reaches to the horizon, and even worse, patches of suburbia bloom like mold, in green-and-brown enclaves amid the tumbleweeds. It\u2019s hardly the lush valleys of what will become known as Silicon Valley\u2014indeed, one of the most confusing and interesting things about \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d is that it\u2019s not set in San Francisco (yet) but instead takes place in the Silicon Prairie, that collection of telecom corporations taking up space in the vast reaches around the most boring city in the world, Dallas-Fort Worth. This is the era before tech was cool, or to be exact, before this industry desperately branded itself as cool. And trying to make money off of bulky, beige cubes of plastic, wiring and blank glass screens seems about as impossible and alchemical as turning lead into gold. In season one, \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d attempted to build a narrative around Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), former IBM company man who is now trying to build a company that can compete with the computing giant. Pace is the show\u2019s biggest star, and his story, on paper, had the satisfying beats of a Man Trying To Do A Thing that has characterized many other successful dramas, including AMC\u2019s own \u201cMad Men\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The show reboots itself successfuly in its second season to put two female computing entrepreneurs front and center", "title": "The radical notion that women can pursue their own grand TV destinies: \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d finds its voice by focusing on women in tech", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The show reboots itself successfuly in its second season to put two female computing entrepreneurs front and center", "title": "The radical notion that women can pursue their own grand TV destinies: \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d finds its voice by focusing on women in tech", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/07/the_radical_notion_that_women_can_pursue_their_own_grand_tv_destinies_halt_and_catch_fire_finds_its_voice_by_focusing_on_women_in_tech/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/halt_catch_fire.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The show reboots itself successfuly in its second season to put two female computing entrepreneurs front and center", "title": "The radical notion that women can pursue their own grand TV destinies: \u201cHalt and Catch Fire\u201d finds its voice by focusing on women in tech", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/halt_catch_fire.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amc, halt and catch fire, kerry bish\u00e9, Lee Pace, mackenzie davis, Mad Max: Fury Road, scoot mcnairy, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0154\"", "article_summary": "But what you do see happening in mainstream narratives is the gender-swapping of characters\u2019 roles, if not of the characters\u2019 genders, themselves.\nIt works best in a setting that has traditionally quite strong gender roles.\nTexas in 1984, the setting of AMC\u2019s \u201cHalt and Catch Fire,\u201d isn\u2019t exactly post-apocalyptic America\u2014but then again, it\u2019s not so far off, is it?\nThe gender swap is even simpler than any of that\u2014it merely asks, well, what if all the female characters were men, and the male characters were women?\n\u201cMad Men,\u201d for example, did this with Peggy (Elisabeth Moss), starting out by writing her character into the cookie-cutter secretarial role before inserting her into the traditionally male role of copywriter and creative director."}
