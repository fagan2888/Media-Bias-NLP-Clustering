Military surveillance techniques that were perfected in Fallujah, are now being deployed in Southern California. Despite recent drops in violent crime, Los Angeles is experimenting with license plate reading technology and citywide surveillance cameras. Authorities will have the ability to track the exact locations of L.A. drivers at any date – whether they've committed a crime or not.

According to LAWeekly:

"Smart video" programs can use facial recognition to ID people by comparing live CCTV footage to mugshot databases built from facial scans collected by police using mobile devices or during bookings. Computer programs also can learn "acceptable behavior" by humans — such as pedestrian or vehicular traffic patterns — and alert cops when something "abnormal"' occurs. LAPD already is using a sophisticated intelligence-analysis program from Silicon Valley firm Palantir, which is partially funded by In-Q-Tel, the Central Intelligence Agency's venture capital firm. Palantir sells data-mining and analysis software to the NSA and other intelligence agencies. Ana Muniz, an activist and researcher who works with the Inglewood-based Youth Justice Coalition, says, "Any time that a society's military and domestic police force become more and more similar, where the lines have become blurred, it's not a good story."

Last June, Reason TV investigated Baltimore's controversial decision to install audio recorders in its fleet of city buses. Maryland's politicians were bitterly divided over the issue, while privacy activists debated law enforcement over the policy.

For the most part, Baltimore's bus riders have accepted surveillance as a fact of life. In a city that ranks among America's most violent, most citizens say they're more concerned with fighting crime than protecting privacy in public spaces.
