Perry isn't the first musician the president has deemed one of his favorites. Here are four others who join the \"Roar\" singer on Obama's playlist. (JulieAnn McKellogg/The Washington Post)\n\nPresident Obama loves Katy Perry.\n\n\"I love Katy Perry,\" Obama said last night before the \"Firework\" singer took the stage to perform at a White House reception for the Special Olympics. \"She is just a wonderful person. I just met her mom, now I know why she's such a wonderful person.\"\n\nPerry, clad in a blue, sequined gown, performed at the Thursday night event, which marked the 46th anniversary of the Special Olympics. And the praise continued from Obama.\n\nPerry is \"one of my favorite people,\" the president said.\n\n\n\nSinger Katy Perry (C) and her mother, Mary Perry Hudson (L), arrive for a celebration for the Special Olympics on Thursday in the East Room of the White House.

Stevie Wonder, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Andy Roddick also attended the gala.\n\nTurns out that Obama and Perry go (relatively) way back. Perry performed at rallies for Obama during the 2012 campaign and told GQ that she \"might have won Wisconsin for him\" after performing at a rally in Milwaukee.\n\n\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t do too much, but he called on me a couple of times. Which was very nice,\" she told the magazine.\n\nPerry also performed in Las Vegas before an Obama rally in 2012. The singer was wearing a dress that looked like a ballot with a vote cast for Obama. Obama said Perry was an \"outstanding young lady,\" and noted her grandmother was a longtime Nevada resident.\n\nLast year Obama's official Twitter account, which is run by Organizing for Action, Tweeted at Perry, thanking her for publicly supporting the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere was no word on whether Obama and Perry talked about aliens, a subject she told GQ she wanted to take up with the president if their relationship deepened.\n\n\"I see everything through a spiritual lens,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe in a lot of astrology. I believe in aliens,\" she told GQ. \u201cI look up into the stars and I imagine: How self-important are we to think that we are the only life-form? I mean, if my relationship with Obama gets any better, I\u2019m going to ask him that question. It just hasn\u2019t been appropriate yet.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Perry, who once said she might have \"won Wisconsin\" for Obama in 2012, performed at the White House for the Special Olympics Thursday.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Perry, who once said she might have \"won Wisconsin\" for Obama in 2012, performed at the White House for the Special Olympics Thursday.", "title": "Obama: Katy Perry is \u2018one of my favorite people\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/01/obama-katy-perry-is-one-of-my-favorite-people/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2014-07-31/Getty/Was8855173.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katiezez"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/08/01/obama-katy-perry-is-one-of-my-favorite-people/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, Katy Perry, Special Olympics, Stevie Wonder, Andy Roddick, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Las Vegas, Wisconsin, GQ", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zezimak"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Katy Perry, Special Olympics, Stevie Wonder, Andy Roddick, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Las Vegas, Wisconsin, GQ"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc38d\"", "article_summary": "(JulieAnn McKellogg/The Washington Post)President Obama loves Katy Perry.\n\"I love Katy Perry,\" Obama said last night before the \"Firework\" singer took the stage to perform at a White House reception for the Special Olympics.\nSinger Katy Perry (C) and her mother, Mary Perry Hudson (L), arrive for a celebration for the Special Olympics on Thursday in the East Room of the White House.\nPerry, clad in a blue, sequined gown, performed at the Thursday night event, which marked the 46th anniversary of the Special Olympics.\nObama said Perry was an \"outstanding young lady,\" and noted her grandmother was a longtime Nevada resident."}
