We will definitely be hearing one phrase of that sort this weekend: \u201cfreedom is not free.\u201d\n\nWhen people who have never served in the military use the phase \u201cfreedom is not free,\u201d I often find it to be done in a very convoluted and disingenuous manner on many levels. For example, we lost dozens of American lives fighting to hold Ramadi almost a decade ago, and yet campaign promises essentially gave the Iraqi town to ISIS terrorists just this week. These brave men and women who died in service to our nation will be mourned this weekend. Fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, husbands and wives will be missed.\n\nA price was paid in Ramadi for freedom, but then the investment was squandered. That\u2019s not right.\n\nAmericans of all ages, socio-economic status, politics, ethnicity and gender use \u201cfreedom is not free\u201d as if they know exactly what it means to put service to their country and the commitment to an ideal before one\u2019s own self interest. They often do not. The truth is that only a fraction of Americans under 50 have served their country in uniform. Many really don\u2019t seem to feel it is their obligation these days.\n\nSo we can establish people are often unclear on the concept of \u201cfreedom is not free.\u201d It\u2019s a shame. When people use it, do they at least even know its origins? The honest answer is probably not. But that\u2019s OK. To help, here is some background and credibility for them as we prepare to observe Memorial Day weekend.\n\nThe origin of \u201cfreedom is not free\u201d is credited to retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Walter Hitchcock of the New Mexico Military Institute. It is meant to express gratitude for the service of members of the military, implicitly stating that the freedoms enjoyed by those living in democracies today are only possible due to the risks taken and sacrifices made by those in the armed services. It conveys respect \u2014 specifically to those who gave their lives in defense of our freedom.\n\n\u201cFreedom is not free,\u201d for example, is engraved onto a portion of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, Washington, D.C. While it should be a powerful phrase to all, it is particularly important to veterans.\n\nThose of us who have served our country honorably salute and say an often-silent prayer for our fallen brothers and sisters who fought so Americans can enjoy the rights and freedoms granted to them by our Constitution. When you are at a BBQ or watching the game this weekend, please take a moment to say at least a silent \u201cthank you\u201d to veterans for their service. You might also donate to veterans\u2019 charity to lend a helping hand to those vets who have fallen on hard times.\n\nAnd you might also say a prayer for those still serving. They seem to need it these days.\n\nMemorial Day should not be political. But the U.S. military has nonetheless been the object of mass social and political experiments under this and other presidential administrations. The dishonor and immorality now being implemented in the military is an abomination. I have spoken with many active and retired military personnel, and they all have a common complaint: the Obama Administration is disruptive and degrading to the military\u2019s ability to do its job. The political agenda imposed by this White House, they say, is endangering lives.\n\nThat\u2019s why my prayer is that God protects our brave men and women, and that He gives them the support they need to do their job and return home safely and healthy to their families.
