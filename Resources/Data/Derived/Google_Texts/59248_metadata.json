It showed Marilyn Tavenner, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, telling an employee in the public affairs office to \u201cplease delete this email.\u201d\n\nCMS spokesman Aaron Albright, though, told FoxNews.com that the email nevertheless was forwarded to staff to be preserved \u2013 it evidently was, since committee leaders later obtained it from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cThe administrator forwarded this email to a press staffer solely for her awareness. She also copied immediate staff to retain the email, and it was preserved,\u201d Albright said.\n\nMore On This...\n\nThe development, though, comes after HHS earlier this month informed Congress that some of Tavenner\u2019s emails may be lost \u2013 which followed the IRS admitting that emails from embattled ex-official Lois Lerner, embroiled in the scandal over the targeting of conservative groups, were also gone.\n\nRepublicans investigating the botched HealthCare.gov launch fired off a letter to Tavenner on Friday asking about that 2013 conversation, and whether the department has directed staff to delete or destroy other emails or documents pertaining to HealthCare.gov as well.\n\nHHS has explained that since Tavenner receives as many as 12,000 emails a month, she would sometimes delete emails after either forwarding or copying the email to her staff to keep. However, some of these emails never made it to her staff.\n\nAn HHS spokesman said earlier this month that the department has confidence the \u201cvast majority\u201d of Tavenner\u2019s emails can be retrieved, and they already have located more than 70,000. The department claimed any missing records do not speak to an attempt to conceal information.\n\nUpton and Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., pointed to the Oct. 5, 2013 email in questioning that claim.\n\n\u201cWhat was the Obama administration trying to hide?\u201d Upton said. The lawmakers\u2019 letter to Tavenner said the instruction to delete an email \u201ccontradicts\u201d the agency\u2019s claim that it tells personnel to retain records.\n\nThe 2013 email exchange started when Tavenner sent a note explaining how agency personnel were handling the flood of applications as the website itself failed. She explained they were taking PDF files that \u201clook and act like a paper application,\u201d but were shifting to take some information online. Another official wrote back questioning how that process would work.\n\nTavenner then looped in Julie Bataille, with the press office, and wrote: \u201cPlease delete this email-but please see if we can work on call script.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "judiciary", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/HOUSE OF
