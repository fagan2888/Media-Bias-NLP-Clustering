It was unbelievable. I couldn't believe the speed, I couldn't believe that they could be so close together. It was really just beyond description.\"\n\nJohnson, who now lives in Lafayette, and others want to install at North Boulder Park a piece of original, abstract art about 50 feet long, 18 feet tall and 20 feet wide. After announcing the idea in 2010, the group is still working to raise $215,000 to fund the project, which is being called the U.S. Cycling Monument.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany credit the Red Zinger/Coors Classic stage race with putting Boulder and the United States \"on the map\" for competitive cycling, including Zach Johnson, Kimmerjae's husband and one of the advocates for the project.\n\nZach Johnson added that the monument would also be a testament to Boulder's outdoor lifestyle, including cycling for commuting and recreation.\n\n\"The monument not only will honor and celebrate the bike races, but on a bigger scale, launching the U.S. onto the international stage,\" he said. \"It celebrates the race but also Boulder and Colorado's role in international cycling.\"\n\nCelestial Seasonings launched the race in 1975 \u2014 40 years ago this summer \u2014 to promote the company's Red Zinger tea. In 1979, Michael Aisner took over the race and the Coors Brewing Co. became its second sponsor.\n\nAisner believes the race, which drew 50,000 to 60,000 spectators in its later years, made Boulder a hub for the world's best cyclists, triathletes, runners and other athletes.\n\n\"We have had an influx of athletes move to Colorado because they found the benefits of altitude and living in a town as bike-friendly as Boulder,\" he said.\n\nHe added that it helped establish the careers of countless professional cyclists, including three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond, who twice won the Coors Classic.\n\nBoulder resident and national champion Dale Stetina won the race in 1979 and 1983.\n\nAnother local, Olympic medalist, national champion and two-time Tour de France stage winner Davis Phinney, won the final Coors Classic in 1988.\n\nConnie Carpenter-Phinney, Olympic gold medalist and 12-time national champion, won the race in 1977 and 1982. The two were married in the fall of 1983.\n\nDavis Phinney, whose Boulder-based Davis Phinney Foundation supports people with Parkinson's disease, said many racers in the Red Zinger/Coors Classic era \"fell in love\" with Boulder at the time. He was 15 the first time he witnessed the race and 18 when he first competed.\n\nRiders approach the finish line of the 1975 Red Zinger Bicycle Classic.

It literally changed my life.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28427470/fundraising-continues-monument-honor-boulders-place-cycling-history", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28427470:view"}, "startDate": "2015-07-05T10:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Although decades  have passed, artist Kimmerjae Johnson remembers clearly the first time she watched a pack of cyclists clad in brightly colored racing bibs sprint toward the finish line of the Coors International Bicycle Classic in North Boulder Park.", "title": "Fundraising continues for monument to honor Boulder's place in cycling history", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28427470/fundraising-continues-monument-honor-boulders-place-cycling-history", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0702/20150702__06DCAMONw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2015-07-05T10:27:03-0600", "endDate": "2025-07-05T10:52:01-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaStaff", "pubDate": "2015-07-02T22:46:10-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-07-05T10:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Fundraising continues for monument to honor Boulder's place in cycling history", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0702/20150702__06DCAMONw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Although decades  have passed, artist Kimmerjae Johnson remembers clearly the first time she watched a pack of cyclists clad in brightly colored racing bibs sprint toward the finish line of the Coors International Bicycle Classic in North Boulder Park.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28427470/fundraising-continues-monument-honor-boulders-place-cycling-history", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Although decades  have passed, artist Kimmerjae Johnson remembers clearly the first time she watched a pack of cyclists clad in brightly colored racing bibs sprint toward the finish line of the Coors International Bicycle Classic in North Boulder Park.", "title": "Fundraising continues for monument to honor Boulder's place in cycling history"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0702/20150702__06DCAMONw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "A team is working to raise $215,000 to build a monument to the Red Zinger bike race and to Boulder's place in cycling history.\nAfter announcing the idea in 2010, the group is still working to raise $215,000 to fund the project, which is being called the U.S. Cycling Monument.\nZach Johnson added that the monument would also be a testament to Boulder's outdoor lifestyle, including cycling for commuting and recreation.\nCelestial Seasonings launched the race in 1975 \u2014 40 years ago this summer \u2014 to promote the company's Red Zinger tea.\nAnother local, Olympic medalist, national champion and two-time Tour de France stage winner Davis Phinney, won the final Coors Classic in 1988."}
