Nathan Deal outlined yesterday isn\u2019t quite complete. And the hole that needs to be filled could involve Georgia\u2019s largest hospital.\n\nChris Riley, Deal\u2019s chief of staff, told us his boss is in talks with Grady Memorial Hospital\u2019s chief executive about filling a possible hole in the hospital\u2019s budget.\n\nIt involves a winding down of Disproportionate Share Hospital payments under Obamacare.\n\nGrady received roughly $90 million in DSH funding each year but that amount could be halved in four years due to changes from the healthcare overhaul. And without a Medicaid expansion, which isn\u2019t happening any time soon, the funding cuts won\u2019t be offset by Washington.\n\nSuddenly, the state has another health care void to fill. Riley said there\u2019s flexibility built into the budget to plug the hole, but how much \u2014 if any \u2014 is needed is not immediately known.\n\n\u201cThe governor is very concerned about it, and we will be continuing to talk to Grady about what kind of assistance the hospital requires,\u201d said Riley.\n\n***\n\nGov. Nathan Deal has mentioned Site Selection magazine\u2019s pick of Georgia as the nation\u2019s No. 1 place to do business in just about every appearance the last few months. He cited it in three different speeches on Wednesday alone.\n\nWe get the feeling he may not be making much hay about the magazine\u2019s January edition.\n\nUnder the \u201crankings that matter\u201d category, Georgia comes in at No. 2 in one category (career readiness certificates) and 11 in GDP. But it\u2019s in the bottom half of the nation in three of the magazine\u2019s other categories: 32nd in business tax climate, 38th in health and 47th in high school graduation. *** Over at the WABE(90.1FM) website, Denis O\u2019Hayer has an interesting clip illustrating the gulf that exists between the two top authorities over education in Georgia \u2013 Gov. Nathan Deal and School Superintendent John Barge, who is one of Deal\u2019s primary challengers. O\u2019Hayer asked Deal if any of the education spending increase in his 2015 budget proposal was a reaction to a lengthy letter that Barge sent to him and other lawmakers last week, objecting to years of education spending cuts. This was the governor\u2019s reply:\n\n\u201cWe had already prepared our budget far beyond the time frame in which the school superintendent saw fit to send us a letter. He did not provide us very detailed information in his budget presentation. It was just generalities. We had worked on a concept of how to fund public education. Unfortunately, his input was not forthcoming at an appropriate time, when we were preparing the budget.\u201d\n\nDeal was asked to elaborate, and he did:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very conceivable that writing a three-page letter to the governor and the members of the General Assembly at a point in time when you know that the budget has already been prepared and, as we say, locked. And that\u2019s when it came\u2026.It\u2019s always good to hear from our state school superintendent, even if he\u2019s late.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Hayer quickly caught up with Barge, who said he felt locked out of the budget process:\n\n\u201cWe had our budget meeting with him just like any other agency head. We had our scheduled time. He did not schedule our time with him until December. So I was not invited to present our budget to him until December. And we did it at our assigned time\u2026.It was later this year than normal.\u201d\n\n***\n\nMore on the topic of cuts in spending on education: Today\u2019s print column tells of a forum held by the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, featuring eight candidates for state school superintendent \u2013 a replacement for John Barge.\n\nOne of them was former DeKalb County school board member Nancy Jester, who insisted that talk of reduced spending on education was nonsense. \u201cWe need to put to rest that our funding has been cut \u2013 because it hasn\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of her allies this morning pointed us to a line from Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s state-of-the-state speech: \u201c[D]uring my administration, funding for education has increased by over $930M.\u201d\n\nBut James Salzer, the AJC\u2019s budget master, says Jester might run into trouble if she uses that line in certain parts of Georgia.\n\nNo legislative leader would agree with her statement, Salzer told us. The biggest complaint from school groups are the \u201causterity cuts\u201d that began during the 2000s.\n\nEssentially, governors and lawmakers couldn\u2019t fully fund the formula used to determine how much schools get for each pupil. It depends who you talk to, but schools estimate they have been shorted somewhere in the neighborhood of $6 billion over the past decade.\n\nFor years the \u201causterity cuts\u201d have been listed in budget documents.\n\n***\n\nThe U.S. House easily passed a bill Wednesday to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year, to the tune of about $1.1 trillion.\n\nIn the Georgia delegation, the vote breakdown was similar to December\u2019s bipartisan budget deal: The Democrats were all in favor, while the three Republicans running for Senate gave it a thumbs-down. (This was despite Jack Kingston\u2019s status as a top appropriator who inserted a big get for the Savannah Port project into the bill.)\n\nOne lawmaker who moved was Rep. Austin Scott, a Tifton Republican: He voted for the budget deal but against the spending bill that filled in the details.\n\nScott, via a spokeswoman, informed us that his objection to the spending bill had to do with process. It was written in secret and published Monday night before being whisked to the floor, sans amendments, for a rapid vote. Said Scott:\n\n\u201cWhile the overall budget agreement is a step in the right direction, my primary goal is to get back to an open appropriations process to allow for amendments and proper debate.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOn the Democratic side of the U.S. Senate race, Michelle Nunn\u2019s five campaign vows caught the notice of the GOP\u2019s Washington apparatus.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Campaign sent along a detailed research note illustrating alleged contradictions in her pledges. For example, Nunn vows to \u201cEnd Secret, Unlimited Special Interest Spending in Elections,\u201d but the NRSC points out that the president\u2019s Organizing For Action is backing Nunn. OFA is organized as a nonprofit that does not have to disclose its donors, but it has done so voluntarily.\n\nSome of the objections are a bit of a stretch, such as pooh-poohing Nunn\u2019s pledge to meet with all 99 fellow senators because she accepted campaign donations from Senate Democratic leaders Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer, who are not known for being warm and fuzzy to Republicans.\n\nThe GOP opposition research group America Rising also jumped in on the action, pointing out that Nunn pledged to forever ban members of Congress from becoming lobbyists (they currently have to wait a year after leaving office), even as her campaign donors include members-turned-lobbyists James Symington, Michael Andrews, Vic Fazio and Georgia\u2019s own Buddy Darden.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/01/16/gov-nathan-deal-in-talks-with-grady-hospital/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/011614_leg_budget_bs10.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "The $20.8 billion budget that Gov.
