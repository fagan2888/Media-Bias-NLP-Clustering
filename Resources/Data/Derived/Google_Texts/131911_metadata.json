Burcham and co-signed by board Chairwoman Kathleen Aikenhead to faculty and staff.\n\n\u201cNo LMU dollars will be spent paying for the additional coverage,\u201d Burcham and Aikenhead wrote in the letter. The University Comprehensive Benefits Committee will review the decision and make benefit recommendations for 2015 and beyond.\n\nThe plan managed by the third party will be chosen soon. A \u201cslightly higher premium\u201d is expected for faculty and staff, the letter stated.\n\nOne professor on the Westchester campus said the compromise probably guarantees ongoing debate over the issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it makes much sense,\u201d said Christopher Kaczor, a Loyola philosophy professor. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying abortion is seriously wrong, I will not drive you to the abortion clinic, but wait here and I\u2019ll have my brother drive you \u2014 and that somehow gives them clean hands.\u201d\n\nThe decision, he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t really work. ... It\u2019s a victory for the side that wants LMU to be a secular place.\u201d\n\nEqually dissatisfied on the other side of the debate was associate professor of sociology Anna Muraco, who has written about the issue and said the matter of equity in the workplace has been pushed aside in the debate.\n\n\u201cI work at a Jesuit institution and I understand that,\u201d she said, adding that the trustees\u2019 statement and the debate has dismissed the university\u2019s stated goal of \u201cwanting to educate the whole person,\u201d with an emphasis on social justice.\n\nRemoving elective abortions from health care plans, she said, \u201csingles out health coverage that only affects one class of worker.\u201d She also questioned whether the alternative plan premiums would be too high for lower-paid employees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re missing some of the larger issues that are at stake here \u2014 issues like equity\u201d and diversity, she said. Abortion, she said, \u201cis legal and safe. There\u2019s something disingenuous by the way this (issue) has been framed. ... They claim to be an institution that respects diversity and religious plurality and we did not have to sign any kind of faith statement like other (Catholic) schools have.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMuraco was raised and educated in the Roman Catholic Church but has since left due to differences over issues such as reproductive rights and gay marriage.\n\nShe said the discussion at LMU \u201cpresupposes that Catholicism has one viewpoint about abortion or health care.\u201d\n\nWhile Catholic laity may represent a variety of opinions on abortion, however, church leadership has long led the way in the anti-abortion movement, with Pope Francis, a Jesuit, among the long line of leaders speaking out against the practice.\n\nKaczor cited a 10-year-old Jesuit statement titled \u201cStanding for the Unborn: A Statement of the Society of Jesus in the United States on Abortion,\u201d in which the order reiterated the church teaching on efforts to \u201cprotect life in the womb\u201d and bring an end to abortion.\n\nWhile the university had asked before whether elective abortion coverage could be dropped, it wasn\u2019t until this summer that health providers told Loyola Marymount that dropping that coverage would be an option.\n\nThat set off a whirlwind of debate among faculty and students alike at the Jesuit school that employs a growing number of non-Catholic faculty and staff.\n\nOpponents to dropping the elective abortion coverage asserted that it sent a chilling message of exclusion.\n\nKaczor argued that the university community was \u201cfounded on a shared mission and identity as a Jesuit/Catholic university. An essential part of this Jesuit/Catholic mission is the promotion of justice as understood in the Catholic tradition. ... If LMU were to freely choose to cover elective abortion in its insurance, it would be cooperating in evil and acting contrary to its own stated mission and identity.\u201d\n\nThe enactment of the nation\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as Obamacare \u2014 has triggered debate nationwide over the rights of religious institutions or employers to be exempt from plans that provide contraception and abortion coverage.\n\nAn accommodation provision has given some leeway to religious schools.\n\nIn the case of Loyola, the internal debate centered on issues of campus diversity versus the role of a Catholic university.\n\n\u201cWhen we learned that (the university) had, for the first time, been given the option to exclude elective abortions from its principal health insurance plans, we decided that the governing board ... should address this difficult issue,\u201d the letter from the trustees read.\n\n\u201cThe board decided that (the university\u2019s) principal insurance plans for 2014 will not provide coverage for elective abortions,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cAll other aspects of reproductive health coverage will remain the same. We will continue to cover therapeutic abortions, contraception and other forms of reproductive care mandated by the state of California.\u201d\n\nThe alternative plan, the letter said, \u201cwill cover elective abortions for which an employee will pay a slightly higher premium. The employee will be responsible for the entirety of the cost associated with this additional coverage. ...\u201d\n\nPhillip Zampiello, an alumnus who is part of a group called Renew LMU that was formed to \u201cprotect, foster, and preserve the Catholic identity\u201d of the school, said the group concurs with a statement from LMU\u2019s vice president for mission and ministry, Father Robert Caro: \u201cExclusion of abortion from our medical benefits does not infringe freedom of conscience, civil rights or anyone\u2019s decision to have an abortion. It does mean that university funds would not be used to pay for elective abortions. It is the position which LMU\u2019s institutional commitment to Roman Catholicism urges us to respect.\u201d\n\nMuraco said while the compromise will satisfy some on her side, she doesn\u2019t \u201cshare their enthusiasm.\u201d The decision, she said, should be viewed as part of a larger effort to chip away at access to reproductive health care.\n\n\u201cThis is not the end; unfortunately, it\u2019s going to be an ongoing process,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if somewhere down the line there will be an attempt to restrict sterilization coverage or limits on services for transgendered Americans or domestic partner benefits.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After weeks of campus-wide debate, trustees at Loyola Marymount University voted late Monday to end university-paid insurance coverage for elective abortions for faculty and staff in 2014.But in a concession th", "title": "Loyola Marymount navigates campus divide on providing abortion medical coverage", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/social-affairs/20131007/loyola-marymount-navigates-campus-divide-on-providing-abortion-medical-coverage", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.dailybreeze.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailybreeze_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Loyola Marymount navigates campus divide on providing abortion medical coverage"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybreeze.com", "description": "After weeks of campus-wide debate, trustees at Loyola Marymount University voted late Monday to end university-paid insurance coverage for elective abortions for faculty and staff in 2014.But in a concession th", "title": "Loyola Marymount navigates campus divide on providing abortion medical coverage", "url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/social-affairs/20131007/loyola-marymount-navigates-campus-divide-on-providing-abortion-medical-coverage", "image": {"src": "http://local.dailybreeze.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/dailybreeze.png?052016"}, "site": "@DailyBreezeNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551753330", "iphone": "id503015160", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.torrancedailybreeze"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Higher education, Higher education news, Torrance Higher education news, CA Higher education news, US Higher education news, world Higher education news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Higher education, Higher education news, Torrance Higher education news, CA Higher education news, US Higher education news, world Higher education news."}, "article_summary": "Opponents to dropping the elective abortion coverage asserted that it sent a chilling message of exclusion.\nIn the case of Loyola, the internal debate centered on issues of campus diversity versus the role of a Catholic university.\nWhile the university had asked before whether elective abortion coverage could be dropped, it wasn\u2019t until this summer that health providers told Loyola Marymount that dropping that coverage would be an option.\n\u201cThe board decided that (the university\u2019s) principal insurance plans for 2014 will not provide coverage for elective abortions,\u201d the letter continued.\nAfter weeks of campus-wide debate, trustees at Loyola Marymount University voted late Monday to end university-paid insurance coverage for elective abortions for faculty and staff in 2014."}
