The Obama administration’s new regulation aimed at curbing conflicts of interest in the retirement advice sector “sounds a lot like Obamacare,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday.

“Like Obamacare, it threatens to upend an entire industry, threatens to increase cost and decrease access, and threatens to hurt the very people it’s aimed at helping,” McConnell (R-Ky.) said on the Senate floor. “This regulation could have the effect of discouraging investment advisers from taking on clients with smaller accounts.”

The administration releases the final rule today.

While McConnell noted that the final version contains changes from the proposed one, he said “the fundamentals are likely to remain the same.”

Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has indicated that the House will take action to pre-empt the fiduciary rule as soon as it’s released. McConnell did not hint at legislative action in the Senate.

“America’s middle class deserves responsible solutions, not far-reaching regulations that could jeopardize the retirement security of the very people it purports to help,” McConnell said.
