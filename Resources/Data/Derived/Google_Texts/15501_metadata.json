Congress adjourned in December without passing a farm bill, leading some farmers to wonder when payments they are accustomed to might come.\n\nThe temporary extension of the previous year\u2019s farm bill expired in September, though Congress did pass a temporary extension of the current bill before adjourning for the holidays. That expires Jan. 31, meaning Congress will have to pass either a new farm bill or an extension in the next three weeks.\n\nThe farm bill costs about $500 billion annually, with roughly the majority of that going to food stamps. The Republican-controlled House passed a version of the farm bill that cut $4 billion from food stamps, while the Democratic-controlled Senate\u2019s version cut $400 million.\n\nTim Fulton, of Rossville, owns an 80-acre farm in Jackson County where he grows corn, soybeans and hay. He said he receives between $300 and $500 in direct payments, commonly called subsidies, in most years. He said not having a farm bill could delay those payments, but it won\u2019t have a large impact on his business.\n\n\u201cIt helps pay the taxes on the place,\u201d he said.\n\nLawmakers have discussed ending direct subsidies and replacing them with payments based on crop prices and revenue. Some agricultural industry groups have opposed the changes, however, so it isn\u2019t certain that they will be part of the final bill.\n\nBrad Tollefson, of Silver Lake, farms on two patches in Leavenworth County and one in Shawnee County. He said he doesn\u2019t take subsidies, but the farm bill\u2019s conservation programs have helped him in the past. He used that money to do some water quality improvement projects, he said.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for somebody who\u2019s in the middle of a project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to get paid.\u201d\n\nStill, Tollefson said he doesn\u2019t mind waiting for the farm bill if it means cutting government spending overall.\n\nTed Birtell, who has a farm in Osage County, said he isn\u2019t directly affected by the lack of a farm bill, but he believes one needs to pass soon. Birtell said he is retired, but rents his land to farmers who get crop subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe need some kind of a farm bill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like we\u2019re headed for lower grain prices.\u201d\n\nAmanda Whitehurst, executive director of the U.S. Farm Service Agency office serving Jefferson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte counties, was one of the FSA representatives taking a turn manning a booth at the Topeka Farm Show on Thursday. She said farmers still need to report how many acres they are planting of different crops by Jan. 15 to avoid extra fees. The acreage reports are used for programs like crop insurance, which has continued despite the lack of a bill, and direct payments.\n\nJennifer Snyder, farm program technician for the same FSA office, said farmers usually have received payments on June 1, but the program is \u201cin limbo\u201d until a farm bill passes. It isn\u2019t clear if payments could be pushed back because of the delay in passing a bill.\n\n\u201cIf the deadline is the same, we\u2019re going to be doing nine months of work in four or five months,\u201d she said.\n\nTodd Domer, vice president of communications for the Kansas Livestock Association, said his members are concerned about less commonly discussed parts of the bill. One of the most important parts in the farm bill for livestock farmers is an often-overlooked provision to require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to change its rules on how meat is labeled after the World Trade Organization ruled the U.S. plans violated its rules, he said.\n\nUSDA had set up rules to require meat be labeled with where the animal was born, raised and slaughtered, Domer said, and Canada and Mexico threatened to retaliate against U.S. beef imports.\n\n\u201cThose are two of our three largest U.S. beef customers,\u201d he said.\n\nDomer said changing the rules to require only one country to be listed is a start, but the Kansas livestock farmers would rather that labeling be voluntary. The program hasn\u2019t been cost-effective for producers because American and Canadian cattle can\u2019t be slaughtered together and the cattle have to be tracked, but customers aren\u2019t willing to pay more for U.S. beef, he said.\n\n\u201cPackers have to segregate, and some of them have decided they will not process Canadian cattle because the segregation is too costly, too cumbersome,\u201d he said.\n\nOther important provisions would retroactively compensate farmers for livestock lost in disasters since the program expired in 2012 and would reinstate cost-sharing programs to help farmers comply with environmental regulations, Domer said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, News, Local, State, Megan Hart, Local business", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Farming is always an uncertain business: Temperatures and commodity fluctuate wildly, potentially turning a good year into a marginal one. \nAnd this year, uncertainty extends to the political arena.", "title": "Kansas farmers share concerns about lack of farm bill", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/business/2014-01-11/kansas-farmers-share-concerns-about-lack-farm-bill", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/12979478.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Farming is always an uncertain business: Temperatures and commodity fluctuate wildly, potentially turning a good year into a marginal one.And this year, uncertainty extends to the political arena.
