But, like all raisin growers in the United States, he is used to having part of his crop taken from him.\n\nSince 1949, the government has been taking its share of their harvests under a Department of Agriculture protectionist order - Marketing Order 989 \u2013 originally designed to keep prices high and growers in business.\n\n\u201cIt began as 25 percent and then it went to 35 percent and then the year in question, they told us, we're going to take 47% of your crop. I said you\u2019re not taking any of it,\u201d Horne told me as we trod softly through the avenues of sugary sweet Thompson grapes, waiting to be trimmed by seasonal Hispanic harvesters.\n\nReserves for agricultural products had existed before World War II. Today, apart from diamonds and oil, no other commodity is required to be placed in special stockpiles.\n\nIn a business where margins can be as thin as the vines the grapes grow on, Horne described it as \u201chighway robbery and government thievery,\u201d claiming it goes against the Fifth Amendment which says private property cannot be taken for public use without just compensation.\n\nHis 11-year-long refusal to contribute became a case that reached the Supreme Court this spring. During arguments, Justice Elena Kagan said the case should be returned to California\u2019s Ninth Circuit court \u2013 which had earlier ruled against Horne \u2013 to \"figure out whether this marketing order is a taking or it\u2019s just the world\u2019s most outdated law.\u201d\n\nThe Fresno-based Raisin Administrative Committee, established by the Department of Agriculture to run the reserve \u2013 what it refers to as volume regulation \u2013 declined to comment on Horne\u2019s pending case against the government.\n\nBut when asked in an interview with Fox News why in an era of free markets such a protectionist measure like volume regulation for raisins continues to exist, the RAC\u2019s president Gary Schultz said that the reserve hasn\u2019t been needed since 2009. He added that $200 million had been reimbursed to growers since 1997. The last payout was five years ago when around 3,000 growers shared $10 million.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s smart for the committee to have volume regulation as an option,\u201d Shultz said. \u201cAfter long deliberation and a lot of hearings and testimony, we\u2019ve chosen not to eliminate it because we\u2019ve needed to use it on many occasions since 1949 [\u2026] Now, fortunately, global supply and demand has taken us away from that day and we\u2019re hoping that that continues for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nThat does not explain why raisins are an exception to other crops whose government-appointed reserves had long since been retired.\n\nShultz said that the reserve would be a useful tool if surplus volumes of raisins returned. While there is zero tonnage in the reserve, as of this July Fresno packers are currently holding a \u201ccarry over\u201d of 132,400 tons from last year\u2019s crop.\n\nShultz added that he believed this is the \u201cbeginning of the hay day in raisins, at least in recent history\u201d for growers.\n\nBack on his vineyard, 68-year-old Horne contends that thousands of producers have been forced out of business or driven to farm other crops because of Marketing Order 989.\n\n\u201cIt has decimated our industry,\u201d he said \u201cWe're down to less than 2,000 growers [from 6,000 at their peak]. We've lost almost 180,000 acres of grapes that's been pulled out.\u201d\n\nHe owes the government over a million pounds in raisins and $1.2 million in fines and legal fees.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit is expected to rule on the order by November. If it gets overturned, it is likely to open the floodgates to compensation claims by raisin growers against the Department of Agriculture.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Power Play", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:15:43 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Marvin Horne had been praying for what drought-struck central California\u2019s famous farmlands need little of -- a good dry spell.", "twitter": {"description": "Marvin Horne had been praying for what drought-struck central California\u2019s famous farmlands need little of -- a good dry spell.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/07/california-raisin-grower-battles-federal-order-taking-almost-half-his-crop.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/090613/0/0/090613_fxr_raisin_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "California raisin grower battles federal order taking almost half his crop", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Power Play\"],\"author\":\"Dominic Di-Natale\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"California raisin grower battles federal order taking almost half his crop\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/090613/0/0/090613_fxr_raisin_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-08T00:31:27Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/07/california-raisin-grower-battles-federal-order-taking-almost-half-his-crop.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"8c47ae37-dd24-406f-92ac-dec5c6389464\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Marvin Horne had been praying for what drought-struck central California\u2019s famous farmlands need little of -- a good dry spell.", "dc.identifier": "8c47ae37-dd24-406f-92ac-dec5c6389464", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/COLUMNS/Power Play\"],\"author\":\"Dominic Di-Natale\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"California raisin grower battles federal order taking almost half his crop\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/090613/0/0/090613_fxr_raisin_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-08T00:31:27Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/07/california-raisin-grower-battles-federal-order-taking-almost-half-his-crop.html\",\"post_id\":\"8c47ae37-dd24-406f-92ac-dec5c6389464\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "classification-isa": "powerplay", "description": "Marvin Horne had been praying for what drought-struck central California\u2019s famous farmlands need little of -- a good dry spell.", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "California Raisin Grower Battles Federal Order Taking Almost Half His Crop", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-02 01:15:43 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Marvin Horne had been praying for what drought-struck central California\u2019s famous farmlands need little of -- a good dry spell.", "title": "California raisin grower battles federal order taking almost half his crop | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/09/07/california-raisin-grower-battles-federal-order-taking-almost-half-his-crop.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/090613/0/0/090613_fxr_raisin_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-09-07", "column": "power-play", "dc.creator": "Dominic Di-Natale"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2868\"", "article_summary": "But, like all raisin growers in the United States, he is used to having part of his crop taken from him.\nIf it gets overturned, it is likely to open the floodgates to compensation claims by raisin growers against the Department of Agriculture.\nAs raisin grapes produce only a single crop per season, Horne could lose a hefty slice of his harvest.\nSince 1949, the government has been taking its share of their harvests under a Department of Agriculture protectionist order - Marketing Order 989 \u2013 originally designed to keep prices high and growers in business.\nMarvin Horne had been praying for what drought-struck central California\u2019s famous farmlands need little of -- a good dry spell."}
