(WTNH)–A blood test with the potential to find cancer. Researchers are now testing a new way of doing biopsies.

It’s called the liquid biopsy. Right now it’s showing promise in detecting cancer DNA in a patient’s blood.

In a traditional biopsy, a surgeon cuts out a piece of a patient’s tumor, which can be invasive.

The hope is that the simple blood test can be as effective in screening for cancer. It could enable doctors to quickly determine if treatment is working and if it is, to continue monitoring in case the cancer develops resistance.

Dr. Jose Baselga, physician-in-chief medical officer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said, “This could change forever the way we follow up not only response to treatments but also the emergence of resistance, and down the line could even be used for really early diagnosis.”

While early results are encouraging, researchers say the blood test needs to to be studied further. So far, there have only been small studies on certain cancers, including lung, colon and blood cancer.
