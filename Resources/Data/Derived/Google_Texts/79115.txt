Timothy Jones said walking a mile in his shoes would cover lots of terrain.

The Navy veteran and University of West Florida student said his life's path had some bumps in the road, including at one point being without a home and feeling broken.

"It was ten years in the wilderness as I say. Really, not being able to get a handle on my own mental health concerns, and not really having a home. I felt discarded," Jones said. "It was a true battle between myself, and discovering that self love, and that love of community that led me to today."

After landing back on his feet, Jones teamed up with filmmaker Trent Soto to spread awareness of the Mayor's Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness by walking more than 200 miles from Pensacola to Tallahassee.

Their pit-stop Saturday included a visit to the Good Samaritan Veterans Network of Northwest Florida.

After working at the Panama City Rescue Mission, network president Billy Fox said he saw veterans go down the same path Jones had once encountered.

"1 in 3 of the men at the mission were military veterans, and most of them were post-9/11," Fox said. "They're young guys like Tim, who's going out and telling the story, and they are not like a regular homeless person. They were in good shape when they went into the military. Now they're broken, and they need some special attention."

But after finding his step, Jones says he and Soto want to give veterans hope by going the distance to help them get back on the right track.

"I didn't think I would be here today to even talk about this initiative," Jones said. "This is not about one person or two people. This is about 5,100 just in the state of Florida that are homeless. And the fact that they have a voice."

Jones said they hope to reach Tallahassee as early as Monday.

As for Fox, he said the Good Samaritan Veterans Network of Northwest Florida accepts both monetary and other donations.
