Keith Emerson shot himself in the head in what’s likely now a suicide investigation. The keyboardist and founder of Emerson, Lake & Palmer was found dead by his girlfriend on Thursday night in the couple’s Santa Monica, California house with a single bullet shot to the head.

The piano player had been depressed as a result of a nerve problem that affected his right hand and severely impaired his ability to play the keyboard. Still, he was slated to perform next week in Japan.

Emerson, Lake & Palmer received its first and only Grammy nomination in 1972 for Best New Artist. They lost to Carly Simon. The progressive rock band was best known for its hits, “Nut Rocker,” “Fanfare for the Common Man,” “Lucky Man,” “Tarkus,” and “Karn Evil 9.″

On their official Facebook site, the band wrote, “We regret to announce that Keith Emerson died last night at his home in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, aged 71. We ask that the family’s privacy and grief be respected.” Band member Carl Palmer stated on his personal page, “I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my good friend and brother-in-music, Keith Emerson.”

Palmer went on to call his bandmate “a gentle soul whose love for music and passion for his performance as a keyboard player will remain unmatched for many years to come. He was a pioneer and an innovator whose musical genius touched all of us in the worlds of rock, classical and jazz. I will always remember his warm smile, good sense of humor, compelling showmanship, and dedication to his musical craft. I am very lucky to have known him and to have made the music we did, together.” Gossip Cop has reached out to the band’s management regarding the situation, but we have yet to hear back.
