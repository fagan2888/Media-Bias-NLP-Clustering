Two men are at a local hospital after a 75 foot fall.

It happened near Academy and Woodmen next to Cottonwood Creek.

It's still unclear how the fall happened but the men were on a steep cliff and fell into the creek.

A witness saw it all happen and called police.

Firefighters say both men have serious injuries from the fall.

A new trail was added in the area recently and rescue crews tell 11 News this isnâ€™t the first time this has happened.

Firefighters want to remind people in the area to use caution when they are near the creek.
