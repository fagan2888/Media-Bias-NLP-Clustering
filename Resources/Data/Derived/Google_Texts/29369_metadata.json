Lindsey Graham (S.C.) spoke for many Republicans when he grudgingly conceded that the GOP has only one option left to stop the billionaire: Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is not my favorite by any means, and I don\u2019t wish him ill\u2014I was making a joke about Ted\u2014but we may be in a position where we have to rally around Ted Cruz as the only way to stop Donald Trump, and I\u2019m not so sure that would work,\u201d Graham, who dropped his own bid for the White House in December, told CBS on Tuesday night.\n\nRelated: Unstoppable? The GOP Has 13 Days to Keep Trump from Hijacking the Nomination\n\nIt was quite the change of heart from last week when Graham, speaking at an event in Washington, joked: \u201cIf you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you,\u201d reference to the chamber\u2019s widespread dislike of the Texas lawmaker.\n\nBut Graham and others should think twice before tapping Cruz as their savior and the de facto GOP standard-bearer against Trump.\n\nCruz had staked much of his candidacy on winning Super Tuesday and the so-called \u201cSEC Primary\u201d of Southern states, where evangelicals were supposed to catapult him ahead of Trump. That theory held after Cruz\u2019s victory in the Iowa caucuses, where he bested Trump among the key group, 34 to 22 percent.\n\nRelated: Cruz\u2019s Economic Plan Would Add Trillions to the Debt\n\nBut somewhere in the weeks between contests, anger about Washington began to outweigh Bible Belt beliefs, and Cruz finished behind Trump among evangelicals in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee, according to data from last night. The only primaries where he came in first with evangelicals was in Texas, his home state, and Oklahoma, which shares a border with the Lone Star state.\n\nDespite another win in far-off Alaska on Tuesday, the data indicate that while Cruz does well in his own region, that doesn\u2019t make him a religious crusader capable of stopping Trump.\n\nThe calendar isn\u2019t about to do him any favors, either.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s What Happens in a Clinton vs. Trump Matchup\n\nOn Mar. 5, Republicans will caucus in Kansas, Kentucky and Maine and hold a primary in Louisiana.\n\nA survey released last week in Kansas showed Trump beating Cruz, 26 to 14 percent. The same goes for Kentucky, where likely caucus-goers support Trump 35 to 15 percent over Cruz. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who won Minnesota on Tuesday night, received 22 percent.\n\nBen Carson leads Trump in Louisiana, according to the few public opinion polls conducted in state, but the data is dated, coming well before the retired neurosurgeon became irrelevant to the presidential race.\n\nMaine has also received scant attention, but surveys conducted last year had Trump at least 10 points ahead of his nearest rivals, and that was before the state\u2019s controversial governor, Paul LePage, backed the real estate mogul and before he notched his biggest margin of victory Tuesday night in nearby Massachusetts.\n\nPoor showings for Cruz this weekend could have a butterfly effect and hurt his standing in Puerto Rico on Mar. 6 and on Mar. 8 when voters turn out in Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan and Mississippi.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On the same night Donald Trump racked up wins across the country, Sen.", "title": "Can Cruz Save the GOP From Trump?
