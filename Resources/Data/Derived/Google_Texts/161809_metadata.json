When it's finished, Solberg Avenue will go from two lanes to four north of 57th Street and a giant storm sewer detention pond on the southwest side of the Empire Mall will have a bigger capacity.\n\n\"I like it. I'm glad it's being increased in size. Very happy,\" Marlin Westra said.\n\nWestra has managed the South Hampton apartments nearby for 13 years. He's seen flooding in the area twice during that time.\n\nSioux Falls Principal Engineer Joshua Peterson says these new improvements should fix the issue. Originally, the pond could hold enough runoff to flood 61 football fields in one foot of water.\n\n\"We're going to add about 10 more feet to that. So it would be about 71 football fields a foot deep or one football field 71 feet deep,\" Peterson said.\n\nOn top of the pond, the new four-lane road will feature a new traffic light at 49th and Solberg, next to the mall.\n\n\"I have waited many minutes to get onto 49th,\" Westra said.\n\nWith a new light and more lanes, Solberg Avenue should become a main corridor on the west side of town.\n\n\"It will really help that traffic and maybe take some of that pressure off of Louise which is a very busy street for us,\" Peterson said.\n\nThe $3.5-million project should finish in October.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
