Nathan Deal trumpeted the news that Site Selection magazine had named Georgia the top place to do business and the most competitive state in the nation in 2013. But the Atlanta-based publication on Tuesday named North Carolina the nation\u2019s most competitive state for the year 2014.\n\nNorth Carolina earned 409 points in the state\u2019s 10-part index, beating out Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nAnd Georgia\u2019s rank? Tenth. Dare we ask what Georgia did \u2014 or didn\u2019t do \u2014 to earn such a steep drop in a single year? Or should we simply say, \u201cWait til 2018\u201d?\n\n***\n\nLet\u2019s go presidential this morning. In Iowa, we\u2019ve got a good sign that New Hampshire may have to serve as the spot where former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will have to look for initial traction. From the press release:\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is the top dog with a big early lead in the Iowa Republican Caucus, with a four-way scramble for second place and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in seventh place with 5 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today.\n\nWalker is at 21 percent of likely GOP caucus participants, compared to 25 percent in a February 25 poll by the independent Quinnipiac University. In the scramble for second place are U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida with 13 percent each, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas with 12 percent and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 11 percent. Physician Ben Carson has 7 percent, with 5 percent for Bush. No other candidate is above 3 percent and 6 percent are undecided. Bush tops the list at 25 percent, followed by New Jersey Gov. Christopher Christie with 20 percent, when likely Republican Caucus participants are asked if there is any candidate they would definitely not support.\u201d Paul is next on this negative list with 10 percent.\n\n***\n\nOn the Democratic side, Politico.com reports that U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren met privately late last month with supporters eager to see her jump into the presidential contest. And then we have Democrat Hillary Clinton making a break with her 2008 bid for the White House. From the Washington Post:\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Staking a strongly liberal position on the divisive issue of immigration, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that she wants to ensure that illegal immigrants can gain full citizenship under a reform of the patchwork system and the limited protections President Obama has put in place in the meantime. Republicans want to make sure immigrants can never be more than \u201csecond-class\u201d Americans, the Democratic presidential candidate said in sharply partisan remarks that could shake up the presidential contest by pushing immigration to the fore. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship,\u201d Clinton said in her most direct overture yet to Hispanic voters, who helped form Obama\u2019s winning coalition.\n\n***\n\nCloser to home, Attorney General Sam Olens, in a speech to the United Tea Party of Georgia, identified the U.S. Supreme Court as the issue that should rally Republicans in 2016. From the Forsyth County News:\n\n\u201cTo those of you that tell me next September, \u2018I really wanted blank to win, but the Republican nominee is Y.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to hear it,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the question\u2019s simply do you want Hillary to choose the next justices, which there will be several of, or do you want someone else choosing the next justices?\u201d\n\nIn light of a looming decision on gay marriage now before the high court, Olens may have a point.\n\n***\n\nGov. Nathan Deal is set to sign a bill today that would regulate Uber and Lyft in Georgia and require drivers to maintain insurance coverage of up to $1 million.\n\nFew issues generated as much debate \u2013 and feedback from voters \u2013 as House Bill 225 did. But both ride-sharing firms ultimately signed onto the plan after changes that allowed the firms to conduct their own background checks rather than require all drivers to be fingerprinted.\n\nIt could have turned out very differently.\n\nUber quit Kansas this week after lawmakers there approved legislation that requires state background checks for its drivers and mandates an increase in their insurance coverage. The company said in a blog post that the new bill \u201cmakes it impossible for Uber to operate in the state.\u201d\n\n***\n\nHouse Speaker David Ralston\u2019s office is pushing back against accusations that the race for the House\u2019s No. 3 job has taken a harsh turn.\n\nThis comes after your Insiders reported that the arm-twisting was ratcheting up in the contest between state Reps. Jon Burns, Allen Peake and Chuck Martin for a vacant House Majority Leader gig. Burns is seen as Ralston\u2019s choice in the first major leadership shake-up since he became speaker.\n\nSaid Kaleb McMichen, Ralston\u2019s press secretary:\n\n\u201cRumors and unsubstantiated allegations, although not helpful, are not uncommon in caucus elections. I am sure members are making calls to discuss their choice for this important position and that includes all members of House leadership. However, as the vote is taken by secret ballot, claims of \u2018arm twisting\u2019 lose credibility when you consider that every member\u2019s vote is private.\u201d\n\n***\n\nGov. Nathan Deal is protesting a new proposed U.S. Department of Energy efficiency regulation on residential furnaces. Deal wrote to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz in a letter dated April 30:\n\n\u201cThe proposed standard would mandate the use of condensing furnaces nationwide and create hardship for Georgia\u2019s consumers. The cost of the mandated furnace itself would be $300-$700 greater than non-condensing models and will likely increase the cost of installation by $2,000-$3,000 in many older homes. I am concerned that these additional expenses would hit average- and low-income households especially hard and would disproportionately impact multi-family housing units in our state. \u201cI am also troubled by the fact that an analysis of the standard shows that energy usage and emissions would increase under the proposal. A study by the American Gas Association and the Gas Technology Institute indicates consumers may see an increase by as much as $44.9 million in energy costs per year and carbon dioxide emissions may increase by nearly 350,000 tons as a result of the standard.\u201d\n\nDOE has more background on the proposed rule here. We were alerted to Deal\u2019s letter by Washington lobby firm Bracewell and Giuliani, which has several energy clients working on the issue.\n\n***\n\nAt the tail end of an interview with U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Savannah, on Tuesday, we asked the new congressman how he was settling in. As it turns out, he is \u2013 like many of his colleagues, Democrat and Republican \u2013 living out of his office. Said Carter:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to do that for a long period of time, but it\u2019s not that bad. There are over 80 of us who live in our office and we got a members\u2019 gym \u2013 and it\u2019s got lockers and showers and washing machines and dryers. It\u2019s like living in a dorm. \u201cYou build up a lot of camaraderie, which at this point I need. I need to get to know these guys. In the morning, I\u2019m sometimes working out beside Paul Ryan and Joe Kennedy, and I\u2019m thinking \u2013 you know, this is pretty wild.\u201d\n\nPaul Ryan? Yeah, in any dorm situation, he\u2019d be the R.A.\n\n***\n\nU.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, got some Facebook love Tuesday from presidential hopeful Rand Paul.\n\nCollins introduced a resolution in the House to block the FCC\u2019s new \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulations, which require internet service providers to treat all content equally and not create \u201cfast lanes.\u201d Critics call it a government takeover of the Internet. Paul, the Kentucky senator, introduced a companion measure in his chamber and gave Collins the accompanying social media shout-out.\n\nIt was on Paul\u2019s official page, so not part of his presidential campaign. Collins has not endorsed anyone for president. At the very least it gets his name out there: Paul\u2019s page has 684,000 likes.\n\n***\n\nToronto\u2019s about to get an infusion of Atlanta\u2019s top business and political leaders.\n\nAbout 100 metro Atlanta powerbrokers are headed to Canada Wednesday for the Atlanta Regional Commission\u2019s annual LINK trip. The confab will soak in how Toronto handles issues like education, mass transit and planning.\n\nThe participants include House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, Metro Atlanta Chamber CEO Hala Moddelmog, Cobb County Chairman Tim Lee, Atlanta City Council President Ceaser Mitchell and Roswell Mayor Jere Wood.\n\n***\n\nTwelve-year-old C.J. Pearson, the Republican wunderkind from Augusta, has weighed in on the race for state GOP chairman. He\u2019s backing incumbent John Padgett. A portion:\n\nGeorgia\u2019s political landscape is quickly changing and it is imperative that the Georgia Republican Party react accordingly. In 2014, Governor Nathan Deal captured 10% of the African-American vote, largely due to the efforts of Chairman Padgett and his strong efforts to ensuring that minorities found a place in the party. Once again. where was Alex Johnson? We need a leader with experience, not just ideas. We need a leader with results. Chairman Padgett has results.\n\nYoung C.J. also appears to be willing to take on the likes of Erick Erickson, the WSB Radio provocateur who is backing Johnson. Says the youngster:\n\nUnlike some conservative political commentators, I\u2019m not so easily swayed by what one says but am more convinced by what one does.\n\nThis is where we mention to Erick that child abuse is always something best avoided.\n\n***\n\nOther than a healthy run of presidential candidates and a chairmanship race, the one thing virtually guaranteed at next week\u2019s state GOP convention in Athens is a debate over religious liberty legislation and gay marriage.\n\nBelow is the text of a resolution passed by the 12th District GOP convention last month. You\u2019ll see that it demands passage of S.B. 129, the Josh McKoon bill, without amendment \u2013 which pretty much requires Gov. Nathan Deal to address delegates on the issue. The governor has talked about adding anti-discrimination language.\n\nBut the amendment also runs afoul of Capitol politics. Ask any House Republican member whether that caucus should accept any Senate Republican legislation as perfect and incapable of improvement, and you\u2019re likely to get an unprintable reply.
