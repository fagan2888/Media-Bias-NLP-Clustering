Therein lies a looming crisis for Washington.\n\nMr. Ma has gone far to extend economic and cultural ties to the mainland, too far for many on the island. The delicate balance has been jarred by a widely circulated video of a Chinese military exercise, including an unmistakable depiction of an attack on Taiwan\u2019s presidential palace.\n\nPresident Obama has the responsibility for implementing the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which prevented President Jimmy Carter abandoning Taiwan, and requires a continued working arrangement between the United States and Taiwan for defending the island. House legislation in the last Congress extending arms sales to Taiwan was blocked in the Senate by Harry Reid, then the leader of a Democratic majority in the Senate.\n\nAlmost 15 years have passed since the United States added anything to the island republic\u2019s defense, whether selling Taiwan aircraft or particularly needed submarines. China, on the other hand, has been spending lavishly to expand its military. The Taiwan legislature has been reluctant to spend money and the United States has been reluctant to authorize the sale of more arms, in keeping with the Obama strategy of slighting friends and courting enemies. No one in Washington wanted to disturb what the analysts imagine is a sleeping dog.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping already has a lot to deal with, not only with opponents in his party, but with resistance in remote areas of the vast country. Armed resistance to Beijing rule is bubbling among Turkic minorities in westernmost Singkiang, and frequent self-immolation by dissidents continues after Beijing cut off negotiations with the Dalai Lama for Tibetan autonomy.\n\nWith a half million Taiwanese operating factories on the Mainland, Beijing has used economic incentives to press for a political settlement. But President Ma\u2019s efforts \u2014 given the island\u2019s lackluster economy in a worldwide slowdown \u2014 have set off a backlash.\n\nMr. Ma\u2019s Nationalist Party is sagging in the polls and appears headed for a defeat in the presidential election in January. The Democratic Progressive Party, which once called for formal recognition of Taiwan independence, is expected to win handily. The party\u2019s following has grown with the Sunflower student movement, whose leaders take cues from what\u2019s happening in Hong Kong, where the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d solution promised with the British departure is routinely subverted by pressure from Beijing.\n\nBeijing\u2019s aggressiveness in the South China Sea \u2014 building bases a thousand miles beyond its southern shores on coral reefs reclaimed from the ocean \u2014 has changed strategic considerations. Maintaining the de facto independence of Taiwan \u2014 the preference of most Taiwanese \u2014 has now become not only a moral and legal issue for Washington, but a strategic necessity. Communist control of the Taiwan ports would breach \u201cthe first island chain\u201d and strengthen Beijing\u2019s threat to freedom of navigation, coming as President Obama shrinks the U.S. Navy. Japan, increasingly sensitive to threats by both China and North Korea, consider a neutral Taiwan essential to defense of Japan.
