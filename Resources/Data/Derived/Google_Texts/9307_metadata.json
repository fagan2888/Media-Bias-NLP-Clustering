Due to the obstruction of politicians like those running the show in North Carolina, millions of people who could be insured at federal government expense must instead do without. The scandalous result: thousands of preventable deaths each year.\n\nAs Alex Zielinski at Think Progress explains, however, there are some new and encouraging signs that cracks in the obstructionist wall are starting to show:\n\nRed States Begin To See The Light On Medicaid Expansion\n\nConservative leaders may be warming up to Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion \u2014 a program that has been traditionally gridlocked in GOP-led states \u2014 in an emerging trend that could have a serious influence on the program\u2019s adoption in fellow red states. Recent state elections unveiled a majority of these changes.\n\nAt first, many voters in favor of Medicaid expansion feared the recent elections would worsen their chances. And with a new, staunchly anti-expansion governor elected in Kentucky and a unwavering Republican majority in the Virginia Senate, it\u2019s clear why. But these potential road blocks to further state expansions may be countered with other unexpected victories in other states.\n\nThe biggest surprise came out of the Louisiana election, where Democrat John Bel Edwards won the governor\u2019s race by a landslide this weekend. He\u2019ll fill the seat of current Governor Bobby Jindal, who has rejected the \u201csubpar\u201d Medicaid expansion program from its start. Edwards is a true Southern Democrat \u2014 he\u2019s openly against abortion and gun control \u2014 but stands firmly behind progressive health care and labor plans. He\u2019s already pledged to sign an executive order authorizing Medicaid expansion on his first day in office. This would provide immediate coverage to an additional 225,000 uninsured residents.\n\nMeanwhile, in Kentucky, Governor-elect Matt Bevin may be softening his opposition to this Obamacare provision. During his campaign, Bevin spoke firmly about his opposition to Medicaid expansion \u2014 which already exists in the conservative state. But now that the election\u2019s over, he\u2019s mentioned a scaled-back attack on the expansion program. Instead of cutting off the 400,000 people who benefit from the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, he may work with the feds to just adapt it to his liking. This will likely still shed some benefits of the current state program, but won\u2019t affect its users as harshly as predicted.\n\nKentucky\u2019s expected action \u2014 or inaction \u2014 may have inspired an unprecedented move toward expansion in a fellow red state, where no Democrat holds a political office: Alabama.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the plight of the working poor \u2026 If doctors are not paid for seeing those patients, doctors will not go to rural Alabama because you can\u2019t expect a doctor to go to rural Alabama and lose money,\u201d Gov. Robert Bentley told the Associated Press a week after Bevin\u2019s Kentucky victory.\n\nBentley, a former physician, said his administration is currently considering Medicaid expansion. If successful, Alabama could join Louisiana in influencing the usually Medicaid-resistant South to take a second look at the program. Around 300,000 people in Alabama, one of the nation\u2019s poorest states, would be eligible for coverage under an expansion.\n\nAt the moment, more than 3 million poor uninsured adults in the country fall into the \u201ccoverage gap,\u201d the income bracket that the optional Medicaid expansion covers \u2014 and 90 percent of that population lives in the South.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019ll fill the seat of current Governor Bobby Jindal, who has rejected the \u201csubpar\u201d Medicaid expansion program from its start.\nAt first, many voters in favor of Medicaid expansion feared the recent elections would worsen their chances.\nHe\u2019s already pledged to sign an executive order authorizing Medicaid expansion on his first day in office.\nDuring his campaign, Bevin spoke firmly about his opposition to Medicaid expansion \u2014 which already exists in the conservative state.\nInstead of cutting off the 400,000 people who benefit from the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, he may work with the feds to just adapt it to his liking."}
