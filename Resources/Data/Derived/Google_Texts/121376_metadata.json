It's Tuesday evening here in Washington. Sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite. Here's the latest.\n\nTHE BIG STORY\n\nThe Obama administration will consider evicting tens of thousands of public housing residents who earn too much money to qualify for government assistance.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced Tuesday an effort to root out these \"over-income\" tenants who are living in government-assisted homes that could be used to help even poorer families. http://bit.ly/1PxuwMe\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Some of those families significantly exceeded the income limits,\" HUD wrote in the Federal Register, warning that \"scarce public resources must be provided to those most in need of affordable housing.\"\n\nCurrently, federal law does not prohibit over-income families from continuing to live in government-assisted homes, as long as they met the income requirements when they moved in.\n\nHUD released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking Tuesday seeking public comment on what to do with over-income tenants.\n\nThis stems from a July 2015 inspector's general report that found as many as 25,226 over-income families are living in public housing facilities even though they are not eligible for government assistance.\n\nMany of these families were eligible when they moved in, but as their incomes have grown they no longer need the housing benefits, the agency noted.\n\nHUD is grappling with whether to evict the over-income tenants, and how long to give them to find new homes. The agency wants to make public housing units available to those families who are most in need, but it also urged caution against evicting tenants who enjoy a \"minimal or temporary rise in income.\"\n\n\"An increase in income is a good and welcomed event for families, and when a family's income steadily rises, it may be an indication that the family is on its way to self-sufficiency,\" HUD wrote.\n\n\"Any changes that would require the termination of tenancy for over-income families should be enacted with caution so as not to impede a family's progress,\" the agency continued.\n\nON TAP FOR WEDNESDAY\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to discuss the need for transparency and accountability in asbestos trust funds. http://1.usa.gov/1nZSXaQ\n\nThe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will hold a hearing to examine the Stream Protection Rule and the impact it has on the environment. http://1.usa.gov/1Pb6NxY\n\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hold a hearing to examine the federal administration of the Safe Drinking Water Act in Flint, Mich., following the water crisis there. http://1.usa.gov/1Ko8pHP\n\nThe House Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition will hold a hearing to review incentive programs, which aim to increase low-income families' ability to purchase fruits and vegetables. http://1.usa.gov/1Pxlter\n\nTOMORROW'S REGS TODAY\n\nThe Obama administration will publish 208 new regulations, proposed rules, notices and other administrative actions in Wednesday's edition of the Federal Register.\n\n--The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will consider new rules that would root out \"over-income\" tenants in government-assisted housing projects.\n\nHUD is concerned that tens of thousands of families living in public housing are not eligible for those government benefits, because they make too much money. They may have qualified originally, but as their income increased they failed to report it.\n\nThe advanced notice of proposed rulemaking comes in response to a report from HUD's inspector general that found 25,226 families are living in public housing even though they are ineligible.\n\n\"Some of those families significantly exceeded the income limits,\" the agency noted.\n\nThe public has 30 days to comment. http://bit.ly/1UHi24X\n\n--The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will propose new animal welfare regulations.\n\nThe USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will propose new procedures for handling dolphins in captivity.
