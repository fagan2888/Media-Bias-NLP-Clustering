They will do so by spending unheard of sums to buy elections with the happy assistance of big business and wealthy patrons for whom the joys of gross income inequality are a comfortable fact of life. By gerrymandering and denying the vote to as many of the poor, the elderly, struggling low-paid workers, and people of color as they can. And by appealing to the basest impulses of human nature: anger, fear and bigotry.\n\nTurn on your TV or computer, pick up a paper or magazine and you can see and hear them baying at the moon. Donald Trump is just the most outrageous and bigmouthed of the frothing wolf pack of deniers and truth benders. As our friend and colleague Tom Engelhardt of TomDispatch writes, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing, no matter how jingoistic or xenophobic, extreme or warlike that can\u2019t be expressed in public and with pride by a Republican presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nLike the pronouncement of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell\u2019s 1984, ignorance is strength, whether it\u2019s casting paranoid fantasies about thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheering 9/11, or warning about terrorists in refugees\u2019 ragged clothing and Mexican rapists slithering across the border.\n\nJust four-and-a-half years ago, Washington mainstays Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein shocked the inside-the-Beltway establishment (especially the press, with its silent pact to speak no evil of wrongdoers lest they deny you an interview) when they published their book, It\u2019s Even Worse than It Looks. The two esteemed political scientists wrote, \u201cThe Republican Party has become an insurgent outlier \u2013 ideologically extreme; contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime; scornful of compromise; unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\u201d\n\nIn the years since, an ugly situation has only gotten increasingly dire, with right-wing radicals whipped into a frenzy by a Republican establishment that thought it could use their rage, only to find it running amok and beyond their control. In a recent interview with Francis Wilkinson of Bloomberg View, Norman Ornstein said, \u201cThe future still looks pretty grim.\u201d And Thomas Mann noted, \u201cThe burden is on the GOP because they are currently the major source of our political dysfunction. No happy talk about bipartisanship can obscure that reality. Unless other voices and movements arise within the Republican Party to changes its character and course, our dysfunctional politics will continue.\u201d\n\nThe fever is pandemic not only among the party\u2019s presidential candidates but throughout the House and Senate right down to our state governments. Witness erstwhile GOP presidential candidate and current Wisconsin governor Scott Walker cutting off food stamps for the hungry and possibly bankrupting food pantries in his state just in time for Christmas \u2013 because many of those on the lowest rung of the ladder haven\u2019t yet found a job.\n\nAnd here\u2019s multimillionaire Bruce Rauner winning the governorship of Illinois after spending some $65 million \u2014 half of which came from himself and nine other individuals, families or the companies they control. Now he\u2019s calling once again on his wealthy friends and allies around the country who, The New York Times reports, \u201care rallying behind Mr. Rauner\u2019s agenda: to cut spending and overhaul the state\u2019s pension system, impose term limits and weaken public employee unions\u201d\u2013 even though a majority of ordinary citizens in Illinois are opposed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump is a symptom of a much larger disease.
