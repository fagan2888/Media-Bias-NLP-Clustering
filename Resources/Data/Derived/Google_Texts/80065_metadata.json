Dexter incorporated an express-up during a late pyramid, a move that helped propel the Tigers to their second regional title in three years on Saturday morning at the Cross Insurance Center in Bangor.\n\n\u201cIt was a very big difference-maker,\u201d said Dexter senior Sarah Ann Vigue. \u201cIt\u2019s a higher-level stunt, and you switch from one foot to the other in the air while you\u2019re throwing [the flyer] up.\n\n\u201cWe were so afraid it wasn\u2019t going to hit, and then once it hit, we were all so happy. We were cheering each other on the mat,\u201d she added.\n\nCoach Kacie Ladd\u2019s team scored 114 points to edge runner-up Bucksport by four-tenths of a point (113.6). Defending Class C state champion and 2015 Penobscot Valley Conference winner Central of Corinth finished third with 106.3 points followed by Orono (102.9), Houlton (101.3) and Mattanawcook Academy of Lincoln.\n\nAll six teams advance to state championship competition Feb. 7 at the Augusta Civic Center.\n\nRounding out the field were: 7. Narraguagus of Harrington 94.6, 8. Sumner of East Sullivan 86.6, 9. Washington Academy of East Machias 86.4, 10. Calais 84.6\n\nDexter had tied for second place at the Penobscot Valley Conference meet a week earlier, signalling to Ladd that her team was ready to make a run at the title.\n\n\u201cWe spent all week to clean up and just make things stronger,\u201d said the sixth-year Dexter coach. \u201cI definitely knew it was within reach, but it all depends on the day and how it goes.\u201d\n\nThe Tigers, which utilized 13 competitors, made an impression early with a high basket throw that was facilitated in part by their three male team members, Martin Ward, Dillon Austin and Emmitt Ross.\n\n\u201cOur opening basket is something that gets a reaction every time,\u201d Ladd said. \u201cIt gets pretty high, so we\u2019re proud of that.\u201d\n\nDexter appeared to execute its lifts with precision and demonstrated cohesiveness throughout. Even the Tigers\u2019 cheer element was done while showing off three simultaneous lifts.\n\n\u201cWe worked on all of our stunts, we came in confident, we came in ready, and we just decided we\u2019d come in here and show everybody what we\u2019re made of,\u201d said Ward, who is a senior.\n\nThe express-up, which was added Thursday, wasn\u2019t a major change for the Tigers, who had been nailing their stunts recently. And even though it came relatively late in Dexter\u2019s routine, it provided the cheerleaders with a big boost.\n\n\u201cGetting the energy from hitting that stunt and going into that last dance, it just gives you so much adrenaline,\u201d Vigue said.\n\nDexter\u2019s other team members are: seniors Shayna Fogg, Cayla Wyman and Shawna Moulton; sophomores Grace Belanger, Olivia Day, Autumn Nickerson, Kirsten Swimm and Jasmine Woodard; and freshman Lily Cummings. The mascots are seniors Jacob Leighton and Matthew Stanhope.\n\nBucksport took home the Class C runner-up plaque, following up on its second-place finish (tie with Dexter) at PVCs.\n\nCoach Sue Bennett said her team has concentrated on taking care of business on the mat.\n\n\u201cWe have been trying not to worry about what everybody else was doing, just focus on our own routine and make it as clean and as solid as we possibly can,\u201d she said. \u201cA sharp, clean routine goes a long way.\u201d\n\nGolden Bucks team members said the key to their success was sticking together and supporting each other.\n\n\u201cWe had encouraging, positive stuff in our routine, and we were working as a family,\u201d said senior co-captain Olyviah Burns.\n\nBucksport showed off a couple of nice tumbling passes, was strong in its lifts and displayed good energy and cohesiveness throughout.\n\n\u201cWe definitely felt like we had a really strong team this year and we had the potential, and we just had to work really hard,\u201d added senior co-captain Sarra Bridges.\n\nBucksport\u2019s other team members are seniors Sierra Cyr and Samantha Goode; junior Kim Davenport; sophomores Kylee Atwood, Isabella Cyr, Melanie Hall, Mariah Jerome, Lauren Stubbs and Arlena Tolmasoff; and freshmen Alyssa Bennett and Abby Morong.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BANGOR, Maine \u2014 Cheerleading teams spend countless hours developing and perfecting their routines for the opportunity to perform them only a few times in competition.
