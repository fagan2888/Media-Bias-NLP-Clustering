More than 154,000 New Yorkers have signed up for an insurance plan through the state's exchange during the first month of open enrollment, the health department said Friday.

The number is current through Thursday.

Of those,102,164 signed up for Medicaid and 52,398 enrolled in a private insurance plan. The roughly 2:1 ratio is in line with what New York saw during the first open enrollment season.

The state health department also said it was extending the deadline to enroll in a plan that would take effect by Jan. 1. The deadline had been Monday but state officials will now give New Yorkers until Dec. 20 to enroll because of the "extreme weather" that has impacted much of the state.

This is the first look at how New York is doing during the Affordable Care Act's second enrollment season.

Last year, the state received high marks for a relatively smooth-running website and for enrolling 370,000 in private insurance plans and another 600,000 in Medicaid.

This year, Donna Frescatore, the executive director of New York's exchange, the marketplace created by the A.C.A. on which insurance plans are sold, said she expects to enroll 350,000 more New Yorkers.

That's an ambitious goal.

New York State health officials, using projections from the Urban Institute, estimated that after three years, 615,000 New Yorkers will be enrolled in private plans purchased through the exchange.

If Frescatore is correct, the state would blow past that number sometime in the next two months.

The federal government, which is running the exchange for 37 states, reported that through Dec. 5, 1.4 million people have purchased a private insurance plan since the exchange opened Nov. 15.

Open enrollment season ends Feb. 15.
