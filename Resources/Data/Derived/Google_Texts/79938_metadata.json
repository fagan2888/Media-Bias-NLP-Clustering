But buried in the poll numbers was a figure that just might constitute an even more important turning point.\n\nRespondents were asked: \u201cOn balance, do you feel that Obama\u2019s presidency so far has been more of a success or more of a failure?\u201d More than half, 52%, said \u201cfailure.\u201d Only 42% said \u201csuccess.\u201d And it gets worse. Only 22% were \u201cstrongly\u201d convinced Obama is a success, while 39% are strongly convinced he\u2019s a failure. And the American people have pretty much made up their minds on this; only 6% of respondents had no clear opinion.\n\nOther evidence backs up this turn in public opinion. How bad has it gotten? The last president who was widely written off by the American people as a failure, George W. Bush, now enjoys higher net approval ratings than Obama, while Mitt Romney has been going on an I-told-you-so tour.\n\nAt this point, the American people are pretty much feeling like this kid. We are so over with being impressed by this president.\n\nOn behalf of long-time critics of Obama, let me say to the American people: welcome to our world. As a public service, to help you solidify your sense that he just isn\u2019t up to the job, let me count down the ways that President Obama has failed to live up to his promises and to the responsibilities of his office. The list is pretty comprehensive.\n\n1. He didn\u2019t heal our racial divisions.\n\nThe first thing people expected of Obama, the whole reason his presidency was already hailed as \u201chistoric\u201d on Inauguration Day 2009, before he had taken a single official act, is because voters thought that the first black president would help America put the ugly history of racially divisive politics behind us.\n\nBut from his earliest stumbling efforts\u2014anyone remember the \u201cBeer Summit\u201c?\u2014Obama has proven alternately uninterested and ham-handed in dealing with this signature issue. What he has mostly contributed has been to rush in and pre-judge racially charged cases, like the shooting of Trayvon Martin or the questionable police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, before the defendants get their day in court. When you pre-judge someone on the basis of race, isn\u2019t there a word for that?\n\nSo as the recent race riots in Ferguson confirm, Obama has not served as some kind of magical bridge who would promote mutual understanding between whites and blacks. Instead, he has done more to inflame the tensions in these cases than to defuse them.\n\nOur expectations of Obama were overblown from the beginning, but he worked pretty hard to overblow them. Certainly, when voters chose him, they were hoping for the opposite of an unscrupulous race-hustler like Al Sharpton. There was even a joke about Obama sending Sharpton and Jesse Jackson on missions to non-existent countries just to get them as far away from his campaign as possible. Now, Sharpton is being described as Obama\u2019s \u201cgo-to man on race,\u201d with a White House source gushing to The Politico that \u201cThere\u2019s a trust factor with The Rev from the Oval Office on down.\u201d\n\nFor those of us who remember Obama\u2019s previous go-to man on that subject\u2014the Reverend Jeremiah Wright\u2014it\u2019s not surprising. But it\u2019s not what most people thought they were voting for.\n\n2. The stimulus didn\u2019t stimulate.\n\nPresident Obama was elected in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, and his first big act in office was to sign a gargantuan package of \u201cstimulus\u201d spending\u2014financed entirely with debt\u2014that was supposed to jump-start the economy. Congress voted for hundreds of billion of dollars for \u201cshovel-ready projects\u201d which Obama later discovered don\u2019t exist, and the money disappeared without a trace.\n\nHow many \u201crecovery summers\u201d have there been in which growth and employment was finally supposed to take off\u2014only to peter out again? (Hint: the first one was in 2010.)\n\nIn how many other recoveries has labor force participation\u2014the percentage of people actually working\u2014declined? In what other recovery have poor people emerged deeper in debt than they were at the beginning?\n\nYes, the economy was in crisis when President Obama took office. But he has presided over the slowest, weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression\u2014and by a good margin.\n\n3. Financial reform didn\u2019t reform.\n\nBut surely, Obama saw to it that we would never repeat the problems that led to the financial crisis and the recession in the first place, right? Except that the Dodd-Frank financial reforms didn\u2019t really reform anything. They created a couple thousand pages of new legislation and many, many more new executive-branch regulations, which have helped to muddle the rules rather than clarify them. But these regulations have never really resolved any of the pre-crisis problems.\n\nThe old system in which a handful of giant financial institutions were considered \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and thus could depend on the rest of us to bail them out? That system is alive and well.\n\n4. ObamaCare is a boondoggle.\n\nThe disastrous launch of ObamaCare was a reminder of everything that\u2019s wrong with big government. It turns out that when we warned health insurance would be run as well as the Department of Motor Vehicles, we were too optimistic. And no one was ever held accountable for that fiasco.\n\nWhen ObamaCare was passed, we were assured that it would provide insurance for 32 million people who didn\u2019t have any coverage. Four years later, it looks like ObamaCare has covered far fewer new people, between 10% and 20% of what was promised, and about half of those were through an expansion of Medicaid\u2014a burden that will eventually bankrupt the states\u2014rather than through ObamaCare\u2019s insurance exchanges.\n\nMost of the people buying insurance through the exchanges are those who were kicked out of their previous health insurance plans by new regulations. It turns out that if we liked our health insurance, we couldn\u2019t keep it. For some of us, this will be bad. For others, it\u2019s much worse.\n\nYou\u2019re still going to hear a lot of commentators on the left arguing that the law is a great success\u2014if you agree to move the goalposts and ignore all the broken promises. But the American people aren\u2019t buying it.\n\n5. Obama failed to reform immigration.\n\nHe spent all of his political capital, and then some, on the failed stimulus and the ObamaCare boondoggle, leaving nothing for immigration reform. Having failed to get anything through Congress, he floated a dubious plan to enact amnesty through a unilateral executive authority that he doesn\u2019t have. Then he dropped the idea.\n\nInstead, he has simply failed to enforce the immigration laws, contributing to a crisis on our southern border.\n\nThe result: he has managed to enrage the right, the left, and the middle. He hasn\u2019t cracked down on illegal immigration, he hasn\u2019t legalized it, and he hasn\u2019t forged any kind of compromise or consensus on the issue. Nobody is happy and nothing has been accomplished.\n\n6. He withdrew prematurely from Iraq.\n\nObama was so eager to not be George W. Bush that he pulled all of our troops out of Iraq as soon as possible, then totally ignored the country, even as a terrorist threat re-established itself there. For most of this year, he foolishly downplayed the rise of the Islamic State. Even as Kurds and the Iraqi government issued increasingly panicked warnings, and the Islamic State took over more and more territory, he let the problem get worse for months without bothering to interrupt his golf schedule.\n\nA few weeks ago, he admitted to having no strategy for dealing with the Islamic State. Last week, he hastily assembled one, but it\u2019s looking like it might be unrealistic and lacks international support.\n\nBush went into Iraq with multiple UN resolutions, congressional approval, a broad \u201ccoalition of the willing,\u201d and (as it turned out) the resolve to use whatever means were necessary to prevent a terrorist state from establishing itself there. Obama is going back into Iraq with none of that. So I guess he really isn\u2019t anything like George W. Bush.\n\nWho could have guessed that he would be the one to suffer by that comparison?\n\n7. He blew the Arab Spring.\n\nWhen a series of uprisings overthrew dictators across the Middle East, Obama failed to adopt any meaningful policy or to turn the situation to our advantage. He dithered for so long on Egypt that all of the factions there hate him, and most of Egypt\u2019s liberals concluded that he was secretly backing the Muslim Brotherhood. The result is that Egypt went right back to where it was before, except this time the military dictatorship regards America as a useless and irrelevant ally.\n\nMeanwhile, the two places where we could have taken advantage of the Arab Spring to get rid of truly nasty dictators who have been hostile to our interests for decades\u2014Libya and Syria\u2014ended in disaster. In Libya, the killing of our ambassador in Benghazi was just the beginning of a slow collapse into chaos and civil war. In Syria, three years of administration dithering allowed the rise of ISIS, which then spilled over into Iraq.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about 2009, when Iranians poured out onto the street to oppose their own brutal, theocratic, terror-sponsoring regime\u2014and Obama sat back passively because he preferred to cut a diplomatic deal with the ayatollahs.\n\n8. Obama ignored the threat of a resurgent Russian dictatorship.\n\nDuring a debate with Mitt Romney in 2012, Obama dismissed Romney\u2019s suggestion that Russia might be a threat to American interests, sneering, \u201cThe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\u201d Now it\u2019s looking more like the 1970s are calling, with an aggressive Russian dictatorship invading its neighbors, leaving our European allies feeling exposed and unsure whether they can really count on support from the US and NATO. Poland\u2019s foreign minister has been overheard complaining about\u2014how shall I put this politely?\u2014his country\u2019s unrequited love for America.\n\nThe president\u2019s response to Russian aggression has been to impose a few more sanctions, make a speech in Estonia, and otherwise ignore the crisis and hope it goes away.\n\n9. He didn\u2019t shut down Guantanamo, keep the NSA from spying, or rein in the drones.\n\nI know people who sincerely believe that all of these are good policies and who will defend them vigorously if asked. Barack Obama is not one of those people. Yet all of these policies have been pursued during his presidency, on his authority.\n\nPresident Obama came into office having loudly condemned many of the Bush administration\u2019s measures against terrorism. Then he continued them. You can call this hypocrisy or you can call it subversion. But President Obama has achieved a unique combination: managing to morally discredit America\u2019s anti-terrorism policies without actually ending them.\n\n10. He has made America irrelevant.\n\nYou will notice that most of Obama\u2019s failures result, not from taking a bold stand, but from taking no stand and just letting events drift. Certainly, in a lot of these cases, Obama has given speeches or press conference to announce his enlightened intentions\u2014then done nothing to plan for how to actually achieve his goals.\n\nBut if he is irrelevant, that makes America irrelevant. We can look at the Arab Spring, at Ukraine, and at Iraq, but let\u2019s add one more example. For most of his presidency, Obama has declared his intention to \u201cpivot to Asia,\u201d extricating himself from the Middle East and focusing on bolstering our Pacific allies to peacefully manage the rise of China. It\u2019s pretty widely acknowledged that he never managed to do it, letting the Asia pivot die of neglect.\n\nThis may fit with the quasi-isolationist mood that has taken hold in America in recent years, but it is yet another case where Obama promised something very different. He campaigned on the promise that America would be more respected in the world after the Bush years\u2014not that we would be considered a useless ally and an ineffectual opponent.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you could come up with a more comprehensive list of presidential failures, encompassing foreign policy and domestic policy, economics, race, and immigration. And I\u2019m sure I left a lot of things off this list, not least of which is the targeting of Obama\u2019s political opponents by a corrupt IRS, which continues to announce the oh-so-mysterious loss of potentially incriminating data by its employees.\n\nCombine all of this with his frequent vacations and golf outings and his fascination with the trappings of pop-culture celebrity, and you get the impression that Obama has checked out of the presidency and lost interest in the responsibility he is neither willing nor able to shoulder.\n\nObama was originally elected on the basis of celebrity, on vague slogans about \u201chope and change,\u201d on a sense of self-congratulatory smugness about how progressive and enlightened we would all be if we voted for him. He was re-elected on all of that, plus the smearing of his political opposition as racists and mean rich white guys.\n\nIf the result is an utter failure of leadership, maybe there are a few lessons we ought to learn for the next presidential election.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 16 Sep 2014 06:40:59 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "We are so over with being impressed by this president.", "title": "10 Ways Obama Has Failed as President", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obamapressconference.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-17T06:16:42+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/09/16/10-ways-obama-has-failed-as-president/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "We are so over with being impressed by this president.", "title": "10 Ways Obama Has Failed as President", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obamapressconference.jpg"}, "creator": "@Tracinski", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Al Sharpton,Arab Spring,Asia pivot,Barack Obama,border crisis,Drones,Egypt,Ferguson,financial crisis,financial reform,George W.
