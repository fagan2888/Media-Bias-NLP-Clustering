Having trouble selling your house? A slow Internet connection may be to blame.

Recently, The Wall Street Journal reported that “the availability of speedy Internet service is starting to affect Americans’ biggest purchase: their homes.”

In a study released earlier this week, researchers at the University of Colorado and Carnegie Mellon found that fiber-optic connections can add $5,437 to the price of a $175,000 home. A 2014 study by the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater showed similar results. It found that high-speed access could add $11,815 to the value of a $439,000 vacation house in Door County, Wisconsin.

Some real estate agents are going so far as to tout high-speed Internet service in listings, along with the number of bathrooms and other desirable features.

For most Americans, adding a high-speed Internet line is relatively cheap and easy. And it sure beats renovating the kitchen.
