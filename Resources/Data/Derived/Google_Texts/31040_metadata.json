So-called \u201cpro-ana\u201d and \u201cpro-mia\u201d websites are designed as an outlet where people suffering from an eating disorder can come to share \u201cthinspiration\u201d (thinspo) and dieting tips. However, many believe they pose a danger to young people who can be swayed into thinking anorexia or bulimia are a good way to lose weight.\n\nIf the bill is approved, pro-ana and pro-mia site creators would face a fine costing between $13,000 and $134,000 and/or up to a two year prison sentence. Fines would double if it was discovered the site had effected someone under the age of 14. People opposing the bill claim most of the people in charge of sites promoting anorexia and bulimia are often affected by an eating disorder.\n\n\u201cThe world of pro-ana and thinspo is a dangerous place for those who have eating disorders or who are vulnerable to developing them,\u201d Claire Mysko, teen outreach coordinator for the National Eating Disorders Association, told Yahoo Health. \u201cPeople who create and consume this content are not villains; they are struggling, and sometimes they are very sick. That\u2019s why we believe so strongly in providing a positive alternative.\u201d\n\nControversy surrounding the Italian anti-anorexia bill comes in the wake of a 15-year-old girl in the U.K. who committed suicide after visiting pro-anorexia websites. Elle Holmes, a straight A student and captain of her school\u2019s swimming team, was seemingly living a life most girl\u2019s dream of, but Elle\u2019s mother Leigh said that her daughter was dealing with \u201chidden demons\u201d that she kept secret from even the people close to her.\n\n\"Everybody wants to know 'why'. To be honest, I still don't know,\" Leigh told The Telegraph. \u201cI don't know why my loved, brilliant, popular, talented, funny baby made that decision. She left no note. She said nothing to the little brother she adored. No word to her boyfriend, or her close inner circle of friends. There was no long-suffering depression, or slow descent into despair. The spiral into darkness seemed to occur over just a few short hours as her mind became overwhelmed and she simply snapped.\u201d\n\nA look into Elle\u2019s computer history revealed that she recently frequented pro-anorexia website in the days leading up to her untimely death. She had also wrote and performed a song titled \u201cMirror, Mirror\u201d that seemed to highlight a girl\u2019s attempt to cope with her looks. Leigh said her daughter showed no signs of depression and a video taken just before her death showed her laughing and fooling around with her younger brother.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "thinspiration, pro, anorexia, eating, disorder", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Creators of websites that promote eating disorders and \"thinspiration\" could face fines and even jail time if Italian bill is passed.", "title": "Promoting Anorexia Online Could Lead To Jailtime Pretty Soon", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thinspiration-outlawed-anti-anorexia-law-proposed-italy-could-mean-jailtime-websites-297196", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/eating-disorder.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Creators of websites that promote eating disorders and \"thinspiration\" could face fines and even jail time if Italian bill is passed.", "title": "Promoting Anorexia Online Could Lead To Jailtime Pretty Soon", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/thinspiration-outlawed-anti-anorexia-law-proposed-italy-could-mean-jailtime-websites-297196", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/eating-disorder.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/eating-disorder.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-08-08T12:28:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T12:28:56-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Creators of websites that promote eating disorders and \"thinspiration\" could face fines and even jail time if Italian bill is passed."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda263\"", "article_summary": "Lawmakers in Italy proposed a bill this past June that could mean hefty fines and even jail time for creators of websites that promote anorexia and other eating disorders.\nTo be honest, I still don't know,\" Leigh told The Telegraph.\n\u201cThe world of pro-ana and thinspo is a dangerous place for those who have eating disorders or who are vulnerable to developing them,\u201d Claire Mysko, teen outreach coordinator for the National Eating Disorders Association, told Yahoo Health.\nSo-called \u201cpro-ana\u201d and \u201cpro-mia\u201d websites are designed as an outlet where people suffering from an eating disorder can come to share \u201cthinspiration\u201d (thinspo) and dieting tips.\nPeople opposing the bill claim most of the people in charge of sites promoting anorexia and bulimia are often affected by an eating disorder."}
