Despite the Internet revolution, many hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices continue to rely on paper records and faxes in treating their patients.\n\nRelated: Why Obama\u2019s $30B Digital Health Record Plan Is Failing\n\nBut with a deadline looming at the end of the year for health care providers to demonstrate \"meaningful use\" of electronic records, the transition nationwide \u201chas been slower than anticipated,\u201d writes Stuart N. Brotman, a faculty member of the Harvard Law School and Business School \u2014 and not simply because of the substantial costs and time it takes to make the switch. An epidemic of bold cyberattacks against the IT infrastructure of many medical facilities has scared off executives of other hospitals and institutions that have considered making such a move.\n\nA startling 81 percent of health care executives say that their organizations have been hit by at least one malware or cyberattack during the past two years, according to the 2015 KPMG Healthcare Cybersecurity Survey.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the number of attacks has increased from the previous year, with 13 percent of the 223 chief information officers and chief technology officers interviewed saying they are targeted by external hack attempts about once a day. Another 12 percent of executives interviewed complained of two or more cyberattacks a week.\n\nRelated: Keeping Your Health Records Safe from Hackers\n\n\u201cSuch intrusions have potentially profound effects on e-health records,\u201d Brotman wrote in a blog post for the Brookings Institution. \u201cA breach can lead to a degradation of medical care and a loss of confidence by patients.\u201d\n\nThe situation is even worse in that 16 percent of health care organizations reported that they can\u2019t detect in real time if their IT systems have been compromised. Among the greatest concerns of health care organization officials are external attackers, the possibility of data getting into the hands of third parties, employee breaches and inadequate fire walls.\n\nLast July, UCLA reported that 4.5 million patient records were accessed by hackers at the university\u2019s health care system in California \u2014 including patients\u2019 dates of birth, Social Security numbers and medical records. But that is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIn August 2014, Community Health System, one of the largest health organizations in the country with 206 hospitals in 29 states, revealed that a group of hackers originating in China stole 4.5 million individuals\u2019 nonmedical patient data using highly sophisticated malware. According to Modern Healthcare, the hackers were believed to be hunting for intellectual property on medical devices and other equipment, but then settled for data on patients. There have been scores of other similar attacks on health care facilities and hospitals.\n\nRelated: Why Your Health Records Are Stuck in the 20th Century\n\nSome experts say the cost of hacking of IT records in the health care industry is potentially \u201ccatastrophic\u201d \u2014 with billions of dollars of damage to IT infrastructure and additional costs for improving security. That helps to explain why so many hospitals and health care organizations are taking a wait-and-see attitude.\n\n\u201cThe vulnerability of patient data at the nation\u2019s health plans and approximately 5,000 hospitals is on the rise and health care executives are struggling to safeguard patient records,\u201d Michael Ebert, leader of KPMG\u2019s Healthcare & Life Sciences Cyber Practice, said in a statement. \u201cPatient records are far more valuable than credit card information for people who plan to commit fraud, since the personal information cannot be easily changed. A key goal for execs is to advance their institutions\u2019 protection to create hurdles for hackers.\u201d\n\nSince 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services has spent about $30 billion providing incentives to hospitals and doctors that moved from paper to electronic record keeping. However, the momentum to bring patient record keeping and sharing into the 21st century has had mixed success at best, even after passage of the Affordable Care Act, which targets electronic record-keeping as a priority for achieving long-term cost savings.\n\nGovernment officials at one time had sought to force all hospitals to move to digitized patient records by the end of 2015 or face penalties of reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. But many hospitals and health care services are finding it too difficult and costly to make the move, and are dropping out of the program. The threat of cyberattacks is further discouraging hospitals and medical care organizations from making the change.\n\nRelated: Insurers Warn Obamacare Premium Prices to Soar\n\n\u201cUnless and until these organizations are able to decrease the number and severity of real-time cyber threats, there is not likely to be a dramatic shift from paper to digital health records,\u201d Brotman wrote for Brookings. \u201cFinancial incentives alone will not be sufficient to bring about this needed change. The data in the KPMG survey suggest that the underlying crisis of confidence is real; it must be addressed if this critical aspect of Obamacare is to be realized.\u201d\n\nAnd without continued conversion of paper health care records to a digital system, Brotman added, \u201cthe essential variable of cost controls will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the Obama administration\u2019s lesser known efforts to help \u201cbend the cost curve\u201d f", "title": "How Cyberattacks Are Jeopardizing the Switch to Electronic Medical Records", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/15/How-Cyberattacks-Are-Jeopardizing-Switch-Electronic-Medical-Records", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cybersecurity-heartbleed_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/15/How-Cyberattacks-Are-Jeopardizing-Switch-Electronic-Medical-Records", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cybersecurity-heartbleed_2.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "One of the Obama administration\u2019s lesser known efforts to help \u201cbend the cost curve\u201d f", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The threat of cyberattacks is further discouraging hospitals and medical care organizations from making the change.\nRelated: Keeping Your Health Records Safe from Hackers\u201cSuch intrusions have potentially profound effects on e-health records,\u201d Brotman wrote in a blog post for the Brookings Institution.\nLast July, UCLA reported that 4.5 million patient records were accessed by hackers at the university\u2019s health care system in California \u2014 including patients\u2019 dates of birth, Social Security numbers and medical records.\nDespite the Internet revolution, many hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices continue to rely on paper records and faxes in treating their patients.\n\u201cPatient records are far more valuable than credit card information for people who plan to commit fraud, since the personal information cannot be easily changed."}
