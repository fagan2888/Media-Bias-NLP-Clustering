I have abused prescription drugs and battled addiction. If I hadn\u2019t gotten the help I needed when I needed it, I might not be here today. And I want to help others facing the same challenges I did,\u201d Macklemore said.\n\nThe joint effort made history. White House officials said the artist is the first non-administration official to be featured on the president\u2019s weekly address.\n\nPresident Obama talked about the dangers of substance abuse, saying that drug overdoses take more lives every year than traffic accidents. Deaths from opioids have tripled since 2000, the president said.\n\nWATCH: 'Treatment Has Saved My Life,' Macklemore Says\n\n\u201cA lot of time they are from legal drugs prescribed by a doctor. Addiction does not always start in some dark alley. It often starts in a medicine cabinet,\u201d Obama said.\n\nA new study released in April found that 44 percent of Americans know someone who has been addicted to prescription pain killers. Many Americans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation report, are not aware of the legal requirement that insurance plans must follow the same rules for mental health benefits and substance abuse treatment as other medical services.\n\nBut this week Congress took steps to fight opioid abuse. Lawmakers passed a series of bills addressing the problem \u2014 a group of 18 measures designed to combat the nation's epidemic of addiction to painkillers.\n\nThe vote was 400 to 5 and the new legislation takes steps to set up federal grants and a task force to examine pain management methods and the prescribing of pain medication.\n\nAlso in a rare bi-partisan effort, the Senate is considering a similar bill. Both Democrats and Republicans hope to give the president one comprehensive bill to sign into law.\n\nThe United States represents only five percent of the global population but Americans consume 80 percent of the world\u2019s supply of pain medication. Opiate use in the United States has quadrupled since 1999, helped along by low cost and ease of access to opiate pain killers and a lack of understanding about their dangers.\n\nFor Macklemore, this fight gets even more personal. He lost a 21-year-old friend who overdosed on painkillers.\n\n\u201cAddiction is like any other disease. It doesn\u2019t discriminate. It doesn\u2019t care what color you are. Whether you are a guy or girl, rich or poor, whether you live in the inner city, a suburb, or rural America. This doesn\u2019t just happen to other people\u2019s kids or in some other neighborhood. It can happen to any of us,\u201d Macklemore said.\n\nHelp for those in need\n\nTo President Obama just talking about this crisis is not enough.\n\n\u201cWe need to get treatment for more people who needed it. My administration is working with communities to reduce overdose deaths including with medication. We\u2019re working with law enforcement to help people get into treatment instead of jail,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president said under the Affordable Care Act health plans have to include options for treatment.\n\n\u201cThe House passed several bills about opioids, which is great,\u201d Obama said, but urged \u201cunless they also make investments in more treatment, it won\u2019t get Americans the help that they need.\u201d\n\nThe White House released a statement calling on Congress to approve $1.1 billion in new funding for drug treatment listed in President Obama's budget proposal for next year.\n\n\u201cShame and stigma associated with the disease keeps too many people from seeking the help they need. Addiction isn\u2019t a personal choice or a personal failing. And sometimes it takes more than a strong will to get better. It takes a strong community and accessible resources,\u201d Macklemore said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, Health", "Author": "Aline Barros", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "President Barack Obama and hip hop artist Macklemore joined forces in the president's weekly radio address to call on the U.S. Congress to fund more treatments to fight opioid abuse.\r\n The Grammy-awar", "title": "Macklemore, Obama Urge Congress to Fight Opioid Abuse", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/macklemore-and-obama-urge-congress-to-fight-opioid-abuse/3330418.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/B9CE0EB7-A805-48C4-BB31-F68000597B26_cx0_cy7_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/B9CE0EB7-A805-48C4-BB31-F68000597B26_cx0_cy7_cw0_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Macklemore, Obama Urge Congress to Fight Opioid Abuse", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
