Saving Lives and Saving Money: Hospital-Acquired Conditions. Update Interim Data From National Efforts To Make Care Safer, 2010\u20132014.\n\nEfforts to improve patient safety have reduced hospital-acquired conditions by 17% from 2010 to 2014 and saved 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billion, according to data released by HHS.The report found that patients in the hospital experienced 2.1 million fewer hospital-acquired conditions. Hospital-acquired conditions include adverse drug events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line associated bloodstream infections, pressure ulcers, and surgical site infections, among others.Interim estimates for 2014 from HHS\u2019 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) show the rate of hospital-acquired conditions staying steady from 2013. AHRQ estimates 36,000 fewer patients died in hospitals in 2014 as a result of the decline.\u201cPatients in America\u2019s hospitals are safer today as a result of this partnership with hospitals and health care providers,\u201d HHS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell, said in a statement . \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has given us tools to build a better health care system that protects patients, improves quality, and makes the most of our health care dollars.\u201dThe most deaths averted were as a result of pressure ulcers (42,716 deaths averted), followed by adverse drug events (16,670 deaths averted), and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (7922 deaths averted).\u201cWhile there is always more work to be done to improve patient safety, the collaborative efforts of hospitals and HHS have delivered great results that will continue to help the field on the quality improvement journey, said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association.HHS associates the major strides in patient safety to efforts by the federal Partnership for Patients initiative, Hospital Engagement Networks, Quality Improvement Organizations, and other public and private partners.\u201cThese results demonstrate that it\u2019s possible to improve national patient safety performance resulting in millions of people avoiding infections and adverse events,\u201d said Patrick Conway, MD, deputy administrator for innovation and quality and chief medical officer at CMS. \u201cAs a practicing physician, I know the importance of safety culture and care teams focused on keeping every patient as safe as possible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ACA, patient safety, healthcare quality, healthcare cost", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "site_name": "AJMC", "description": "Efforts to improve patient safety have reduced hospital-acquired conditions by 17% from 2010 to 2014 and saved 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billion", "title": "Patient safety improvements reduced hospital-acquired conditions by 17% & saved 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billion"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJMC_Journal", "image": "https://ajmc.s3.amazonaws.com/_media/_core/ajmc-twitter-logo.jpg", "description": "Efforts to improve patient safety have reduced hospital-acquired conditions by 17% from 2010 to 2014 and saved 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billion", "card": "summary", "title": "Patient safety improvements reduced hospital-acquired conditions by 17% & saved 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billion"}, "description": "Efforts to improve patient safety have reduced hospital-acquired conditions by 17% from 2010 to 2014 and saved 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billion"}, "article_summary": "Efforts to improve patient safety have reduced hospital-acquired conditions by 17% from 2010 to 2014 and saved 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billionLaura JosztImage: HHS.\nEfforts to improve patient safety have reduced hospital-acquired conditions by 17% from 2010 to 2014 and saved 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billion, according to data released by HHS.The report found that patients in the hospital experienced 2.1 million fewer hospital-acquired conditions.\nSaving Lives and Saving Money: Hospital-Acquired Conditions.\n\u201cAs a practicing physician, I know the importance of safety culture and care teams focused on keeping every patient as safe as possible.\u201d\nHospital-acquired conditions include adverse drug events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line associated bloodstream infections, pressure ulcers, and surgical site infections, among others.Interim estimates for 2014 from HHS\u2019 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) show the rate of hospital-acquired conditions staying steady from 2013."}
