This inclusion goes beyond the existing Medicaid expansion in the state, a first for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) agency that approved the move.\n\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid coverage to tens of thousands of expectant mothers and youth means the most vulnerable citizens served by the Flint water supply can now be connected to a wide range of needed health and developmental services,\u201d said Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell in a Thursday press release.\n\nBurwell stressed the need for testing to check for lead levels in children\u2019s bloodstream \u2014 the dangerous outcome of high levels of lead in the city\u2019s tap water \u2014 and behavioral health services \u2014 the anticipated need for children who may suffer from heightened mental health issues, a side affect of lead poisoning. The news comes a day after HHS announced another expansion geared toward Flint\u2019s youngest, who have been found to be the most at-risk for the affects of lead poisoning: $3.6 million in additional funds toward the city\u2019s Head Start program.\n\nMichigan Gov. Rick Snyder requested this additional expansion on February 14. Snyder, who has become the lead villain responsible for neglecting Flint\u2019s crisis, was one of the first GOP governors to accept President Obama\u2019s Medicaid expansion, a major coverage provision under the Affordable Care Act that has been resisted by Republican leaders.\n\n\u201cChildren, teens and young adults exposed to lead need more coverage to get testing and the treatment they need,\u201d Snyder said in his request to CMS. \u201cExpanding these services and lead abatement efforts will mitigate the risks of lead exposure and result in better identifying any long-term health challenges.\u201d\n\nFlint\u2019s water became contaminated in April 2014, after the city stopped using the Detroit\u2019s water system and switched to the local Flint River. The river water, left dangerously untreated for corrosive elements, quickly chipped away at the city\u2019s lead pipe system and funneled lead-heavy water into every residence.\n\nThose covered under the new expansion are some of the most in need of medical care. In Flint, where 40 percent of the population already lives in poverty, the poorest residents were found to have the highest levels of lead in their blood after drinking the contaminated city tap water for over a year.\n\nBut lead poisoning isn\u2019t the only side affect of drinking Flint\u2019s water \u2014 physicians have also found a major increase in cases of Legionnaires Disease following the city\u2019s water change, though officials have yet to test the water to confirm the potential link.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The expansion grants coverage to an additional 15,000 children and pregnant women.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The expansion grants coverage to an additional 15,000 children and pregnant women.", "title": "Low-Income Flint Residents Receive Emergency Medicaid Expansion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/03/04/3756720/flint-medicaid-expansion/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04122943/AP_551526133025-1-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The expansion grants coverage to an additional 15,000 children and pregnant women.", "creator": "@alex_zee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04122943/AP_551526133025-1-321x214.jpg", "title": "Low-Income Flint Residents Receive Emergency Medicaid Expansion", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04122943/AP_551526133025-1-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/04122943/AP_551526133025-1-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-04T12:44:44+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/alexzielinskireporter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "This inclusion goes beyond the existing Medicaid expansion in the state, a first for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) agency that approved the move.\n\u201cChildren, teens and young adults exposed to lead need more coverage to get testing and the treatment they need,\u201d Snyder said in his request to CMS.\nHealth Low-Income Flint Residents Receive Emergency Medicaid Expansion CREDIT: AP Photo, Carlos Osorio Registered Nurse Brian Jones draws a blood sample from Grayling Stefek, 5, at the Eisenhower Elementary School, Tuesday, Jan. 26, 2016 in Flint, Mich.AP Photo/CarlosIn the wake of a devastating water contamination crisis, the federal government has approved Michigan\u2019s request for an emergency increase in health insurance access for low-income Flint residents.\nThe river water, left dangerously untreated for corrosive elements, quickly chipped away at the city\u2019s lead pipe system and funneled lead-heavy water into every residence.\nThose covered under the new expansion are some of the most in need of medical care."}
