So when the Republican presidential frontrunner looks at the Defense Department\u2019s multi-billion dollar F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, he sees a lousy deal.\n\nDuring an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, the real estate mogul said he has received briefings on the fighter jet effort and that it has \u201cbig problems.\u201d\n\nRelated: Yet Another Costly F-35 Glitch That Won\u2019t Be Fixed Any Time Soon\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that our existing planes are better. And one of the pilots came out of the plane, one of the test pilots, and said this isn\u2019t as good as what we already have. And to spend billions and billions of dollars on something that maybe isn\u2019t as good,\u201d Trump said. He was referring to a recent five-page report written by a test pilot and obtained by War is Boring that said the fifth-generation aircraft was easily outmatched by the F-16 fighter, which the F-35 is meant to replace.\n\nYears behind schedule and with a $400 billion price tag, the F-35 is the most expensive weapon program in U.S. history. The plane\u2019s development began roughly 15 years ago and has been plagued with cost overruns and technical glitches.\n\nThe effort\u2019s latest hiccup is that its ejection seat could cause fatal whiplash for pilots weighing under 136 pounds, despite the fact that the seat was designed to handle any pilot weighing between 103 and 245 pounds. The discovery prompted the Pentagon to restrict any pilot that weighs less than 136 pounds from flying the aircraft until a solution was found.\n\nRelated: How the Liberal\u2019s Win in Canada Could Hurt the F-35\n\nAir Force leaders expect the ejection seat\u2019s manufacturer, Martin-Baker, to pay for the fix, however it could take anywhere from a year to 18 months to implement, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the F-35\u2019s program chief, told Congress earlier this week.\n\nHe also pushed back against the test pilot\u2019s report, describing the mock dogfight as \u201cone of the very first developmental test sorties that were flown to better understand the slow flight characteristics of the airplane,\u201d which has since performed better in operational trials.\n\nRegardless of the fighter\u2019s progress, Trump, a thrifty businessman and the GOP\u2019s most frugal presidential contender, said things would be different if he were in the Oval Office.\n\nRelated: The $1 Trillion Question for the F-35: Is the U.S. Buying an Inferior Plane?\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying it doesn\u2019t perform as well as our existing equipment, which is much less expensive. So when I hear that, immediately I say we have to do something, because you know, they\u2019re spending billions,\u201d he told Hewitt.\n\n\u201cThis is a plane. There\u2019s never been anything like it in terms of cost. And how about, you know, we\u2019re retooling with planes that aren\u2019t as good as the ones we have, and the test pilots are amazing people. They know better than anybody, okay, and I think you would accept that,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen test pilots \u201csay that this cannot perform as well, as the planes we already have, what are doing, and spending so much more money?\u201d Trump asked.\n\nHis hesitation is this week\u2019s second bit of potential bad news for the F-35. On Monday, Canada overwhelming elected the Liberal Party and its leader, Justin Trudeau, as prime minister. Trudeau has vowed to kill Ottawa\u2019s planned order of 65 jets, saving the country $9 billion.\n\nWhile he\u2019s received no notification that Canada is pulling out the effort, Bogdan said that if any of the nine partner countries developing the F-35 opted out of the effort, about $1 million would be tacked on to the cost of each fighter jet.\n\nSince the U.S. wants to purchase 2,440 F-35s that could add billions more to the program\u2019s long-term $1 trillion cost and force the Pentagon to dramatically cut back its total buy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump boasts, \u201cI\u2019m the most militaristic person there is,\u201d and that he\u2019d build a military force so robust \u201cno one is going to mess\u201d with the U.S. Yet at his core, Trump is a businessman.
