PETERSBURG \u2014 Thousands of stories by the world\u2019s greatest minds line the shelves of Haslem\u2019s Book Store and some are as endearing as the love story between the family-owned institution and the community that created it.\n\nThe independent new and used bookstore in the Grand Central District, one of few in the nation that has survived in an age of Kindles and e-books, celebrated its 80th birthday Sunday with hours of tears, laughter and hugs as the minds that make up St. Petersburg\u2019s creative community did what they do best \u2014 tell stories.\n\n\u201cThe store is not necessarily a reflection of my family, but of this community,\u201d said Raymond Hinst, son of the third-generation owners of the store, Suzanne Haslam and her husband, Ray Hinst.\n\n\u201cEverything that\u2019s in here came from your homes, you brought it to us or called it in because you were interested in it. Everyone in this town made a store this big with all this amazing diversity and history, and you\u2019re still bringing more in.\u201d\n\nTo get a sense of what makes St. Petersburg tick, one need only look around at the characters and stories haunting Haslam\u2019s. Former Florida Representative and current Dean of the College of Education at the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg Bill Heller and St. Petersburg\u2019s first poet laureate Peter Meinke were just a few of the familiar faces that filtered through the store Sunday. The men mingled with the up-and-coming writers and 20-something\u2019s in fedoras and horn-rimmed glasses that weren\u2019t there because of the store\u2019s history in the city, but simply because this is where they hang out. The next generation of customers, school children in flip-flops and tank tops, ran around the musty stacks looking for new stories to leaf through, chasing the store\u2019s cat Tea Cup.\n\nAt Haslam\u2019s, where the family\u2019s \u201cbest friends are our customers, not necessarily our best customers,\u201d it\u2019s okay to leaf through the pages of a book in the corner or stop by to discuss new projects and ideas, Raymond Hinst said. The store saw St. Petersburg through the end of prohibition, segregation and World War II, welcoming all, black or white, into the family.\n\nFirst opened as a magazine exchange in 1933 during the Great Depression, John and Mary Haslam\u2019s family store was a frequent hang-out for icon Jack Kerouac, who is rumored to still haunt the store, moving his books to more prominent display locations as he did in life.\n\nAs customers and former employees took turns sharing their stories Sunday, a stack of children\u2019s books inexplicably flew from a display.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk in the door you know this place is something different and some strange things could happen here,\u201d said Ray Arsenault, an American historian and co-director of the University of South Florida, St. Petersburg\u2019s Florida Studies Program.\n\nHearing customers\u2019 heart-felt stories is \u201cedifying,\u201d Ray Hinst said, especially as the family watches bookstores as big as Borders close their doors and big cities like New York and L.A. struggle to keep independent shops open. After the depression, as people flocked to St. Petersburg to retire to \u201cparadise\u201d and the pursuit of leisure, the store became a collection of the community\u2019s favorite stories, family heirlooms, dreams and aspirations. Now it\u2019s those stories that are sparking younger generations to keep the creative spirit of the community alive, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople came with the books they always wanted to read and started sharing,\u201d Ray Hinst said. \u201cWe\u2019re truly a reflection of the pursuits of the community. ... As long as the community interest is there, we\u2019ll be here.\u201d\n\nadawson@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-9851\n\nTwitter: @adawsonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 08 Dec 2013 18:46:43 -0400", "Description": "ST.
