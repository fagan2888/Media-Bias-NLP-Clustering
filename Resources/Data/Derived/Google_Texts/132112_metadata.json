Roughly $7 billion of the toxic-loans deal is earmarked for direct borrower relief; a large chunk of that is expected to involve principal write-downs for underwater owners.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: Under current tax law, when most of these owners accept reductions in what they owe, the amount forgiven by the bank gets reported to the IRS and the owner is hit with taxes as if the reduction were ordinary income. Congress created a temporary exception to this tax code rule solely for distressed homeowners but that law expired Dec. 31 and has not been renewed for principal reductions during 2014, whether they are obtained through short sales, foreclosures or loan modifications by lenders.\n\nIf Congress does not extend the law retroactively, Attorney General Eric Holder says, hundreds of thousands of underwater owners could be hit with tax burdens they may not be able to handle. Equally troubling, the lapse in the debt relief act already has prompted many owners to avoid the possibility of a huge tax bill altogether. Deeply in the hole on their mortgages, they have opted for bankruptcy rather than trusting Congress to renew the law.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing a lot more bankruptcies because of [the expiration],\u201d says Kevin B. Tolbert, a realty agent with Keller Williams in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Tolbert estimates that he handled more than 300 short sales from 2010 through 2013, but he has avoided them this year. With the potential for heavy tax levies on clients who opt for principal reductions, Tolbert says, until Congress renews the law \u201cI really can\u2019t recommend\u201d that owners take the chance. Nor can he recommend that they declare insolvency to avoid having to pay money to the IRS.\n\nSo back to the main question: What\u2019s happening in Congress on mortgage debt forgiveness? It\u2019s complicated. Before heading out for summer vacation, it appeared that action was imminent in the Senate. The Finance Committee approved an \u201cextenders\u201d bill that would renew the debt forgiveness law along with other expired tax code programs such as credits for alternative energy and for research and development.\n\nBut before a vote was taken by the full Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) prohibited consideration of a Republican-backed amendment that would have repealed an excise tax on medical devices that is a source of funding for the Affordable Care Act. That knocked the entire extenders bill off track. Sources say Reid now wants a vote on the extenders \u2014 and is willing to take up the ACA amendment \u2014 but plans to delay until after the November elections, when the chance of passage would be good.\n\nIn the House, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) is not likely to schedule a separate vote on mortgage relief, sources say, but he won\u2019t block a short-term extension of the program if the Senate passes the extenders bill and sends it to the House.\n\nSo what\u2019s the outlook for owners scheduled to receive principal debt reductions from banks in the coming months, along with others who have completed short sales or loan modifications this year? Thousands of Bank of America borrowers have some special protection: The settlement requires the bank to set aside $490 million to help defray customers\u2019 tax bills if Congress fails to extend the relief law.\n\nFor most other underwater borrowers who plan to receive principal reductions this year or who already have, it\u2019s still nail-biting time. But the odds for eventual renewal by Congress \u2014 yes, even this Congress \u2014 appear to be a little better than even.\n\nKen Harney\u2019s e-mail address is kenharney@earthlink.net.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "realestatepage, underwater motgages, princiapl reductions.Bank of America settlement, Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Congress has not yet decided to renew law that helps people eligible for cuts in mortgage principal.", "title": "As Congress returns, tax breaks for owners with underwater loans remain uncertain", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/as-congress-returns-tax-breaks-for-owners-with-underwater-loans-remain-uncertain/2014/09/10/a651bd90-3788-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "realestatepage, underwater motgages, princiapl reductions.Bank of America settlement, Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a651bd90-3788-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Congress has not yet decided to renew law that helps people eligible for cuts in mortgage principal."}, "article_summary": "For most other underwater borrowers who plan to receive principal reductions this year or who already have, it\u2019s still nail-biting time.\nEqually troubling, the lapse in the debt relief act already has prompted many owners to avoid the possibility of a huge tax bill altogether.\nRoughly $7 billion of the toxic-loans deal is earmarked for direct borrower relief; a large chunk of that is expected to involve principal write-downs for underwater owners.\nBut the odds for eventual renewal by Congress \u2014 yes, even this Congress \u2014 appear to be a little better than even.\nIf Congress does not extend the law retroactively, Attorney General Eric Holder says, hundreds of thousands of underwater owners could be hit with tax burdens they may not be able to handle."}
