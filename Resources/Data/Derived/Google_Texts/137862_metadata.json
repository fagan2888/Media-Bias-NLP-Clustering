The Fourth Amendment, Scalia pointed out, prohibits the government from searching our \u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects\u201d without a warrant \u2013 not \u2018conversations.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2013 Excerpt from a story by Erin Fuchs on the Business Insider website on March 22, about an appearance by Justice Scalia before students of the Brooklyn Law School in New York City.\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND\u2026\n\nWhen a Justice of the Supreme Court, speaking outside the court, makes a comment on the meaning of the Constitution, one can never say for sure that such a remark is wrong: the Justice can always try to persuade other members of the court to rule that way, sooner or later.\n\nBut in order for telephone conversations to be placed outside the privacy protections of the Fourth Amendment, a majority of the court would have to be persuaded to overrule several of its most important decisions limiting the government\u2019s power to eavesdrop on private conversations without a search warrant.\n\nJustice Scalia\u2019s comment (if accurately recounted), that the Fourth Amendment does not protect telephone conversations, at one time was, in fact, the court\u2019s view. In the Prohibition era case of Olmstead v. U.S., in 1928, the Supreme Court decided a case involving a crude form of physical wiretapping to listen to the conversations of liquor dealers. The court said explicitly: \u201cOne who installs in his house a telephone instrument with connecting wires intends to project his voice to those quite outside, and\u2026the wires beyond his house and messages while passing over them are not within the protection of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d\n\nThat decision established the privacy principle that, unless government agents intruded physically into a constitutionally protected area, such as carrying out a \u201ctrespass\u201d inside the home, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nIn 1961, the Supreme Court was asked to overrule the Olmstead decision, in a case involving the use of a microphone on the end of a long pole that was poked through a wall to enable federal agents to listen in on gamblers\u2019 conversations. The court had been told that advancing technology made it easier for government to intrude into private spaces, so the Fourth Amendment should take account of that.\n\nIn that case, Silverman v. U.S., the court said it need not delve into \u201cthe large questions which have been argued,\u201d based on \u201cthe vaunted marvels of the electronic age,\u201d because this case involved a physical invasion into or encroachment on a private space. It thus ruled that the use by the agents of a \u201cspike mike\u201d did violate the Fourth Amendment.\n\nWhat is at least implicit in the court\u2019s perspective, at least by the time of the Silverman decision, was that there could be factual scenarios in which government eavesdropping on private conversations was an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.\n\nThe Supreme Court went further, in the 1967 decision in Katz v. U.S. That case, involving an illegal gambling prosecution, challenged federal agents\u2019 use of a device from outside of a telephone booth that had been used by a suspect to make bets. The court did what it had refused to do in the Silverman case: it cast aside the Olmstead view that there could be no Fourth Amendment violation unless eavesdropping was done by a physical intrusion into a private space.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment, the court said, \u201cprotects people, not places.\u201d So it abandoned the notion that the Fourth Amendment applied only to private physical space or areas. Instead, the court adopted the concept that what an individual \u201cseeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.\u201d\n\nWhen an individual steps into a telephone booth, closes the door and puts a coin in the slot, that individual, the court said, \u201cis surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world. To read the Constitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication.\u201d\n\nThe court stressed in that case, however, that it was not ruling on a scenario in which government agents had eavesdropped, without a warrant, on a suspect in a case involving \u201cnational security.\u201d\n\nFive years later, the Supreme Court took up that open question, in the case of U.S. v. U.S. District Court, involving government eavesdropping on the conversations of suspects in the dynamite bombing of a Central Intelligence Agency office in Ann Arbor, Mich. Relying on what it had said in the Katz and Silverman cases about eavesdropping in ordinary criminal cases, the court ruled that there is no national security exemption to the Fourth Amendment requirement that the government obtain a warrant before conducting surveillance of telephone conversations.\n\n\u201cThose charged with investigative and prosecutorial duty,\u201d the court said, \u201cshould not be the sole judges of when to utilize constitutionally sensitive means in pursuing their tasks.\u201d\n\nThe National Security Agency\u2019s global program of monitoring telephone calls, as well as Internet and cable communications, one day \u2013 perhaps soon \u2013 will be tested in the Supreme Court, under the Fourth Amendment. There will be a lengthy history of constitutional protection for the privacy of conversations that will be at stake, and Justice Scalia probably will be on the court then to say \u2013 in his formal role as a judge \u2013 whether that history was all a mistake.\n\nLyle Denniston is the National Constitution Center\u2019s adviser on constitutional literacy.
