Rob Maness, the conservative Louisiana Senate candidate.\n\nAccording to the Times-Picayune, Palin and Maness had an event \u201cat Restaurant des Familles in Crown Point\u201d and \u201cManess surprised the former Alaska governor with a three-foot gator\u201d after her speech (see Shealah Craighead photo). Perhaps they will go duck hunting next, as Palin reportedly said that the Duck Dynasty crew had \u201cnice things to say\u201d about Maness when they visited her in Alaska.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nApparently @SarahPalinUSA hosted the @DuckDynastyAE guys at a BBQ in Alaska. She said they had \u201cnice things to say\u201d about @RobManess #LASen \u2014 Cole Avery (@cole_avery1) September 27, 2014\n\nPalin reportedly said that Maness \u201cknows the issues and what Washington, D.C., does to a state like Louisiana\u201d and told attendees that \u201cWe need a fighter in D.C. that doesn\u2019t just go with the flow.\u201d\n\nManess is in third place in Louisiana\u2019s jungle primary against incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Rep. Bill Cassidy, the moderate establishment Republican who is leading in the polls and may have trouble against Landrieu in a one-on-one matchup. But a recent poll showed that Maness is within an eight-point swing of overtaking Cassidy. If nobody gets more than 50% of the vote in November, the top two will square off in a December runoff that may decide control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nPalin has previously hailed Maness, as Breitbart News reported, for \u201copposing amnesty, pledging to protect our Second Amendment rights, and promising to defund Obamacare.\u201d And she has ripped Cassidy opposing Ronald Reagan in the past and for actually being \u201ca supporter of Mary Landrieu until recent years.\u201d Others have noted that Landrieu always beats candidates like Cassidy who are unable to draw sharp contrasts in a one-on-one matchup.\n\nTony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council that hosted this weekend\u2019s Values Voter Summit, said he has seen \u201cprivate polling\u201d not conducted for any campaign that, according to The Hill, \u201cshows Maness more competitive in a runoff than\u201d Cassidy, the \u201cestablishment pick\u201d who is leading in the polls.\n\n\u201cI think our best chance to pick up a Senate seat in Louisiana is Rob Maness,\u201d Perkins told The Hill. \u201cThat\u2019s why I endorsed him.\u201d\n\nRedState noted that \u201cCassidy and Landrieu are creatures of Washington, D.C.\u201d and pointed to moderate candidates the establishment pushed in GOP primaries who are now struggling in places like North Carolina and Kansas.\n\nAs Breitbart News previously noted, \u201cCassidy has donated thousands of dollars\u201d to Landrieu, \u201cwhich will make it tough to run against her in a general election.\u201d He has also \u201cmocked Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal\u201d and \u201copenly supported Michael Dukakis.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Cassidy \u201ccampaigned for TARP and now claims he opposes it, which will make it even more difficult for voters in Louisiana to differentiate Cassidy from Landrieu.\u201d\n\n\u201cLouisiana, Col. Rob Maness fought for us for 32 years. Let\u2019s fight for him these next six months and let him continue to support and defend our Constitution in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Palin said when she endorsed Maness months ago.\n\nSince then, Maness, a 32-year career in the Air Force, has secured endorsements from the \u201cSenate Conservatives Fund, Family Research Council, Gun Owners of America, National Association of Gun Rights, Gun Rights Across America, Eagle Forum, and Tea Party Express.\u201d\n\nManess\u2019s first television ad showed him wrestling an alligator.\n\nPhoto: Shealah Craighead", "article_metadata": {"description": "Palin Serves Gator Meat Campaigning for Conservative Rob Maness", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Palin Serves Gator Meat Campaigning for Conservative Rob Maness", "title": "Palin Serves Gator Meat Campaigning for Conservative Rob Maness - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/09/28/Palin-Maness-Gator-jpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/09/28/palin-serves-gator-meat-campaigning-for-conservative-rob-maness/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Palin Serves Gator Meat Campaigning for Conservative Rob Maness", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/09/28/Palin-Maness-Gator-jpg.jpg", "title": "Palin Serves Gator Meat Campaigning for Conservative Rob Maness - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Mary Landrieu, Senate, Twitter,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-09-28T09:37:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Rob Maness, the conservative Louisiana Senate candidate.\n\u201cI think our best chance to pick up a Senate seat in Louisiana is Rob Maness,\u201d Perkins told The Hill.\nRob Maness fought for us for 32 years.\nand \u201cMama Grizzly\u201d Sarah Palin held an alligator and served gator meat with \u201cAlligator Hunter\u201d Col.\nLet\u2019s fight for him these next six months and let him continue to support and defend our Constitution in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Palin said when she endorsed Maness months ago."}
