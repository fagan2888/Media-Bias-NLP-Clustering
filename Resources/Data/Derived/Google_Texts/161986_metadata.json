The rocket program it had been constructed to serve was canceled in 2010.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking to know that, you know, you thought you\u2019d done something good,\u201d David Forshee, general foreman for the pipefitters of the tower, told the Post. \u201cAnd all you\u2019ve done is go around in a damn circle, like a dog chasing his tail.\u201d\n\nIn the project\u2019s inception, NASA predicted it would cost $119 million to build. This estimate then jumped to $163 million. When it was over, NASA had spent more than twice as much as the second estimate for a program that ended four years earlier.\n\nAnd the spending is still not over. According to the Post, NASA will continue to spend an additional $700,000 a year \u201cto maintain it in disuse.\u201d\n\nShortly after the program was canceled, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., sponsored an amendment to reinstate construction and complete it by September 2013, even though its mission would not be revived.\n\n\u201cAdministrations come and go. I think it makes sense not to leave a partially constructed asset sitting there,\u201d Wicker told the Post. \u201cI do believe, a decade from now, we\u2019ll look back and see that it has been used in a very positive way.\u201d\n\nThe Post noted that Wicker did not name a specific NASA program that could use the tower, and NASA says it doesn\u2019t have any rockets in development that would even need the testing the A-3 tower provides.\n\nSo for now, the massive steel structure will remain \u201cmothballed,\u201d according to the Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NASA built a $349 million laboratory tower in Mississippi intended to simulate the \u201cvacuum of space\u201d to test a new rocket engine.
