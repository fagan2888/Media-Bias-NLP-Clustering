POLICE have put up banners outside an Exeter school to warn parents about the dangers of bad parking.

Officers have been working with Pinhoe C of E Primary School to address the problems associated with the school run for several months because they fear bad parking among parents dropping off and picking up children could lead to an accident.

The banners were designed with the childrenâ€™s help and warn of the need to park sensibly.

Funding came from the Community Safety Partnership.
