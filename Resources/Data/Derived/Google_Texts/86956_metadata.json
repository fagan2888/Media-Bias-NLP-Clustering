There was no limit to the mischief and thievery the hackers could wreak with access to tens of millions of names, birth dates, medical identification numbers, Social Security numbers, street addresses, email addresses and employment information.\n\nRelated: U.S. Federal Agencies Refuse To Testify About OPM Hack\n\nThe data breach at Anthem was one of five cyber-attacks against major health insurance companies in the past year. The other targets were Premera Blue Cross, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, Excellus BlueCross BlueShield and UCLA HealthSystem.\n\nTaken together, the five massive hacks likely hurt as many as 105 million individuals, according to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Civil Rights. When other health care industry hacks and thefts were tossed in, the total rose to 154 million individuals whose identity was put at risk.\n\nNow alarmed members of Congress -- still reeling from reports of massive hacks of Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and other federal government agencies that threatened government security -- are pressing for answers to why the health insurance industry is so vulnerable to cyberattacks. They are also are seeking better coordination between federal, state and local authorities in combatting future hacks.\n\nFour senators \u2013 Republicans Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Orrin Hatch of Utah and Democrats Patty Murray of Washington State and Ron Wyden or Oregon \u2013 voiced their concerns in a letter last week to Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Jocelyn Samuels, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights. The letter previously was reported by NextGov.\n\nRelated: Millions hit by personal data hack still have not been told\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that data theft will continue to rise and will result in an increase in medical identity theft,\u201d the senators said in their letter.\n\nBy some estimates, roughly 15 million Americans have their identities used fraudulently annually with financial losses totaling close to $50 billion. Tens of millions of others have their personal identifying information put at risk each year when records maintained by government and corporate databases are lost or stolen.\n\nIn the case of health care records like the ones stolen from Anthem and other major U.S. health insurers, the financial consequences can be devastating, according to the lawmakers. For example:\n\nVictims can end up paying large out-of-pocket costs for medical bills incurred by thieves using their names.\n\nVictims can see their credit ratings destroyed and lose their health insurance.\n\nThieves can file claims in the victims\u2019 names for expensive service and medical equipment, leaving the victims unable in the future to access those services and equipment when needed.\n\nRelated: Think You\u2019ve Been Hacked? 10 Tips to Protect Yourself Now\n\n\n\nHackers who gain access to medical records can alter them in ways that could endanger the lives of the victims when they are next treated in a hospital or doctor\u2019s office. \u201cFaulty records that contain a false diagnosis, or inaccurate blood type, can result in dangerous health repercussions, including receipt of improper medical treatment,\u201d the senators said in their letter. And while patients have the right to review their records and request corrections under federal privacy rules, \u201cthere is widespread confusion\u201d about how those rules apply in cases where hackers add faulty information to a victim\u2019s medical reports.\n\nBeyond all that, identity theft can adversely affect the Medicare Trust Funds and defraud taxpayers. According to a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) study, about 10 percent of total yearly Medicare and Medicaid spending -- or $98 billion \u2013 was fraudulent.\n\nFor example, an organized crime ring operated at least 118 phony clinics in 25 states and submitted over $100 million in Medicare claims using stolen data. In another case, a multi-national organization created a \u201cghost\u201d medical clinic, which milked Medicare for over $1 million in services.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Last February, health insurance giant Anthem Inc.", "title": "Health Insurance Hackers Put 154 Million Consumers at Risk", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Health-Insurance-Hackers-Put-154-Million-Consumers-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07312013_Online_Health_Insurance_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Health-Insurance-Hackers-Put-154-Million-Consumers-Risk", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07312013_Online_Health_Insurance_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Last February, health insurance giant Anthem Inc.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "When other health care industry hacks and thefts were tossed in, the total rose to 154 million individuals whose identity was put at risk.\nTaken together, the five massive hacks likely hurt as many as 105 million individuals, according to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Civil Rights.\nIn another case, a multi-national organization created a \u201cghost\u201d medical clinic, which milked Medicare for over $1 million in services.\nLast February, health insurance giant Anthem Inc. revealed stunning news: Hackers invaded the company\u2019s massive computer system and gained access to sensitive personal and medical information of 78.8 million people enrolled in Anthem and a series of related health care insurance brands.\nIn the case of health care records like the ones stolen from Anthem and other major U.S. health insurers, the financial consequences can be devastating, according to the lawmakers."}
