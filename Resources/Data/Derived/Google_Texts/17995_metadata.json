He is in his second season in the NBA as an undrafted player out of Belmont University.\n\nClark did most of his work, however, with Utah\u2019s D-League team, the Idaho Stampede. There, he averaged 14.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.1 steals in 32.0 minutes per game.\n\nAt his best, Clark has shown the ability to be a knock-down shooter, though he didn\u2019t get a significant opportunity to show that during his time with the Jazz. He\u2019ll likely also be part of the Nuggets\u2019 summer league team.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets claim guard Ian Clark off waivers", "title": "Nuggets claim guard Ian Clark off waivers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/28/nuggets-claim-guard-ian-clark-off-waivers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__458923752p1-1.jpg", "height": 473}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150328__458923752p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-28T15:26:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T15:32:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcae\"", "article_summary": "The Nuggets claimed guard Ian Clark off of waivers Saturday, bringing their roster up to a total of 14 players.\nThe 6-foot-3, 180-pound Clark made 23 appearances for the Jazz and averaged 1.9 points in 7.0 minutes per game.\nThere, he averaged 14.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.1 steals in 32.0 minutes per game.\nClark was waived two days ago by the Utah Jazz.\nClark did most of his work, however, with Utah\u2019s D-League team, the Idaho Stampede."}
