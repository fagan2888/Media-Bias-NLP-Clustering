The company also unveiled to the press its latest fulfillment center, where robot versions of Santa\u2019s elves, and some 80,000 seasonal workers, pack up and dispatch all those orders from customers.\n\nCool stuff, and clearly, Amazon.com isn\u2019t exactly struggling. On the other hand, the \u201cEverything Store\u201d may be approaching a turning point in its corporate life.\n\nThe company\u2019s stock is trading well below its highs of the year, at only $315 or so a share, down from above $400 in January and $360 as recently as the summer. And Moody\u2019s cut its ratings outlook for the online retailer\u2019s debt to negative, pointing out that it faces intensified competition from traditional rivals and its expenses are simply going to mount as it invests heavily to stay ahead of the pack.\n\nRelated: Amazon vs. Hachette \u2014 The Battle Is Over, the War Isn\u2019t\n\nIndeed, Amazon recently posted its worst loss in more than a decade, thanks in part to that outsized spending. A big part of the costs are going toward new technology, like those fulfillment center robots. If you think that it\u2019s a coincidence that the flurry of publicity for Amazon\u2019s tech hit the airwaves just ahead of Cyber-Monday and so soon after the news of the company\u2019s big losses, well, there\u2019s this bridge in Brooklyn that I can let you have for far less than the cost of a board lot of Amazon stock.\n\nAmazon is at a point now where it needs to sustain customer loyalty, while at the same time reassure its investors that all that money that is being spent is being put to good use. Up until now, Amazon\u2019s shareholders have given founder and CEO Jeff Bezos a remarkable degree of latitude, more or less content (depending on the specifics of each quarter) to sacrifice growth in profitability for big gains in revenue.\n\nThis last quarter, however, was too much for some. A 20 percent increase in revenue? Great. But accompanied by a net loss of $437 million, the largest in 14 years? Whoa, Nelly. It forces usually short-term oriented investors to ask themselves just how long they are willing to wait in order for Bezos to achieve his goal of global retail domination \u2014 and perhaps to question whether that goal is really achievable. The quarter was enough for hedge fund manager David Einhorn to add Amazon to his \u201cbubble portfolio\u201d as a short position.\n\nRelated: Bezos Defends Amazon\u2019s Lack of Profits\n\nIf it were just the dollars and cents, perhaps investors would be less jittery. But around the margins, there are signs that Amazon\u2019s once-dominant position is more vulnerable. Witness the world of the Kindle and its related products, where Amazon was a first mover or has attempted to challenge established incumbents.\n\nAmazon got its start selling books, so it\u2019s logical that it would try to become the first to popularize an e-book reader, as it did when it launched the first Kindle in 2007. Ugly and expensive ($400), the device by today\u2019s standards looks clunky and slow \u2014 but it beat Apple to the market and established Amazon as the first place to go to for e-books. Amazon now has a 65 percent share of the e-book market and its dominance is almost unchallenged, as Apple discovered to its cost.\n\nThis autumn, we entered the seventh generation of Kindle products, with the advent of the Kindle Voyage (see the related review) and Amazon is marketing a third generation of its Kindle Fire devices, which can be used as tablets or to stream digital media purchased via Amazon.\n\nIn recent weeks, Amazon customers have seen a steady stream of special offers encouraging them to snap up another Kindle, or to upgrade from the one they have.

Buy a Kindle Fire at a discount price, and get a six-month subscription to Kindle Unlimited (a $60 value) as well!\n\nRelated: 3 Exciting Moves from Amazon Coming This Year\n\nThese and other special offers haven\u2019t been confined to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and they don\u2019t seem to be aimed solely at sparking holiday gift-giving. Rather, the intent seems to be to keep folks buying older-model Kindles even as Amazon roles out the new seventh generation Voyages, and to convince them to consume more content by signing up for Prime (now $99 a year, offering digital video and music) and Kindle Unlimited (books, at $120 a year). The good folks at Amazon just loaded, unsolicited, The Washington Post\u2019s app onto my Kindle Fire for the next six months \u2014 free. (Bezos is the Post\u2019s new owner.)\n\nHow many Kindles can Amazon customers buy, and how much content do they want to consume? When it comes to both, I\u2019m probably an outlier \u2014 I want to try the latest e-reader technology as soon as possible, and have owned every Kindle device (other than the Kindle Touch, and each iteration of the Fire tablets) since the Kindle 1, acquired in 2008. Even so, my orders for new content are falling. This year, the number of digital orders I placed with Amazon (which include orders for free books and for heavily discounted \u201cKindle Daily Deals\u201d) fell below 300 for the first time, and probably will end up being half that of two years ago.\n\nAt the tablet end of the device market, Apple is nipping at Amazon\u2019s heels, and it isn\u2019t alone. Unlike the market for e-book readers, the tablet domain never belonged to Amazon\u2019s Kindles: Apple owns about 80 percent of this market today, with Amazon, Samsung, and Google trailing behind. Amazon\u2019s goal in what remains an ultra-competitive market is to offer consumers a product that is priced at a break-even level (rather than Apple\u2019s premium-priced iPads), stuffed with features \u2014 a higher-resolution screen , a Mayday feature giving them the ability to access live tech support.\n\nBut not all of Amazon\u2019s big, costly ideas have been hits. The company\u2019s first stab at creating its own smartphone \u2014 the Fire Phone, which would (what a coincidence) steer its owners directly to Amazon for their shopping \u2014 was a high-profile failure, forcing the company to take a $170 million writeoff on unsold inventory. Its latest bright idea, the Amazon Echo, a speaker/voice control system, is \u201ctoo much of a work in progress\u201d to recommend at its $199 list price, CNET wrote in the item\u2019s first major review, published Monday.\n\nRelated: Why Amazon\u2019s $1 Billion Deal for Twitch Was Totally Worth It\n\nAnd as Amazon\u2019s ambitions grow \u2014 as it tries to hang on to its customers, to get them purchasing more, whether by upgrading to the newest device or persuading them to try a newly launched service like Amazon Fresh \u2014 the sheer breadth and scope of its ambitions are starting to alienate customers.\n\nIn England, thousands are signing up with Amazon Anonymous, pledging to do their holiday shopping anywhere but with Amazon, citing (among other factors) the working conditions at the company\u2019s warehouses. Some of the same concerns are getting more attention in the United States as well, even as the long-running dispute between Amazon and Hachette over e-book pricing have caused others to abandon the site. And as I\u2019ve written about before, Franklin Foer of The New Republic recently published a damning and widely read argument that \u201cAmazon Must Be Stopped.\u201d\n\nAmazon needs to find a way to remind customers of what it was when it was young and scrappy, delivering the joy of instant gratification without the threat of being a \u201cBig Brother\u201d monopolist or oligopolist. It also needs to find a way to convince shareholders that it takes their concerns seriously. It\u2019s hard to tell which is more important, or which will be tougher to accomplish.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amazon\u2019s public relations machine was in overdrive early this week, as the company ann", "title": "Amazon Needs to Wow Investors and Customers Again", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/04/Amazon-Needs-Wow-Investors-and-Customers-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/06202014_Jeff_Bezos_Amazon_Fire.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/12/04/Amazon-Needs-Wow-Investors-and-Customers-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/06202014_Jeff_Bezos_Amazon_Fire.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Amazon\u2019s public relations machine was in overdrive early this week, as the company ann", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "How many Kindles can Amazon customers buy, and how much content do they want to consume?\nIn recent weeks, Amazon customers have seen a steady stream of special offers encouraging them to snap up another Kindle, or to upgrade from the one they have.\nAmazon now has a 65 percent share of the e-book market and its dominance is almost unchallenged, as Apple discovered to its cost.\nAt the tablet end of the device market, Apple is nipping at Amazon\u2019s heels, and it isn\u2019t alone.\nBut not all of Amazon\u2019s big, costly ideas have been hits."}
