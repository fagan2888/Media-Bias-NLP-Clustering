A man is arrested Saturday near downtown Wichita after chasing down a teenager with a knife and threatening to stab him.

It happened at about 6:10 p.m. near the intersection of Broadway and Murdoch. That's about a block west of Via Christi St. Francis hospital.

A 16-year-old boy told police he was confronted by a 28-year-old man regarding an argument between the two from several days before. The alleged victim said he then ran away down the street when older man then threatened to stab him.

The older man gave chase. When the victim stopped running and looked behind the man was trailing him holding a knife. The boy told police a bystander was able to diffuse the situation.

Following their arrival officers spotted the suspect riding by on a bicycle. He was stopped and taken into custody on charges of aggravated assault, criminal threats, possession of methamphetamine, paraphernalia, resisting arrest and outstanding warrants.

The boy was not hurt.
