The Russian military drills comprise 40,000 troops, more than 41 warships, 15 submarines and 110 aircraft and helicopters, according to RIA news agency.\n\nThe TU-22M3 is capable of carrying the Kh-22 anti-ship missile, which was designed by the Soviet Union to target U.S. warships and is capable of carrying both conventional and nuclear warheads.\n\nRussia\u2019s military exercises began Monday and are scheduled to last until Saturday. The stated intent of the mobilization, according to Russian defense officials, is to evaluate Russia\u2019s northern defenses and the capabilities of its Northern Fleet.\n\n\u201cNew challenges and threats of military security demand the further heightening of military capabilities of the armed forces and special attention will be paid to the state of the newly formed strategic merging (of forces) in the North,\u201d said Russian Defense Minister Gen. Sergey Shoigu, according to Russian news outlet Sputnik.\n\nRussia also announced this week the deployment of Iskander tactical ballistic missile systems to the Kaliningrad region, according to TASS. The Iskander missile system has a range up to about 300 miles and is designed to carry both conventional and nuclear warheads.\n\nThe deployment of nuclear platforms within striking distance of NATO forces during this week\u2019s drills highlights the role of nuclear weapons in Russia\u2019s national security strategy, said Michaela Dodge, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cRussia does think about NATO as one of its primary adversaries, threatens NATO allies with a nuclear attack, and states that nuclear weapons use can be de-escalatory under some circumstances,\u201d Dodge said.\n\n\u201cProvided that we have a good insight into what the Russian troops are doing in the field,\u201d Dodge added, \u201copportunities for miscalculations should be low.\u201d\n\nIn an interview aired on Russian television Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had considered putting his nuclear arsenal on alert if U.S. or NATO had intervened in Russia\u2019s March 2014 annexation of Crimea.\n\n\u201cWe were ready to do that,\u201d Putin replied when asked if he was willing to put his nuclear arsenal on alert. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think no one wanted to start a world conflict.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s exercises this week parallel several high-profile NATO operations, underscoring the escalation of tensions to levels not seen since the Cold War.\n\nOn March 9, Norway, a NATO member country, launched a military exercise in the northern region of Finnmark, which borders Russia\u2019s Murmansk Oblast.\n\nThe exercise, called \u201cJoint Viking,\u201d comprises 5,000 Norwegian military personnel.\n\nIn another NATO operation, a convoy of U.S. Army Stryker armored fighting vehicles is set to depart Saturday for a 1,100-mile journey across Eastern Europe.\n\nThe operation, named Dragoon Ride, is part of a ratcheted-up U.S. military presence across Eastern Europe in response to Russia\u2019s involvement in the ongoing Ukraine conflict as well as other recent provocations such as repeated flybys of NATO countries by Russian warplanes and the infiltration of Russian submarines into Swedish territorial waters.\n\nAs part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, the U.S. Air Force recently deployed 12 A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft to Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany and forward deployed F-16 fighters to Amari Air Base, Estonia and Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base, Romania.\n\nDespite the tit-for-tat military exercises with NATO and the deployment of nuclear weapons platforms, Russia\u2019s actions this week are probably not a serious threat to the alliance, said Luke Coffey, Margaret Thatcher fellow at The Heritage Foundation.\n\nI do not think that these exercises and troop movements are anything more than posturing,\u201d says @LukeDCoffey\n\n\u201cAt this point I do not think that these exercises and troop movements are anything more than posturing,\u201d said Coffey, a U.S. Army veteran. \u201cNevertheless, it is important that NATO keeps an eye on Russia\u2019s actions in the region. After the invasion of Ukraine and the illegal annexation of Crimea nothing can be completely ruled out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russian defense officials said this week that supersonic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons will be deployed to Crimea.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Russian defense officials said this week that supersonic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons will be deployed to Crimea.", "title": "Russia Sends Nuclear-Capable Bombers to Crimea", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/bomber.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:15:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BaTRAg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Russian defense officials said this week that supersonic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons will be deployed to Crimea.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/bomber.jpg"}, "title": "Russia Sends Nuclear-Capable Bombers to Crimea", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Ukraine", "published_time": "2015-03-20T10:26:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:15:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, Russia, NATO, Operation Atlantic Resolve, Dragoon Ride, Putin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc9d\"", "article_summary": "The Russian military drills comprise 40,000 troops, more than 41 warships, 15 submarines and 110 aircraft and helicopters, according to RIA news agency.\nRussia\u2019s military exercises began Monday and are scheduled to last until Saturday.\nKYIV, Ukraine\u2014As NATO and Russia simultaneously launch military exercises stretching from Eastern Europe into the Arctic, Russian defense officials said this week that supersonic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons will be deployed to Crimea.\nRussia also announced this week the deployment of Iskander tactical ballistic missile systems to the Kaliningrad region, according to TASS.\n\u201cRussia does think about NATO as one of its primary adversaries, threatens NATO allies with a nuclear attack, and states that nuclear weapons use can be de-escalatory under some circumstances,\u201d Dodge said."}
