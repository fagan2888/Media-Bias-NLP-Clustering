The law\u2019s pub\u00adlic stand\u00ading re\u00admains only equi\u00advoc\u00adal, the poll found, but it also re\u00admains largely stable \u2014 not only with the coun\u00adtry over\u00adall, but among most of the key sub\u00adgroups. And giv\u00aden everything that\u2019s happened lately, that trend may rep\u00adres\u00adent the best the be\u00adlea\u00adguered White House can hope for now.\n\nThe United Tech\u00adno\u00adlo\u00adgies/Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal Con\u00adgres\u00adsion\u00adal Con\u00adnec\u00adtion Poll, con\u00adduc\u00adted by Prin\u00adceton Sur\u00advey Re\u00adsearch As\u00adso\u00adci\u00adates In\u00adter\u00adna\u00adtion\u00adal, sur\u00adveyed 1,013 adults by land\u00adline and cell phone from Nov. 14-17. It has a mar\u00adgin of er\u00adror of plus or minus 3.6 per\u00adcent\u00adage points.\n\nAmid all of the tur\u00admoil sur\u00adround\u00ading the law, sol\u00adid ma\u00adjor\u00adit\u00adies of Amer\u00adic\u00adans con\u00adtin\u00adue to say they be\u00adlieve it will \u201cmake things bet\u00adter\u201d for people who do not have health in\u00adsur\u00adance (63 per\u00adcent) and the poor (59 per\u00adcent). Only about one-third thought the law would \u201cmake things \u201c\u00a6 worse\u201d for each group. In each case, that\u2019s a slight im\u00adprove\u00adment in the over\u00adall judg\u00adment since the Ju\u00adly poll. Back then, 58 per\u00adcent thought the law would help the un\u00adin\u00adsured and 55 per\u00adcent be\u00adlieved it would be\u00adne\u00adfit the poor.\n\nThese res\u00adults re\u00adflect a broad con\u00adsensus. In the new sur\u00advey, sol\u00adid ma\u00adjor\u00adit\u00adies of Demo\u00adcrats, in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adents, non\u00adwhites, and both col\u00adlege-edu\u00adcated and non\u00adcol\u00adlege whites say the law will help the un\u00adin\u00adsured; ma\u00adjor\u00adit\u00adies of each of those groups ex\u00adcept whites without col\u00adlege de\u00adgrees also say it will help the poor (and even a 49 per\u00adcent plur\u00adal\u00adity of those non\u00adcol\u00adlege whites agree). Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans were more du\u00adbi\u00adous, but even so, 47 per\u00adcent thought the law would help the un\u00adin\u00adsured and 42 per\u00adcent be\u00adlieved it would be\u00adne\u00adfit the poor.\n\nThese res\u00adults are a mixed bless\u00ading for the law\u2019s sup\u00adport\u00aders, though, be\u00adcause the poll also finds that most Amer\u00adic\u00adans, es\u00adpe\u00adcially whites, are much more du\u00adbi\u00adous that the law will be\u00adne\u00adfit broad\u00ader groups in the coun\u00adtry, or their own fam\u00adil\u00adies. That con\u00adfounds the an\u00adti\u00adcip\u00ada\u00adtion of Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic strategists who have hoped for dec\u00adades that health care re\u00adform could re\u00adverse the skep\u00adti\u00adcism among many voters, par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly middle-class whites, that Wash\u00ading\u00adton can de\u00adliv\u00ader tan\u00adgible be\u00adne\u00adfits in their own lives.\n\nRe\u00adl\u00adat\u00adively few voters, es\u00adpe\u00adcially whites, are an\u00adti\u00adcip\u00adat\u00ading such be\u00adne\u00adfits from the health care law, the poll found. Over\u00adall, just 33 per\u00adcent said they ex\u00adpec\u00adted the law will make things bet\u00adter for \u201cpeople like you and your fam\u00adily,\u201d while 49 per\u00adcent said they thought it would make things worse. That was little changed since Ju\u00adly (when those polled split 35 per\u00adcent pos\u00adit\u00adive to 46 per\u00adcent neg\u00adat\u00adive). But the res\u00adults con\u00adtin\u00adued the de\u00adcline since Septem\u00adber 2012, just be\u00adfore Obama\u2019s reelec\u00adtion, when a nar\u00adrow 43 per\u00adcent to 40 per\u00adcent plur\u00adal\u00adity ex\u00adpec\u00adted the law to im\u00adprove their per\u00adson\u00adal health care.\n\nThe latest res\u00adult con\u00adtin\u00adued the stark ra\u00adcial split on this crit\u00adic\u00adal ques\u00adtion. Minor\u00adit\u00adies, by a 51 per\u00adcent to 30 per\u00adcent mar\u00adgin, thought the law was more likely to make things bet\u00adter than worse for their fam\u00adil\u00adies. That rep\u00adres\u00aden\u00adted a small de\u00adteri\u00ador\u00ada\u00adtion (with\u00adin the mar\u00adgin of er\u00adror) for Obama since Ju\u00adly, but main\u00adtained a huge gulf in at\u00adti\u00adtudes com\u00adpared with whites. Just 25 per\u00adcent of whites said they be\u00adlieved the law would im\u00adprove con\u00addi\u00adtions for their fam\u00adily; nearly three-fifths of whites (58 per\u00adcent) thought it would make things worse for them. (That also rep\u00adres\u00aden\u00adted only a small de\u00adteri\u00ador\u00ada\u00adtion, also with\u00adin the mar\u00adgin of er\u00adror, since Ju\u00adly.) Only about one-fifth of whites without a col\u00adlege de\u00adgree, a group con\u00adsist\u00adently tough on Obama, thought the law would make things bet\u00adter for them; but so did only about one-third of col\u00adlege-edu\u00adcated whites, a con\u00adstitu\u00adency usu\u00adally more open to him. Minor\u00adit\u00adies and whites re\u00admain starkly di\u00advided as to whom will be\u00adne\u00adfit from the pres\u00adid\u00adent\u2019s health care plan.\n\nIn\u00addeed, Obama faces skep\u00adti\u00adcism about the law\u2019s per\u00adson\u00adal im\u00adpact from two groups cent\u00adral to his co\u00adali\u00adtion. While Monday\u2019s poll res\u00adults found little sup\u00adport for re\u00adpeal\u00ading the health care law among mil\u00adlen\u00adni\u00adals and col\u00adlege-edu\u00adcated white wo\u00admen, just un\u00adder half of re\u00adspond\u00adents in each group thought the law would make things worse, rather than bet\u00adter, for their own fam\u00adil\u00adies. Only 31 per\u00adcent of the well-edu\u00adcated white wo\u00admen, and 37 per\u00adcent of young adults un\u00adder 30, thought the law would make things bet\u00adter for them.\n\nThe sur\u00advey also pro\u00adduced ad\u00adverse judg\u00adments on what the law will mean for oth\u00ader groups. Just 39 per\u00adcent said the law will be\u00adne\u00adfit the middle class, while 53 per\u00adcent said it would harm it. That was also down sig\u00adni\u00adfic\u00adantly since Septem\u00adber 2012, but es\u00adsen\u00adtially un\u00adchanged since last Ju\u00adly when re\u00adspond\u00adents split 36 per\u00adcent pos\u00adit\u00adive to 49 per\u00adcent neg\u00adat\u00adive.\n\nLike\u00adwise in the new poll, 40 per\u00adcent said Obama\u00adcare would make things bet\u00adter for seni\u00adors, while 45 per\u00adcent thought it would make things worse. Again that was vir\u00adtu\u00adally un\u00adchanged since Ju\u00adly, but also a fall since Septem\u00adber 2012. Both in Ju\u00adly and in the new poll, the share of whites over 50 who said the law would make things worse for seni\u00adors was about double the por\u00adtion that ex\u00adpec\u00adted im\u00adprove\u00adments.\n\nFa\u00admil\u00adi\u00adar polit\u00adic\u00adal di\u00advides re\u00adsur\u00adfaced over the law\u2019s im\u00adpact on the na\u00adtion as a whole. Only 42 per\u00adcent said it would make things bet\u00adter for \u201cthe coun\u00adtry over\u00adall,\u201d while 51 per\u00adcent said it would make things worse. This meas\u00adure too de\u00adclined from Septem\u00adber 2012 to Ju\u00adly, but hasn\u2019t changed much since.\n\nOn this ques\u00adtion, Obama con\u00adtin\u00adues to face enorm\u00adous skep\u00adti\u00adcism from groups tra\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adally crit\u00adic\u00adal of him (about two-thirds of non\u00adcol\u00adlege whites, just over three-fifths of rur\u00adal res\u00adid\u00adents, and nearly three-fifths of whites above 50 thought it would make things worse for the coun\u00adtry). But, com\u00adpared with the ques\u00adtion about the law\u2019s per\u00adson\u00adal im\u00adpact, the pres\u00adid\u00adent ral\u00adlied more sup\u00adport from groups fa\u00advor\u00adable to him, with nearly three-fifths of minor\u00adit\u00adies and al\u00admost ex\u00adactly half of col\u00adlege whites say\u00ading the law would do more to make things bet\u00adter than worse for the coun\u00adtry over\u00adall. (Only about two-fifths of mil\u00adlen\u00adni\u00adals, though, agreed.)\n\nOn both sides of that di\u00advide, the res\u00adults showed little change since last Ju\u00adly. All of that adds to the sense from this week\u2019s poll that the health care law con\u00adtin\u00adues to face power\u00adful doubts, but isn\u2019t yet fa\u00adcing the col\u00adlapse of its pub\u00adlic sup\u00adport (par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly with\u00adin the Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic co\u00adali\u00adtion) or a crest\u00ading of op\u00adpos\u00adi\u00adtion that could ig\u00adnite a le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive stam\u00adpede to\u00adward re\u00adpeal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll finds public opinion on the health law remarkably steady despite rollout troubles.", "title": "Poll: Americans Think Obamacare Will Help the Poor, Not the Country", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/66271/poll-americans-think-obamacare-will-help-poor-not-country", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/10/11/183983906.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2013/10/11/183983906.jpg"}, "title": "Poll: Americans Think Obamacare Will Help the Poor, Not the Country", "description": "United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll finds public opinion on the health law remarkably steady despite rollout troubles.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nationaljournal"}, "description": "United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll finds public opinion on the health law remarkably steady despite rollout troubles.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9b0\"", "article_summary": "Only 42 per\u00adcent said it would make things bet\u00adter for \u201cthe coun\u00adtry over\u00adall,\u201d while 51 per\u00adcent said it would make things worse.\nBack then, 58 per\u00adcent thought the law would help the un\u00adin\u00adsured and 55 per\u00adcent be\u00adlieved it would be\u00adne\u00adfit the poor.\nLike\u00adwise in the new poll, 40 per\u00adcent said Obama\u00adcare would make things bet\u00adter for seni\u00adors, while 45 per\u00adcent thought it would make things worse.\nRe\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans were more du\u00adbi\u00adous, but even so, 47 per\u00adcent thought the law would help the un\u00adin\u00adsured and 42 per\u00adcent be\u00adlieved it would be\u00adne\u00adfit the poor.\nOnly about one-third thought the law would \u201cmake things \u201c\u00a6 worse\u201d for each group."}
