(Photo: ~File)\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK Three former employees of a Highland Park day-care center were placed on probationary terms after they were charged with failing to adequately care for a nine-week old boy who died at the facility, Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey said Friday in a statement.\n\nTanya Choy, 36, of Martinsville, was placed on a three-year probationary term known as Pre-Trial Intervention after pleading guilty to a count of endangering the welfare of the child, admitting that she placed the infant face-down in a crib at the Above and Beyond Child Care Center on South Third Avenue in Highland Park and failed to check on the welfare of the infant, who died on Sept. 10, 2014.\n\nHer co-workers, Lorie McDermott, 49, of Milltown, and Blanca Jimenez, 61, of Edison, who also had been charged with child endangerment, were admitted to PTI for two years.\n\nEach of the three is required to pay the infant\u2019s family $1,704.01 in restitution to cover some family expenses.\n\nThe charges will be dismissed for each of the defendants upon successful completion of the program.\n\nThe three were admitted to the program following agreements reached with Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Lisa Miralles Walsh. The agreements were approved in New Brunswick by Superior Court Judge Diane Pincus.\n\nThe defendants were charged following an investigation by Detective Don Newton of the Highland Park Police Department and Detective Sgt. Frank DiNinno of the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\n\nThe investigation began when Highland Park police were dispatched to the day-care center and arrived to find that the infant was nonresponsive.\n\nPolice rushed the infant to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nSudden Infant Death was determined to be the cause. A contributing factor was that the infant was placed on his stomach and left unattended for two hours.\n\nStaff Writer Susan Loyer: 732-565-7243; sloyer@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1UMwgAe", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Three former employees of the Above and Beyond Child Care Center in Highland Park were admitted into the PTI program", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Three former employees of the Above and Beyond Child Care Center in Highland Park were admitted into the PTI program", "title": "Charges may be dropped in Highland Park day-care death", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2015/09/11/charges-may-dropped-highland-park-day-care-death/72086284/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three former employees of the Above and Beyond Child Care Center in Highland Park were admitted into the PTI program", "title": "Charges may be dropped in Highland Park day-care death", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/13235c6ced93f668c45769e9ef7e48b579016491/c=50-0-350-300&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/11/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635775875406954010-gavel.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Highland Park, Above and Beyond Child Care Center, Tanya Choy, Lorie McDermott, Blanca Jimenez"}, "article_summary": "The defendants were charged following an investigation by Detective Don Newton of the Highland Park Police Department and Detective Sgt.\nThree former employees of a day care center were admitted into the PTI programThree former employees of a Highland Park day care get PTI.\nThe investigation began when Highland Park police were dispatched to the day-care center and arrived to find that the infant was nonresponsive.\nThe three were admitted to the program following agreements reached with Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor Lisa Miralles Walsh.\nFrank DiNinno of the Middlesex County Prosecutor\u2019s Office."}
