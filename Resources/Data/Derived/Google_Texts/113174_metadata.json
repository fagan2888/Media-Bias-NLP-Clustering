The number of Americans experiencing pain in the last year of life actually increased by nearly 12 percent between 1998 and 2010, according to a study released Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. In addition, depression in the last year of life increased by more than 26 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s the case even though guidelines and quality measures for end-of-life care were developed, the number of palliative-care programs rose and hospice use doubled between 2000 and 2009.\n\n>> Caregiving Questions? We\u2019ve Got All Your Answers Here \u2014 AARP Caregiving Resource Center\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put a lot of work into this, and it\u2019s not yielding what we thought it should be yielding. So what do we do now?\u201d asked study author Joanne Lynn, M.D., who directs the Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness at the Altarum Institute.\n\nThe study looked at 7,204 patients who died while enrolled in the national Health and Retirement Study, a survey of Americans over age 50. After each participant\u2019s death, a family member was asked questions about the person\u2019s end-of-life experience, including whether the person suffered pain, depression or periodic confusion. Those three symptoms were all found to have become more prevalent over the 10-year analysis.\n\nOne reason, Lynn said, is that doctors are using a greater range of high-tech treatments, which can lengthen the process of dying without curing the patient. \u201cWe throw more medical treatment at patients who are on their way to dying, which keeps them in a difficult situation for much, much longer,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve increased the number of people put on ventilators and kept in hospitals, and we simply have more treatments that are possible to offer.\u201d\n\nThe majority of our research, she added, focuses on wiping out diseases, rather than long-term supports or symptom management for people with chronic conditions or disabilities associated with aging: \u201cThink about how much we invest in curing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and how little we put into making the course of Alzheimer\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nMost physicians tend to undertreat pain and other symptoms at the end of life because they don\u2019t recognize them or are hesitant to talk candidly about the process of dying and the pain associated with it, said Tim Ihrig, a palliative-care physician at UnityPoint Health in Fort Dodge, Iowa.\n\n\u201cA lot of practitioners aren\u2019t honest. We fail to empower patients with the truth,\u201d said Ihrig. \u201cIn that setting, it\u2019s easier to continue to do procedures and diagnostics rather than having that conversation, which is very honest and very difficult.\u201d\n\nTake a cancer patient who has stopped eating and is writhing in pain, he said. An oncologist might recognize that the person is going to die, but rather than telling the patient, he or she begins another round of treatment that causes more pain and suffering.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the vernacular in our society to have the conversation about the end of life. People say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to take away someone\u2019s hope.\u2019 But in a metastatic pancreatic cancer, for example, we have to redefine what we mean by hope,\u201d he said, citing one of the most deadly cancers.\n\nOften, those conversations aren\u2019t happening until the last days or hours of life, according to Ihrig.\n\nJonathan Keyserling, a senior vice president with the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, points out that half of all hospice patients receive hospice care for less than 30 days.\n\n\u201cIf these patients had been under the care of a hospice or palliative-care program [earlier], their pain and symptoms could have been brought under control for a much longer and sustained period of time,\u201d Keyserling said via email.\n\nIt\u2019s possible, however, that caregivers interviewed in the study simply reported more suffering, reflecting Americans\u2019 changing awareness of pain and depression over the past decade.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve raised the expectation of better pain management over the years, which may make [the caregivers interviewed] more likely to report it,\u201d said Rosemary Gibson, author of The Treatment Trap and senior adviser at the Hastings Center, a bioethics think tank based in Garrison, New York. There are many more Americans diagnosed with depression today than in 1998, she added, \u201cso it\u2019s not surprising that people would report it more.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Gibson said, the country has a long way to go in improving care at the end of life. The increase in palliative care and hospice use over the past decade was just \u201can oasis in the desert. We did nothing to stop the tsunami of overuse [of aggressive treatments] and doing things to people at the end of life that have no benefit.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to pick up the speed of change, said study author Joanne Lynn. \u201cWe are all going to pass through this part of our lives, and we have a strong interest in its not being awful. So let\u2019s buckle down and get it right.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Kliim/iStock\n\nThis article was produced by Kaiser Health News with support from the SCAN Foundation.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s been more than 15 years since the Institute of Medicine released its seminal 1997 report detailing the suffering many Americans experience at the end of life and offering sweeping recommendations on how to improve care.
