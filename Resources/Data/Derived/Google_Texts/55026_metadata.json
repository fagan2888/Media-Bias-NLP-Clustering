Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah Medicaid expansion \u2013 Healthy Utah -- and the GOP Utah House\u2019s plan called Utah Cares finds Healthy Utah provides six times the financial benefits.\n\nBut the House\u2019s expert on Medicaid expansion -- Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville \u2013 says the report is already outdated, biased and worth little in the current Medicaid expansion debate.\n\nThe Gang of Six \u2013 six GOP leaders Herbert rounded up after his Healthy Utah failed in the 2015 Legislature to find a Medicaid expansion compromise \u2013 has \u201calready move beyond\u201d Healthy Utah and Utah Cares, Dunnigan told a press conference he called to respond to the Healthy Utah advocates\u2019 press conference earlier Tuesday.\n\nDunnigan would only show shadows of the \u201cconcepts\u201d the Gang of Six is working on, adding that while he hopes and believes a special legislative session on Medicaid expansion could be called by Herbert later this year, it\u2019s possible the Six\u2019s compromise won\u2019t be ready for legislative debate until the 2016 general session, which starts in January.\n\nYou can read the new report \u2013 put together for Utah AARP, the Utah Health Policy Project and Voices for Utah Children \u2013 here.\n\nSven Wilson, the lead economist on the report, said: \u201cIn a nutshell, Healthy Utah provides six times the benefits that Utah Cares would.\u201d\n\nThe financial returns: 24:4 for Healthy Utah, 4.1 for Utah Cares, bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars extra for the state.\n\nIt has been said, and the new report emphasizes, it\u2019s a no-brainer for the benefit of Utah taxpayers \u2013 not to mention getting 66,000 low-income people health insurance \u2013 that Healthy Utah should be adopted post haste, says Wilson.\n\nIn fact, says Wilson, House GOP leaders (Dunnigan et al.) are just afraid that Healthy Utah will be a success \u2013 and then they will look bad for opposing it.\n\nDunnigan laughed at that idea: That House Republicans are afraid of the success of Healthy Utah and Obamacare\u2019s requirements to help poorer Americans buy subsidized health care.\n\n\u201cThat is so far away from the truth,\u201d said Dunnigan, \u201cthat it\u2019s not even worthy of a response.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m after good policy, trying to remove politics from this. That is silly\u201d to say House Republicans are afraid of the possible success of Healthy Utah.\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid of success,\u201d said Dunnigan.\n\nIn fact, the House\u2019s reluctance to adopt Healthy Utah \u2013 with no guarantees of financial or healthcare success \u2013 is an attempt to find something else that would be a success, not giving in to chance, he said earlier in his press briefing.\n\nUtahPolicy reported several weeks ago that House Speaker Greg Hughes, R-Draper, (who was not available Tuesday) is trying to find a solution within the Gang of Six whereby health providers in Utah make significant financial commitments to help the state pay for Medicaid expansion.\n\nEven better, says Hughes, would be the state turning over it\u2019s cost-matching \u2013 10 percent \u2013 to private healthcare providers, especially hospitals, and let them take the fed\u2019s 90 percent in matching funds and run the whole program.\n\n\u201cJust get us out of it,\u201d Hughes said referring to the state. \u201cI\u2019d take that.\u201d\n\nDunnigan confirmed Tuesday that the Gang of Six was talking to local health care providers about giving money toward Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like broad-based (financial) participation by providers,\u201d said Dunnigan.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, said Dunnigan, how much hospitals, doctors, and other medical care providers would make via Medicaid expansion in Utah.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I asked them that,\u201d but didn\u2019t get an answer, said Dunnigan.\n\nCertainly, he said, medical providers \u201cuncompensated care\u201d \u2013 costs billed to patients that are never paid \u2013 would decrease because low-income folks would be paying their medical bills under Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cTheir uncompensated care would decrease, and that would help their bottom line,\u201d said Dunnigan.\n\nAnd here\u2019s an interesting political twist:\n\n-- Wilson said that Utah Cares would only pay for primary care, not hospital stays or specialty care.\n\n\u201cOnly 6 percent of medical costs are primary care,\u201d he added.\n\nThat means 94 percent of a patient\u2019s care costs come from hospitals and such.\n\nAnd in dealing with the Utah Hospital Association \u2013 and trying to get them to pay for some of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion costs \u2013 the Gang of Six is dealing with former Lt. Gov. Greg Bell, the new president of the UHA.\n\nBell resigned his post \u2013 he was chosen by Herbert to be his LG several years ago \u2013 last year so he could earn some more money in the private sector.\n\nAnd now Herbert, Dunnigan, and the rest of the Six, are trying to get Bell and his association to pick up some of Medicaid expansion\u2019s costs.\n\nAin\u2019t Utah politics interesting.\n\nWhile the new Healthy Utah comparisons with Utah Cares may be interesting to some, said Dunnigan, they don't enter into the future legislative debate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outdated already,\u201d said Dunnigan. \u201cI hope they didn\u2019t pay too much for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re moving beyond\u201d comparisons between Healthy Utah and Utah Cares.\n\nThe Gang of Six\u2019s recommendation will be something else, Dunnigan said.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new economic study comparing Gov.
