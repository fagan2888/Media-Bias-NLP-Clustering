Market research firm Euromonitor International expects chocolate sales volumes to skyrocket by over 500 percent in India between 2005 and 2017, and over 140 percent in China.\n\nAt the same time, cocoa prices have more than doubled in the last 10 years. In an effort to produce more cocoa faster, Torres said a new problem is on the horizon.\n\n\"By planting more, we find new hybrid of cocoa, and by doing that we lose some quality. So the price of the very high-end chocolates rises even more,\" said Torres. Even though cocoa prices keep rising, Torres is reluctant to raise his chocolate prices at the same rate. \"We want to be the less expensive of the best makers,\" says Torres.\n\nHis profit margins have taken a hit, but he's still looking into ways to help costs, such as investing in more efficient equipment.\n\nAs for the health of the consumer Torres says \"what we see is that we have more sales, in number of sales \u2026 but the average price of sales is down a little bit.\"\n\nIn the future, Torres hopes to expand his company outside of New York, where he currently has nine retail stores and his 40,000-square-foot factory. Torres says he hopes to be in Boston later this year and is considering further expansion on the East Coast in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Chocolatier Jacques Torres tells CNBC why the world's surging hunger for chocolate is creating strains in the industry this holiday season.", "author": "Erin Barry", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Chocolatier Jacques Torres tells CNBC why the world's surging hunger for chocolate is creating strains in the industry this season.", "title": "Everyone loves chocolate\u2014and that's a problem", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/24/chocolate-lovers-send-demand-prices-soaring-retailer.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/02/09/102410074-chocolate.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chocolatier Jacques Torres tells CNBC why the world's surging hunger for chocolate is creating strains in the industry this season.", "title": "Chocolate lovers send demand, prices soaring: Retailer", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/24/chocolate-lovers-send-demand-prices-soaring-retailer.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/02/09/102410074-chocolate.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@erincstefanski", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "On The Money, Retail Sales, Food Retail, Food and Beverage, On The Money, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-03-26T14:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "On The Money", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T14:00:34-0400", "tag": "On The Money"}, "pageNodeId": 103492994, "news_keywords": "Chocolate, Jacques Torres, retail, food, NRF, Easter, Valentine's Day"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3af8\"", "article_summary": "Even though cocoa prices keep rising, Torres is reluctant to raise his chocolate prices at the same rate.\nAt the same time, cocoa prices have more than doubled in the last 10 years.\nMarket research firm Euromonitor International expects chocolate sales volumes to skyrocket by over 500 percent in India between 2005 and 2017, and over 140 percent in China.\nIn the future, Torres hopes to expand his company outside of New York, where he currently has nine retail stores and his 40,000-square-foot factory.\nBut it's not just Americans and Europeans who love chocolate, emerging markets such as China and India are whetting their appetite for the treat."}
