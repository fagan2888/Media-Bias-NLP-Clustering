Even institutions normally cautious about criticizing the government, including the Roman Catholic Church, have spoken out, and a Mexican protester even disrupted the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo, Norway, to draw attention to the tragedy.\n\n\u201cThe protests are an expression of people fed up with impunity, and indignant at the complicity between some authorities and criminals,\u201d said Luis Raul Gonzalez, president of the normally politic Human Rights Commission, speaking directly to Pena Nieto at a recent public event.\n\nWhen Pena Nieto took office two years ago, he promised Mexico would see a new Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which had ruled Mexico for 71 years, often through coercion and corruption. After losing the presidency in 2000, the party portrayed itself as repentant and reconstructed.\n\nDisillusioned by 12 years of opposition party rule, many Mexican voters returned to the PRI on the theory it at least knows how to govern.\n\nBut the purported \u201cnew PRI\u201d has turned out to be younger politicians operating with the old playbook. Though its leaders were lauded for passing reforms, they had nothing to fall back on when violence knocked them off their message of economic growth.\n\nThey sent police to crack down on protesters and called the unrest a plot to \u201cdestabilize\u201d the government and undermine the reforms.\n\nPena Nieto told the country it was time to \u201cmove beyond\u201d the case of the 43 students just weeks after their abduction, and he took a month to meet with their families.\n\nThe administration has tried to explain away the president\u2019s $7 million mansion by saying it belonged to his wife, former soap opera actress Angelica Rivera, and it said Treasury Secretary Luis Videgaray\u2019s bought his house before he officially took office, although he was part of Pena Nieto\u2019s transition team.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Analysis: Mexico scandals expose government without answers", "title": "Analysis: Mexico scandals expose government without answers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Analysis: Mexico scandals expose government without answers", "title": "Analysis: Mexico scandals expose government without answers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/05/analysis_mexico_scandals_expose_government_without_answers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/mexico-scandals-analysis.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Analysis: Mexico scandals expose government without answers", "title": "Analysis: Mexico scandals expose government without answers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/mexico-scandals-analysis.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katherine Corcoran", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde00\"", "article_summary": "When Pena Nieto took office two years ago, he promised Mexico would see a new Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which had ruled Mexico for 71 years, often through coercion and corruption.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsMEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 As he heads to Washington this week to meet with Barack Obama, Enrique Pena Nieto leaves behind a year that was hardly what he had envisioned.\nTens of thousands have taken to the streets since the 43 college students disappeared Sept. 26.\nPena Nieto told the country it was time to \u201cmove beyond\u201d the case of the 43 students just weeks after their abduction, and he took a month to meet with their families.\nDisillusioned by 12 years of opposition party rule, many Mexican voters returned to the PRI on the theory it at least knows how to govern."}
