(Photo: Freddie Herpin, Daily World)\n\nCars lined the shoulder of westbound U.S. 190 toward Eunice Saturday morning. The people who parked outside the Savoy Music Center carried in songs, instruments and memories.\n\nMany were the musicians with whom Cajun fiddler Milton Vanicor used to play. After they shared coffee, boudin links and Boudreaux jokes, they sat in a large, ragged ring around his customary chair at the weekly jam and serenaded his memory with some of his favorites.\n\n\u201cValse Criminelle\u201d (The Convict Waltz). \u201c\u2018Tit Yeux Noir\u201d (Little Black Eyes).\n\n\u201cJ\u2019ai Passe Devant Ta Porte\u201d (I walked past your door). That one became a heartfelt sing-along.\n\nA framed black-and-white photo of the fiddler occupied the chair. Vanicor, who continued to play in the traditional manner he learned as a boy, died in June, a couple of weeks shy of his 97th birthday.\n\nNearly 70 years separated him from one of the many guitarists in the room who described Vanicor as a good friend.\n\n\u201cHe played with my great-grandfather, (legendary Cajun songwriter) Iry LeJeune,\u201d said Kegan Navarre, a high school senior from Jennings.\n\n\u201cHe was a great person and a phenomenal fiddle player,\u201d Navarre said. \u201cHe was one of the best people to learn from.\u201d\n\nThe jam reflected generations of listening and learning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019so good to see the older musicians with the patience to teach the younger ones,\u201d said the fiddler\u2019s daughter Jeannette Aguillard, who drove from Lake Charles. \u201cIt\u2019s not far,\u201d she said, and later she and her sister Linda Marcantel took up guitars to join the jam.\n\nVanicor became a Saturday morning regular after his wife Odille died in 2008. In his final years, he won acclaim in the world beyond Acadiana for his CD \u201cUn Souvenir de Milton Vanicor\u201d and, as Ann Savoy put it, as \u201ca live wire\u201d at the jam sessions in her husband Marc\u2019s store.\n\nAnother regular, Terry Lieux, recalled that on his 95th birthday party in the store Vanicor \u201cdanced with all the women. He dances better than me, and he\u2019s older.\u201d\n\nThe organizers briefly interrupted the music for more formal tributes.\n\nMarc Savoy called Vanicor \u201cperhaps the last of the old-time Cajun fiddlers.\u201d\n\nCarl Brazell, a retired broadcasting executive who breaks out his accordion sometimes, said he couldn\u2019t get enough of Vanicor.\n\n\u201cFrom his early youth until the day he died, he played his fiddle with particular fervor,\u201d Brazell told the crowd. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let contemporary influences affect the way he played.\u201d\n\nThe mayor of Eunice, the lieutenant governor and the St. Landry Parish Tourism Commission sent proclamations.\n\n\u201cWhether he knew it or not, we were about to adopt Milton so he could vote for us,\u201d former Eunice mayor Curtis Joubert joked before he granted Vanicor, who lived in Welsh, honorary citizenship in the Prairie Cajun Capital of Louisiana and a key to the city of Eunice.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for visitors from far and wide to make pilgrimages to the Savoy Music Center. Saturday\u2019s tribute attracted Beatrice Vanicor Cormier, the fiddler\u2019s niece, for the first time.\n\n\u201cMy son said on Facebook there\u2019d be a little memorial for Milton, so of course I wanted to be here,\u201d she said as her brother Orsey Vanicor sweetened the tunes with his pedal steel guitar.\n\nShe hinted that this visit would not be her last. As Cormier laughed through tears, she exclaimed, \u201cOur Cajun roots are comin\u2019 out today!\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/2015/08/29/tunes-tears-tributes-milton-vanicor/71389528/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The Cajun fiddler who maintained a pure traditional style gets a heartfelt musical sendoff", "og": {"site_name": "The Advertiser", "description": "The Cajun fiddler who maintained a pure traditional style gets a heartfelt musical sendoff", "title": "Tunes, tears and tributes for Milton Vanicor", "url": "http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/2015/08/29/tunes-tears-tributes-milton-vanicor/71389528/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/theadvertiser.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Cajun fiddler who maintained a pure traditional style gets a heartfelt musical sendoff", "title": "Tunes, tears and tributes for Milton Vanicor", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5b568a0cb456d797278705ef126fedd383830a9e/c=452-0-1949-1497&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/29/LafayetteLA/B9318616316Z.1_20150829160504_000_G0PBOTI0K.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@theadvertiser", "site": "@theadvertiser", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=743844896", "fb": {"app_id": 150147415035780}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Many were the musicians with whom Cajun fiddler Milton Vanicor used to play.\nThe weekly jam session at the Savoy Music Center honored the late Cajun fiddler Milton Vanicor.\nThe people who parked outside the Savoy Music Center carried in songs, instruments and memories.\nIt\u2019s not unusual for visitors from far and wide to make pilgrimages to the Savoy Music Center.\nAs Cormier laughed through tears, she exclaimed, \u201cOur Cajun roots are comin\u2019 out today!\u201dRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/local/2015/08/29/tunes-tears-tributes-milton-vanicor/71389528/"}
