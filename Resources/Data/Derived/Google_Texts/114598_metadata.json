Where was all this affection over the last six years?\u201d\n\n[READ: Obama, Holder Hailed for Openness at Transparency Celebration]\n\nHolder was joking, sort of, especially compared with the heat Hill Democrats \u2013 and at least one outsider Republican \u2013 are putting on Republicans for blocking the appointment of the first African-American woman attorney general.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Congressional Black Caucus all but called the GOP holdup an act of racism, strongly suggesting that the all-white nearly all-white Republican Senate delegation doesn\u2019t want a black woman to become the nation\u2019s top cop.\n\n\"I think race certainly can be considered a major factor in the delay,\u201d Democratic Rep. G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, the caucus\u2019 chairman, told reporters on a press call.\n\nSurprisingly, though, Butterfield didn\u2019t break new ground with that insinuation. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., went off about it back in February, when Lynch\u2019s holding pattern had stretched a mere 100 days or so.\n\n[ALSO: Loretta Lynch Embraces Eric Holder's Legacy on Civil Rights]\n\n\"I would think, as we approach the 50th anniversary of Selma, that Republicans should be more sensitive about what they're doing to this woman,\" Durbin said. \u201cShe's being held up for no substantive reason. That's not an implication. That's a statement. You can't celebrate civil rights and ignore the reality that one of the most important civil rights milestones, the appointment of an African-American attorney general, is being held up for no good reason.\"\n\nThe civil rights comparison Durbin drew \u2013 one he took even further Wednesday by saying Republicans had put Lynch \u201cin the back of the bus\u201d \u2013 was more than appropriate. After all, the same GOP Senate leader \u2013 Mitch McConnell of Kentucky \u2013 who\u2019s holding up the Lynch vote didn\u2019t celebrate civil rights, at least not in person, when the Bloody Sunday anniversary in Selma, Alabama, rolled around a week and a half ago.\n\nBottom line: Both Holder \u2013 who\u2019s tacitly suggested that race was a factor in the way congressional Republicans treated him \u2013 and Lynch, whom others imply is the victim of racism, are stuck in neutral for the moment, unless and until Senate Republicans change their ways.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "As Loretta Lynch Languishes, Eric Holder Feels the GOP Love", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "At a think tank event, the outgoing attorney general quips: How can they miss me if they won\u2019t let me leave?", "title": "As Loretta Lynch Languishes, Eric Holder Feels the GOP Love", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/03/18/as-loretta-lynch-languishes-eric-holder-feels-the-gop-love", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/20/c2/49c0b4e54d698a2193ca1d6bfbff/150318-holder-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At a think tank event, the outgoing attorney general quips: How can they miss me if they won\u2019t let me leave?", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "As Loretta Lynch Languishes, Eric Holder Feels the GOP Love"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "March 18, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
