Don\u2019t vote for me.\u201d\n\nLittle about Kasich\u2019s message is standard political operating procedure. He is more apt to mention God on the campaign trail than he is his Democratic opponents, much less his Republican ones.\n\n\u201cThis is not a political speech \u2014 this is a life talk,\u201d Kasich told workers at a warehouse in the town of Bow, observing that \u201cthe Lord has put his hand on me for some reason. But he\u2019s got his hand on everybody in this room if you let him.\u201d Then he wondered, \u201cWhat do you think? Am I out of my mind here telling you this stuff?\u201d\n\nHis style is folksy and meandering, bordering at times on goofy. One minute he\u2019s talking about streamlining government regulations, the next he\u2019s musing about parking. \u201cYou ever notice, you\u2019re at a crowded mall and somebody\u2019s getting ready to back out. And you\u2019re waiting there? Did you ever notice how long it takes them to leave that space? Huh?\u201d\n\nKasich has a reputation for prickliness, yet he seems the happiest warrior on the 2016 campaign trail, with a message that is distinctly populist and bipartisan. The Kasich stump speech invariably begins with his roots: his mailman father, his coal-miner grandfather who died of black lung, his grandmother who could barely speak English.\n\n\u201cI come from a blue-collar Democrat town, and all the people I grew up with, most of them are doing exactly what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Kasich told the workers in Bow. \u201cSo ... who do you think I respond to? You, or rich people?\u201d\n\nIf elected, \u201cMy job is to make sure that the lives of people just like you get better,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI happen to be a Republican, but so what? The Republican party is my vehicle, not my master.\u201d\n\nIf any state is made for Kasich, it is New Hampshire, where independent voters make up the biggest chunk of likely voters \u2014 more than 40 percent \u2014 and are free to vote in either primary. In addition, even in this angry year, this is not a particularly angry state; unemployment is down to 3.1 percent.\n\nAll this presents a potential opening for Kasich, one that might be bearing fruit. He is running second in the Real Clear Politics average of polls in the state, far behind Trump and closely bunched with Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.\n\nOne measure of his tenuous new stature: Right to Rise, the super PAC backing Jeb Bush, just launched a television ad attacking Kasich as \u201cwrong on New Hampshire issues.\u201d The harder challenge, if Kasich were to do well here, lies ahead, but that\u2019s a headache he would be glad to suffer. The theory of the Kasich case is to do well enough to pick up delegates along the Southern coast, concentrate on Virginia, Massachusetts, Vermont and Tennessee among Super Tuesday states, and aim to score big in Michigan the next week.\n\nKasich is only a moderate, rhetorically and politically, in the acid context of the current Republican Party. As Ohio\u2019s governor, he tried to strip public-employee unions of bargaining rights and signed a law banning abortion after 20 weeks \u2014 but also accepted the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nAsked in Contoocook about his approach to health care, Kasich spent four minutes discussing methods of paying doctors and hospitals for above-average performance \u2014 without mentioning Obamacare, much less denouncing it. For the record, as he hastened to say when I noted this to him afterwards, he\u2019s against it.\n\nAt a senior citizen center in Concord, a voter lamented the presence of \u201cmillions of illegals\u201d in the country, asking, \u201cWhat is your plan to deport them?\u201d\n\nKasich didn\u2019t try to soften the blow of disagreement. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen. ... There is no practical way to go searching neighborhoods, grabbing people out of their homes.\u201d\n\nIf he fails to produce a strong showing in the primary here Feb. 9, Kasich acknowledged, \u201cI\u2019m pretty well done \u2014 I am done.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve raised the bar in this election. I\u2019ve talked about hope and the future and positive things and a can-do attitude. ... So whatever you do, even if you don\u2019t love me, I love you. How\u2019s that?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.columbiatribune.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=news*&f=rss&id=5; cycle=1", "googlebot": "noarchive", "application-name": "Columbia Tribune", "p": {"domain_verify": "e84f2ccdbb23b2303cfa08c12e9bd926"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/wide.png?_dc=1372340732", "twitter": {"title": "John Kasich is refreshingly happy", "description": "CONTOOCOOK, N.H. \u2014 In the year of the angry candidate and the even angrier voter, John Kasich stands out as the self-proclaimed \u201cprince of light and hope.\u201d", "card": "summary", "site": "@columbiatribune"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#065874", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/tiny.png?_dc=1372340614", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/large.png?_dc=1372340596", "og": {"url": "http://www.columbiatribune.com/opinion/columnists/john-kasich-is-refreshingly-happy/article_7dd692a0-196c-504f-a4af-8ac25eb32aa2.html", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Tribune", "type": "article", "description": "CONTOOCOOK, N.H. \u2014 In the year of the angry candidate and the even angrier voter, John Kasich stands out as the self-proclaimed \u201cprince of light and hope.\u201d", "title": "John Kasich is refreshingly happy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 299470460147166}, "msvalidate.01": "1E3A617C7822235CF7453A03AC560148", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/t-badge_144.png?_dc=1372343381", "keywords": "john kasich,republican party,election 2016,primary election", "google-site-verification": "Pa-FtOcowtRH8XQjoX9dIrD_ncPLS80pMIWeoJZyZnA", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/columbiatribune.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/windows8_favs/square.png?_dc=1372340606", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "description": "CONTOOCOOK, N.H. \u2014 In the year of the angry candidate and the even angrier voter, John Kasich stands out as the self-proclaimed \u201cprince of light and hope.\u201d"}, "article_summary": "In addition, even in this angry year, this is not a particularly angry state; unemployment is down to 3.1 percent.\nKasich is only a moderate, rhetorically and politically, in the acid context of the current Republican Party.\nBut he\u2019s got his hand on everybody in this room if you let him.\u201d Then he wondered, \u201cWhat do you think?\nAm I out of my mind here telling you this stuff?\u201dHis style is folksy and meandering, bordering at times on goofy.\nYou, or rich people?\u201dIf elected, \u201cMy job is to make sure that the lives of people just like you get better,\u201d Kasich said."}
