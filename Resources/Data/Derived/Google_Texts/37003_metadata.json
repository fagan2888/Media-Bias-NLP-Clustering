Like Gillibrand, Cruz is a junior member of the Armed Services Committee, and within this body, support for the bill \u201cdidn\u2019t break under party lines, and didn\u2019t break under gender lines, but did break along seniority,\u201d said Greg Jacob, a former marine and the policy director of the Service Women\u2019s Action Network, which has lobbied for the bill. Senior members of the committee, like McCaskill, Jack Reed, or John McCain, \u201chave longstanding relationships with the Department of Defense,\u201d Jacob said, and seem more sympathetic to its claims that upsetting tradition could have unforeseen consequences. The most senior member of the committee listed among Gillibrand\u2019s supporters is David Vitter, who entered the Senate in 2005.\n\nPaul and Cruz have refused to pay deference to the Pentagon before. Paul has decried ballooning defense spending, and Cruz said he was willing to put the military on the chopping block to force Obama\u2019s hand on the Affordable Care Act during the shutdown last fall.\n\nTo put President Obama in a bind\n\nThough Obama has paid unprecedented attention to the problem of sexual assault in America, he has yet to express support for Gillibrand\u2019s bill. Obama said in December, after the NDAA passed, \u201cIf I do not see the kind of progress I expect, then we will consider additional reforms.\u201d He bought himself time, setting December 1, 2014, as a deadline for the Pentagon to show \u201csubstantial improvements\u201d on sexual assault\u2014and tacitly suggesting that Gillibrand and her allies should hold off until then. Though the NDAA codified sizable changes to the legal process (among them, taking away commanders\u2019 ability to overturn verdicts, mandating dishonorable discharge for convicted service members, and allowing victims to transfer units), it did not separate justice from the chain of command. Gillibrand didn\u2019t pull punches in her response to the president: \u201cI do not want to wait another year to enact the one reform survivors have asked for,\u201d she said in a statement. Cruz and Paul can see that Gillibrand is putting pressure on the White House\u2014and, surely, are happy to help.\n\nTo attract women voters\n\nBoth Paul and Cruz have exhibited the Republican talent for alienating women\u2014Cruz once called birth control an \u201cabortifacient,\u201d and as Hillary 2016 speculation heats up, Paul can\u2019t seem to stop talking about Monica Lewinsky. As the reproductive health site RH Reality Check has suggested, \u201cIn joining with Gillibrand \u2026 Cruz and Paul, both regarded as contenders for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, likely hope to convey some compassion for women, especially since both men hold stringent anti-choice positions\u2014as in no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the woman.\u201d\n\nBecause they believe in the bill\n\nGillibrand\u2019s relentless campaign has raised eyebrows on the Hill: Her staff famously keeps a whiteboard tallying her colleagues\u2019 likely votes, and she supposedly pounced on Senator Cory Booker the day he was sworn in to gain his support. But her efforts, and the lack of partisan consensus about either her bill or McCaskill\u2019s, have produced a serious debate about the best way forward. \u201cThe conversations we\u2019ve been having with undecided offices have shown that they\u2019re really undecideds,\u201d Jacob told me. \u201cThey\u2019re not just saying they\u2019re undecided because they don\u2019t want to say that they\u2019re for the bill. The senators are really struggling, really wanting to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nCruz has said he adopted Gillibrand\u2019s position after hearing her lay out the facts in a committee meeting last June. When flabbergasted reporters asked how Cruz came to be one of just two Republicans to support her in the initial vote, he gave them a simple answer: \u201cShe made a strong argument,\u201d he said.\n\nThis post has been updated to better describe reforms in the most recent NDAA.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The four most-plausible theories", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Right-leaning mavericks Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have been among the Kirsten Gillibrand's\u00a0most outspoken allies.
