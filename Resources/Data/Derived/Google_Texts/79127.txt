Whether an employee fully understands or takes advantage of health benefits available to them depends to a significant degree upon their income.

Thatâ€™s the recurring theme of a report prepared by Aflac. Its 2015 WorkForces study gathered information from nearly 2,000 professionals in benefits-related positions at U.S. companies. As a screen, Aflac considered responses about the tendencies of employees who had a household income of $100,000 or more, comparing them to responses from those with a household income of $50,000 or less.
