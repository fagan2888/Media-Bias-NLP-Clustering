The shadow of the Cadillac tax appears to be growing despite the fact that it wonâ€™t go into effect until 2018. An analysis of health plans covering 13 million employees or retirees projects that nearly 20 percent of the plans reviewed will trigger the tax by 2020.

Truven Health Analytics conducted the study and reviewed claims data from 2,600 self-funded plans to determine whether the levy, an excise tax mandated by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, would be triggered. The tax would be imposed on plans considered to be unusually rich by PPACA standards.
