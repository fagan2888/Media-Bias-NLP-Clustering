The sky isn\u2019t falling! Or, to put it another way, the premiums aren\u2019t reaching up to the sky. That would be the Obamacare premiums, which critics of the Affordable Care Act were absolutely sure would see crippling increases \u2013 as in double, if not triple digits \u2013 in 2015.\n\nBut actual data is starting to accumulate from states and the prophesied rate-shock horror stories are not materializing. PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 Health Research Institute has collected available data from 29 states and the District of Columbia and concluded that the average premium increase for those getting their insurance through Obamacare exchanges is currently around 8.2 percent. There are of course caveats, starting with the fact that that\u2019s a national average \u2013 some states have higher increases than others, and there can even be wide variations within states. The range in Colorado, for example, is from a 22 percent decline to a 35 percent increase, and it averages out to a 3.6 percent increase. For comparison\u2019s sake, understand that the Commonwealth Fund, a pro-Obamacare foundation, released a study in June which found that increases in the individual market in the three years before the Affordable Care Act was enacted averaged 10 percent or more. That\u2019s a higher number than 8.2 percent.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also a far cry from the standard right-wing talking points on the matter. House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans issued a report in May of last year grimly warning of the forthcoming Obamacare price crisis: \u201cConsumers purchasing health insurance on the individual market may face premium increases of nearly 100 percent on average, with potential highs eclipsing 400 percent,\u201d the GOP members warned, speciously as it turned out. And, during last fall\u2019s government shutdown, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said that \u201cvirtually every person across this country has seen \u2026 premiums going up and up and up.\u201d In April of this year, FactCheck.org surveyed a series of conservative attack ads, noting that \u201c\u2018skyrocketing\u2019 is the word of choice in these attack ads. That\u2019s misleading.\u201d And so on.\n\n[MORE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\n(It\u2019s worth noting here also that while most of the discussion of the effects of Obamacare on health care costs focuses on those purchasing insurance on the individual market, it\u2019s a distinction rarely explicitly stated in the political debate. Thus, headlines like \u201cO-Care premiums to skyrocket,\u201d from The Hill in March can easily seem to be a prediction for all insured, not the roughly 5 percent who purchase on the individual market.)\n\nGiven the right\u2019s track record for Obamacare prognostication, the deflation of the sticker-shock talking point shouldn\u2019t come as a great surprise. Vox\u2019s Sarah Kliff did yeoman\u2019s work on this last month, publishing a list of \u201cpredicted Obamacare disasters that never happened.\u201d The gloomdoggling tends to exhibit a yes-but pattern: Yes, the last prediction didn\u2019t bear out, but here\u2019s another reason it is about to collapse. Yes, people signed up, but not enough. Yes, enough people signed up, but they\u2019re not new. Sure, some are new but more have lost insurance. Yes, lots of people signed up, and a ton of them are new, but really, they\u2019re not paying their premiums. Or, those who signed up will find their premiums are about to skyrocket, causing a death spiral. Obamacare is eternally on the verge of spectacular collapse according to the right (excepting those who, sometimes simultaneously, warned the opposite: that the law is a seductive new entitlement that will only bind otherwise freedom-loving Americans more closely to the big government teet).\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that the Obamacare news has been net positive in recent months, in some cases, as with the moderate premium hikes, simply because it didn\u2019t approach the absurd predictions of its most rabid critics. Multiple surveys, for example, have shown the nation\u2019s uninsured rate dropping since the law took effect. The Congressional Budget Office in the spring reduced its estimate for how much the law will cost over the next decade; and more than half of the states PricewaterhouseCoopers has surveyed will have more insurers offering plans under Obamacare. This is not only a sign that the health insurance companies don\u2019t share the vision of an impending collapse, but also (free market alert) is good news in terms of competition for business, which will presumably mean lower prices. Oh, and did I mention that Medicare\u2019s trustees reported last month that the law is helping extend the life of that beloved entitlement?\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nThat might explain why Obamacare is diminishing as a political issue. A Gallup survey last month found that the number of people citing health care as the most important issue facing the country has been halved since January, from 16 percent to 8 percent. So Politico reported recently that Obamacare is not a major component of House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s stump speech, while the same publication noted that GOP pollsters had tested 57 varieties of anti-Obamacare messages, trying to find one that moved voters. Fifty-seven? So much for the days when simply saying \u201cObamacare\u201d was a sufficient scare tactic.\n\nIndeed, Bloomberg's Heidi Przybyla reported yesterday that \"Republicans are easing off their strategy of criticizing Democrats over the Affordable Care Act now that many Americans are benefiting from the law and the measure is unlikely to be repealed.\" Republican ads in the North Carolina senate race are featuring the issue half as much as just a few months ago, she writes, noting similar declines in Arkansas and Louisiana. \"The party had been counting on anti-Obamacare sentiment to spur Republican turnout in its quest for a U.S. Senate majority, just as the issue did when the party took the House in 2010,\" Przybyla writes. \"Now, Republicans are seeking a new winning formula, with the midterm election less than three months away.\"\n\nOf course the law itself remains deeply unpopular, with more people disapproving of it than approving. But the same polls tend to show that majorities of Americans oppose its repeal. This is in part because it has taken on a polarizing life unconnected to its real world effects. As the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Drew Altman wrote last week in The Wall Street Journal \u201cwe could ask the public if the [law] will take us to Mars or solve the problem of climate change and the responses would split perfectly along partisan lines.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Obamacare No Longer Republicans' 2014 Ace Issue", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "As GOP predictions for the Affordable Care Act prove wrong, the issue fades as a 2014 weapon.", "title": "The Incredible Shrinking Issue", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/08/20/obamacare-no-longer-republicans-2014-ace-issue", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a2/06/3559eb1e48abb5184cf6510cd842/thumb-3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obamacare No Longer Republicans' 2014 Ace Issue", "description": "As GOP predictions for the Affordable Care Act prove wrong, the issue fades as a 2014 weapon.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Aug. 20, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Robert Schlesinger,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,politics,picks,2014 Congressional elections,Republican Party,Politics [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "As GOP predictions for the Affordable Care Act prove wrong, the issue fades as a 2014 weapon."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87c1\"", "article_summary": "That would be the Obamacare premiums, which critics of the Affordable Care Act were absolutely sure would see crippling increases \u2013 as in double, if not triple digits \u2013 in 2015.\nA Gallup survey last month found that the number of people citing health care as the most important issue facing the country has been halved since January, from 16 percent to 8 percent.\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]That might explain why Obamacare is diminishing as a political issue.\nGiven the right\u2019s track record for Obamacare prognostication, the deflation of the sticker-shock talking point shouldn\u2019t come as a great surprise.\n\"Now, Republicans are seeking a new winning formula, with the midterm election less than three months away.\""}
