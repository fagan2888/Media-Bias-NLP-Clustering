And as Jerry [Garcia] would say, 'Let there be songs to fill the air,'\" a nod to American Beauty's \"Ripple.\"\n\nThe presidential message, as well as a photo of the Dead's Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann and their respective families with the President during an Oval Office visit in 2009, reportedly appeared on the cover of Friday's Fare Thee Well program, Relix writes.\n\nObama's connection to the Grateful Dead members actually dates back to February 2008, when Weir, Lesh and Hart reunited for the first time in four years to perform at \"Deadheads for Obama,\" a Super Tuesday campaign event for the Illinois senator-turned-presidential candidate. In October 2008, the Dead once again reunited \u2013 this time with Kreutzmann \u2013 to play at an Obama rally in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nAfter Obama won the 2008 presidential election, he invited the Dead to perform at one of his 10 inaugural balls in Washington, D.C. in January 2009.\n\nThe Grateful Dead will close out their Fare Thee Well run, featuring the surviving \"core four\" paired with Phish's Trey Anastasio and keyboardist Bruce Hornsby, Sunday night. Although the first of the three Chicago Fare Thee Well performances was a classic, Saturday night's concert, while patriotic, was marred by lost chemistry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama has paid tribute to the Grateful Dead with a message congratulating the group on their 50th anniversary and enduring legacy.", "og": {"site_name": "Rolling Stone", "description": "\"Enjoy this weekend's celebration of your fans and legacy.
