Those prescribed surgery typically didn't have the money or ability to travel hundreds of miles.\n\nThe regular eye care is making a difference in the lives of Utah Navajos and their Arizona neighbors, health care providers say.\n\nUncorrected vision problems are \"a major cause of trouble\" for children, says Robert Hoffman, chief of pediatric ophthalmology at Moran and Primary Children's Hospital. Utah's schools on the Navajo reservation consistently have low test scores, and Hoffman believes poor vision may be one reason.\n\nNow, many Navajo children have been fitted with glasses.\n\nAnd though Navajos have accepted the fact that many will go blind, much of the blindness is preventable, says Shawn Begay, manager of the Utah Navajo Health Systems' clinics in Monument Valley and Navajo Mountain.\n\n\"Around here, people just got used to it, like it's just part of life, part of getting old,\" Begay says. \"But in reality, it doesn't have to happen.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nLong time coming \u2022 Navajo Mountain, population 354, is one of Utah's most remote communities. It's over the mountain from Lake Powell's Rainbow Bridge, but to get there, one must drive to Page or Kayenta, Ariz., and then drive 94 miles or 86 miles, respectively.\n\nOf the 175,000 Navajos living on the reservation, 6,000 live in Utah. Nearly half have incomes below the poverty line.\n\n\"This is like a third-world place in the middle of the United States,\" says Alan Crandall, co-director of Moran's Global Outreach Division, which operates entirely on donations.\n\nOn this trip, Crandall and his son, David Crandall, a Michigan ophthalmologist, removed four cataracts for Navajos at the Blue Mountain Hospital in Blanding, and then examined dozens of patients' eyes the next day at Navajo Mountain.\n\nA Moran team of two or three dozen employees, family members and other volunteers comes 11 times a year. Most of them take vacation days to do so, and the doctors charge no fees.\n\nThe team goes to the biggest public spaces, schools in three Navajo communities \u2014 Navajo Mountain, Monument Valley and Montezuma Creek \u2014 to examine the eyes of Navajos of all ages. Those who need glasses get them the following month, and those who need cataract or pterygium surgery are given appointments for the next month as well. The Moran team sets up shop at its partner institutions, the Blanding hospital or a clinic in Monument Valley, for the surgeries.\n\nGordon Warren and Loretta King of Navajo Mountain brought three of their five boys to Navajo Mountain High School for eye exams. It's been 18 months since two of the boys were last examined, when the family lived in Phoenix. Both are supposed to see eye specialists every six months, and one has a broken pair of glasses, King says.\n\n\"We moved back [to Navajo Mountain] and it makes it hard for us to see specialists,\" she says, adding that the Moran team's visit saves the family a three- or four-hour trip to Phoenix.\n\nTristan Warren, 2, also gets his eyes examined for the first time and his parents are happy with the news. He doesn't yet need glasses.\n\n\u2014\n\nCommunication is key \u2022 Providing regular eye care here is not easy because few have home phones, cellphone coverage is spotty, and it's hard to get places on this vast reservation.\n\nThis is why Yei, on the move since 5 a.m. on the first day of this outreach trip, is visiting the home of Frances and Kee Parrish early in the evening.\n\nThe Parrishes both had cataracts removed from both eyes earlier this year, but have not made their follow-up visits. They live about 10 miles from Kayenta, much of it on a rutted dirt road, and have to walk to the top of a hill to get cell service.\n\nFollow-up visits after surgery are important so patients' eyes can be re-examined and eyeglasses can be provided to correct what the surgery couldn't.\n\nYei has brought along his friend, Toni Dee, to translate because the Parrishes speak only Navajo. Dee is a hospice nurse based in Bluff.\n\nKee, 70, who worked in the uranium mines and now has lung problems, says he can shoot his gun again and even hunt rabbits or deer, if he is of a mind to do that.\n\nFrances, 68, tells Yei that her vision is good enough now to thread a needle or allow her to drive to Farmington, N.M., or Cortez, Colo., but she still sees double when looking in the distance, especially at night.\n\n\"It's an eye muscle thing,\" Yei tells her, adding that the glasses she'll get at follow-up visits will fix that problem.\n\n\"If she can come, the prism will correct that,\" he says.\n\nIt's still an improvement from the partial blindness the cataracts were causing. Without the Moran folks, says Frances, \"We would have to live with it.\"\n\nFrances and Yei settle on a communication plan: Yei will send a reminder of an October appointment to the couple's post office box in Kayenta.\n\nThe group shares pleasantries for a while. \"You look as cute as ever,\" Yei tells them.\n\n\"It's nice to see you guys again,\" says Frances.\n\nYei, who initiated the outreach to the Navajos after he joined Moran, says communication and transportation are the two biggest obstacles to providing good eye care here.\n\nOn Moran's September trip to the reservation, for example, only four of the 12 who had appointments for cataract surgery made it to the Blanding hospital.\n\n\u2014\n\n\"Exactly where I belong\" \u2022 Some do follow up.\n\nLucy Cly, 78, stands in the hallway of the Monument Valley clinic, holding her hand in front of one eye and then the next as Moran techs ask what she can see on the eye chart.\n\nThe team removed a cataract from her left eye in July, says Traci Cly, her daughter-in-law, driver and translator. Lucy was expecting to receive her new glasses this day, but instead must wait a few days because of a delivery problem.\n\nLucy wears the traditional clothing of older Navajo women: a long printed skirt, a velveteen long-sleeved shirt, turquoise and silver bracelets, and a brooch. The stick in her bun is beaded.\n\n\"She couldn't see little words or screens,\" says Traci.\n\nNow Lucy can see well enough to sew and do beadwork again, Traci says.\n\nAround the corner and down the hall, Susan MacDonald, an ophthalmologist from Tufts University and the Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Boston, reassures Frieda Crank, 65, who lies on the surgical table with a cover over her head. One of her eyes is exposed and lit by a bright light.\n\n\"We're almost done, so hang in there, my darlin',' \" MacDonald says, wielding a medical instrument but putting Crank at ease. \"Sorry I took my sweet little time, but it looks gorgeous. I just wanted to get rid of that growth.\"\n\nCrank, who lives in Oljato in Monument Valley, is one of four patients having pterygia removed this day.\n\n\"I just wanted to get rid of that growth,\" she says later, echoing the doctor. \"It's blurry and it looks funny.\"\n\nMacDonald, who has traveled with Moran teams to Kenya, Guatemala and Haiti in the past couple of years, says when she is volunteering her time, \"I feel I'm exactly where I belong.\"\n\nMacDonald did her residency at the U. and considers Crandall her mentor.\n\n\"We're doing something amazing \u2014 restoring vision in communities where they don't have access to care.\"\n\n\u2014\n\nLooking forward \u2022 Over at Tse'bii'nidzisgai Elementary, Moran's Lori McCoy is fitting child after child for glasses.\n\n\"We're going to get you some glasses,\" she tells 6-year-old Rikeya Barlow. \"What is your favorite color? Pink, blue, black, yellow, purple?\"\n\nEventually, Barlow settles on a pair of black plastic rectangular frames that are a perfect fit for her small face.\n\nOn this trip, all 70 children examined at Tse'bii'nidzisgai Elementary and Navajo Mountain are prescribed glasses.\n\nVision problems can affect a child's brain development and are harder to correct the longer one waits, Hoffman says.\n\n\"They're looking at a lifetime of poor vision, which isn't going to instantly get better when you put glasses on them as an adult,\" he says.\n\nHe's hopeful that by providing eye care to younger children \u2014 he and a colleague screened an infant at Tse'bii'nidzisgai on this trip \u2014 things will turn around for Utah's Navajo children.\n\nAnd Yei is looking at what more can be done now that the Moran team has finessed the logistics of such outreach trips.\n\nHe'd like to set up a permanent laser machine at one of the Utah Navajo Health System's clinics to treat diabetic retinopathy, a common malady among Navajo adults, 22 percent of whom have diabetes.\n\nAt present, some patients with glaucoma, macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy travel to Salt Lake City, on Moran's dime, for treatment. But it's expensive and difficult for Navajo families.\n\nYei also harbors an ambitious goal: to bring together all the organizations involved in Navajo health throughout the Southwest to create a unified, coordinated eye-care system.\n\n\"There is a lot of need overseas, but there is a lot of need here,\" he says. \"I think we can transform eye care.\"\n\nkmoulton@sltrib.com Twitter: @KristenMoulton", "article_metadata": {"description": "Navajo Mountain \u2022 Violet Smith has just learned she needs surgery to remove a pterygium, the buildup of white scar tissue blurring the vision in her left eye.
