Terry McAuliffe promised Monday to remove language from a pending $2.1 billion bond bill that would prevent capital projects at colleges and universities from moving forward until he signs construction contracts for replacing the General Assembly Building as part of a pending $300 million overhaul of state buildings on Capitol Square.\n\nMcAuliffe told the presidents of public colleges and universities, meeting at the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia, that the General Assembly \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in fashioning the language that would tie more than $1.6 billion in bonds to four pending projects on Capitol Square, including the eventual renovation of the Virginia Supreme Court Building and Morson Row, a historic complex of state-owned buildings on Governor Street.\n\nUnless he removes the language, McAuliffe said, \u201cYou will have to wait until 2020,\u201d or halfway through the next governor\u2019s term, for bond money to pay for pending capital projects.\n\n\u201cI think they got a little too cute,\u201d said the governor, who promised, \u201cI will remove the language \u2014 I have to.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s remarks escalate a long-simmering confrontation between the governor and Republican leaders over their refusal to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program for uninsured Virginians under the Affordable Care Act. He has made expansion of insurance coverage a condition for signing the bonds to finance the replacement of the deteriorating General Assembly Building, renovation of Old City Hall and construction of a parking garage at North Ninth and East Broad streets, although he has allowed planning of the projects to proceed.\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairman Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, said Monday the legislature inserted the language into the bond bill after the governor\u2019s spokesman, Brian Coy, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch earlier this month, \u201cAs long as we\u2019re denying Virginians health coverage ... we shouldn\u2019t spend that kind of money on the building.\u201d\n\nLegislators say the replacement of the General Assembly Building is not for their comfort, but to address dire public health, safety and liability issues raised in a 2012 consultant\u2019s report that warned of a sudden shutdown if deteriorating asbestos insulation in one wing of the building gets into the air handling system.\n\nJones said he disagrees with the governor\u2019s interpretation of the language in the bond bill, which was intended to apply only to construction contracts for the General Assembly Building, Old City Hall and the new parking garage. Those projects were part of a budget agreement the legislature and McAuliffe reached in late 2014 to break an impasse over the Capitol Square overhaul, which the governor had suspended after the legislature refused to expand health coverage for the uninsured.\n\n\u201cIt was clear the legislative intent was the $300 million pool of funding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt did not include the Supreme Court or Morson Row.\u201d\n\nBut administration officials said the language includes all of the projects authorized in the 2014 budget bill, not just those funded. \u201cWhether it was intentional or not, they did,\u201d said Secretary of Finance Richard \u201cRic\u201d Brown in an interview.\n\nThe governor\u2019s warning caught college and university presidents by surprise. \u201cIt\u2019s news to me,\u201d said Glenn DuBois, chancellor of the Virginia Community College System, which is counting on the bond package to pay for nine capital projects, including renovation of two buildings at John Tyler Community College in Chester.\n\nThe portions of the bond package that would be held up include money for:\n\nconstruction of a new building for the VCU School of Allied Health Professions and expansion of the School of Engineering, the university\u2019s top capital spending priorities, as well as construction of the VCU-led Commonwealth Center for Advanced Logistics in Prince George County;\n\nexpansion of Western State Hospital in Staunton and the central forensic laboratory and Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Richmond;\n\nrepairs and renovations at 14 existing state parks and the first phase of a new park at Widewater on Aquia Creek in Stafford County;\n\nconstruction of a parking deck and creation of a master site plan at the Science Museum of Virginia, as well as replacement of air handling units at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, both in Richmond; and\n\nplanning of 21 future construction projects, including a new state juvenile correctional center in Chesapeake, a STEM laboratory building at VCU, expansion of the Division of Consolidated Laboratories in Richmond, and the renovation of Morson Row.\n\nThe language would not affect $350 million in bonds to expand capacity at Norfolk International Terminal, $59 million for pollution controls to protect the Chesapeake Bay, $20 million to assist localities with storm water controls, and a pair of small bond issues for more than a dozen pending projects, including building renovations at VCU, the Science Museum, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nIn addition to a potential four-year delay, Brown said the language could result in higher borrowing costs on municipal bonds to pay for the capital projects in the pending legislation.\n\n\u201cOur interpretation is it\u2019s going to cost, because we don\u2019t see interest rates going down,\u201d he said.\n\nMcAuliffe said he spoke directly to Jones and Senate Finance Co-Chairman Emmett Hanger, R-Augusta, on Monday and also had tried to reach Finance Co-Chairman Thomas Norment, R-James City, about his concerns over the long delay of projects in the bond package, which the governor originally proposed in December at $2.4 billion.\n\n\u201cWe will get into a negotiation stage now, which I always enjoy,\u201d he told the educators at SCHEV.\n\nIn an interview Monday, Hanger said technical corrections to the bond bill language can be negotiated, but he told McAuliffe that replacement of the General Assembly Building \u201cis important and shouldn\u2019t be held up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt simply isn\u2019t going to work to try to tie Medicaid to this,\u201d said Hanger, who was a leader of an unsuccessful effort to expand health care coverage for uninsured Virginians in 2014.\n\nJones said Monday the Appropriations Committee staff already is exploring the issue with Brown and his staff.\n\n\u201cI have confidence we\u2019ll get it worked out,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "RICHMOND \u2014 Gov.
