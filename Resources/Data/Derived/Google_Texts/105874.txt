ARAB, Ala. (WHNT) - This week's Tools for Teachers award winner is Joan Scott, a Marshall County teaching institution. We surprised Ms. Scott at Arab Primary with $319 to spend on teaching supplies as she sees fit.

Ms. Scott has been teaching for more than five decades, and despite the fact she technically retired a few years back, she's still touching lives as a Title One reading teacher at Arab Primary School. During the course of her illustrious career, multiple generations of families have sat learning from Ms. Scott, and she is now teaching side by side with many of those former students.

One such pupil-turned-colleague is Whitney Nixon, a first grade teacher at Arab Primary who was once one of Ms. Scott's own first graders. It was Nixon who nominated Ms. Scott for this award because she wanted to recognize her former teacher for the influence she's had on her own teaching style.

"She was an amazing teacher, and she believed in me," Nixon told us.

Ms. Scott says she always placed an emphasis on teaching reading, and Arab Primary principal Dr. Leah Keith tells us that dedication to literacy has had lasting effects on the Arab community.

"Half the adults in Arab can credit Joan Scott with teaching them how to read," Dr. Keith said, only half-joking.

If you know a worthy teacher, coach, principal, or aide, tell us about them through the Tools for Teachers nomination form.
