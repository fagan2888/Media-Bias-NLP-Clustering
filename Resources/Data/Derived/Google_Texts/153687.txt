Frequent, Efficient Staff Meetings Important for Health Care Teams

HealthDay News â€” Frequent, efficient, in-person staff meetings are valuable for health care team operation, according to an article published in Medical Economics.

The article discusses the importance of regular in-person staff meetings, which, although not always logistically easy, are ultimately important for a care team.

Having a meeting every week increases the chance of catching practice management problems at an early stage. The meetings should include everyone involved in major processes, from the clerical to clinical. An agenda should be prepared to help keep the meeting on track. Meetings should not be too short or too long, with an ideal time of 20 to 30 minutes. Action items should be recorded to help ensure the meetings are productive. In order for staff to take participation in these meetings seriously, the meeting should ideally be scheduled during time normally allotted to patient care. Positive feedback should be used liberally, with a low threshold for thanking people during the meeting.

"You cannot have a team that never convenes in real time as a group," according to the article. "Therefore, if you choose not to meet with your coworkers, you cannot expect your coworkers to operate like a team."
