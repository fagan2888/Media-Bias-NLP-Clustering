An infographic recently released by the Alliance of Community Health Plans shows that prescriptions to treat rheumatoid arthritis have increased since 2013, and projects they will continue to do so through 2020.

From January 2013 through January 2016, the price of Enbrel increased 80.3 percent, the price of Humira increased 68.7 percent and the price of Xeljanz increased 44.3 percent. The cost of treating rheumatoid arthritis will increase from $6.4 billion in 2013 to $9.3 billion in 2020, according to data from data cited from the journal Arthritis & Rheumatology.

The trend goes against what traditionally happens in the pharmaceutical market, which is that drug costs decrease as more generic versions enter the market and drive down costs. Rising drug prices have become a national concern, and have been a major topic on the campaign trail this year.

The ACHP has been highlighting the price changes of treatments for treating common diseases as part of an infographic series on drug prices.
