(The decision was successfully blocked, for now). This year also saw extensive coverage of the gender wage gap; Women still make just 77 cents for every dollar men make, and that widens even further for black and Hispanic women. The question, of course, becomes this: Are American women concerned enough about these issues, and many others, to actually turn out at tomorrow's midterm elections?\n\nDemocrats are hoping the answer is yes. As The New York Times reports, midterm elections are particularly tricky for left-leaning candidates because, \"many single women do not vote, especially in non-presidential election years like this one.... The result is a turnout that is older, whiter, and more conservative than in presidential years.\" The lack of women voter turnout is no small challenge, considering that roughly 56 million adult women are unmarried, and that \"single women have become Democrats' most reliable supporters, behind African Americans,\" according to the Times. Tomorrow's midterm elections will decide who gets (or keeps) seats in the Senate and House, as well as several gubernatorial races\u2014including in Texas, where the stakes are particularly high for women. If Democratic candidate Wendy Davis is going to defeat Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, one thing is certain: She'll need a big push from female voters. More specifically, single female voters. And other candidates will as well.\n\nWhy single women, in particular? For starters, they tend to be more liberal than married women (which is not to say that there aren't liberal married women as well) and also have less financial security, making them more inclined to vote for candidates who will protect their reproductive rights and also support policies that help them financially\u2014whether by increasing minimum wage or making education more affordable.\n\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, \"Democrats lost women for the first time in decades and subsequently lost the House and six Senate seats,\" reports Time. To prevent the same thing from happening this year, Democrats have publicly called out Republicans for what they've call the party's \"War on Women\"\u2014a term that they hope could motivate women to protect themselves at the polls, so to speak. Republicans have also recognized the power of female voters by introducing bills on equal pay and flexible work schedules, although neither has actually been voted on.\n\nAccording to a telephone poll of 1,000 drop-off voters for Emily's List, American Women, and Planned Parenthood, 70 percent said that voting against a pro-life politician was \"very motivating\" in terms of getting them to the polls this year, as was voting against politicians \"who want to let employers decide what health coverage a woman gets.\"\n\nOn Friday, President Obama spoke to female business owners and working mothers at an event in Rhode Island as part of the effort to get women to the polls. \"So while many women are working hard to support themselves and their families, they're still facing unfair choices, outdated workplace policies. That holds them back, but it also holds all of us back,\" he said, according to Reuters. \"We have to do better, because women deserve better.\" The results of tomorrow's midterm elections will determine whether or not the Democrats will hold the Senate\u2014a major factor in Obama's final two years in office.\n\nHow about you?
