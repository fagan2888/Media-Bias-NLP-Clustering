It the lack of transparency that hides what is really going on with pricing tests, drugs and hospital and doctors\u2019 fees. Big Insurance and Big and Small Pharma cut secret deals. We are all affected.\n\nI\u2019ve been wanting to blog about this \u2013 especially after Jim Bacon\u2019s recent post on the supposed tech trend in health care \u2013 but I wanted to wait until a story I\u2019ve been working on for a few weeks was posted at Style Weekly, where I am a contributing editor.\n\nIn it, I explore the strange story of Health Diagnostic Laboratory, a famed Richmond start-up that went from zero to $383 million in revenues and 800 employees in a few short years. The firm said it was developing advanced bio-marker tests that could predict heart disease and diabetes long before they took root. HDL\u2019s officials thought it would transform the $1.6 trillion health care industry.\n\nRichmond\u2019s business elite applauded HDL founder Tonya Mallory, a woman who grew up just north of the city and had the strong personality and drive to create the HDL behemoth. Badly wanting a high tech champion in a not-so high tech town, the city\u2019s boosters did much to publicize HDL and Mallory, believing they could draw in more startups.\n\nThe story was too good to be true. It start to deflate last summer when the federal government noted that HDL was one of several testing labs being probed for paying doctors $17 for using HDL tests for Medicare patients when Medicare authorized $3 per test. Mallory resigned Dept. 23. Several lawsuits by Mallory\u2019s former employer, Cigna health insurance and another have accused HDL of fraud. HDL has responded in court.\n\nOne legal picture suggests that HDL wasn\u2019t a true tech startup but a new firm that stole intellectual property and sales staff. HDL says no, but its new leader Joe McConnell has taken steps to reform sales and marketing and is said to be working with the U.S. Department of Justice to settle a federal investigation.\n\nThe HDL affair raises issues about the inside marketing and apparent payoffs that are the biggest problem the health care industry faces. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of \u201cmarket magic\u201d combined with new technology comes up if something like this keeps happening.\n\nThis is all the more reason for a universal payer system. That may be \u201csocialized\u201d medicine but in my opinion it is the only logical way to go.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore\n\nReddit\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nThere are currently no comments highlighted.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb930\"", "article_summary": "By Peter GaluszkaThe biggest problem facing the health care industry in Virginia and the rest of the country isn\u2019t Obamacare or the lack of new medical discoveries.\nIn it, I explore the strange story of Health Diagnostic Laboratory, a famed Richmond start-up that went from zero to $383 million in revenues and 800 employees in a few short years.\nHDL\u2019s officials thought it would transform the $1.6 trillion health care industry.\nThe HDL affair raises issues about the inside marketing and apparent payoffs that are the biggest problem the health care industry faces.\nOne legal picture suggests that HDL wasn\u2019t a true tech startup but a new firm that stole intellectual property and sales staff."}
