Trump's appears in the nearly hourlong video from the Somali al-Qaeda-linked militant group, with a clip shown of him discussing his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the U.S. during a recent speech.

ADVERTISEMENT "The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens," al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki, who has since been killed by a U.S. drone strike, says in the video after Trump's remarks.

"Slowly but surely, your situation is becoming similar to that of the embattled Muslim community of Spain after the fall of Granada," al-Awlaki tells Muslims viewers living in the U.S.

Elsewhere in the video, the group urges black youth in America to convert to Islam, invoking racial tension surrounding the police-involved shootings of black men in recent years.

Whether Trump was being used in terrorist recruitment videos became the subject of controversy between Trump and Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in December.
