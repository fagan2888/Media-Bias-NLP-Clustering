Robert Marshall (Photo: JENNIFER CORBETT/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo Story Highlights Two incumbent members of the General Assembly fell in primaries\n\nTwo political newcomers won statewide primaries, but the majority of incumbents kept their seats\n\nTuesday's primaries saw several things: two political newcomers winning statewide primaries; the majority of incumbents keeping their seats; and two tight races, one each in New Castle and Sussex counties, that resulted in calls for a recount.\n\nBy the end of Wednesday, one recount was finished and longtime Wilmington state Sen. Robert Marshall's tight victory over City Councilwoman Sherry Dorsey Walker remained intact.\n\nThe recount was requested by Dorsey Walker after Marshall defeated her by only 37 votes, despite not meeting the half a percentage point threshold that triggers an automatic official recount, said state Election Commissioner Elaine Manlove.\n\nThe recount was granted by the state and 74 absentee ballots were counted by hand, but the result remained the same.\n\nAn automatic recount was triggered after the hotly contested GOP race for Sussex County sheriff ended with only two-tenths of a percentage point separating the candidates.\n\nSussex County officials will recount by hand the 479 absentee ballots cast in the Republican primary race between Sheriff Jeff Christopher and his challenger, Robert T. Lee.\n\nLee, a retired Seaford detective, leads Christopher by just 21 of the 10,197 votes cast in the race.\n\nIf the results hold, it will mean voters rejected a second-term bid by Christopher \u2013 who campaigned as a \"constitutional sheriff\" and tried repeatedly to add law enforcement duties to the scope of his office's work \u2013 by a very narrow margin. The winner will face the sole Democratic candidate to register, former Lewes police chief R. Beau Gooch, in November.\n\nKenneth L. McDowell, director of the Sussex County Department of Elections, said the absentee ballots which were machine-counted on Election Day will be hand-tallied on Thursday.\n\n\"The law says I can do it either way,\" McDowell said: run the absentees through counting machines again, or do it by hand. \"What I've chosen to do is take the machine count and hand-count it to see if everything is on the up and up.\"\n\nDelaware voters on Tuesday picked winners in three statewide primaries. Republican Kevin Wade, a Christiana businessman, won his primary over Milton retiree Carl Smink to take on U.S. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., in November.\n\nFormer investment fund manager Ken Simpler won the GOP contest for state treasurer. And lawyer Brenda Mayrack overtook accountant Ken Matlusky to become the Democratic nominee for state auditor. She will attempt to unseat Tom Wagner, Delaware's sole statewide Republican officeholder.\n\nTwo incumbent members of the General Assembly fell in primaries, Democratic Rep. Dennis E. Williams of Talleyville, and Republican Rep. Donald Blakey of Camden.\n\nPRIMARY RESULTS: See the races at a glance\n\nFor some, the general election campaign began in earnest Tuesday night, before primary results were finalized.\n\nDemocratic treasurer candidate Sean Barney wasted little time criticizing Simpler, who won 53.9 percent of the vote in his victory over Milford businesswoman Sher Valenzuela.\n\nBarney, a former aide to Gov. Jack Markell and U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, pointed to an opinion article that Simpler wrote in February 2012 for the website Town Square Delaware, saying the article was evidence of far-right policies.\n\nIn the article, Simpler criticized provisions of Obamacare that lowered prescription drug costs for elderly Americans by increasing government subsidies and forcing pharmaceutical companies to offer discounts to Medicare patients.\n\nSimpler argued the lower costs to seniors should not be described as savings, comparing Obamacare's subsidies and regulation of drug pricing to the armed robbery of a string of convenience stores.\n\n\"There simply are no 'savings,' \" Simpler wrote. \"While paying for drugs for our eldest citizens is surely a politically conscionable act, let's not pretend that the savings enjoyed by such citizens are not equal to the dis-savings of taxpayers and pharmaceutical companies.\"\n\nIn an email late Tuesday, Barney's campaign manager, Andrew Wilson, said in a written statement that, \"Ken Simpler wrote that seniors on Medicare were stealing from drug companies. And Simpler wrote we should make seniors pay more for prescription drugs so drug companies can make higher profits.\"\n\nSimpler's article does not explicitly make either of those claims.\n\nIn his own written statement, Simpler criticized Barney for his campaign's early attacks.\n\n\"I'm disappointed that my opponent's first communication in this race was not one welcoming us to the campaign, or encouraging a high-level debate on the issues, but was instead a negative, political twisting of some words I once wrote,\" Simpler said.\n\nAnother curiosity of Tuesday's primaries were the nearly 3,000 votes recorded in the Democratic state Treasurer race between incumbent Chip Flowers and Sean Barney that never came to be.\n\nFlowers withdrew and his name did not appear on Tuesday's machine ballots. Still, that didn't stop 377 voters from selecting Flowers at the polls.\n\nBarney recorded 1,242 votes, despite becoming the presumptive Democratic nominee last month following Flowers abandoning his campaign.\n\nThe remaining votes were recorded via absentee ballots.\n\nElection Commissioner Elaine Manlove said the names were removed from voting machines by blocking out the ballot fields with stickers.\n\nManlove said she didn't know why voters selected the candidates on the ballot. The names were blocked off, but the electronic system was not blocked from recording votes if selected, she said.\n\nIt is possible that voters simply decided to hit the buttons, even though they were covered.\n\nThe same thing happened in a Democratic primary race for Speaker of the House Peter Schwartzkopf's seat. The race was abandoned after the challenger dropped out early on, but Schwartzkopf's remained in the electronic system and received four votes, Manlove said.\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.
