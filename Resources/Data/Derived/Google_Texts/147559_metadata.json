And he constantly promoted Infowars on his Facebook page.\n\nIn one of his Infowars posts, Miller even speculated about whether or not he should kill police officers.\n\n\u201cThe emerging narrative in the Las Vegas shooting now includes Alex Jones,\u201d the Infowars site complained shortly after news of the shootings broke. In short order, Jones began calling the shootings a \u201cfalse flag operation\u201d secretly staged by nefarious federal government operatives who set it up to look like it was a crime committed by domestic terrorists.\n\n\u201cThe incident is custom-made to demonize the patriot movement,\u201d the Infowars site claimed. \u201cThe Southern Poverty Law Center has consistently attempted to forge a link between white supremacists and members of the patriot and constitutional movements.\u201d\n\nJones became downright imaginative, explaining to his listeners, in one rant, how he would go about setting up the murders if he were a government agent, and then warning that the shootings mean that \u201ccivil war is coming\u201d. He also began assigning responsibility for the \u201cfalse flag operation.\u201d In one rant, he accused Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of being behind the crimes. In another, it was the work of President Obama and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nJones\u2019 wild claims must be intended to distract from the fact that, as Media Matters reported, Miller avidly posted Infowars links on his Facebook page and urged his readers to the website \u2013 saying, in one such post, to \u201cget informed or get stupid\u201d.\n\nWhat those claims fail to explain is why, beginning in May 2012, Jerad Miller became an Infowars forum member and began posting long pieces there. In all, he appears to have published five posts, though one of them titled \u201cA Short Story About Protesting\u201d is no longer available.\n\nBy far the most striking and disturbing of these posts is the May 28, 2012, post he titled: \u201cThe Police (to kill or not to kill?).\u201d Most of it is devoted to him explaining at length that he\u2019s mostly a law-abiding citizen who doesn\u2019t steal from people, but police oppression over his marijuana business is driving him to think of violence: \u201cI am like a wild coyote,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou corner me, I will fight to the death.\u201d He continued:", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Alex Jones' conspiracy site, \"patriot\" extremist Jerad Miller wrote that he preferred to die than sit in jail", "title": "Las Vegas gunman\u2019s Infowars posts included speculation about killing cops", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "On Alex Jones' conspiracy site, \"patriot\" extremist Jerad Miller wrote that he preferred to die than sit in jail", "title": "Las Vegas gunman\u2019s Infowars posts included speculation about killing cops", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/14/las_vegas_gunmans_infowars_posts_included_speculation_about_killing_cops_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/police-shot-las-vegas.jpeg18-e1402410471247-620x4121.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Alex Jones' conspiracy site, \"patriot\" extremist Jerad Miller wrote that he preferred to die than sit in jail", "title": "Las Vegas gunman\u2019s Infowars posts included speculation about killing cops", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/police-shot-las-vegas.jpeg18-e1402410471247-620x4121.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Neiwert", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Las Vegas shooters, Southern Poverty Law Center", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In one of his Infowars posts, Miller even speculated about whether or not he should kill police officers.\n\u201cThe emerging narrative in the Las Vegas shooting now includes Alex Jones,\u201d the Infowars site complained shortly after news of the shootings broke.\nWhat those claims fail to explain is why, beginning in May 2012, Jerad Miller became an Infowars forum member and began posting long pieces there.\n\u201cThe incident is custom-made to demonize the patriot movement,\u201d the Infowars site claimed.\nAs a matter of fact, Jerad Miller \u2013 the 31-year-old Indiana man who led the attack, assisted by his 22-year-old wife, Amanda \u2013 liked to post on the Infowars member forum."}
