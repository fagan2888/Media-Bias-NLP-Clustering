Raul Labrador, an Idaho Republican and leader of House conservatives.\n\n\u201cAnd I think civil disobedience has been something for the most part that the liberal media used to stand up for, but apparently there\u2019s some exceptions to that when us conservatives and pro-Second Amendment people are trying to exercise that same right of civil disobedience. So it\u2019s pretty frustrating.\u201d\n\nNo, Congressman. Civil disobedience is when people break laws they think unjust and then peacefully face the legal consequences. The takeover of a federal wildlife facility in Oregon by armed men is sedition.\n\nYet not one of the 10 or so Republican House members on the panel criticized the takeover, and one, Rep. Steve Pearce of New Mexico, announced his refusal to pass judgment.\n\n\u201cI just want to agree with Raul on this,\u201d said Kentucky Rep. Tom Massie.\n\n\u201cYou can disagree with their methods of protesting, but we wouldn\u2019t be talking about this today if they weren\u2019t protesting, and so they\u2019ve drawn attention to it.\u201d\n\nIt was an inauspicious start to this election year and to the second session of the 114th Congress. The Republican majority began the year not by governing but with an ostentatious show of its hostility toward government.\n\nThe House\u2019s first substantive piece of business for the new year: another attempt to repeal Obamacare (the 62nd, by the Democrats\u2019 tally) coupled with another stab at cutting off Planned Parenthood, one of a dozen such efforts recently to scale back abortion rights and women\u2019s health care. In this latest attempt to repeal Obamacare (it goes further than the previous 61 because Republicans used a legislative maneuver that allows it to go to President Obama for a certain veto), Republicans abandoned their \u201crepeal and replace\u201d mantra in favor of just abolishing the massive health care law.\n\n\u201cIf we repeal Obamacare, the very first thing that happens is we go back to the best health care system in the world,\u201d announced Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, another participant in the conservatives\u2019 pizza-and-Coke luncheon. \u201cWe had health care six years ago, and it was the best, and that\u2019s where I want to go as a starter.\u201d\n\nBrooks is given to exotic pronouncements (he declared in 2014 that Democrats were engaged in a \u201cwar on whites\u201d), but his assertion that all was hunky-dory before the 2010 health care law recalls the good old days of lifetime coverage limits, coverage bans because of pre-existing conditions, discrimination against women, inability to carry health insurance between jobs, and obstacles to young adults staying on their parents\u2019 policies.\n\nStill there was, purely as a matter of doggedness, something impressive about this Obamacare vote. North Korea is testing nukes, Saudi Arabia and Iran are plunging the Middle East deeper into conflict \u2014 but congressional Republicans will not be distracted from their agenda.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in a Wednesday news conference, said he would eventually come up with an alternative to Obamacare and something else resembling a legislative agenda in 2016. \u201cWe are just beginning this decision-making process,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing\u2019s been decided yet.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to govern when your caucus is so hostile to government that it has sympathy for seditionists. Asked about the Oregon situation, Ryan deferred to Rep. Greg Walden, a member of GOP leadership who represents the area \u2014 and, as The Washington Post\u2019s Mike DeBonis noted, Ryan nodded agreement as Walden spoke.\n\nWalden made clear that \u201can armed takeover is not the way to go about it,\u201d but he had sympathy for the rebels. \u201cThese people just want to take care of the environment \u2014 they really do,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it is the government that all too often ignores the law.\u201d\n\nSuch as: when lawmakers sworn to uphold the Constitution applaud those who take up arms against the government.\n\nFollow Dana Milbank on Twitter, @Milbank.(c) 2016, Washington Post Writers Group\n\ngraphic via shutterstock.com", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.audience": "Global", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.7", "og": {"site_name": "The Moderate Voice", "description": "Sympathy for sedition by Dana Milbank Washington Post Columnist WASHINGTON -- Republican lawmakers began the new year in Washington with new ideas about how to undermine the government in which they serve.
