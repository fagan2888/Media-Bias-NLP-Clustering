The company he comes from, UnitedHealth, is the nation\u2019s largest health insurer.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will also hire a chief executive officer and chief technology officer for the insurance exchanges, said Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who was approved by Congress as the HHS secretary on June 9, in a statement. Previously, no single person was in charge of the exchanges, a lack of accountability faulted by both foes and supporters of Obamacare after healthcare.gov was found to be riddled with technical errors.\n\nThe changes \u201cbring additional operational and technological firepower and have a clear single point of contact in the marketplace CEO to streamline decision-making,\u201d Burwell said in the statement.\n\nIn his new job, Slavitt will have broad responsibility for all of CMS\u2019s operations, including Affordable Care Act programs, Medicare, the program for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid, the program for low-income people. He will report to the agency\u2019s administrator, Marilyn Tavenner.\n\nOptum Hiring\n\nSeparately, two Republican senators sent letters to Tavenner yesterday questioning Optum\u2019s role in the health exchanges. The senators, Charles Grassley of Iowa and Orrin Hatch of Utah, suggested it may present a conflict of interest for a UnitedHealth subsidiary to have a hand in running insurance exchanges while its parent company at the same time competes against other insurers in the marketplaces.\n\n\u201cWe would like to ensure that all potential conflicts of interest are mitigated,\u201d they wrote, requesting documents related to Optum\u2019s contract with Tavenner\u2019s agency.\n\nA spokesman for UnitedHealth, Matt Stearns, declined to comment on the inquiry. A CMS spokesman, Aaron Albright, said in an e-mail that the agency has ensured Optum \u201chas taken steps to meet standards required by federal acquisition regulations to prevent organizational conflicts of interest.\u201d\n\nSlavitt offered his company\u2019s services to the Obama administration in late October as the federal website was floundering. The government hired Optum\u2019s Quality Software Services Inc. unit as lead contractor for the site, and by December, it functioned for most customers.\n\nOpen Enrollment\n\nThe exchanges re-open for most Americans on November 15, and making sure the technology works on day one is Burwell\u2019s top concern. The management shake-up for the Affordable Care Act programs marks her first major decision as secretary.\n\n\u201cEnsuring that the second open enrollment period is administered as effectively as possible must be a top priority, and it is most encouraging that Secretary Burwell is acting promptly towards that end,\u201d Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group in Washington that supports the health law, said in an e-mail. \u201cThese administrative improvements will enable the second enrollment period to build on, and to improve, the success of the millions of people who gained health coverage recently.\u201d\n\nStates with exchange problems of their own began calling Optum soon after healthcare.gov was fixed, including Maryland, Minnesota and Massachusetts. The company was credited with helping each of the states enroll thousands of people in new Affordable Care Act health plans despite websites that barely functioned, if at all. Vermont hired Optum this month.\n\n8 Million\n\nAbout 8 million people used the exchanges to sign up for private health plans by the end of April. UnitedHealth itself has a small footprint in the marketplaces, selling its plans in just five states this year. It plans to expand its exchange offerings in 2015.\n\n\u201cI am excited to join such a talented team and be part of such an historic opportunity to make a difference in the lives of millions of Americans who are impacted by CMS\u2019 programs,\u201d Slavitt said in an e-mail from a CMS spokeswoman.\n\nAdministration allies including the Center for American Progress and Ezekiel Emanuel, a former White House official now at the University of Pennsylvania, have previously urged Obama to appoint a CEO for the insurance exchanges.\n\n\u201cIt is unclear whether decision-making authority resides with the White House, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or the secretary of Health and Human Services,\u201d Emanuel and Neera Tanden, CAP\u2019s president, wrote in a May 17 report. \u201cThere still is no single leader who is accountable for successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nCandidate Search\n\nThe government hasn\u2019t yet identified candidates for the exchange CEO and CTO jobs, officials said. The CEO will have responsibility for both federal and state exchanges, and will report to Tavenner, Slavitt and Burwell. Tanden and Emanuel recommended that the CEO report directly to Obama and to Burwell.\n\nKurt DelBene, a former Microsoft Corp. executive who has been managing the federal enrollment system since December, will leave the government at the end of this month. His job was always considered temporary and his departure isn\u2019t related to Slavitt\u2019s appointment, officials said.\n\nSlavitt is the second UnitedHealth executive to recently leave the company for public service. Simon Stevens, who ran the company\u2019s international business, was appointed in October to lead England\u2019s National Health Service. He started on the job April 1.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to Andy for his contributions to Optum\u2019s success and are sad to see him go, but we know his skills, experience and integrity will serve CMS and the American people well,\u201d Brian Kane, an Optum spokesman, said in an e-mail.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-20/u-s-hires-unitedhealth-s-slavitt-to-lead-obamacare-effort", "description": "The UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive whose Optum division helped states and the federal government fix Obamacare health exchanges will become second-in-command at the agency that runs the U.S. program.", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "U.S. Hires UnitedHealth\u2019s Slavitt to Lead Obamacare Effort"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell,Health,UnitedHealth Group Inc", "news_keywords": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell,Health,UnitedHealth Group Inc", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-20/u-s-hires-unitedhealth-s-slavitt-to-lead-obamacare-effort", "parsely-title": "U.S. Hires UnitedHealth\u2019s Slavitt to Lead Obamacare Effort", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-06-20T18:53:38.973Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive whose Optum division helped states and the federal government fix Obamacare health exchanges will become second-in-command at the agency that runs the U.S. program.", "parsely-tags": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell,Health,UnitedHealth Group Inc,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-06-20T18:53:38.973Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-20/u-s-hires-unitedhealth-s-slavitt-to-lead-obamacare-effort", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "type": "website", "description": "The UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive whose Optum division helped states and the federal government fix Obamacare health exchanges will become second-in-command at the agency that runs the U.S. program.", "title": "U.S. Hires UnitedHealth\u2019s Slavitt to Lead Obamacare Effort"}, "fb": {"status": "The UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive whose Optum division helped states and the federal government fix Obamacare health exchanges will become second-in-command at the agency that runs the U.S. program."}, "parsely-post-id": "N7H4UW6KLVRT01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9008\"", "article_summary": "Andy Slavitt, Optum\u2019s group executive vice president, was named principal deputy administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, U.S. officials said.\nSlavitt is the second UnitedHealth executive to recently leave the company for public service.\nOptum HiringSeparately, two Republican senators sent letters to Tavenner yesterday questioning Optum\u2019s role in the health exchanges.\nThe CEO will have responsibility for both federal and state exchanges, and will report to Tavenner, Slavitt and Burwell.\nThe UnitedHealth Group Inc. executive whose Optum division helped states and the federal government fix Obamacare health exchanges will become second-in-command at the agency that runs the U.S. program."}
