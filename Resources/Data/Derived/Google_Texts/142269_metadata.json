It started slowing down a bit before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, and then it slowed down even more after the ACA was signed into law. As implementation began, we last year for the first time in a long time saw health care spending rise more slowly than overall GDP.\n\nThis has set off a pundit war over the question of whether the Affordable Care Act is the cause of the slowdown. Watch the witty Jonathan Chait slice-and-dice Conn Carroll if you're interested in that kind of thing.\n\n\n\nBut in important ways, this doesn't matter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHere's the basic shape of the puzzle. The framers of Obamacare felt that there were two big problems in the United States health care system as it existed in 2008. One problem was that many millions of Americans were locked outside the health insurance system. Another problem was that health care spending was increasing at an unsustainable rate. For ethical reasons they wanted to address the former problem. But the most direct means of addressing the coverage problem would naturally tend to increase the rate of health care spending. That's why the basic coverage provisions were paired with a whole bunch of politically contentious cost control measures. For coverage expansion to work\u2014both politically and financially\u2014it had to be paired with a slowdown in health care spending growth.\n\nAnd guess what? Health care spending growth is slowing down.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Health Care Spending Is Slowing Down and It Doesn't Matter Whether Obamacare Is the Cause", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Yglesias", "description": "Health care spending growth is slowing down.
