But the most intriguing documentaries take viewers into subcultures and worlds they would probably never see. More often than not, these films tell stories that are stranger than fiction.\n\nIn 2015 there has been a spate of nonfiction films that have featured bizarre characters and unusual subjects. From the Angulo brothers in \u201cThe Wolfpack,\u201d who learn about the outside world through movies, to \u201cThe Yes Men are Revolting,\u201d about the merry activists/prank-stars who conduct hoaxes to expose corporate greed, the trend in documentary film has certainly shifted away from \u201cbran muffin\u201d and more toward \u201cyou can\u2019t make this shit up!\u201d\n\nHere are a handful of the wildest, weirdest, and most wonderful documentaries to play in cinemas, film festivals and on demand this year.\n\n\u201cThe Barkley Marathons: The Race that Eats Its Young\u201d\n\nOpening with a credit that reads, \u201cWe are going to try to tell you the truth,\u201d followed by the statement, \u201cThe truth is malleable,\u201d this fantastic doc depicts the 2012 Barkley Marathon, an endurance test so grueling that the 40 (among hundreds of) applicants who are selected to run it receive a letter that reads, \u201cSorry to inform you that you\u2019ve been accepted.\u201d Paying $1.60 and handing over a license plate from their home state for entry, contestants must complete a 130-mile, five-loop course with the equivalent of a 12,000-foot climb and descent through the mountains of Tennessee. In 60 hours. To complete the race, which involves intense hiking on an unmarked trail, entrants must rip out pages of books like \u201cDoomed\u201d and \u201cThe Human Zoo\u201d as proof they completed each leg. And speaking of legs, most runners have theirs ripped to shreds by the course\u2019s dangerous brambles. However, those contestants who call for \u201cTaps\u201d after hiking down \u201cQuitter\u2019s Lane\u201d have a camaraderie with the remaining runners that is infectious. Yes, the dropouts tend to the blisters of those sorry athletes who are determined to finish. The Barkley Marathon is the brainchild of co-founder Lazarus Lake, who based the race on James Earl Ray\u2019s failed escape through the local mountains. He named parts of the course \u201cThe Pillars of Doom,\u201d \u201cSon-of-a-Bitch Ditch\u201d and \u201cThe Bad Thing,\u201d proving he may be a sadist, but he has a sense of humor. This documentary may be as wacky as the race itself, but the life lessons about pain and observations about competition are invaluable.\n\n\u201cI Touched All Your Stuff\u201d\n\nThe title of this unbelievable but true story comes from a practical joke played on Chris Kirk, whereby his housesitter covered every object in his apartment with aluminum foil. His books. His shoes. Even his coins. Kirk recounts this anecdote to the filmmakers, Ma\u00edra B\u00fchler and Matias Mariani, as he explains how he \u201ctouched all the stuff\u201d owned by his girlfriend\u2014a mystery woman known only as \u201cV\u201d\u2014because she wasn\u2019t entirely honest with him. Kirk may not be entirely honest with the filmmakers because he\u2019s talking to them from a Brazilian jail, where he has been incarcerated for crimes undisclosed. \u201cI Touched All Your Stuff,\u201d brilliantly uses computer files, interviews, photographs (the ones of V are all deliberately blurry) and music to tell Kirk\u2019s story. Viewers who go down this rabbit-hole may not discern exactly what happened, but it is impossible not to be impressed (and unsettled) by this strange but true investigation.\n\n\u201cFinders Keepers\u201d\n\nThis WTF documentary depicts the \u201cfoot fight\u201d that happened when John Wood lost his left leg for the second time. In Maiden, North Carolina, Shannon Whisnant purchased at auction a smoker left in a storage unit. However, the smoker contained amputee John Wood\u2019s leg. Claiming \u201cfinders keepers,\u201d Whisnant felt he was entitled to Wood\u2019s leg, and exploited his discovery for cash and celebrity. Wood, however, just wanted his leg back. He\u2019d lost it in a plane crash that killed his father and was saving the muscled and fleshed limb for a memorial. However, Wood succumbed to addiction and became estranged from his family as a result of the accident and its aftermath. John\u2019s mother says, \u201cIt\u2019s a funny story born of tragedy,\u201d and filmmakers Bryan Carberry and J. Clay Tweel nimbly tell this tale of what one interviewee calls, \u201cfuckery and shenanigans.\u201d The strangest moment may involve Wood trying to keep his leg at a local Hardee\u2019s, and the strangest character may be the women who is going to peel the skin off the preserved leg \u201clike beef jerky.\u201d There is considerable humor as the case is settled on a very special episode of \u201cJudge Mathis,\u201d but the heart of what is really going on with the two protagonists is what makes \u201cFinders Keepers\u201d so distinctive.\n\n\u201cSneakerheadz\u201d\n\nA sneakerhead is someone who \u201cforgoes paying their rent so they can own a pair of shoes they will never wear.\u201d In the wildly entertaining \u201cSneakerheadz,\u201d directors David T. Friendly and Mick Partridge explore this fascinating subculture of enthusiastic people who collect, design, and curate\u2014because resell is an ugly word\u2014sneakers. Now, these are no ordinary gym shoes. A Nike Dunk \u201cPigeon\u201d from 2005, which has a $69.95 retail value, can sell for $5,500; the Buscemi luxury sneakers can start at $900; and someone paid $100,000 for Michael Jordan\u2019s \u201cflu shoes.\u201d If you want to know about collabs, deadstock and quickstrikes, you need to see \u201cSneakerheadz.\u201d But be warned: you\u2019ll also see hoarders like baseball player Jeremy Guthrie, who has a vault in his house as a form of \u201ccollection protection,\u201d whereas other sneakerheads, who live at home, have their \u201cdad and his 2\u00d74\u201d keeping their sneaks safe. So valuable are some of these limited-edition kicks, that kids will camp out for days waiting for them to go on sale, and collectors will fly to Japan. But if you really want them, sneaker pimps, known as \u201cswag concierges,\u201d can help you find a pair. Yet, as the subjects of \u201cSneakerheadz\u201d indicate, the art of the hunt is part of the fun. There are, however, downsides to this subculture, and the film does devote time to violence around collecting, and the estimated 1,000 deaths a year that have resulted over people being killed for sneakers. Friendly and Partridge\u2019s documentary celebrates those collectors who are defined by what they wear. In fact, they are so obsessed and so addicted, one collector admits he can\u2019t wear wingtips.\n\n\u201cThe Seven Five\u201d\n\nBack in 1993, Michael Dowd, a New York City cop, testified that while he was an officer in the 1980s, he committed crimes including theft, extortion, racketeering, engaging in drugs for personal use, and trafficking in drugs. With crack in its heyday, it was a tough era for crime in New York. Or, as Dowd\u2019s partner, Kenny Eurell, candidly describes Brooklyn in the 1980s, \u201cWelcome to the Land of Fuck!\u201d Dowd, a \u201ccrook in a cop uniform\u201d explains how he would enter a house containing a 55-gallon drum of marijuana, guns and a duffle bag full of cash, and walk out with the cash. In the fabulously entertaining \u201cThe Seven Five,\u201d Dowd and a colorful rogues gallery of colleagues, dealers, DEA agents and Internal Affairs guys recount stories of the extent of Dowd\u2019s corruption. One plum example has Dowd getting shorted by a dealer he is protecting only to have the dealer put a hit out on Dowd. But the powerful Dowd pulls him over and puts an end to that. \u201cThe Seven Five\u201d includes a tense car chase\u2014but in this documentary, it is the cops being chased by the criminals! Dowd and Eurell eventually get on the payroll of Dominican drug dealer Adam Diaz, to advise him on narcotics officers in the area, and supply Diaz\u2019s men with bulletproof vests. By the time Dowd\u2014who reportedly (and not surprisingly) did more coke than he sold\u2014recounts a last-ditch kidnapping and murder plan, he also admits he is \u201cshocked\u201d he got away with what he did for as long as he did. Viewers\u2019 jaws will drop as well at what transpires in \u201cThe Seven Five\u201d\u2014especially when a stunner of a late-act twist is revealed. This doc is a Martin Scorsese movie in the making.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From sneakerheads to the white supremacist next door, the year's documentary subjects are anything but staid", "title": "2015\u2019s wild and wonderful documentaries: These true stories are infinitely weirder than fiction", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From sneakerheads to the white supremacist next door, the year's documentary subjects are anything but staid", "title": "2015\u2019s wild and wonderful documentaries: These true stories are infinitely weirder than fiction", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/12/2015s_wild_and_wonderful_documentaries_these_true_stories_are_infinitely_weirder_than_fiction/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/2015docs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From sneakerheads to the white supremacist next door, the year's documentary subjects are anything but staid", "title": "2015\u2019s wild and wonderful documentaries: These true stories are infinitely weirder than fiction", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/2015docs.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Gary M.
