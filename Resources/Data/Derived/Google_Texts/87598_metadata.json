Tim didn\u2019t mind going to church, but he told his parents often that when he grew up, he wanted to be a successful businessman. He was especially drawn to clothing and fabrics and colors.\n\nHis minister, though, seemed to see something totally different in his youthful member. The Rev. John Williams pulled the young boy aside one day and said he believed \u201cGod is talking to you. ... Do me a favor, listen.\u201d\n\nShaw had no idea that decades later, that request would create a life-changing direction.\n\nAt age 30, Shaw was the peacock-proud owner of a high-end men\u2019s store downtown, 319 King. It was the shop where stylish executives and NBA superstars sought fashion advice. Shaw knew the business, and even more, knew how to take care of a customer. He never forgot a name and knew the individual likes and dislikes of every customer he fitted.\n\nThe store\u2019s reputation grew and grew, primarily by word of mouth. When the New York Knicks started preseason practice at The College of Charleston, Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley often stopped by to see what was in the window.\n\nWhen Greg Marshall\u2019s Winthrop team first qualified for March Madness, he bought suits for his entire staff. Now that he\u2019s making millions as the coach at Wichita State, he continues to wear 319 King\u2019s label on the sidelines.\n\nShaw\u2019s business on King Street was booming. On the outside, so was Shaw. He was successful. He\u2019d accomplished exactly what he told his parents he wanted to do.\n\nCan you hear me now?\n\nIn 2003, Shaw, his wife and two boys were still involved in the church where he grew up. He was teaching a Sunday School class and still loved being around the church.\n\nBut there was a constant, small voice telling him to do more. So Shaw decided to embark on a second career: as a minister.\n\nIn 2006, he started a weekend course of study at Duke Divinity School. On Fridays, he would drive to Durham, N.C., and go to class from 6:30-10:30 p.m. On Saturdays, there were classes from 8 a.m.-12:30 p.m. He then drove back to the Lowcountry where he would preach either at Ebenezer UMC in Moncks Corner or Asbury-St. James on Rutledge Avenue.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost 10 years. He\u2019s still taking the courses, but he\u2019s now the full-time appointee as minister at Asbury-St. James, one of Charleston\u2019s oldest congregations. Oh, and by the way, he still runs the clothing store on King Street.\n\nA good fit\n\nShaw is excited about what\u2019s happening in this little church in this old part of town. When he first arrived, attendance on some Sundays was in the teens. They now average 60-90 and thanks to some generous church members, the facilities are undergoing renovation. While the neighborhood rejuvenates, the little church also is trying to lift hopes and spirits.\n\nShaw has two sons, Timothy, 19, and Luke, 12. His wife, Tina, tries to keep up with all the schedules while Tim divides his time between clothing customers and inspiring congregants.\n\nHe once spent all of his time trying to outfit the outer man.\n\nHe now is far more occupied with speaking to what\u2019s on the inside.\n\nShaw prides himself on his energy and positivity. But where would he be if he\u2019d never taken the time to listen?\n\nReach Warren Peper at peperwarren@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "319 King clothier finds good fit as a minister, too, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nArts & Travel, \r\nWarren Peper, \r\nWarren Peper, 319 King,Asbury-St. James,Charles Oakley ,Duke Divinity School,Patrick Ewing ,Rev.
