But, starting Wednesday morning, one day after it was reported Miller was in trouble with the law again, tweets began going out from the account, including an apology to fans.\n\nAround 10 a.m., the account tweeted: \u201cI know I\u2019ve made mistakes but I\u2019m doing my best to correct them everyone. I will do better in the future and make Broncos fans proud!\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t get too excited. Again, it is not Miller.\n\nThe current, fake account, has only 19 followers. Miller\u2019s official account with that handle had tens of thousands of followers.\n\nMiller is currently serving a six-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s drug policy, which he did actually tweet about on his official account before it went dark.\n\n\u201cSee reports abt 4 game susp. I know I did nothing wrong. I\u2019m sure this\u2019ll be resolved fairly. Disapp. Broncos have 2 open camp like this.\u201d\n\nThat tweet was sent July 22, at 12:49 p.m.\n\nRyan Parker: 303-954-2409, rparker@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ryanparkerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Von Miller not back on Twitter, no real apology to fans", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Von Miller not back on Twitter, no real apology to fans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/11/broncos-von-miller-not-back-on-twitter-no-real-apology-to-fans/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130910__BN20130911_Z00_BNSP11FBNMILLERp1.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130910__BN20130911_Z00_BNSP11FBNMILLERp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-11T16:21:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:27:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fc0\"", "article_summary": "Don\u2019t be fooled Broncos fans, Von Miller is not back on Twitter and did not offer up an apology to you.\nI will do better in the future and make Broncos fans proud!\u201dDon\u2019t get too excited.\nMiller\u2019s official account, @MillerLite40, which previously had a blue check mark for verification, has been deactivated for months.\nMiller\u2019s official account with that handle had tens of thousands of followers.\nMiller is currently serving a six-game suspension for violating the league\u2019s drug policy, which he did actually tweet about on his official account before it went dark."}
