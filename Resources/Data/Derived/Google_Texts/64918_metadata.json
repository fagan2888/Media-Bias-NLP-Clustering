Blane is the rich, handsome, well-meaning teenager who falls in love with the movie\u2019s protagonist, a young working-class woman named Andie Walsh played by Molly Ringwald. Blane loves Andie\u2019s strength, individuality and beauty. Andie loves Blane\u2019s kindness, devotion and beauty. They end up together in a memorable kiss in the parking lot outside the prom, an ending that still infuriates a critical mass of the fanbase of \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d which celebrates its 30th birthday this weekend. Those fans thought Andie should have kissed her best friend Phil \u201cDuckie\u201d Dale (Jon Cryer), a fellow working-class kid in thrift-store finery who loves her and can\u2019t seem to tell her so.\n\nTo identify with a privileged dreamboat like Blane, even though McCarthy plays him with great sensitivity and longing, feels either like being too proud of being rich, popular and handsome yourself, or like cheering for Big Tobacco in a class action lawsuit. Instead, a generation of American male teenagers, me included, saw themselves in Duckie\u2014charming, quirky and overlooked. Duckie belonged an elite gang of best friends \u201cPretty in Pink\u201d screenwriter John Hughes made the beating heart of his \u201980s teen filmography\u2014Cameron Frye in \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off,\u201d Farmer Ted in \u201cSixteen Candles\u201d and Watts in \u201cSome Kind of Wonderful\u201d\u2014characters who embodied the pain of being young and not yet able to be honest about your own desires.\n\nBeyond Hughes\u2019 other sidekicks, \u201cDuckie\u201d has become synonymous with \u201cweird friend thrown over for safe, popular choice,\u201d adolescent canon reinforced by a generation of boys who mimicked Duckie\u2014in dress, manner and seduction\u2014to joke and serenade their way into the hearts of their dream girls.\n\nDisciples of Duckie, we had it all wrong.\n\nNo, you don\u2019t get to be with the girl of your dreams just because you want to. No, you don\u2019t get to avoid telling her how you feel and then resent her for showing interest in another guy. No, it\u2019s not romantic, but rather a little sad that you can only express how you feel to her father and in charming but empty gestures like lip-synching Otis Redding\u2019s \u201cTry a Little Tenderness.\u201d And no, you aren\u2019t an unsung hero because your dream girl doesn\u2019t dream of you. You\u2019re a bad best friend for not respecting her decisions and thinking that means her love for you isn\u2019t worth anything.\n\nRe-watch \u201cPretty in Pink\u201d and Duckie comes off not as a role model but as a cautionary tale about what we can destroy while growing up: The movie may end happily for everyone \u2014 even Duckie, who doesn\u2019t win Andie\u2019s heart but nobly tells her to forgive Blane for canceling on taking her to the prom. Before all that, Duckie comes dangerously close to losing Andie forever: Not 30 seconds after the Otis Redding serenade, Blane shows up to take Andie on their first date. Duckie, not knowing about the date, accuses Andie of disrespecting herself by going out with a rich guy, and then threatens to not be there (i.e., not be her friend) if she gets her heart broken.\n\nNever mind that Duckie doesn\u2019t know Blane and has no claim on Andie, and, since Andie is a smart, self-possessed, attractive young woman, she has probably received this kind of attention before. Since Andie and Duckie have been friends since childhood, Duckie having his world rocked when Andie goes on a date feels less like unfairness and more like Duckie ignoring an entire adolescence\u2019s worth of evidence that Andie isn\u2019t just his pal or his valentine, but a woman and a person in her own right.\n\n\u201cBut Duckie\u2019s pain was real!,\u201d I just heard a squad of ex-Duckies cry. I used this excuse to not grieve my own teenage heartbreak but instead make it the heartbreaker\u2019s fault. I wish had known better than to think my high school best friend/crush would fall for me after months of not letting on, and then getting mad when she fell for someone else, and in between trying to woo her with a lip-synch performance (mine was M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce\u2019s \u201cHome Sweet Home.\u201d Laugh all you want.). I can only imagine what it would have been like for a girl in Andie\u2019s position who likes a guy who likes her and doesn\u2019t want to hurt her best friend, who seems have trouble being straight with her anyway.\n\nI wish someone had clued me \u2014 and teenagers like me \u2014 in to the realization that writer Todd Goldberg outlined in his 2007 essay \u201cThat\u2019s Not a Name, That\u2019s a Major Appliance: How Andrew McCarthy Ruined my Life\u201d:", "article_metadata": {"description": "I, too, saw myself in John Hughes' nice guy\u2014and like so many others, I learned all the wrong lessons from his story", "title": "The trouble with Duckie: How \u201cPretty in Pink\u2019s\u201d most lovable character gave a generation of teenage boys the wrong idea", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I, too, saw myself in John Hughes' nice guy\u2014and like so many others, I learned all the wrong lessons from his story", "title": "The trouble with Duckie: How \u201cPretty in Pink\u2019s\u201d most lovable character gave a generation of teenage boys the wrong idea", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/27/the_trouble_with_duckie_how_pretty_in_pinks_most_lovable_character_gave_a_generation_of_teenage_boys_the_wrong_idea/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/pretty_in_pink_ducky.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I, too, saw myself in John Hughes' nice guy\u2014and like so many others, I learned all the wrong lessons from his story", "title": "The trouble with Duckie: How \u201cPretty in Pink\u2019s\u201d most lovable character gave a generation of teenage boys the wrong idea", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/pretty_in_pink_ducky.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kevin Smokler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Brat Pack, Editor's Picks, Film, John Hughes, jon cryer, Movies, pretty in pink", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "You\u2019re a bad best friend for not respecting her decisions and thinking that means her love for you isn\u2019t worth anything.\nThose fans thought Andie should have kissed her best friend Phil \u201cDuckie\u201d Dale (Jon Cryer), a fellow working-class kid in thrift-store finery who loves her and can\u2019t seem to tell her so.\nNever mind that Duckie doesn\u2019t know Blane and has no claim on Andie, and, since Andie is a smart, self-possessed, attractive young woman, she has probably received this kind of attention before.\nBlane is the rich, handsome, well-meaning teenager who falls in love with the movie\u2019s protagonist, a young working-class woman named Andie Walsh played by Molly Ringwald.\nI used this excuse to not grieve my own teenage heartbreak but instead make it the heartbreaker\u2019s fault."}
