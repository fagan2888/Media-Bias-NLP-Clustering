Centre Partners Invests in Juice Maker Sun Orchard

The deal follows better-for-you transactions for Noosa Yoghurt and Teasdale Foods

Private equity firm Centre Partners has made a majority investment in Sun Orchard Inc.

Sun Orchard, headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, provides juice and beverage products, including orange, lemon, lime and grapefruit juice. The company makes natural, not-from-concentrate juices, fruit ades, bar mixes, specialty smoothie bases and other mixology and culinary products. In addition to its Tempe headquarters, Sun Orchard has a production facility in Florida. Terms of the investment weren't disclosed.

Centre Partners, headquartered in New York and Los Angeles, has a history of investing in food and beverage companies. In October, the firm picked up a stake in Stonewall Kitchen, a York, Maine-based food producer and retailer of jams, sauces, crackers, pancake mixes and other food products. In October 2013, Centre invested in Captain D's Seafood Restaurants.

Centre's investment in Sun Orchard is in line with the consumer-driven better-for-you food trend that has been driving food and beverage dealflow for years. Other recent health food transactions include Advent International's purchase of Noosa Yoghurt LLC, and Snow Phipps Group LLC's acquisition of Teasdale Foods Inc.
