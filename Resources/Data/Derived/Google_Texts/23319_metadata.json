Here are eight highlights of what he had to say:\n\n1) On the U.S.\u2019s failure to halt the march of ISIS in Syria and Iraq: \u201cSyria has been a difficult problem for the entire world community, and, obviously, most importantly, for the people of Syria themselves that have been devastated by this civil war, caught between a brutal dictator who drops barrel bombs on his own population . . . and a barbaric, ruthless organization in ISIL. And what we\u2019ve been able to do is to stall ISIL\u2019s momentum to take away some of the key land that they were holding. . . Over time the community of nations will all get rid of them.\u201d\n\n2) On whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is challenging Obama\u2019s leadership: \u201cWell Steve, I\u2019ve got to tell you, if you think that running your economy into the ground and having to send troops in to prop up your only ally is leadership, then we\u2019ve got a different definition of leadership.\n\n3) On whether the world is safer after Obama\u2019s nearly two terms: \u201cAmerica is a safer place. I think that there are places, obviously, like Syria that are not safer than when I came into office. But in terms of us protecting ourselves against terrorism, in terms of us making sure that we are strengthening our alliances, in terms of our reputation around the world, absolutely we\u2019re stronger.\"\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Putin Has Sent to Syria\n\n4) Obama\u2019s thoughts on Donald Trump: \u201cWell, I think that he is a great publicity seeker and at a time when the Republican Party hasn\u2019t really figured out what it\u2019s for, as opposed to what it\u2019s against, I think that he is tapped into something that exists in the Republican Party that\u2019s real\u2026 He is, you know, the classic reality TV character. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll end up being president of the United States.\u201d\n\n5) On Hillary Clinton\u2019s email problem: \u201cNo, [and] I don\u2019t think it posed a national security problem. I think that it was a mistake that she has acknowledged and \u2013 you know, as a general proposition, when we\u2019re in these offices, we have to be more sensitive and stay as far away from the line as possible when it comes to how we handle information, how we handle our own personal data. I do think that the way it\u2019s been ginned up is in part because of \u2013 in part\u2014because of politics [as she seeks the Democratic nomination]. And I think she\u2019d be the first to acknowledge that maybe she could have handled the original decision better and the disclosures more quickly.\u201d\n\n6) On Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s possible entry into the Democratic presidential campaign: \u201cYou know, I am going to let Joe make that decision. And I mean what I say. I think Joe will go down as one of the finest vice presidents in history, and one of the more consequential.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump Out of Step With Americans Over Immigration Policy\n\n\n\n7) On retiring House Speaker John Boehner: \u201cJohn Boehner and I disagreed on just about everything. But the one thing I\u2019ll say about John Boehner is he did care about the institution. He recognized that nobody gets 100 percent in our democracy.\u201d\n\n8) On whether Obama thinks he could win reelection again if he were allowed to run: \u201cYes, I do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This past week has been one of rising political and military tensions both here and ab", "title": "Obama Is Certain Trump Won\u2019t Be the Next President", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/12/Obama-Certain-Trump-Won-t-be-Next-President", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/12/Obama-Certain-Trump-Won-t-be-Next-President", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This past week has been one of rising political and military tensions both here and ab", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96f1\"", "article_summary": "But the one thing I\u2019ll say about John Boehner is he did care about the institution.\nThere\u2019s utter chaos on Capitol Hill as House Republicans try to find a replacement for the retiring House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio.\nI think Joe will go down as one of the finest vice presidents in history, and one of the more consequential.\u201dRelated: Trump Out of Step With Americans Over Immigration Policy7) On retiring House Speaker John Boehner: \u201cJohn Boehner and I disagreed on just about everything.\n3) On whether the world is safer after Obama\u2019s nearly two terms: \u201cAmerica is a safer place.\nI think that there are places, obviously, like Syria that are not safer than when I came into office."}
