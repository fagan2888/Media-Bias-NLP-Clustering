Three unarmed U.S. Marines reportedly shut down a man with an AK-47 who opened fire on a high-speed train heading from Amsterdam to Paris Friday.

The Marines reportedly heard the gunman loading his AK-47 in the bathroom before he opened fire, injuring three people, reported The Daily Mail. The Marines tackled the man and detained him, until the train stopped and police arrested him.

Two of the victims were reported seriously injured.

The Telegraph reports counter-terror police have taken over the investigation, but France’s Interior ministry spokesman said: “Talking about a terrorist motive would be premature at the moment.”

The suspect is a 26-year-old Moroccan and known to intelligence sources.
