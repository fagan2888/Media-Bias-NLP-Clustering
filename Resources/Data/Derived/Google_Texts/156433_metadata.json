Hardline student protesters, though, are demanding that Maduro step down, less than a year into his term.\n\nThe president, a 51-year-old former union activist who has made preserving Chavez\u2019s legacy the centerpiece of his rule, accuses opponents of planning a coup backed by Washington.\n\nCapriles, who has seen his leadership of the opposition upstaged by Lopez\u2019s street activism, lashed Maduro for talking \u201crubbish\u201d and said he was unsure if he would attend the meeting scheduled for the afternoon at the presidential palace.\n\nSOCIALIST GOVERNOR SPEAKS OUT\n\nThe governor of the turbulent state of Tachira, who belongs to the ruling party, on Monday criticized the government\u2019s response to the protests and called for Lopez to be freed \u2013 an extremely unusual stance for a Socialist Party official.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of peace; all of those in jail for political motives should be sent home,\u201d said Jose Vielma, referring to Lopez and another well-known opposition-linked prisoner.\n\nSocialist Party leaders have for years avoided making comments that could appear to be breaking away from the party line, making Vielma\u2019s comment all the more uncommon.\n\nThe protests have hit the border state Tachira harder than any other, with gangs of student demonstrators now the de facto authorities in some parts of its principal cities.\n\nEven though Maduro has sent in troops to restore order, transport is frequently disrupted by improvised roadblocks that charge tolls to those seeking passage and throw rocks at those who attempt to move on without paying.\n\nSupermarkets in Tachira are opening only for several hours in the morning, with supplies of food limited because delivery trucks cannot get through.\n\nThe nationwide wave of protests began with sporadic demonstrations in Tachira\u2019s capital of San Cristobal due to outrage over an attempted rape, sparking student protests around the region.\n\nLopez, a 42-year-old Harvard-educated economist and firebrand opposition leader, rode the coattails of those protests to create a nationwide effort called \u201cLa Salida\u201d or \u201cThe Exit\u201d meant to end Maduro\u2019s rule.\n\nRelatives of Lopez, who was arrested on Tuesday, said he was bearing up at Ramo Verde prison outside Caracas. \u201cHe\u2019s strong. But he\u2019s a prisoner, and for a mother, it\u2019s devastating,\u201d his mother Antonieta Mendoza de Lopez told Reuters.\n\nPROTESTS GRIND ON\n\nRoadblocks of burning trash and clashes between rock-throwing students and tear-gas-lobbing troops have shown no sign of forcing Maduro from power but have become an annoyance for the mostly well-to-do neighborhoods where they take place.\n\n\u201cThis is brutality. We are fighting for our freedom because when we go to the supermarket there\u2019s no flour, there\u2019s no sugar,\u201d said Yesenia Alvarado, 29, an architect, at the upscale Plaza Altamira where a barricade was blocking traffic.\n\nAs she spoke, a man driving a pickup attempted to force his way through the barricade, at one point getting out and piling debris into the back of the truck. Angry demonstrators restored the barricade and prevented him from moving ahead.\n\nResidents of Caracas\u2019 poorer west side have staged only a few minor demonstrations, though government critics there have joined traditional protests of banging pots and pans at their windows during Maduro\u2019s hours-long television broadcasts.\n\nThe wave of violence has shifted attention away from economic troubles including inflation of 56 percent, slowing growth, and shortages of staple goods such as milk and flour.\n\nThe opposition blames these problems on Chavez\u2019s economic legacy of nationalizations, currency controls and constant confrontation with businesses.\n\nThey say socialism has crippled private enterprise and weakened state institutions while spawning a nepotistic elite that enriches itself with the country\u2019s oil wealth.\n\nMaduro calls it an \u201ceconomic war\u201d led by the opposition. The former bus driver calls himself the \u201cson\u201d of Chavez and has vowed to continue the generous public spending that helped reduce poverty and propelled the late president to repeated election victories over 14 years.\n\n(Additional reporting by Javier Farias in San Cristobal, Girish Gupta in Caracas; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "article_metadata": {"description": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Anti-government demonstrators set up barricades and started fires in Venezuela's capital on Monday despite calls from within the opposition to rein in protests in which at least 12 people have died in the OPEC nation.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "By Brian Ellsworth and Andrew Cawthorne    CARACAS (Reuters) - Anti-government demonstrators set up barricades and started fires in Venezuela's capital on Monday despite calls from within the oppositi", "title": "Venezuela Protests Flare Anew, Death Toll Rises to 12", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/venezuela-protests-flare-anew-death-toll-rises-to-12/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Venezuela-protest1-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Venezuela-protest1-150x150.jpg", "description": "By Brian Ellsworth and Andrew Cawthorne    CARACAS (Reuters) - Anti-government demonstrators set up", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary", "title": "Venezuela Protests Flare Anew, Death Toll Rises to 12"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The nationwide wave of protests began with sporadic demonstrations in Tachira\u2019s capital of San Cristobal due to outrage over an attempted rape, sparking student protests around the region.\nThe protests have hit the border state Tachira harder than any other, with gangs of student demonstrators now the de facto authorities in some parts of its principal cities.\nThey also want Maduro to disarm pro-government gangs and address national issues ranging from crime to shortages of basic products.\nAuthorities in the convulsed border state of Tachira confirmed the latest death from the unrest: a man hit by a stray bullet watching a protest from the balcony of his apartment.\nHe and other opposition figureheads are demanding that the government release imprisoned protest leader Leopoldo Lopez and about a dozen jailed student demonstrators."}
