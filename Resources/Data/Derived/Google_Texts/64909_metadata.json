I have been able to vote for nearly 48 years, and with the exception of two general election years, I am proud to say that I have been 100 percent Independent. I have listened to the candidates; read their position on each issue; and made my mark next to the name of the man or woman I believed to be most qualified for the position. And, thanks to a rare choice here in Nevada, I have all too often been forced to choose \u2018none of the above.\u2019 The 2016 general election is drawing near, and with a single exception, I don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ll be able to vote for any Republican candidates.\n\nIt appears that the GOP, which includes both Republicans and the TEA Party, wants to take our nation backwards in time. It is attempting to take away voting rights for minorities, and continually attempts to roll back or repeal advances in social programs which began after WWII. The GOP wants women to return to a subservient role as second class citizens, and put gay men and women back \u2018in the closet.\u2019\n\nWith the exception of Rand Paul and Jeb Bush, I have not heard a single new or even a positive idea from another GOP hopeful. I can\u2019t vote for Rand Paul; his Libertarian ideas are far too dangerous, and could result in an acceleration of income disparity. Jeb Bush is a \u2018maybe.\u2019 He must prove to me that he is completely separated from the policies of his father and brother.\n\nIn the last couple of days GOP presidential candidates have made statements which not only guarantee that they will not receive my vote, but actually frighten me.\n\nWednesday Ben Carson, a former neurosurgeon, who I assume has a medical degree, claimed that being gay is a choice, and therefore the rights of the LGBT community are different from the rights of minorities. He said that the proof was delivered by prison inmates, most of whom enter confinement as straight, but when they are released many of them are gay. He said \u2018something must have happened while they were incarcerated.\u2019\n\nI assumed that a man of science would have read the facts. Carson is correct that not all studies have resulted in the same conclusion, but the one that counts has; the American Psychiatric Association decided that homosexuals are born; they don\u2019t decide to change their sexual preference.\n\nHow could I vote for a man who doesn\u2019t believe that \u2018all men are created equal?\u2019\n\nThen there\u2019s Marco Rubio. He loves the past. Although the United States\u2019 embargo of his parent\u2019s native land, Cuba, has had no effect in over 50 years, he believes it should remain. But that\u2019s not the worst of it; he would institute George W. Bush\u2019s economic policies if he was the president. Let\u2019s see; I know it\u2019s a long time ago, but how did that work out?\n\nBush inherited a surplus from Bill Clinton. In 2008, after two terms of \u2018trickle-down\u2019 economics, our nation was in the worst recession in its history. Senator Rubio; thanks, but no thanks.\n\nI saved my favorite for last; I call him \u2018Mr. if it works, let\u2019s break it;\u2019 Ted Cruz.\n\nThe junior Senator from Texas is loyal to one and only one entity; the TEA Party. He doesn\u2019t care about the future of the GOP or the people of the United States; he cares about the obstructionist party and what it can do for him.\n\nCruz\u2019 efforts have been twofold; to halt any efforts for immigration reform, and to repeal the Affordable Care Act. However, he claims to be concerned about approximately 7.5 million people who might lose their health care if the Supreme Court strikes down a portion of the Affordable Care Act. He offered a solution; to allow the purchase of health insurance across state lines.\n\nFirst of all, he doesn\u2019t care; Cruz has voted against every measure which would help low income earners and the poor. Second of all, economists and health care experts disagree about the merits of \u2018cross-state\u2019 purchase of health insurance.\n\nHow can I possibly vote Republican? Scott Walker hates the working class; Rick Perry is, well, he\u2019s Rick Perry, and Mike Huckabee wants to institute Christianity as the nation\u2019s religion, violating the Constitution.\n\nI do like \u2018none of the above;\u2019 more each and every day.\n\nBy James Turnage\n\nSources:\n\nMSNBC\n\nCNN\n\nThe Daily Beast\n\nPhoto Courtesy of elycefeliz\n\nFlickr License\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "James Turnage", "og": {"site_name": "The Public Slate", "description": "I don\u2019t arrive at my polling place without having made a decision about every candidate and every issue, and how I intend to cast my ballot.
