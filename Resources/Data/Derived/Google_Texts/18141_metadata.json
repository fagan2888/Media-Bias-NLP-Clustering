Is this all the administration had up its sleeve to counteract the cuts despite years of friendly and not-so-friendly warnings?\n\n\n\nAnd one more consideration: none of this is illegal. So is it right for a sitting President of the United States to single out a company that's not committing a crime or even breaking a workplace regulation?\n\nOh, and the President should also take note that Staples is not exactly so many \"billions of dollars in profits.\" Staple is, in fact, a struggling corporation trying everything from consolidation to labor cost cutting to stay alive.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nShare your thoughts on the comment section below.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "President Obama criticized Staples for cutting worker hours and avoid Obamacare costs...but did he have the right to scrutinize the company?", "author": "Jake Novak", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "President Obama criticized Staples for cutting worker hours and avoid Obamacare costs...but did he have the right to scrutinize the company?", "title": "Does Obama have the right to 'shame' Staples?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/11/does-obama-have-the-right-to-shame-staples.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/03/30/100604229-20130330-1402-100.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Obama criticized Staples for cutting worker hours and avoid Obamacare costs...but did he have the right to scrutinize the company?", "title": "Does Obama have the right to 'shame' Staples?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/02/11/does-obama-have-the-right-to-shame-staples.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/03/30/100604229-20130330-1402-100.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@jakejakeny", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Power Lunch, Investing, Barack Obama, Mergers and Acquisitions, Health Care, Mergers, Health Insurance, Staples Inc, Managed Health Care, Health Care Services, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-02-11T10:22:29-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Power Lunch", "modified_time": "2015-02-11T10:22:56-0500", "tag": "Health Care Services"}, "pageNodeId": 102417006, "news_keywords": "obamacare, staples, obama, shame on your, buzzfeed obama"}, "article_summary": "Read MoreStarboard letter urges Staples to merge with Office DepotSo the real question now is this: Does President Obama believe that \"shame on you\" is a real policy?\nThe debate this morning is over President Obama's rebuke to Staples for cutting back on worker hours in order to avoid costly coverage requirements under Obamacare.\nOh, and the President should also take note that Staples is not exactly so many \"billions of dollars in profits.\"\nYou may agree or disagree with Mr. Obama's sentiments, but here's the problem: none of this should be a surprise.\nStaple is, in fact, a struggling corporation trying everything from consolidation to labor cost cutting to stay alive."}
