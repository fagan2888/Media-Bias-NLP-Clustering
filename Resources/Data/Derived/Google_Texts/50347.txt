CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The number of locations where you can go for help navigating the Healthcare.gov website has grown to 13. Starting Saturday, you can buy insurance on the federal marketplace for the first time or change plans if you need to.

In-person assistance to help with those issues and answer questions you might have about Medicaid eligibility will be available at six churches, three Cuyahoga County Library branches, Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Health Services, Mercy Regional Medical Center, McCafferty Health Center and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum (see document below).

All of this is part of "Rock Enroll NEO," the kickoff for the second open enrollment period for insurance through the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.

On Thursday, Mary Wakefield, an administrator with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and Services Administration, made an appearance at the Rock Hall to drum up excitement over open enrollment, which runs Nov. 15 through Feb. 15.

Another delegate of President Obama - HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell - also traveled to Ohio Thursday, making an appearance at a library in Columbus.

In order to have your insurance coverage in place by Jan. 1, you need to complete the enrollment process by Dec. 15.

In addition to Saturday's events, you can get information or find help at areyoucoveredohio.org or 800-648-1176; getcoveredamerica.org or the Get Covered America Ohio office in Cleveland at 216-314-2392; the 2-1-1 website at 211cleveland.org; or the HHS consumer assistance center at 800-318-2596.
