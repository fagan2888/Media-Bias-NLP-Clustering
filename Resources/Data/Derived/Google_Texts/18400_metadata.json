Rather than foisting it directly on businesses and individuals, Obama\u2019s new presidential edicts purport to commandeer state governments for the purpose. The \u201cregulations\u201d even \u201cgraciously\u201d offer states what the anti-CO 2 zealots in the administration and its EPA describe as a \u201cmenu\u201d of \u201cpolicy options\u201d they can \u201cchoose\u201d from to comply with the decrees. The battle to stop the abuse, though, is now underway.\n\nThe \u201cclimate\u201d regulatory regime unveiled by the EPA last month calls for massive reductions in emissions from power plants. Under the scheme, described as \u201cObamaCare for the atmosphere,\u201d emissions of what scientists refer to as the \u201cgas of life\u201d \u2014 exhaled by humans and required for plants \u2014 must be slashed by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Obama explained the economic effects of his plot in a 2008 interview: \u201cUnder my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.\u201d At least in that instance, he was telling the truth. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimated that the scheme could cost $50 billion per year in lost GDP and over 200,000 jobs annually, in addition to a plunge in household disposable income of over half a trillion dollars a year.\n\nIf states refuse to submit to the administration\u2019s widely ridiculed edicts, the EPA claims it has the power to step in and create its own \u201cplan.\u201d More than a few state governments, however, are already fighting back \u2014 or at least pretending to in an effort to appease the groundswell of opposition \u2014 against what elected officials say is brazen anti-constitutional federal and executive overreach. Multiple avenues to stop the plot are being pursued, ranging from congressional action and federal lawsuits to state nullification efforts. Some analysts also suggested forcing the agency to prepare a legally required \u201cimpact statement\u201d outlining and justifying the human devastation set to be wrought on America under the scheme.\n\nWith the GOP-controlled House of Representatives complicit in the administration\u2019s scheming \u2014 the House has the constitutional power to cut off all funding for Obama\u2019s \u201cclimate\u201d antics, yet has refused to do so for reasons that remain unclear \u2014 attention is increasingly shifting to state capitols. Shortly after the latest EPA plot was unveiled, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, citing higher energy costs, lost jobs, and lost business, promised to \u201coppose these regulations using every means possible.\u201d Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett vowed to \u201cfight these regulations every step of the way.\u201d Other governors and state lawmakers offered similar rhetoric, but many of those same states are already working on their own plots to needlessly reduce emissions of the essential-to-life gas.\n\nUnder growing public pressure, though, lawmakers and some governors, especially from coal states, are actually turning up the heat. On July 1, for example, The Hill reported that nine state governments joined a lawsuit against the EPA climate regime by Murray Energy that seeks to overturn the \u201cillegal, irrational, and destructive cap-and-tax\u201d plot. The states include West Virginia, Alabama, Alaska, Kentucky, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Wyoming. The suit, filed on June 18 in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, aims to have the courts restrain Obama\u2019s EPA and stop it from issuing and enforcing unlawful decrees.\n\n\u201cEPA\u2019s assertion of authority denied it by Congress imposes real harms on the States now: States have to undertake huge amounts of burdensome work now to develop plans to meet the anticipated rule and cannot wait for the final rule and still have any chance of meeting the indicated deadlines,\u201d explains a brief filed by the nine state governments, blasting as \u201cextraordinary\u201d the EPA\u2019s claims of authority. \u201cThe \u2018specific prohibition\u2019 against the EPA\u2019s proposed rule is in the very statutory provision the agency cites as its authority.\u201d\n\nAccording to the states\u2019 court filing, Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act \u2014 the same statute the EPA cites as its supposed authority for issuing the decrees \u2014 actually prohibits the administration from regulating \u201cany air pollutant emitted from a source category that EPA already regulates\u201d under a different section of the statute. In other words, as The Hill explained, that means the EPA cannot regulate those power plants under Section 111(d) if they are already regulated under another section of the Clean Air Act. Of course, Congress itself never had the constitutional authority to pass a \u201cClean Air Act\u201d to begin with \u2014 much less delegate such anti-constitutional powers to an unconstitutional agency created by an executive order.\n\nStill, in a bizarre ruling handed down last month that makes a mockery of science and the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme Court gave backing to much of the EPA\u2019s radical anti-CO 2 scheming. As such, efforts to hold the federal government accountable to the Constitution via federal courts are widely viewed as unlikely to succeed. The ruling did say, however, that federal agencies have \u201cno power to \u2018tailor\u2019 legislation to bureaucratic policy goals.\u201d That could bolster the position of some state officials who were demanding that the administration withdraw its unconstitutional and unlawful plot before being forced to squander even more taxpayer funds defending it in court.\n\n\u201cAs the chief legal officer for the State of West Virginia, I respectfully request that you withdraw the Proposed Rule immediately because EPA lacks the legal authority to adopt that Rule,\u201d West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey wrote in a letter to EPA boss Administrator Gina McCarthy, saying the plot should be nixed to \u201cavoid needless litigation.\u201d The EPA is not allowed to \u201cblatantly violate the law in order to achieve its policy goals,\u201d Morrisey added in a statement. The letter also cited the arguments made by the nine states in their recent court filing.\n\nIn Congress, lawmakers are also considering their options. One plan, proposed by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), would invoke the Congressional Review Act. Once the EPA regulations are finalized, Congress could use the law to simply overturn the CO 2 regulatory regime. Sen. McConnell, an establishment Republican up for re-election widely viewed by conservatives as an enabler of the out-of-control executive branch, called Obama\u2019s carbon plot \u201ca dagger in the heart of the American middle class\u201d and vowed to fight it. Indeed, among Republicans of all varieties, public support for the scheme is virtually non-existent. It remains to be seen, though, how dedicated the GOP truly is to using the tools it has to stop Obama\u2019s EPA.\n\nEven some Democrats, including McConnell\u2019s opponent, have publicly turned against the administration\u2019s attack on Americans and their economy. \u201cLast week, the EPA unleashed its latest assault on the jobs and livelihoods of our coal miners,\u201d Rep. Nick Rahall (D-W.Va.) said after the latest EPA decrees were unveiled. \u201cThe EPA needs to get their head out of the clouds and come back down to Earth where the rest of us must live and work. We don't need more regulation to solve our energy challenges \u2014 we need more innovation.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rep. Rahall and the dozens of co-sponsors for his legislation to block the new decrees, dubbed the \u201cProtection and Accountability Regulatory Act of 2014,\u201d know full well that even if the Senate were to pass the bill as well, Obama would veto it. The only real option for Congress, aside from using the Congressional Review Act to kill the edicts, is to defund the EPA, or at least its ability to impose the unconstitutional and unlawful carbon decrees on America.\n\nAt the state level, nullification of unconstitutional federal statutes and edicts has been spreading like wildfire. Under heavy pressure from struggling constituents, lawmakers in both Arizona and Idaho have been working hard this year to nullify all EPA decrees in their states. Nullification was a favorite solution touted by some of America\u2019s most prominent Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Still today, liberal- and conservative-leaning states are nullifying unconstitutional federal acts ranging from attacks on gun rights to marijuana prohibition. Even disgraced Attorney General Eric Holder has been forced to acknowledge the viability of the tactic.\n\nA solid majority of Americans reject the man-made global-warming theories cited by the Obama administration and the United Nations to justify their radical plans. According to a recent Pew survey, 53 percent of respondents rejected the theory, while 40 percent believe human activities are responsible for \u201cwarming\u201d \u2014 despite the fact that there has been no global warming in almost two decades and counting. Obama and his fellow alarmists simply doubled down, with the president outlandishly using a commencement speech to ridicule the majority of Americans who refuse to believe his discredited theory. The EPA has also been lawlessly hiding the \u201cscience\u201d purportedly justifying its power grabs.\n\nIt has become clear that what more than a few U.S. lawmakers have referred to as \u201cthe imperial presidency\u201d will not stop abusing regulatory agencies such as the EPA until forced to do so. As such, the best strategy would be for House Republicans to cut off all funding to the EPA and other unconstitutional agencies enforcing unconstitutional executive decrees. In addition, state governments ought to use nullification to protect citizens from federal abuse and tyranny. The climate, which has always changed and always will, should be the least of Americans' worries. Without serious action, the administration\u2019s accelerating wars on coal, guns, the Constitution, state sovereignty, the economy, jobs, and more will continue to wreak real havoc on Americans and the world.\n\nAlex Newman is a correspondent for The New American, covering economics, education, politics, and more.
