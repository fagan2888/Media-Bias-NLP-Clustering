(AP) \u2014 Once a democratic socialist, always a democratic socialist. Once a scold of big money in politics, still a scold.\n\nNo one can accuse Bernie Sanders of flip-flopping over his four decades in public life. Rock steady, he\u2019s inhabited the same ideological corner from which he now takes on Hillary Rodham Clinton in an improbable quest for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nHere he is in 1974, as the 32-year-old candidate for U.S. Senate of a fledgling leftist party in Vermont called Liberty Union: \u201cA handful of banks and billionaires control the economic and political life of America. \u2026 America is becoming less and less of a democracy and more and more of an oligarchy.\u201d\n\nAnd now, in an Associated Press interview: \u201cThis is a rigged economy, which works for the rich and the powerful, and is not working for ordinary Americans. \u2026 You know this country just does not belong to a handful of billionaires.\u201d\n\nSome see him as a broken record, others as a person who has been telling the truth all along and just waiting for enough people to listen.\n\n\u201cThe fascinating thing about Bernie right now is that the agenda has caught up with Bernie,\u201d said Garrison Nelson, a University of Vermont political science professor and longtime Sanders watcher.\n\nDuring Sanders\u2019 near decade as mayor of Burlington in the 1980s, during his eight terms holding Vermont\u2019s lone House seat and during his near decade in the Senate, the message has stayed the same: The rich are absconding with an immorally large part of the country\u2019s wealth, and ordinary people have been getting the short end of the stick.\n\nClinton has gone from opposing same-sex marriage rights to supporting them. Howard Dean, the last Vermont presidential candidate, was a centrist governor who became a liberal representing the \u201cDemocratic wing of the Democratic Party,\u201d when he saw the left flank open in the 2004 primary campaign.\n\nSanders, now 73, favored gay marriage rights before it became fashionable in Democratic circles. He voted against the Defense of Marriage Act in the mid-1990s signed by Clinton\u2019s husband, President Bill Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie Sanders has had 4 decades to rehearse stump speech", "title": "Bernie Sanders has had 4 decades to rehearse stump speech", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bernie Sanders has had 4 decades to rehearse stump speech", "title": "Bernie Sanders has had 4 decades to rehearse stump speech", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/bernie_sanders_has_had_4_decades_to_rehearse_stump_speech/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/dem-2016-sanders-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bernie Sanders has had 4 decades to rehearse stump speech", "title": "Bernie Sanders has had 4 decades to rehearse stump speech", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/dem-2016-sanders-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dave Gram", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, News, Politics NewsMONTPELIER, Vt.
