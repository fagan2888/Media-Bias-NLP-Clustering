There is nothing wrong with that. We want to have a president who thinks through the issues. My experience in Washington is that logic alone doesn\u2019t work. Once you lay out a position, you are going to roll up your sleeves and you have to fight to get it done. That is key in Washington. In order for presidents to succeed, they cannot just \u2014 when they run into problems, step back and give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling and I have a feeling that the leadership and the president have given up on the big issues facing this country whether it\u2019s immigration or a budget deal or infrastructure funding or trade or energy. there is a sense that you can\u2019t deal with that. This country needs that. They can\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Panetta: Obama Has Given Up", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Panetta: Obama Has Given Up", "title": "Panetta: Obama Has Given Up - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/07/hja.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/10/07/panetta-obama-has-given-up/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Panetta: Obama Has Given Up", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/07/hja.jpg", "title": "Panetta: Obama Has Given Up - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Defense, MSNBC, Twitter,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-10-07T09:53:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPanetta said, \u201cHe [Obama] approaches things like a law professor in presenting a logic of his position.\nInstead he suggested Obama has given up.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTuesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cAndrea Mitchell Reports,\u201d former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta declared President Barack Obama\u2019s approach to be like a law professor, however without the aspect of rolling up his sleeves and to get the job done.\nOnce you lay out a position, you are going to roll up your sleeves and you have to fight to get it done.\nThat is key in Washington."}
