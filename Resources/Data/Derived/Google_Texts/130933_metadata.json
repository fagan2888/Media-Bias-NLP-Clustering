Jason DeCrow/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office said Thursday the mayor and his wife plan to travel to Puerto Rico for a personal trip, a public disclosure that provides a sharp contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s policy of keeping his out-of-town jaunts private.\n\nMr. de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, are scheduled to leave New York on Friday evening and return to the city on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe mayor will remain in close contact with senior leadership and staff at City Hall, including receiving daily briefings,\u201d said Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio.\n\nThe mayor and Ms. McCray are paying for their travel costs, his office said. No aides from City Hall are accompanying them on the trip, but the mayor\u2019s security team from the New York Police Department will be with the couple, his office said.\n\nFirst Deputy Mayor Anthony Shorris will be responsible for attending to any issues that arise at City Hall while the mayor is out of town.\n\nMr. de Blasio has promised to provide the public with general information about his whereabouts, saying he believes New Yorkers have a right to be informed about his location.\n\nMr. Bloomberg, who served as mayor between 2002 and 2013, refused to provide information about his personal out-of-town travel. A billionaire, Mr. Bloomberg owned homes around the world, including Bermuda, London and Vail, Colo.\n\nIn 2010, Mr. Bloomberg came under fire for being in Bermuda at the start of a snowstorm that snarled the city for days. In 2013, Mr. Bloomberg was again in Bermuda when a train derailed in the Bronx.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the mayor would have no private life, couldn\u2019t be with his kids when you have the press following you around all the time,\u201d said Mr. Bloomberg in 2011, explaining why he kept his whereabouts secret. Mr. Bloomberg has said he was in charge of the city \u201call the time,\u201d no matter where in the world he was.\n\nMr. de Blasio\u2019s position on this issue is different.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to alert the public and the media broadly to my whereabouts,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in 2013. \u201cFor security reasons and, you know, other important reasons, it may not be right down to the street address and where the front and back door are.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office said Thursday the mayor and his wife plan to travel to Puerto Rico for a personal trip, a public disclosure that provides a sharp contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policy of keeping his out-of-town jaunts private.", "title": "Mayor de Blasio and His Wife to Visit Puerto Rico", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/02/mayor-de-blasio-and-his-wife-to-visit-puerto-rico/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HS418_NYDEBL_P_20150402213512.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Mayor de Blasio and His Wife to Visit Puerto Rico", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office said Thursday the mayor and his wife plan to travel to Puerto Rico for a personal trip, a public disclosure that provides a sharp contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policy of keeping his out-of-town jaunts private.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Michael Howard Saul", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office said Thursday the mayor and his wife plan to travel to Puerto Rico for a personal trip, a public disclosure that provides a sharp contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policy of keeping his out-of-town jaunts private.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-03T01:40:47-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/02/mayor-de-blasio-and-his-wife-to-visit-puerto-rico/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-22845", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office said Thursday the mayor and his wife plan to travel to Puerto Rico for a personal trip, a public disclosure that provides a sharp contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg's policy of keeping his out-of-town jaunts private.", "title": "Mayor de Blasio and His Wife to Visit Puerto Rico", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/04/02/mayor-de-blasio-and-his-wife-to-visit-puerto-rico/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HS418_NYDEBL_P_20150402213512.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-22845", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-03T01:41:13-04:00"}, "article_summary": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, are shown in a file photo.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to alert the public and the media broadly to my whereabouts,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said in 2013.\nJason DeCrow/ASSOCIATED PRESSNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office said Thursday the mayor and his wife plan to travel to Puerto Rico for a personal trip, a public disclosure that provides a sharp contrast to former Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s policy of keeping his out-of-town jaunts private.\nMr. de Blasio and his wife, Chirlane McCray, are scheduled to leave New York on Friday evening and return to the city on Tuesday.\nMr. Bloomberg, who served as mayor between 2002 and 2013, refused to provide information about his personal out-of-town travel."}
