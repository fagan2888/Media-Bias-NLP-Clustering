There\u2019s a lot more discussion about childhood freedom. Where it went and how we can get it back. I think the thing that I brought to public attention is this government angle. The idea that helicopter parenting was becoming law of the land, rather than just a choice. And that\u2019s changed. There\u2019s constant attention to this now in public and it\u2019s a more fevered pitch. I just think that everybody gets now what I\u2019m saying. For two years in a row after I started this site, I was voted as the most controversial mommy blogger by Babble. I\u2019m not that controversial anymore. I read a lot of articles and everyone sounds like me.\n\nAre there parameters for free-rangers? I think parents are the best judge of that. Certainly there are entire continents who send their children at age 7 to school alone. The idea is we do know what\u2019s best for our kids. My parameter is that unless a child is in obvious immediate and grave danger, we\u2019re allowed to teach our kids the same lessons our parents taught us: Cross the street safely.
