Only two skiers have won more: Annemarie Moser Proell of Austria (six) and Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg (five).\n\nInjuries prevented Vonn from challenging for it since she last won in 2012. The two women who won it since then \u2014 Tina Maze of Slovenia (2013) and Anna Fenninger of Austria (2014-15) aren\u2019t racing this season. Maze is taking the year off and Fenninger blew out a knee last month.\n\nIt\u2019s not far-fetched to envision Shiffrin, 20, making a strong bid this season or next. She dominated slalom the past three seasons, and her giant slalom has improved steadily. She will race super-G this season for the first time, bringing in the possibility of scoring points in that discipline and in super combined.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m on the radar,\u201d Shiffrin said last week during a training camp at Copper Mountain. \u201cIt is in the back of my mind, honestly. If I ski really well in GS and slalom this year, and I get some World Cup points in super-G, I think the overall is within my reach. But it\u2019s definitely a lofty goal, especially with Lindsey. Fenninger is injured, Maze is not skiing this year; they (would be) the other two favorites for the overall. Obviously Lindsey is a huge favorite.\u201d\n\nThey have different strengths. Vonn claims most of her points in downhill and super-G (the \u201cspeed\u201d events). Shiffrin will get most of hers in the slalom and GS (the \u201ctechnical\u201d events) and won\u2019t even enter downhill races. But if both are scoring in three events, it could get very interesting.\n\n\u201cIt would be great for the sport and great for skiing in the United States,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely different because we really don\u2019t overlap that much. I\u2019m going to be doing GS this year, and Mikaela\u2019s probably doing a couple super-G\u2019s.\u201d\n\nVonn used to duel annually for the overall with Maria Riesch of Germany, who has since retired. While not teammates, they were friends who regularly spent the Christmas holidays together. When Vonn won the overall four times in five years (2008-12), Riesch claimed the one Vonn missed (2011), and Riesch was either second (2009-10) or third (2008, 2012) the years Vonn won.\n\n\u201cIt might be less dramatic than Maria and I, because we were racing every single race together,\u201d Vonn said, \u201cbut I still think it would be phenomenal for the sport if Mikaela and I were going head to head in the running for the overall title.\u201d\n\nWhat would it be like at a team dinner after one has a good race, the other a bad one? What would breakfast be like the next morning?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to find out,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cIf we were to go head to head, she\u2019s not going to give it to me and I sure as heck am not going to give it to her. I think it\u2019s going to be one of those things that\u2019s like lifting each other up.\n\n\u201cI mean, maybe there will be some cattiness, and that will be fine too. Play the rivalries. I was talking to Tina Maze and she was like, \u2018Play that. People want to see that. They want to see the rivalry. Play the game, why not? It\u2019s fun. It will give you some motivation too.\u2019 Lindsey, she is my rival. But she\u2019s also my teammate and I definitely respect her.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer\n\nWomen\u2019s World Cup\n\nWhy is the World Cup overall the most coveted title in ski racing?\n\nSki racers generally regard World Cup titles as more meaningful than Olympic and world championships medals. Racers accumulate points for top-30 finishes throughout the season, determining titles in each discipline (downhill, slalom, etc.) and the overall (all events). A medal winner is the best on a given day, but those who claim World Cup titles demonstrate supremacy across a season that begins in October and ends in March. Thus the overall winner is considered the world\u2019s best racer.\n\nAmerican overall winners:\n\nLindsey Vonn, four (2008-10, 2012)\n\nPhil Mahre, three (1981-83)\n\nBode Miller, two (2005, 2008)\n\nTamara McKinney, one (1983)\n\nSchedule in Aspen\n\nFriday: Giant slalom,\n\n10 a.m. and 1 p.m.\n\nSaturday: Slalom,\n\n10:15 a.m. and 1:15 p.m.\n\nSunday: Slalom,\n\n10 a.m. and 1 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn, Mikaela Shiffrin could end up battling for World Cup title", "title": "Lindsey Vonn, Mikaela Shiffrin could end up battling for World Cup title", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/26/lindsey-vonn-mikaela-shiffrin-could-end-up-battling-for-world-cup-title/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__20151127_B1_SP27SKICUPp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151126__20151127_B1_SP27SKICUPp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-26T21:08:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T07:33:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "World Ski Championships 2015"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25e7\"", "article_summary": "But she\u2019s also my teammate and I definitely respect her.\u201dJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyerWomen\u2019s World CupWhy is the World Cup overall the most coveted title in ski racing?\nSki racers generally regard World Cup titles as more meaningful than Olympic and world championships medals.\nWhen Vonn won the overall four times in five years (2008-12), Riesch claimed the one Vonn missed (2011), and Riesch was either second (2009-10) or third (2008, 2012) the years Vonn won.\nVonn, 31, has won the overall \u2014 the most coveted title in skiing \u2014 more times than any other American (four).\nA medal winner is the best on a given day, but those who claim World Cup titles demonstrate supremacy across a season that begins in October and ends in March."}
