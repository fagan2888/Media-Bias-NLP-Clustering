He was scheduled to perform a risky operation on a 17-year-old patient who was also a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, a religion that forbids blood infusions. Prior to the surgery, the young man\u2019s parents had signed a document refusing blood during the course of the procedure\u2014no matter what might happen. In their presence, the son had verbally agreed.\n\nHowever, in the days leading up to the operation, with his mom and dad out of the room, the young patient had made a quick, cryptic comment to the surgeon: It is against my religion to receive blood, he had reminded the doctor. But I want you to know that my religion states that if you were to give me blood without my knowledge, it would not imperil my eternal soul.\n\nWas the boy saying that he wanted the doctor to act against the family\u2019s written wishes? The surgeon felt a moral obligation to preserve his patient\u2019s life, having taken a Hippocratic oath to \u201cdo no harm.\u201d But should he accept the boy\u2019s seemingly tacit permission?\n\nThe surgeon turned to a psychiatrist, who referred him to Paul Root Wolpe.\n\nPhotograph courtesy of Emory University\n\nWolpe is a bioethicist and the head of Emory University\u2019s Center for Ethics. He studies the complex and often controversial ethical issues brought about by advances in medicine, in fields such as stem cell research, genetic testing, or organ transplants. As the stuff of science fiction becomes a reality, \u201cthere are all kinds of questions that are coming up,\u201d Wolpe says. Bioethicists are here to \u201cthink through those questions in an informed, logical way.\u201d He stresses that, like a therapist, he\u2019s not there to impose his personal beliefs, but to guide others toward conclusions that fit in with their own ethics and values.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t actually feel like I have any particularly better purchase from which to make ethical decisions than anyone else has,\u201d Wolpe said last year in a conversation hosted by the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. In making bioethics his life\u2019s study, \u201cI just know a lot more about it.\u201d\n\nPart of the job is stumping for more conversations and consensus around ethical standards in medicine. He has even lent his expertise to NASA, helping set their biological research guidelines in increasingly politically charged fields like genetic engineering.\n\nOn a more micro level, Wolpe offers counsel to doctors, hospital administrators, patients, and their families: A woman debating whether to end medical care for her father, who remains on a respirator indefinitely. A diabetic man considering a foot amputation, which would dramatically decrease his pain while increasing his family\u2019s caregiving load. A formerly Catholic hospital now grappling with providing contraception or abortion following its takeover by a larger hospital system.\n\nIn the case of the Jehovah\u2019s Witness, Wolpe explained to the surgeon that the parents\u2019 written consent legally obligated him to withhold blood. But given the boy\u2019s declaration, Wolpe helped the doctor determine that if the operation took a turn for worse, his own moral imperative to save a life would take precedence.\n\n\u201cOften the problem is that a person\u2019s values are in conflict,\u201d Wolpe says. \u201cI can help them clarify those conflicts so that the answer becomes clear to them.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cbioethics\u201d first appeared in 1970, but in some ways Wolpe was introduced to the field before it even existed. He grew up in Philadelphia, where his father, a rabbi, taught a class at the Hahnemann Medical College about the spiritual and emotional aspects of dying. His father also sat on a state commission that prioritized which patients received access to the limited number of kidney dialysis machines available at the time.\n\nThen in 1986, while Wolpe was completing a Ph.D. in the sociology of medicine at Yale, his mother suffered a stroke. His father was left to look after her, and Wolpe saw the ethical burden of responsibility placed on caregivers when it comes to answering questions about quality of life. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t communicate what she wanted,\u201d says Wolpe. \u201cShe lost the use of her dominant arm.\u201d His father had to dress her, cut her meat, figure out how to pay for medical care that their insurance wouldn\u2019t cover. There was a constant stream of decisions to be made on his mother\u2019s behalf.\n\nSoon after, Wolpe entered the then little-known field of bioethics, taking a position at the University of Pennsylvania. In the early days, when Wolpe told other people what he did, few knew what it meant. That began to change in the late 1990s, when technological leaps meant that patients could be kept alive longer than ever\u2014and in varied states of consciousness. As a result, more and more families and physicians were confronting the same kinds of questions that Wolpe and his father had faced.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, people were making life-and-death decisions about their loved ones: \u2018Should we withdraw life support from Grandma?\u2019\u201d says Wolpe. \u201cAnd for the first time, they were having to make tough ethical decisions about their own treatment,\u201d like whether they were willing to live with significant disabilities.\n\nIn the 2000s, with the emergence of cloning and stem cell technology, the debate broadened. It also became more politicized. As legislators frantically try to keep the law on pace with medical progress, partisan politics are increasingly steering much of the public discourse not just on cloning and stem cells, but on issues like end-of-life care, vaccinations, in-vitro fertilization, and decisions about who receives medical treatment\u2014and who pays for it. Nearly 50 years after Wolpe\u2019s father sat on the commission that governed dialysis care, medical rationing became a source of intense political tumult in the wake of the Affordable Care Act, which prompted panic over so-called \u201cdeath panels.\u201d The debates have dragged bioethicists like Wolpe into the middle of the political culture wars.\n\n\u201cWe get involved in those political debates; when the Affordable Care Act was being put together, bioethicists chimed in,\u201d Wolpe says. Still, he maintains the feverish tenor of the discussions often masks people\u2019s real concerns. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t actually worried about stem cells,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about whether the scientists who work with stem cells are ethical.\u201d\n\nPhotograph courtesy of Emory University\n\nAfter years of fielding calls from hospital directors, physicians, and lawmakers, in 2008, Wolpe got a different sort of phone call from Emory. When James Wagner, who would eventually serve as vice chair on Barack Obama\u2019s Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethics Issues, became president of the university in 2003, he made ethical engagement a primary focus. Five years later, after a two-year search, he wanted Wolpe to help elevate the campus\u2019s relatively small Center for Ethics into a global beacon for ethics research across a spectrum of fields, from medicine to art.\n\n\u201cHe was already very influential, but in the end, it was Wolpe\u2019s creativity that set him apart,\u201d says Wagner. \u201cYou could be a powerful ethicist just reacting to problems. Wolpe has the ability to address issues that exist, but also to search out ethical opportunities and challenges.\u201d\n\nFor example, more and more amputees now use robotics-powered prostheses. Should we curb the use of technology that could lead to a human-mechanical hybrid? What about brain imaging technology that could be used to read people\u2019s thoughts? Or genetic advances that would allow scientists to re-create extinct animals in the lab? These are the types of forward-looking, no-easy-answer questions that Wolpe and his team consider.\n\nIn the nearly eight years since Wolpe arrived at Emory, the Center for Ethics\u2014which will celebrate its 25th anniversary later this year\u2014has grown exponentially. In 2008 the institute had just four faculty and five staff members. Today there are nine in-house core faculty\u2014scholars who specialize in philosophy, theology, and the ethics of various fields\u2014plus a network of 39 active fellows working from positions in separate schools within Emory. These fellows collaborate with the center on research and outreach, and a few have enrolled in the ethics master\u2019s program.\n\nLocated in a stately five-story building on the west side of campus, the center is unique among its national counterparts in that it is not housed within a specific academic department, such as the medical school. This independence enables Wolpe and his staff to work across the university\u2019s departments, studying ethical issues in law, business, agriculture, and more.\n\nStill, the center remains primarily focused on bioethics. The staff helps train future doctors at Emory School of Medicine, and one of the core faculty members sits on Emory Hospital System\u2019s institutional review board, which helps to create rules and standards. Faculty are also involved in large-scale public health initiatives\u2014for example, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where one member recently provided input on the agency\u2019s pandemic flu plan. Drue Barrett, who leads the CDC\u2019s public health ethics unit, says she\u2019s grateful not only for the center\u2019s expertise but also for its advocacy of ethics within public health. \u201cWe need scientists to take more responsibility for thinking about the ethics of what they do,\u201d says Wolpe.\n\nIt\u2019s a discussion that Emory is driving worldwide. Last May the center hosted 200 scientists, bioethicists, philosophers, and policymakers from 30 countries in a two-day global summit dubbed the BEINGS conference, held at the Tabernacle. The conference featured panel discussions on the ethics surrounding egg donations, bioterrorism, and genetic engineering.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t reach a consensus, but that wasn\u2019t the point,\u201d says Arthur Caplan, a panelist at the conference and head of the division of medical ethics at New York University. \u201cIt\u2019s about putting these issues out in the public consciousness.\u201d Caplan says the conference was also something of a coming-out party for Emory\u2019s center. \u201cIt\u2019s now world-renowned among the big programs,\u201d he says.\n\nWolpe, too, has stepped out on the world stage, representing Emory as editor in chief of the American Journal of Bioethics and as a past president of the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities. In 2009 he became the first senior bioethicist for NASA, pondering the implications of biological research in outer space and the possibility of a one-way manned mission to Mars.\n\nBut even while dealing with complex issues that can veer into the abstract hypothetical, Wolpe remains focused on the person affected, whether it\u2019s an astronaut facing a years-long space flight, a husband caring for an incapacitated wife, or a surgeon wrestling with the constraints of a patient\u2019s religion. \u201cEthics is rarely about what\u2019s right and wrong,\u201d says Wolpe. \u201cIt\u2019s often about two rights in conflict.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in our January 2016 issue.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "Uncategorized,", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/01/0116_ethics02_courtesy_oneuseonly-300x300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Tony Rehagen", "description": "As the stuff of science fiction becomes a reality, \u201cthere are all kinds of questions that are coming up,\u201d Paul Root Wolpe says.
