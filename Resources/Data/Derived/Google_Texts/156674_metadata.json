The performance was bolstered by MCs and singers that each gave the proceedings the air of a mix-tape, though -- when they were done with the mic -- each would retreat back to their instrument in essentially a backbeat round robin. It's a conceit that's very of the moment, and Rudimental owns it, begging for fist pumps and hand claps while nailing complex tempo changes -- a double time gets-back to an electro wub-wub in a single song, for instance -- giving the versatility of a great DJ while maintaining the feel of a live band.\n\n\n\nAlso exciting, though in a far more traditional sense, was punk rock troubadour Frank Turner. In a Coachella culture veering increasingly towards EDM and dance-pop, Turner's rock songs about rock songs were a welcome change of pace, and the UK songwriter delivered each with a fevered passion clearly learned from idols ranging Springsteen to Shane McGowan.\n\n\n\nOperating at the other side of the classic spectrum was the buzzy outfit Blood Orange, who matched funk grooviness to a let's-go-to-bed mentality, all while smoothly setting down a retro seductiveness. If that sounds like a description of some amalgam of Hall And Oates and Prince, you wouldn't be far off, especially when frontman/guitarist Devonte Hynes tossed on a guitar, conjures up purple, and lets rip. It's derivative and effective all at once.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Sunday afternoon at Coachella, hydra-headed dance collective Rudimental delivered a breakout performance, punk troubadour Frank Turner provided a rockin' relief to EDM and dance-pop, and Blood Orange brought funk grooves with a retro seductiveness.", "title": "Coachella 2014: Rudimental Delivers And Blood Orange Smooths It Out On Day Three", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6052079/coachella-2014-rudimental-delivers-and-blood-orange-smooths", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/coachella-2014-bridgette-amofah-rudimental-performance-billboard-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sunday afternoon at Coachella, hydra-headed dance collective Rudimental delivered a breakout performance, punk troubadour Frank Turner provided a rockin' relief to EDM and dance-pop, and Blood Orange brought funk grooves with a retro seductiveness.", "title": "Coachella 2014: Rudimental Delivers And Blood Orange Smooths It Out On Day Three", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6052079/coachella-2014-rudimental-delivers-and-blood-orange-smooths", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/coachella-2014-bridgette-amofah-rudimental-performance-billboard-650.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Sunday afternoon at Coachella, hydra-headed dance collective Rudimental delivered a breakout performance, punk troubadour Frank Turner provided a rockin' relief to EDM and dance-pop, and Blood Orange brought funk grooves with a retro seductiveness.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Coachella 2014: Rudimental Delivers And Blood Orange Smooths It Out On Day Three | Billboard"}, "article_summary": "Coachella 2014 Full CoverageSunday afternoon at Coachella, that designation clearly belonged to Rudimental, a hydra-headed dance collective that built and built its audience in an eventually-bulging Mojave tent.\nIn a Coachella culture veering increasingly towards EDM and dance-pop, Turner's rock songs about rock songs were a welcome change of pace, and the UK songwriter delivered each with a fevered passion clearly learned from idols ranging Springsteen to Shane McGowan.\nAlso exciting, though in a far more traditional sense, was punk rock troubadour Frank Turner.\nOperating at the other side of the classic spectrum was the buzzy outfit Blood Orange, who matched funk grooviness to a let's-go-to-bed mentality, all while smoothly setting down a retro seductiveness.\nOne of the greatest things about music mega fests like Coachella is the potential for breakout moments -- that instant when a band next-levels strictly on the strength of their live show, hype-be-damned."}
