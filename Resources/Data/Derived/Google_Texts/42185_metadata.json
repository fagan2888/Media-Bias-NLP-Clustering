Winning this game would have set up either team to have played the defending state champions, while the loser would have had an easier team to face.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAccording to Wilbon, the game between Riverdale High School and Smyrna High School was a situation where the adults \u2018failed the children.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is sadder to me than the Jackie Robinson West situation where adults failed children. It goes down to the parents. Because if that\u2019s my kid on the team I\u2019m going down to the floor and you try to miss? You\u2019re trying to turn the ball over? Come out of the game.
