Mao told the Register that the university\u2019s administration \u201cdid nothing\u201d to help him with his illness, but was quick to inform him that his health insurance was no longer valid \u2014 and that he had 15 days to leave the country. \u201cI\u2019m fighting because I want to get reinstated,\u201d Mao said, \u201cbut also because I don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else.\u201d\n\nAccording to graduate student-employees and organizers, Mao\u2019s story is not unique. And the allegedly brusque manner with which the administration treated him is, they say, not unusual, either. That\u2019s one of the reasons why those urging Yale to recognize its graduate student-employees\u2019 union are calling on the university to stop an anti-union campaign intended to \u201cintimidate and confuse\u201d graduate school faculty and students, and to agree to a neutral \u2014 or \u201cno intimidation\u201d \u2014 vote.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke over the phone with two members of the organizing drive, Robin Canavan and Michelle Morgan. Canavan GESO\u2013UNITE HERE co-chair and fourth-year in the Geology and Geophysics Department, while Morgan is a graduate student-employee. Our conversation is below and has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nSo let\u2019s start with the obvious question: Why are graduate employees at Yale organizing?\n\nRobin Canavan (RC): The graduate employees and student organisation have been organizing in the last 18 months over a variety of issues. Members join for a variety of reasons. We\u2019ve got members who\u2019ve had issues with teaching and funding in their upper years, issues created with health coverage and mental health care, child care availability and affordability, racial and gender issues on campus.\n\nWe really gained a lot of steam after NYU. In the last 18 months, we\u2019ve had four major demonstrations, delivering a petition to the administration showing a majority of support for a union from grad student-employees. We\u2019ve had two-thirds of the nearly 2,000 graduate employees of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences show their public support by taking a photo and saying that they want a union.\n\nMichelle Morgan (MM): My name is Michelle Morgan. I\u2019m an upper-year in American Studies. I\u2019m also a mom. I have a 15-year-old son who lives with me in New Haven.\n\nLast year, I was teaching an American Studies junior seminar. I\u2019ve done teaching assistant positions, but this was my own course that I designed myself. Then the university announced it was going to cut upper-year teaching pay by 40 percent. There was nothing that any of us could do about it.\n\nSo, this year, I\u2019m teaching my own class and I\u2019m also teaching another seminar in American Studies \u2014 and I\u2019m doing it for 40 percent less pay, even though it is the same amount of work. Or more work, even. I\u2019m trying to support myself and my son on this pay, but it\u2019s not working.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve made these complaints to the administration, what has been their response?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yale's administration should grant a neutral election, two graduate school student-employee organizers tell Salon", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Yale's administration should grant a neutral election, two graduate school student-employee organizers tell Salon", "title": "Graduate students fight back at Yale: \u201cI\u2019m trying to support myself and my son \u2026 but it\u2019s not working\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/20/graduate_students_fight_back_at_yale_im_trying_to_support_myself_and_my_son_but_its_not_working/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/yale_campus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yale's administration should grant a neutral election, two graduate school student-employee organizers tell Salon", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/yale_campus.jpg", "title": "Graduate students fight back at Yale: \u201cI\u2019m trying to support myself and my son \u2026 but it\u2019s not working\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Graduate students fight back at Yale: \u201cI\u2019m trying to support myself and my son \u2026 but it\u2019s not working\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, GESO-UNITE HERE, Graduate School, graduate student unions, Labor Rights, Michelle Morgan, neoliberalism, new haven register, Robin Canavan, yale university", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So, this year, I\u2019m teaching my own class and I\u2019m also teaching another seminar in American Studies \u2014 and I\u2019m doing it for 40 percent less pay, even though it is the same amount of work.\nI\u2019m trying to support myself and my son on this pay, but it\u2019s not working.\n\u201cI\u2019m fighting because I want to get reinstated,\u201d Mao said, \u201cbut also because I don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else.\u201dAccording to graduate student-employees and organizers, Mao\u2019s story is not unique.\nCanavan GESO\u2013UNITE HERE co-chair and fourth-year in the Geology and Geophysics Department, while Morgan is a graduate student-employee.\nSo let\u2019s start with the obvious question: Why are graduate employees at Yale organizing?"}
