Billboard erected in Kim Davis' hometown (Photo: Planting Peace)

A non-profit organization that advocates for LGBTQ rights has a big message for Rowan County (Kentucky) clerk Kim Davis â€” a message that is the size of a billboard, to be exact.

Planting Peace erected a billboard in Davis' hometown of Morehead, Ky., that reads: "Dear Kim Davis, The fact that you can't sell your daughter for three goats and a cow means we've already redefined marriage."

Aaron Jackson, president of Planting Peace, told USA TODAY that the intent of the billboard is to "expose how the anti-LGBT movement is selective in what rules to follow and how they choose to define 'traditional' institutions or values."

Davis came into the spotlight this month after she refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couples on the grounds of her religious beliefs, despite the Supreme Court's 5-4 landmark ruling that legalized same-sex marriage earlier this year.

Davis, an elected official was jailed last week for defying the court and was released on Tuesday after several same-sex couples received marriage licenses from the clerk's office while Davis was in jail. However, Davis, who returns to work Monday, could face sanctions if she again interferes with eligible couples receiving licenses.



Will Davis see the billboard? Quite possibly. It is placed in the middle of a long road in the rural town of 7,000 people and will be erected for one month.

"We have been told members of the local community have been taking photos and selfies in front of the billboard," Jackson said. "We are excited that they've embraced our message."

Planting Peace is the same group that launched the Equality House in 2013, a rainbow-painted house across from the Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., where a lesbian couple held their wedding.
