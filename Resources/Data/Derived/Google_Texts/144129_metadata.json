Ted Cruz on Thursday accused the Treasury Department of meddling with an IRS interpretation of the Affordable Care Act to make sure low-income Americans could still get subsidized health insurance through federal exchanges.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is trying to impose\u2026thousands of dollars in penalties that are contrary to law,\u201d said Cruz, who suggested the IRS knew how to enforce the law before \u201cpolitical operatives\u201d from the Treasury overruled them.\n\nCruz, a Republican presidential candidate, convened a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on how the administration created Obamacare subsidy rules. Republicans praised it as a sorely needed investigation and Democrats dismissed it as political theater.\n\n\u201cWe are in a so-called hearing about the rule-making process with witnesses that have nothing to do with the rule making process,\u201d said Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, the subcommittee\u2019s chief Democrat.\n\nThe Treasury Department refused to let officials testify, citing pending litigation, and Cruz threatened to subpoena them, as he did in a May 27 letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.\n\nAlthough the Treasury told Cruz those officials wouldn\u2019t appear, the packed hearing room was set up for their testimony. On the witness table, name cards were in place for the absent officials. Cruz called the empty table a symbol of the Obama administration\u2019s \u201ccontempt for Congress\u201d and \u201cthe height of arrogance.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to suggest the empty table was used as a prop,\u201d but implied Cruz was grandstanding.\n\nThe hearing comes as the Supreme Court decides whether insurance purchased through the federally-run state healthcare exchanges is eligible for federal subsidies.\n\nA section of the ACA provides subsidies for policies purchased through exchanges \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d Since 36 states refused to set up their own, the Supreme Court will rule in King v. Burwell if that applies to the federal exchanges and could leave more than 7 million Americans without subsidized insurance.\n\nDemocrats said Cruz should have held off on the hearing until after the Supreme Court rules, at which point Treasury officials would testify. Cruz rejected the idea that officials can\u2019t testify while Obamacare litigation is pending, noting that Treasury provided House testimony in 2013 even as similar cases were in court.\n\nAnother panel of witnesses argued over the legal implications of \u201cestablished by the states.\u201d Michael Carvin, who represents the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell, said that phrase means the federal exchanges aren\u2019t eligible for subsidies. Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies for the libertarian Cato Institute, said House investigators had turned up evidence that supports Cruz\u2019s accusation of the Treasury interference at the IRS.\n\nRobert Weiner, who helped craft the ACA, and Elizabeth Wydra, a self-described progressive and chief council at the Constitutional Accountability Center, said no one in Congress thought the law should be undermined by \u201cestablished by the states,\u201d which critics are taking out of context.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wNi90ZWQtY3J1ei1vYmFtYWNhcmUuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sylvan Lane", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON--Sen.
