A craft store like Hobby Lobby sells a lot of items with alphabet letters, which is presenting an opportunity for those unhappy with the chain’s prominent role challenging the Obamacare contraception mandate.

In recent days, a few women have decided to register their anger by going into the retailer and rearranging display items to spell out phrases like “pro-choice” and “all women deserve birth control.”

Thanks to selfies, Twitter and feminist websites like Bitchmagazine, Jezebel and Feministing, women like Jasmine Shea have won a bit of fame over their in-store protests. Feministing even helpfully provided a link to Hobby Lobby stores for copycatters.

In at least one case, a woman left packs of condoms in a Hobby Lobby store.

A request for comment from Hobby Lobby was not immediately available Wednesday. But Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, laughed at the protests.

“Pretty absurd,” she said.

If they read the ruling, she added, they’d know that Hobby Lobby’s insurance still provides for 16 types of birth control, so protesters can safely “leave their condoms at home.”
