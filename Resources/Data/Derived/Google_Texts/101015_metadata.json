Dustin Maas of the Fremont County Sheriff's Office listens in while Chili's server Mikenna Huber takes an order from patrons Sunday during the Tip-A-Cop event to benefit the Special Olympics. (Carie Canterbury / Daily Record)\n\nTheir job is to serve and protect, but local law enforcement officers, deputies and officials also work to make a difference in the lives of Special Olympics Colorado athletes.\n\nThe Fremont County Sheriff's Office, the Ca\u00f1on City Police Department and the Florence Police Department joined forces Sunday to raise funds for the Special Olympics Colorado by helping Chili's wait staff serve beverages and wait on customers. Tips and donations beyond those designated for the regular servers go directly to the Special Olympics Colorado that serves more than 14,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities across the state.\n\nSheriff Jim Beicker greeted customers at the door during part of the day.\n\n\"It's a worldwide law enforcement effort to bring awareness and raise funds for the Special Olympics,\" he said. \"We are proud to be a part of it.\"\n\nBeicker said he and his office hope to form teams with local Special Olympics athletes so they won't have to go out of town for practices.\n\nSunday's event was split into two shifts with at least five law enforcement representatives volunteering during each. Cpl. Richard Solano of the Fremont County Sheriff's Office got off duty at 6 a.m. Sunday and volunteered part of the day before starting his next shift later that evening.\n\n\"(Special Olympics) is a great program,\" he said. \"They need the money and this helps out with that.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGeneral manager J.J. Mews said Chili's restaurants across the state hosted the Tip-A-Cop event Sunday, and others across the county will host the same event during the month of July.\n\n\"It's a great thing for our community and a great thing for our guests to see these hard-working men and women serving and supporting a good cause,\" he said.\n\nCpl.
