It is seen as a taboo in a country that prides itself on its democratic ideals. Yet, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie last week slammed efforts to simplify voter registration.\n\nReferring to Illinois joining other states \u2014 including many Republican-led ones \u2014 in passing a same-day voter registration law, Christie said: \u201cSame-day registration all of a sudden this year comes to Illinois. Shocking. It\u2019s shocking. I\u2019m sure it was all based on public policy, good public policy to get same-day registration here in Illinois just this year, when the governor is in the toilet and needs as much help as he can get.\u201d\n\nChristie was campaigning for Illinois GOP gubernatorial candidate Bruce Rauner, who is challenging Democratic incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn, who signed the same-day registration bill into law in July.\n\nChristie, who chairs the Republican Governors Association, denounced the effort to boost voter turnout as an underhanded Democratic tactic, despite the Illinois State Board of Elections being composed equally of Democrats and Republicans. Referring to the same-day voter initiative, Christie said Quinn \u201cwill try every trick in the book,\u201d according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Christie said the program is designed to be a major \u201cobstacle\u201d for the GOP\u2019s gubernatorial candidates.\n\nThe trouble with such rhetoric \u2013 beyond its anti-democratic themes \u2014 is its absurd assertions about partisan motives. After all, many of the 11 states with same-day registration laws currently have Republican governors.\n\nIn reality, same-day registration is all about turnout, not partisanship. According to data compiled by the think tank Demos, average voter turnout is more than 10 percent higher in states that allow citizens to register on the same day that they vote. Demos also notes that \u201cfour of the top five states for voter turnout in the 2012 presidential election all offered same-day registration.\u201d There was some evidence in Wisconsin that same-day registration boosted Democratic turnout, but the Wisconsin State Journal of Madison reports that \u201cRepublican areas also saw heavy use of the state\u2019s last-minute registration law.\u201d The registration system been also been adopted by such deeply Republican states as Wyoming, Idaho and Utah.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The real reason Republicans object to same-day voter registration?
