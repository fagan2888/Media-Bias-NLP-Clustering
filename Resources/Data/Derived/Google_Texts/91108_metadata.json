The Big Bang Theory actress, whom Refinery 29 reminds us has a Ph.D. in neuroscience, is open about her strong views on social topics \u2014 some of which cause backlash. Her most recent blog on Kveller, a parenting site, singles out Ariana Grande for one reason: her image.\n\nSpotting a billboard with Grande\u2019s new album cover, Bialik had an emotional reaction, particularly as a parent. She admits she does not know who Ariana Grande is, but makes some assumptions based on the photo.\n\n\u201cI will go ahead and admit I have no idea who she is or what she does. Based on the billboard, she sells lingerie. Or stiletto heels. Or plastic surgery because every woman over 22 wishes she has that body, I\u2019m sure. Why is she in her underwear on this billboard though? And if she has a talent (is she a singer?), then why does she have to sell herself in lingerie? I mean, I know that society is patriarchal and women are expected to be sexy and sexually available no matter what we do in society, but I guess now I need to explain that to my sons?\u201d\n\nBialik has two sons, Miles and Frederick, both under the age of 10.\n\nBialik\u2019s blog post doesn\u2019t stop with Grande, however. She also objects to the overt sexualization evident in many forms of advertising, singling out the promos for the series Masters of Sex and spots for Levi\u2019s jeans. The Levi\u2019s ads, as she describes them, are simply foreplay in an attempt to sell jeans.\n\n\u201cI saw this ad when I went to see the latest \u2018Planet of the Apes\u2019 movie a month or so ago and I thought to myself, \u2018I don\u2019t want my kids seeing this ad if they come to the movies.\u2019 I just don\u2019t want them to see this ad.\u201d\n\nResponding to anticipated pushback that she\u2019s a \u201ccrotchety old lady,\u201d Bialik says she may indeed be, but does not know why she has to be okay with women in lingerie on billboards. The real \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret,\u201d she says in half-jest, is that women really want to be in a robe with a cup of tea.\n\nRefinery 29 responded to Bialik\u2019s post by saying the answer to her questions are simply that \u201csex sells,\u201d and some commentators repeatedly question its use. As the blog points out, it\u2019s a very old debate.\n\nIn advance of The Big Bang Theory\u2019s season premiere on September 22, Bialik has been exploring other projects, such as the reboot of the classic family show Candid Camera.\n\n[Ariana Grande / Mayim Bialik Images: Google]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mayim Bialik is no stranger to controversy.
