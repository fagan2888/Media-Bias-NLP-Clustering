The fees generated by the license would go into the Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act Fund.\n\nThe new law also imposes fines and civil penalties for violations of the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act, and would require monies collected as a result of these fines and civil penalties to be deposited into the Medical Cannabis Fines and Penalties Account, which this bill would establish within the fund.\n\nAB 266, among other things, would enact the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act for the licensure and regulation of medical marijuana and would establish within the Department of Consumer Affairs the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation, under the supervision and control of the director of Consumer Affairs. The bill would require the director to administer and enforce the provisions of the act.\n\nThis new law requires that the Board of Equalization, in consultation with the Department of Food and Agriculture, adopts a system for reporting the movement of commercial cannabis and cannabis products.\n\nThe law imposes fines and civil penalties for specified violations of the act. The monies collected will be deposited into the Medical Cannabis Fines and Penalties Account.\n\nWhat\u2019s most important about this law is that it clearly instructs law enforcement to not to arrest or prosecute compliant cannabis producers.\n\nThe law also requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts the mandated cost associated with medical marijuana\n\nSenate Bill 643 sets the standards that doctors prescribing medicinal cannabis have to follow. The state medical board is charged with the responsibility of investigating, prosecuting and disciplining offending doctors who repeatedly recommend excessive cannabis to patients or repeatedly recommend cannabis to patients without a good faith examination.\n\nUnder the new law, the Bureau of Medical Marijuana now has to require an applicant to furnish a full set of fingerprints for the purposes of conducting criminal history record checks.\n\nThe law also prohibits doctors who recommend cannabis to a patient from accepting, soliciting, or offering any form of remuneration from a facility licensed under the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act. Violating this prohibition is a misdemeanor.\n\nThe law calls for the gubernatorial appointment of a Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation chief with the confirmation of the state senate.\n\nThe Department of Consumer Affairs is the authority that will create, issue, renew, discipline, suspend or revoke licenses for the transportation and storage, unrelated to manufacturing, of medical marijuana, and can authorize the department to collect fees for its regulatory activities and impose specific duties on this department in this regard.\n\nThe Department of Food and Agriculture will regulate all that pertains to the cultivation and transportation of, medical cannabis and can impose specific duties on this department in this regard.\n\nThe law requires the State Department of Public Health to regulate the manufacture and testing of medical cannabis.\n\nCounties are now able to impose taxes cannabis-related activity.\n\nThis bill would require an applicant for a state license pursuant to provide a signed statement under penalty of perjury, thereby changing the scope of a crime and imposing a state-mandated local program.\n\nThis bill would set forth standards for the licensed cultivation of medical cannabis, including, but not limited to, establishing duties relating to the environmental impact of cannabis and cannabis products. The bill would also establish state cultivator license types, as specified.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nAssembly Bill 248, which Assemblyman Roger Hern\u00e1ndez (D-West Covina) authored, aims to close a loophole in health insurance coverage. Large-group health insurers did not need to provide essential health benefits which resulted in some insurers offering narrower, limited-benefit health plans, such as prevention-only plans to large employers with low-wage workers. This new law now requires large plans to provide at least 60 percent minimum value on those plans.\n\nThe law does not apply to limited wrap-around coverage, as described in a specified federal regulation, or a policy that provides coverage for Medicare services.\n\nThe law also does not apply to certain grandfathered health insurance policies that provide basic health care services without annual or lifetime limits.\n\nAB 339 aims to make sure health insurance benefit packages won\u2019t have a discriminatory impact on the chronically ill and that outpatient prescription drug costs remain affordable.\n\nThe bill, until at least Jan. 1, 2020, would provide that any form cost sharing for a covered outpatient prescription drug plan for an individual prescription will not exceed $250 for a $30 day supply.\n\nAB37 allows providers to sidestep the so-called \u201cstep therapy\u201d rule, under which health insurers can require some patients to fail one therapy protocol before they\u2019re allowed to move on to a more expensive one.\n\nThe law\u2019s author, Assemblyman Adrin Nazarian (D-Sherman Oaks), has said the cost-saving rule can be disastrous to some patients with severe illnesses such as lupus, epilepsy or multiple sclerosis.\n\n\u201cWhat is most painful in that process is the time lag\u2014sometimes as much as 90 days,\u201d said Nazarian at a legislative hearing this past year.\n\nHe said he understood the reasons behind gradual escalation of medications, but that a one-size-fits-all approach to limiting medication may not actually fit anyone.\n\nSenate Bill 125 extends the enrollment period for health insurance by more than a month, starting Nov. 1 and ending on Jan. 31. The law also revises the definition of small employer by lowering the threshold. Employers with 100 employees working in California are also considered \u201csmall employers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AB 243, AB 248, Adrin Nazarian, Assembly Bill 243, Assembly Bill 248, Bureau of Medical Marijuana, Department of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Food and Agriculture, Department of Pesticide Regulation, Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act Fund, Medical Cannabis Fines and Penalties Account, Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act, Roger Hernandez, SB 125, Senate Bill 125, Senate Bill 643, State Department of Public Health, State Water Resources Control Board", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.5.5", "og": {"site_name": "Random Lengths News", "description": "AB 243, AB 248, Adrin Nazarian, Assembly Bill 243, Assembly Bill 248, Bureau of Medical Marijuana, Department of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Food and Agriculture, Department of Pesticide Regulation, Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act Fund, Medical Cannabis Fines and Penalties Account, Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act, Roger Hernandez, SB 125, Senate Bill 125, Senate Bill 643, State Department of Public Health, State Water Resources Control Board", "title": "New Laws Tighten the Reins on Compassionate and Affordable Care - Random Lengths News", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.randomlengthsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/healthcaremedicalrecords.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-07T17:23:20-07:00", "url": "http://www.randomlengthsnews.com/new-laws-tighten-the-reins-on-compassionate-and-affordable-care/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.randomlengthsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/cropped-RLn_Logo_withAbalone-270x270.jpg", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "State Water Resources Control Board", "published_time": "2016-01-08T10:15:54-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-07T17:23:20-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6aa8\"", "article_summary": "The fees generated by the license would go into the Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act Fund.\nThe law requires the State Department of Public Health to regulate the manufacture and testing of medical cannabis.\nThe monies collected will be deposited into the Medical Cannabis Fines and Penalties Account.\nAB 266, among other things, would enact the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act for the licensure and regulation of medical marijuana and would establish within the Department of Consumer Affairs the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation, under the supervision and control of the director of Consumer Affairs.\nThe law calls for the gubernatorial appointment of a Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation chief with the confirmation of the state senate."}
