BBC‘s Sherlock returns for its third season and fans are clamoring for a sneak peak, promo, just something to sink their teeth into and BBC One answered.

The teaser below promotes the hashtag #sherlocklives, a follow-up to the season 2 cliffhanger in which Benedict Cumberbatch titular character appears to commit suicide.

Hobbit star Martin Freeman, who stars as John Watson, is center stage in much of the teaser, obviously reeling from the apparent death of his friend and partner.

The gloomy first photo released cemented this tone of the first episode back for the detective duo.

Sherlock season 3, like any other season will have three episodes: Episode 1 “The Empty Hearse,” based on “The Adventure of the Empty House,” episode 2 “The Sign of Three” which is based on author of the original story Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Sign of Four” and episode 3 “His Last Vow,” which is also based on the original chapter from the book “His Last Bow.

Sherlock season 3 begins in the US on PBS starting on January 19, 2014.
