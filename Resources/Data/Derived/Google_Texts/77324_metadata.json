For one, he grew up in a business family \u2013 his parents own Thomson\u2019s Pine Top Farm equestrian center \u2013 and he studied the waste industry for three years before he bought his first garbage truck.\n\nAfter graduating with a business degree from Emory University in 2005, Wilson went to work as an analyst for GMAC Commercial Finance and, later, as an associate for Roark Capital Group, an Atlanta-based private equity firm.\n\nWilson was part of the Roark team that invested $100 million in Waste Pro USA Inc., a privately held, multistate waste company based outside Orlando, Fla.\n\nThe months he spent working closely with Waste Pro Chairman and CEO John Jennings awakened his entrepreneurial side.\n\n\u201cI thought I was going to stay in the world of high finance,\u201d Wilson recalled. \u201cThat was my training, that was what I wanted to do, and I enjoyed it. But there was always that guy on my shoulder or in my head who kept saying, \u2018You need to be an entrepreneur.\u2019\u201d\n\nJennings recalled that Wilson possessed \u201can insatiable appetite to absorb everything he observed\u201d and quickly realized that success in the waste industry is more tied to passionate employees than shiny new trucks.\n\n\u201cHe recognized almost immediately that although this was a capital-intensive business, the ability to attract and motivate the right people was the key to success,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe Robert has all the tools to be a true leader in this industry.\u201d\n\nBut first, Wilson had to make the actual decision to get down and dirty.\n\nThe young executive had a \u00adlucrative job and was living happily in a tony Atlanta neighborhood with his wife, Virginia \u2013 an Augusta native he met during a holiday party in Thomson \u2013 but the itch to get into the waste business wouldn\u2019t go away.\n\nHe finally took the plunge in 2010 after his father told him about a struggling hometown hauler, McGahee Sanitation, that was on the verge of going out of business.\n\n\u201cI came up with the crazy idea of \u2018Let\u2019s move back to Thomson and start a garbage business,\u2019 \u201d Wilson recalled with a laugh. \u201cShe (Virginia) was not too keen on that at first.\u201d\n\nBut the Wilson family\u2019s investment in new equipment and its focus on improving McGahee\u2019s business processes helped turn the company around fairly quickly, and by January 2011 it had officially become Precision Waste.\n\nThe big turning point came in late 2012 when the fled\u00adgling company won its first municipal contract: a solid-waste agreement to serve 850 homes in Warrenton, Ga.\n\n\u201cIt really was a watershed event for us because it was the first time a government has said, \u201cWe trust you guys to do what you say you\u2019re going to do,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWe proved ourselves and went on from there.\u201d\n\nOther city- and county-bid jobs would follow, including Wrens, Dearing, Lincolnton, Sandersville and Stapleton. The contracts have helped fuel the company\u2019s 75 percent annualized growth rate.\n\nWilson said his vision from the get-go was to provide high-quality, low-cost service by maximizing the number of customers per route mile. One way he has achieved \u201croute density\u201d is through acquisitions: Southern Waste Disposal in 2013, ACRO Waste Manage\u00adment in 2015 and Columbia Waste this year.\n\nThe other is through tech\u00adnology. All 30 Precision Waste trucks are GPS-tracked and linked to the central office through a cloud-based route-management system that drivers can access via iPads.\n\nThe wireless system, which also features live-streaming, cab-mounted cameras, ensures that his trucks are getting the most revenue per mile possible during the 50,000 \u201cservice events\u201d they perform each week. It also enables truck drivers to make notes, take work orders and even snap photographs of anything they see along a route that might need to be discussed later.\n\nPrecision Waste operates from two locations: its main office on Mesena Road in Thomson \u2013 formerly the headquarters of Thomson Oak Flooring \u2013 and the former Columbia Waste offices on Franke Industrial Drive in Augusta. Unlike most waste companies that rely on truck dealers to perform repairs and maintenance, Wilson\u2019s company takes care of his own vehicle servicing, which he says substantially reduces their downtime.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the company\u2019s routes are hand\u00adled by trucks outfitted with driver-controlled, automated pickup systems that eliminate the need for a second crew member. Even Precision Waste\u2019s waste bins are high-tech \u2013 each blue household bin is embedded with a radio frequency identification chip.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t realize it, but for some reason garbage carts are hot commodities,\u201d Wilson said of the 96-gallon containers, each of which represent a $53 expense. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got 30,000 on the street and you lose 500 a year, that can add up to serious money.\u201d\n\nWilson says the other ingredient to his \u201csecret sauce\u201d is not skimping on personnel. He provides full health insurance coverage to all 44 employees even though the company falls under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 50-employee threshold.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in driving down operating costs, but you can\u2019t do it through labor because labor is what\u2019s delivering the service,\u201d he said.\n\nWilson says the company is set up to rapidly respond to customer-service issues, and often communicates with customers real-time through social media channels such as Facebook.\n\nHe mentioned a recent incident in which one of his trucks knocked over a customer\u2019s mailbox; the damage was fixed that day and the crew left an apology note and box of chocolates on the customer\u2019s doorstep.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make mistakes, no question about it, but we\u2019re going to fix it,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBeing locally owned has a way of keeping the company on its toes, said Ryan Mahoney, Wilson\u2019s longtime friend and marketing adviser.\n\n\u201cWhen Robert goes to church or when his operations guys go to T-ball, they have to drive past all of these cans that either got picked up or didn\u2019t, and they have to run into their customers who either have complaints or praises,\u201d said Mahoney, a partner in Parlay Marketing Partners. \u201cIt gets real personal compared with the national company side, where you don\u2019t have to interface as much with your community.\u201d\n\nWilson estimates 85 percent of his company\u2019s expenses are made locally. His trucks burn fuel from Boswell Oil Co. in Thomson. They wear out tires from Jim Whitehead Tire and Auto in Evans.\n\nThe steel roll-off containers they haul are fabricated by Lewis Steel Works in Wrens. Georgia Bank & Trust in Augusta helps him finance it all. And Thomson\u2019s Watson & Knox insurance firm helps him protect the investment against a loss.\n\n\u201cIf we can deal with local vendors, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we have an ox in the ditch, they help us get it out.\u201d\n\nGiven his background in high finance and the constant merger-and-acquisition activity in his industry, its natural to assume Wilson is building up the business with the intent to sell out to a larger national company. He says he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s in it for the long haul, he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m building this to provide a good living for my family and my employees,\u201d said Wilson, whose daughters, Charlotte and Georgia, are ages 4 and 2. \u201cIf there\u2019s customers we can take care of at a price they want to have, then we want to do it. So instead of having 25 percent of the market, why don\u2019t we over the next five years try to have 50 percent?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/widetile.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/mediumtile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/smalltile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/themes/mobile/images/icon/aug/largetile.png"}, "article_summary": "All 30 Precision Waste trucks are GPS-tracked and linked to the central office through a cloud-based route-management system that drivers can access via iPads.\nWilson was part of the Roark team that invested $100 million in Waste Pro USA Inc., a privately held, multistate waste company based outside Orlando, Fla.\n\u201cI came up with the crazy idea of \u2018Let\u2019s move back to Thomson and start a garbage business,\u2019 \u201d Wilson recalled with a laugh.\nEven Precision Waste\u2019s waste bins are high-tech \u2013 each blue household bin is embedded with a radio frequency identification chip.\nPrecision Waste operates from two locations: its main office on Mesena Road in Thomson \u2013 formerly the headquarters of Thomson Oak Flooring \u2013 and the former Columbia Waste offices on Franke Industrial Drive in Augusta."}
