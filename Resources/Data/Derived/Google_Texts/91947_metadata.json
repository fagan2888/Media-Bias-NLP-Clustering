With an exceptionally high number of political boondoggles for a non-election year, the show gave everyone something to cheer for (and against).\n\nThe cold open presented Bobby Moynihan as embattled Toronto mayor Rob Ford, who admitted this week to smoking crack cocaine, after denying it for months, and before committing even more PR disasters. SNL responded with a sketch that expressed Ford\u2019s seemingly endless and constant capacity to talk out both sides of his mouth, while appearing red-faced, sweaty, and inebriated. The sketch even squeezed in a scathing knock on 60 Minutes, the US news program that had to retract a high profile story on Benghazi recently:\n\nTaking aim at US politicians, SNL made a fake commercial for \u201cPaxil: Second Term strength,\u201d an anti-depressant for US commander-in-chiefs suffering a second term slump. The spot shows President Obama (Jay Pharaoh) popping pills to a long list of administration headaches, and then just chugging the bottle at the mention of the Obamacare website.\n\nOK, one pet peeve: the now-cliched line about something \u201cnot being covered by Obamacare.\u201d It\u2019s somewhat misleading. Obamacare regulates some \u201cessential\u201d services that private insurers have to cover, but it doesn\u2019t cover things itself. Some entertainers aren\u2019t above this pandering and lazy humor, but SNL should be.\n\nSpeaking of pandering, weekly host Lady Gaga brilliantly addressed the topic in a musical number opening act. The musician showed her vocal abilities as well as a sense of humor with a song about how much she loves applause, whether it is well-earned or not.\n\nWhat were your favorite SNL sketches this week?", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "snl, lady gaga, saturday night live, applause, musical number, rob ford, cocaine, president obama, depression, paxil", "google-site-verification": "KOWY-v3sjmGUUE4I2MxGG5ZIveBAaX0a2i1Snm4v1ZY", "description": "SNL has stand-out political sketches, and Lady Gaga shows her comedy skills.", "generator": "WordPress 3.4.1", "tweetmeme-title": "SNL Wows With Lada Gaga, Rob Ford, And Obamacare Jokes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0aa4\"", "article_summary": "What were your favorite SNL sketches this week?\nSome entertainers aren\u2019t above this pandering and lazy humor, but SNL should be.\nSpeaking of pandering, weekly host Lady Gaga brilliantly addressed the topic in a musical number opening act.\nWith an exceptionally high number of political boondoggles for a non-election year, the show gave everyone something to cheer for (and against).\nObamacare regulates some \u201cessential\u201d services that private insurers have to cover, but it doesn\u2019t cover things itself."}
