Penney (NYSE: JCP) a big Valentine\u2019s Day gift. If it hadn\u2019t been for Penney\u2019s failed, attention-getting attempts to reinvent itself as a slick, edgy \u201cApple-ized\u201d department store, the world might have locked in on the slow-motion implosion at Sears long before its recently announced plunge in same-store sales triggered the most recent selloff in the stock.\n\nNow comes news that Lampert and Sears plan to shutter its flagship Chicago store, right smack dab in the middle of the city\u2019s famed Loop area. It\u2019s one thing for them to shutter smaller stores in regional malls, something else again to decide that they can no longer turn a profit on such a valuable piece of real estate. Or at least, that such an iconic location is worth more as real estate to the troubled company than as a place for shoppers to spend money. It's another sad sign that a retailer that has been around some 128 years \u2013 surviving world wars, depressions, the arrival of the motor car and the shopping mall \u2013 seems prepared to exit the stage with a whimper rather than a bang.\n\nRelated: Five Companies That May Not Survive Past 2014\n\nIn the eyes of Brian Sozzi at Belus Capital Advisors, Sears seems to be using its stores to generate much-needed cash \u2013 cash that, in theory, could assuage any concerns among its suppliers and help convince investors that it still has the resources necessary for a turnaround. \u201cIn effect what we are witnessing from Sears is not painful measures taken today to position the company for the future of retail, it\u2019s the company using its stores as a fast cash ATM machine to survive another couple of years,\u201d Sozzi writes.\n\nStore closures alone are hardly going to be enough to stanch the bleeding, though. What\u2019s needed is for Sears to give shoppers a reason to walk through the doors of those stores \u2013 and not just to pick over the bones, salivating eagerly at the chance to grab towels, kitchen appliances and toys at 75 percent off.\n\nPlenty of analysts question whether that\u2019s achievable. \u201cSears has become a philanthropy, not a business,\u201d one skeptical analyst told me last summer. \u201cThey\u2019re donating market share to everybody else \u2013 including J.C. Penney.\u201d Could Sears be a turnaround candidate, I asked? Not likely, the analyst replied. Nothing that management was doing or saying signaled that they were approaching the problem in the right way.\n\nConsider Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Macy\u2019s (NYSE: M), both of whose management teams have invested north of $6 per square foot of store space in recent years. Lampert, meanwhile, has forked over about a quarter of that. Just walk into the flagship Macy\u2019s store in New York\u2019s Herald Square to get a sense of what that means; even in regional malls, the Macy\u2019s stores look elegant and welcoming compared to the Chicago flagship of Sears.\n\nTo save money, Sears is readying itself to spin off its still-profitable Land's End business. Land\u2019s End is another case of an opportunity squandered: Rather than applying the lessons learned at the boutique retailer to the main department stores, the company ended up eating into the value of the brand by simply making Land\u2019s End apparel available on the shelves at its Sears stores.\n\nIndeed, Sears has avoided pretty much every opportunity to do the right thing when it comes to its turnaround. As industry analysts would say, the folks who get a retailer into trouble are rarely the right people to turn to in order to extricate it from difficulties. So, who did Lampert pick as the new Sears Holdings CEO a year ago? You guessed it: He named himself to the job. That pretty much ensured that he wasn\u2019t going to hear much in the way of criticism coming up the management chain.\n\nOne of the elements that helped Home Depot turn around was a big emphasis on people: Hiring the right folks and retraining them, as well as giving them more responsibility. That was part of a broader push to improve merchandise and make shopping a more pleasant experience. In other words, Home Depot recognized that a turnaround involves more than simply cutting costs to the bone.\n\nOne of the biggest stock market winners of the last year is Best Buy (NYSE: BBY), whose stock is still trading about 56 percent above where it was a year ago at this time, when investors and analysts were still wary of its own attempts to stage a turnaround. (Not coincidentally, the move has been spearheaded by a brand new CEO from outside the company and the industry, Hubert Joly.)\n\nTrue, a disappointing holiday season knocked some of the stuffing out of the stock and the company\u2019s turnaround tale, but even critics are grudgingly acknowledging that service has improved and that the company is intent on finding a way to survive as a bricks-and-mortar retailer in an Amazon-driven world of razor-thin profit margins and \u201cshowrooming.\u201d\n\nThe list of successful bricks-and-mortar turnaround stories in retail may not be long, but it exists. So far, though, there seems to be little reason to suppose that Sears will be joining that list any time soon.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A retailer that has been around for more than a century \u2013 surviving world wars, depressions, the arrival of the motor car and the shopping mall \u2013 seems prepared to exit the stage with a whimper rather than a bang.", "title": "128-Year-Old Sears Looks to Buy Time for a Turnaround", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/01/28/128-Year-Old-Sears-Looks-Buy-Time-Turnaround-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12282011_Sears_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/01/28/128-Year-Old-Sears-Looks-Buy-Time-Turnaround-0", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12282011_Sears_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A retailer that has been around for more than a century \u2013 surviving world wars, depressions, the arrival of the motor car and the shopping mall \u2013 seems prepared to exit the stage with a whimper rather than a bang.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThey\u2019re donating market share to everybody else \u2013 including J.C.
