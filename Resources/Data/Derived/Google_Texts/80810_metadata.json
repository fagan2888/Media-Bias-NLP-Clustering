John Kasich.\n\nThe Republican governor\u2019s Obamacare Medicaid expansion message has gotten national attention, and other governors have borrowed it, but Kasich\u2019s rhetoric is at odds with reality.\n\nPreliminary numbers peg employment in Ohio at 5,329,200 in November, still 124,700 jobs short of a March 2006 pre-recession peak and 307,000 below the state\u2019s all-time high in May 2000.\n\nHow do nearly four years of job gains under Kasich compare to the first 11 months of Obamacare Medicaid expansion enrollment? Ohio has gained 267,700 jobs since Jan. 2011, and has added 450,941 Ohioans to Medicaid under Obamacare this year.\n\nOhio\u2019s job creation rate since Kasich took office ranks in the bottom half of the 50 states, even though Ohio\u2019s loss of 455,000 jobs from March 2006 to February 2010 was among the nation\u2019s worst.\n\nFrom January 2011 to September 2014, Ohio had the 27th-highest rate of job growth, behind neighbor Indiana at 20th and neighbor Michigan at 22nd. For the first three quarters of 2014, Ohio\u2019s job creation rate ranked 44th nationally based on U.S. Department of Labor data.\n\n\u201cWhen I look at economic development, whether it\u2019s tax cuts or deregulation or whatever, economic growth is not an end unto itself,\u201d Kasich told George Stephanopoulos said during a Dec. 7 ABC News interview.\n\n\u201cEconomic growth is terrific, but it should lead to helping people who live in the shadows \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve done in Ohio. So we help the drug-addicted, we help the mentally ill, we help the working poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, on Medicaid expansion, I\u2019m able to bring Ohio money back to Ohio \u2014 cause I know what they do with it in Washington \u2014 and I can use it to treat the mentally ill, I can use it to help the drug-addicted,\u201d Kasich added. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I do that, George? That\u2019s common sense to me.\u201d\n\nDescribing his expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare as a decision \u201cto bring Ohio money back to Ohio\u201d is something Kasich has frequently done.\n\n\u201cI have a chance to bring back $14 billion in Ohio dollars back to Ohio to do what? To strengthen our local communities as they treat the most significant problem of drug addiction, and the problem of mental illness,\u201d Kasich told Chris Wallace during a Fox News interview in March.\n\nAccording to Kasich, Ohio is morally obligated to expand Medicaid using the \u201cOhio dollars\u201d he chose to \u201cbring back\u201d because the state economy is doing well, and this has nothing to do with Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMy philosophy is this, Chris: As the state does better and gets stronger economically, we must help people who live in the shadows,\u201d Kasich told Wallace.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two-prong strategy: Continue to grow the state, continue to make it stronger and stronger economically, and help to lift people outta the ditch where they are, bring them into the mainstream and give them an opportunity to realize their God-given purpose.\u201d\n\nOhio\u2019s economic performance since 2011 is middling, and the governor\u2019s claims about how Medicaid expansion is paid for are false, according to projections from the left-leaning Urban Institute.\n\nFirst, Obamacare includes an open-ended promise of new federal funding for every state expanding Medicaid. Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion does not \u201cbring back\u201d a single \u201cOhio dollar\u201d \u2014 it increases the burden of deficit spending on all U.S. taxpayers, including Ohioans.\n\nSecond, Kasich\u2019s oft-repeated $14 billion figure is his estimate of the federal money Ohio would receive through 2020 by expanding Medicaid under Obamacare. While Ohioans pay for a portion of all federal spending, that portion is far less than 100 percent.\n\nA 2012 report from the left-leaning Kaiser Family Foundation based on Urban Institute data estimated Medicaid spending would increase by $808 billion through 2022 if every state implemented the Obamacare expansion.\n\nUrban Institute estimated Ohio\u2019s implementation of the Obamacare expansion would cost federal taxpayers $53.3 billion and state taxpayers $4 billion through 2022.\n\nHowever incompatible the truth may be with Kasich\u2019s talking points, Kasich seems dedicated to portraying billions in new entitlement spending as proof of his fiscal responsibility.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that Governor Kasich is spearheading a Balanced Budget Amendment as he eagerly accepts Medicaid expansion money that comes from federal deficit spending,\u201d Matt Mayer, president of free market think tank Opportunity Ohio, told Ohio Watchdog via email.\n\n\u201cShould he succeed and other governors expand Medicaid, Ohioans will be forced to pay significantly higher federal and state taxes to cover the exploding Medicaid rolls.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio's roaring economy is covering the cost of nearly half a million new Medicaid recipients, according to Gov.
