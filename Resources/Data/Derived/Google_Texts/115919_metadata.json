According to this week\u2019s Saturday Night Live, the answer would be: absolutely ridiculous.\n\nFor the episode\u2019s cold open, skating announcers Scott Hamilton and Tara Lipinski \u2014 played by Taran Killam and Cecily Strong, respectively \u2014 revealed that the U.S. Olympic Committee put together a team of \u201cless talented, but clearly heterosexual figure skaters\u201d to compete in Sochi should Russia\u2019s restrictions on homosexuality present any last-minute problems.\n\nThe unlikely B-squad of Olympic hopefuls, played by Bobby Moynihan, Jay Pharoah, Kate McKinnon and Beck Bennett \u2014 weren\u2019t exactly Olympics material. Moynihan wore a Jets jersey and cargo pants, and his only combos were of the snack variety. Pharoah was Nate Dog and Warren G fan from Long Beach, Calif., who did not want to be on the ice in the slightest. In the pairs division, Bennett was a horny AutoZone employee chasing around his favorite server at Applebees, played by McKinnon.\n\nNeeding a heterosexual B-squad of figure skaters for the Olympics does seem unlikely, but the growing anxiety towards the treatment of homosexuals in Russia gave SNL the perfect opportunity to ridicule Russian anti-gay social policies, while poking fun at the flamboyance and flare of a sport that, according to SNL, would be ruined without homosexuals.\n\nSNL\u2019s criticism of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is apparent in the sketch, and the implication that the president is single-handedly ruining the Olympics for everyone is quite clear as well. To Saturday Night Live\u2018s writers, figure skating without homosexuals would be like hockey without fights or Nascar without crashes. Sure, it would still be entertaining, but something would definitely be missing overall.\n\nWatch the cold open here:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "What would professional ice skating look like if all of the athletes competing in the sport were heterosexual?
