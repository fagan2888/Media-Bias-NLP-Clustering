Shields is in talks to open at least a half-dozen outpatient clinics over the next two years, adding to the 43 it already operates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest known for its MRI services, Shields plans to open two new imaging centers in Massachusetts and at least four more in two newer markets for the company: New Hampshire and Maine. Locations have not been announced because the deals have not been finalized.\n\nChief executive Thomas A. Shields said the company is well positioned to grow because of the cost pressures on health care providers as well as on patients. As consumers pick up bigger shares of medical costs through higher deductibles and copayments, many are seeking more affordable options.\n\nShields Health Care is paid about $600, on average, for each MRI it performs, about half the reimbursement Boston\u2019s teaching hospitals get, the company says.\n\n\u201cWe believe patients are looking for greater value in the future, and we think we can lead the market in value,\u201d Shields said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s where the market is going.\u201d The company, founded in 1972 by Shields\u2019 parents, started in nursing homes, moved into kidney dialysis centers, and in 1986 began offering what would become its core business: medical imaging.\n\nThe imaging centers house MRIs and other big machines that take high-quality pictures, allowing doctors to scan various parts of the body for tumors, tears, infections, and other problems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe company also runs radiation therapy clinics and an outpatient surgery center for New England Baptist Hospital. It has agreed to operate an outpatient surgery center, scheduled to open in 2017, for UMass Memorial Medical Center .\n\nShields Health Care Group, as a privately held company, does not disclose revenues, profits, or other financial information.\n\nIts growth strategy is in many ways a continuation of its past: Shields is teaming up with hospitals. The company has joint ventures with several hospitals and health systems across Massachusetts, in which it provides MRI services and shares ownership of outpatient clinics.\n\nSuch deals are important for hospitals looking to control costs while holding onto patients, said Matthew R. Fisher, a health care lawyer at a Worcester firm, Mirick O'Connell.\n\n\u201cIf the hospital shifts the service into a location where the cost is going to be less,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019ll help them retain their patients.\u201d\n\nThe approach has proven successful. The number of MRI procedures at Winchester Hospital\u2019s imaging center, for example, grew by 6 percent after it paired up with Shields in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt made sense for us to partner with Shields, given their expertise,\u201d said Mary Sweeney, vice president of strategic development at Lahey Health, Winchester\u2019s parent company. \u201cWe saw a flattening or a potential decline in our MRI volume if we didn\u2019t move in this direction.\u201d\n\nLowell General Hospital experienced more dramatic growth in its MRI business \u2014 70 percent since 2012 \u2014 after partnering with Shields .\n\n\u201cThey run the business more efficiently than we run it because that\u2019s the only thing they do,\u201d said Jody White, president of Lowell General. \u201cThis is all they do. They\u2019re just focused on this piece of business.\u201d\n\nShields has lower costs than hospitals partly because of the size of its network.\n\nWENDY MAEDA/GLOBE STAFF Thomas A. Shields, the son of the company\u2019s founders, has overseen Shields Health Care Group\u2019s steady expansion.\n\nIt centralizes tasks like scheduling and billing, so it doesn\u2019t have to hire people at every clinic to do administrative work. It can keep MRI machines running longer hours because it employs its own engineers, who can quickly make repairs. It cut the check-in time for each patient by more than 10 minutes by switching from paper forms to an iPad.\n\nThe focus on efficiency developed over the last several years as Thomas Shields watched the health care industry experience upheaval through the recession and a slow recovery that reduced the use of medical services, and as the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping federal law, increased pressure to control costs; the consolidation of health care providers in response; and changes to the way insurers reimburse medical services.\n\n\u201cWe thought we could play a larger role in the marketplace,\u201d Shields said, by facing the challenge: \u201cWe\u2019d have to stretch, we\u2019d have to reach, we\u2019d have to work harder than ever before.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.539031277", "eomportal-id": 412300, "description": "For decades, the Quincy company has focused on outpatient clinics that provide medical services at lower costs than hospitals.", "eomportal-instanceid": 17, "og": {"city": "Quincy", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "For decades, the Quincy company has focused on outpatient clinics that provide medical services at lower costs than hospitals.", "title": "Shields Health Care grows as pressure to control medical costs increases - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/09/30/shields-health-care-grows-pressure-control-medical-costs-increases/LQSaza6Zcfv0DF1zWDUqjK/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/09/30/BostonGlobe.com/Business/Images/sheilds1_biz.jpg", "longitude": "-71.00227050000001", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.2528772", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "Lowell General Hospital,Shields Health Care Group,Shields MRI,Thomas Shields,Lowell General Hospital,Winchester Hospital,MRI,medical imaging,Care Group Incorporated, University of Massachusetts", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 09:21:28 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "Lowell General Hospital,Shields Health Care Group,Shields MRI,Thomas Shields,Lowell General Hospital,Winchester Hospital,MRI,medical imaging,Care Group Incorporated, University of Massachusetts, Twitter,Care Group Incorporated|CRUPQ|other-OTC", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "e81c40f0-67d5-11e5-9ef6-0847c90acf95"}, "article_summary": "For decades, Shields Health Care Group has focused on one aspect of health care: outpatient clinics that provide medical services at lower costs than hospitals.\nWENDY MAEDA/GLOBE STAFF Thomas A.
