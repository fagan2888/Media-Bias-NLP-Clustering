Spotlight on… Steve Downie, forward, Penguins

When: The Avalanche begins a three-game trip Thursday at Pittsburgh.

What’s up: Steve Downie, a 27-year-old who was a first-round draft pick in 2005, entered Saturday tied for seventh on his team in scoring. And his 85 penalty minutes led the NHL, 14 more than the Avalanche’s Cody McLeod, who was second. Clearly, having these two guys on the same team would cause problems.

Background: Downie played 33 games for the Avalanche over three seasons, beginning late in 2011-12 when he was acquired from Tampa Bay in a three-team trade that sent Avs defenseman Kyle Quincey to Detroit. Downie suffered a major knee injury and played just two games during the 48-game, lockout-shortened season of 2013.

Chambers’ take: It didn’t look like a wise trade at the time, but sending Downie to Philadelphia early last season for Max Talbot was a good move. At the time, Downie was a pending unrestricted free agent making $700,000 more than Talbot, who is locked in through 2015-16 at relatively low salaries of $1.25 million and $1 million in the final two years. The Flyers let Downie into the UFA market, and his best deal was a one-year, $1 million contract with Pittsburgh. Downie has helped the Penguins but, unlike Talbot, he takes unwise penalties and is viewed as a bomb ready to explode and hurt the team. Talbot, 30, is a better forward and teammate.
