Some of the commentary around the N.B.A. finals assumes that most Americans are rooting for the Spurs to beat the Heat. That makes sense. The Spurs are a likable group, with an older core of players perhaps chasing a last title. And they’re trying to dethrone a team that was built in large part on big-name free agents, including one who took his “talents to South Beach.”

But even if more Americans will be rooting for the Spurs over the next week or two, there is little question that the Heat have more fans than the Spurs do. The map here is based on a large database provided to The Upshot by Facebook, which we used last month to create a national map of N.B.A. fandom.

Based on estimates derived from which teams people “like” on Facebook, the map is simply a head-to-head comparison between the Heat and the Spurs. Any ZIP code where there are more Heat fans than Spurs fans is red (and the redder it is, the bigger the gap). Any gray or black-shaded ZIP code is Spurs country.

Though San Antonio is one of the three most successful teams over the last 15 years, along with the Heat and the Lakers, the map shows that the Spurs have not built a national fan base. They remain a highly regional team, with fans concentrated in Texas (and among Texans scattered around the country). Even the Oklahoma City Thunder, a team that didn’t exist until 2008, have more fans outside their home region than the Spurs.

The Heat and the Lakers, on the other hand, are the closest things that the N.B.A. has to the Yankees and the Red Sox — teams with a national following. All of which may well be one more reason for fans of neither team to root for San Antonio when the finals begin on Thursday night.
