To test this out, they removed the intestines of embryonic mice, cut them into 2 mm to 3 mm tubes, and placed pieces on the supports.\n\nA thread was then inserted into the tubes to link them together. The researchers reported that after three days in the culture, 74 percent of the 36 pairs of intestinal pieces were not only touching, but nerve signals were passed between the pieces so that they were functioning as one single organ.\n\nThe researchers also tried using a growth factor called R-spondin 1 to speed growth, which it did, however the bridge between the two pieces was not grown as uniformly and their fusion was not as successful.\n\nResearchers suspect the method of regrowing operating intestines, as well as being able to see how that happens, could help with treatment of short bowel syndrome. SBS prevents intestinal absorption of nutrients and vitamins, and can cause weight loss and death.\n\n\"The ability to study organs outside of the body is delivering new insights into how they work,\" Woolf said. \"In this case we've been able to study damaged intestines and instigate repairs which could lead to treatment in a number of conditions.\"\n\nThe study is published in the Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers kept two sections of embryonic mouse intestine alive outside the body and instigated them to grow back together as a functioning section of organ.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "Researchers kept two sections of embryonic mouse intestine alive outside the body and instigated them to grow back together as a functioning section of organ.", "title": "Researchers regrow small intestine outside the body", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/08/25/Researchers-regrow-small-intestine-outside-the-body/1411440517374/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/i/1411440517374/2015/1/14405230064610/v2.1/Researchers-regrow-small-intestine-outside-the-body.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/1411440517374/2015/i/14405230064610/v2.1/Researchers-regrow-small-intestine-outside-the-body.jpg?lg=4", "description": "Researchers kept two sections of embryonic mouse intestine alive outside the body and instigated them to grow back together as a functioning section of organ.", "site": "@UPI", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Researchers regrow small intestine outside the body"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Health", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd4e\"", "article_summary": "MANCHESTER, England, Aug. 25 (UPI) -- Researchers kept two sections of embryonic mouse intestine alive outside the body and instigated them to grow back together as a functioning section of organ.\nThe accomplishment could help scientists working to improve surgery and treatment for intestinal conditions in infants and adults, such as short bowel syndrome.\n\"The ability to study organs outside of the body is delivering new insights into how they work,\" Woolf said.\nResearchers suspect the method of regrowing operating intestines, as well as being able to see how that happens, could help with treatment of short bowel syndrome.\n\"In this case we've been able to study damaged intestines and instigate repairs which could lead to treatment in a number of conditions.\""}
