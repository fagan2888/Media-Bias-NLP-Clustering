A toddler who was severely injured in what prosecutors called a serious child abuse case has become Kansas City's first homicide victim of 2015.

The two-year-old boy had been placed on life support after the incident early Friday. Kansas City Police Chief Darryl Forte said the boy died Saturday night.

Mirsad Hamidovic, 23, had previously been charged with two counts of child abuse and two counts of domestic assault.

According to court records, police said Hamidovic had been watching the toddler while the boy's mother was at work. Police said Hamidovic told them he jumped on and off of a bed and landed on top of the boy. Police said Hamidovic also told them that he had shaken the boy, who started vomiting blood and became unresponsive.

Medical personnel said the toddler had brain injuries and a lacerated liver that was consistent with being jumped on.

Prosecutors had previously requested Hamidovic's bond be set at $500,000. Additional charges against Hamidovic may be filed in the wake of the boy's death.
