The story prominently featured a veteran pursuer of African big game from the United States who described himself as a \u201cconservation hunter.\u201d The hunter in question: Governor McCrory\u2019s former Secretary of Public Safety, current East Carolina University Trustee and long-time conservative activist Kieran Shanahan.\n\nShanahan, who appeared in the story with the head of an animal he\u2019d apparently killed mounted as a trophy on the wall of his office, told CBS he was \u201csickened\u201d by poaching he\u2019s seen and claimed to hunt only non-endangered animals under circumstances blessed by relevant African governments.\n\nA Humane Society official, however, refuted Shanahan\u2019s claim about the usefulness of such hunting later in the story:\n\n\u201cBut Wayne Pacelle, who is president of the Humane Society of the U.S., said trophy hunters target some of the biggest, most magnificent animals, which is bad for species health. Creatures that are killed cannot reproduce and pass on their genes to future generations. \u2018We don\u2019t see any rationale to kill animals just as a head-hunting exercise,\u2019 Pacelle said. \u2018It\u2019s pointless. It\u2019s one thing to kill animals for food. It\u2019s another to kill them just for their heads.'\u201d\n\nSeveral commenters to the story have also weighed in to dispute Shanahan\u2019s claims.\n\nAs one noted:\n\n\u201cA point in fact: trophy hunters do NOT \u2018cull\u2019 the herd!! The trophy shot is the biggest, best coat, best conformation, etc., so it looks awesome hanging on the wall. Culling the herd is, by definition, taking out the weak, malformed, sick and elderly to protect the gene pool.\u201d\n\nAnd another:\n\n\u201cThat CBS hunter guest was playing games trying to justify their unsustainable activity. He needs to find something else to use his guns with.\u201d\n\nThough a Shanahan defender said this:\n\n\u201cMEANWHILE, radical islamists are slaughtering innocent people!~ WHO CARES ABOUT THE BIG GAME HUNTERS! WE HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS! Wake up!\u201d\n\nGoing forward, it will be interesting to see if Shanahan\u2019s status as a national spokesperson for big game hunting remains politically \u201csustainable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "He needs to find something else to use his guns with.\u201dThough a Shanahan defender said this:\u201cMEANWHILE, radical islamists are slaughtering innocent people!~ WHO CARES ABOUT THE BIG GAME HUNTERS!\nWake up!\u201dGoing forward, it will be interesting to see if Shanahan\u2019s status as a national spokesperson for big game hunting remains politically \u201csustainable.\u201d\n\u2018We don\u2019t see any rationale to kill animals just as a head-hunting exercise,\u2019 Pacelle said.\nAs one noted:\u201cA point in fact: trophy hunters do NOT \u2018cull\u2019 the herd!!\nIt\u2019s one thing to kill animals for food."}
