Reuters\n\nThe Commerce Department reported Monday that consumer spending rose a better-than-expected 0.4% and personal incomes climbed 0.3% in January. The new health-care law accounted for a big chunk of the increase on both fronts.\n\nOn the incomes side, the law\u2019s expanded coverage boosted Medicaid benefits by an estimated $19.2 billion, according to Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis. The ACA also offered several refundable tax credits, including health insurance premium subsidies, which added up to $14.7 billion.\n\nTaken together, the Obamacare provisions are responsible for about three-quarters of January\u2019s overall rise in Americans\u2019 incomes.\n\nOf course, what the government gives, the government can take away. Case in point: The late-December expiration of a federal program that provided extended aid to unemployed Americans reduced benefit payments $16.7 billion.\n\nExcluding special factors, the Commerce Department said personal income increased a more moderate $23.7 billion, or 0.2%, in January, after falling $15.1 billion, or 0.1%, in December. So it hasn\u2019t been a very good winter for American households.\n\nAlso worth noting: The payments are categorized as \u201ctransfer receipts.\u201d That is, the money is transferred from one household to another via government taxes.\n\nOn the spending side, the BEA is assuming Obamacare is responsible for a $29 billion increase in health-care services. Separately, spending on utilities also saw a big jump due to rising demand for heat during the cold stretch.\n\nOutside of the two categories, consumers spent less: Overall spending on goods declined for the second straight month.\n\n\u201cSo there is indeed evidence of a shift in the composition in spending \u2014 consumers in January spent more on heating bills and health care at the expense of other goods and services,\u201d said Michelle Girard, economist at Royal Bank of Scotland.\n\nTo be sure, the health-care numbers only represent the BEA\u2019s best guess based on preliminary data. \u201cInformation on Medicaid benefits, on ACA insurance exchange enrollments, and other related information was used to prepare the estimates of consumer spending on these services,\u201d the agency said.\n\nSo the figures could be heavily revised as more information \u2014 directly about the new health-care law \u2014 becomes available.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law, is already boosting household income and spending.", "title": "Obamacare Effects Account for Most of Income, Spending Increases", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/03/obamacare-effects-account-for-most-of-income-spending-increases/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BJ112_0204ta_P_20140204150658.jpg"}, "site": "WSJecon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Economy", "article.headline": "Obamacare Effects Account for Most of Income, Spending Increases", "description": "The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law, is already boosting household income and spending.", "article_section": "Economy", "author": "Jeffrey Sparshott", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Real Time Economics Blog", "page.subsection": "Real Time Economics", "article.summary": "The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law, is already boosting household income and spending.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-03-03T17:12:25-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/03/obamacare-effects-account-for-most-of-income-spending-increases/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-REB-23560", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Economy", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law, is already boosting household income and spending.", "title": "Obamacare Effects Account for Most of Income, Spending Increases", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2014/03/03/obamacare-effects-account-for-most-of-income-spending-increases/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BJ112_0204ta_P_20140204150658.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Real Time Economics", "article.id": "BL-REB-23560", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-04T18:26:41-05:00"}, "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Barack Obama\u2019s signature health law, is already boosting household income and spending.\nOn the spending side, the BEA is assuming Obamacare is responsible for a $29 billion increase in health-care services.\nThe new health-care law accounted for a big chunk of the increase on both fronts.\nSo the figures could be heavily revised as more information \u2014 directly about the new health-care law \u2014 becomes available.\nReutersThe Commerce Department reported Monday that consumer spending rose a better-than-expected 0.4% and personal incomes climbed 0.3% in January."}
