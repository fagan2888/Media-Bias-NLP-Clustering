Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has said his family will be the primary factor in whether he runs for president, and members of his family now appear to be on board.

In an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday , Bush’s brother, Neil, said their mother Barbara, who has previously said enough members of her family have been president already, was coming around.“My mom famously said there are more candidates out there, and we should have more candidates than from just two families and maybe Jeb shouldn’t run," Neil Bush said. "I think she’s come around now honestly."“So many people have come up to her and said Jeb is the most qualified guy, and this country needs leadership, and he can bring the country together, so even my mom is starting to swing a bit,” he added. “But Jeb’s going to have to make a very personal decision about whether he wants his family to go through this and whether he can enter the campaign fray with joy.”Neil Bush said he “personally would like to see” his brother run for president.There is expected to be a crowded and diverse field of presidential candidates vying for the GOP nomination in 2016.Bush is near the top of the GOP field in polls, and he easily has the best name recognition of the bunch. If he were to enter the fray, he’d loom large over the field as an establishment figure with deep political and fundraising ties.
