Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, saw the least drop off in media coverage in the week since the Islamist raid in Paris.\n\nNot all media attention is helpful, but you can\u2019t run for president without it. And when major news happens, like the wall-to-wall coverage of the Paris attacks, candidates struggle to be heard above the roar. That\u2019s one of the reasons we bring you The Edge.\n\nThe Edge is a one-of-a-kind measurement from the New Analytics Company that \u201cscrubs\u201d television, radio, print, internet and social media for mentions of the 2016 candidates. The team at New Analytics has built unique tool to measure which candidates are being talked about the most and the data are compiled into a single score and provided to Fox News First.\n\n\n\nEvery candidate saw a drop in coverage from the week before when the Fox Business Network/WSJ debate was driving the discussion, but some managed to still get into the conversation more than others. Here are their rankings for media mentions this week, with their decline from last week in brackets. You can view the full results here.\n\n\n\nDonald Trump, 23.04 [-2.58]; Ben Carson, 14.11 [-4.93]; Jeb Bush, 11.24 [-7.2]; Marco Rubio, 9.15 [-8.28]; Ted Cruz, 9.14 [-7.19]; John Kasich, 5.82 [-5.64]; Carly Fiorina, 5.26 [-6.32]; Rand Paul, 5.11 [-7.19]; Mike Huckabee, 5.01 [-2.724]; Chris Christie, 4.61 [+2.82]\n\n\n\nAT LAST, A REAL POLL!\n\nAfter a two-week drought in national Republican primary polling that covered not just the fourth GOP debate and the most significant Islamist attack in the West in a decade, Bloomberg has finally delivered the goods. And\u2026 not much seems to have changed.\n\n\n\nThe poll mirrors the last useful national survey, which was taken by Fox News at the beginning of the month before the debate and attacks. Donald Trump leads with 24 percent of the vote, but close behind is Ben Carson with 20 percent. Then come Sens. Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz with 12 percent and 9 percent respectively. The rest are, well, the rest.\n\n\n\nThere are some takeaways, though: Trump tops Carson on foreign policy and leadership but Carson tops Trump on questions of character. Carson leads Trump with two key GOP demographic groups: Southerners and Christian conservatives. Rubio bests Cruz on most attribute qualities, including a 19-point advantage on \u201cpresidential temperament.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Net favorability scores with GOP voters - Rubio, 50; Carson, 46; Cruz, 35; Fiorina, 28; Trump, 13; Bush, 6]\n\n\n\nTrump touts government registry of Muslims - WaPo: \u201cDonald Trump said Thursday the United States should create a database of Muslims in the country. \u2018Oh, I would certainly implement that \u2014 absolutely,\u2019 Trump said in a brief interview with NBC News following a town hall event in Iowa on Thursday evening. \u2026 When directly asked Thursday evening by NBC reporter Vaughn Hillyard about the possibility of a database of Muslims, Trump agreed with the idea, using the words \u2018certainly\u2019 and \u2018absolutely.\u2019 But when asked again about this database by a swarm of reporters later in the night, Trump acted confused. \u2018What? Why are you asking me that question?\u2019 Trump said to one reporter following a rally. Trump then ignored a wave of follow-up questions. \u2018Where did you hear that?\u2019 he said to another reporter. \u2018I don't know where you heard that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nRubio\u2019s ObamaCare bailout blocker hits home - A little-discussed provision from Sen. Marco Rubio in a federal funding bill last year may have dealt a devastating blow to ObamaCare. Rubio\u2019s measure to clamp down on what conservatives call insurance \u201cbailouts\u201d but the law calls \u201crisk corridors\u201d to help big insurance with higher costs under ObamaCare seems to have landed on its intended target. The White House downplayed the possible consequences, arguing that the mechanism wouldn\u2019t be necessary anyway because of the success of the law. But with enrollments, especially of healthy customers, lagging, America\u2019s largest health insurer UnitedHealth says it may stop selling ObamaCare policies in the face of forecast losses of $500 million for next year.\n\n\n\n[Rubio joins \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d this weekend.

It\u2019s simply false,\u2019 she said. She criticized the Obama administration for not supplying Middle East allies with support sooner. \u2018We\u2019ve had a fairly effective bombing campaign over the last couple of days. Why haven\u2019t we been doing that for a year and a half? Because we\u2019ve had politically expedient rules of engagement, that\u2019s why. Why haven\u2019t we provided the Jordanians with the bombs and material for their air force [that] they\u2019ve asked us for?\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n[The super PAC supporting Fiorina, CARLY for America, snagged Rick Perry alum Lexi Stemple Swearingen as its senior communications adviser.]\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nThe trials of Nazi leaders for war crimes began in Nuremburg, Germany 70 years ago today. It was a pivot point in Western history in which \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d would be addressed by the victorious side in a war rather than either rough justice at the end of a rope or unaccountability as part of a treaty. The America idea was that offenders would be fairly tried before they were sent to the gallows. But following proper protocols meant that the accused prisoners would have to be afforded access to clergy. But who would sign up to minister to some of the most despicable creatures in history?

When it comes to the theology of Islam, American politicians are the pits. Good intentions have led many astray since the start of the current war with Islamist militants. President Obama has been one of the prime offenders, often expounding on what Islam really is and isn\u2019t. The president took plenty of heat for his head-snapping claim last year that the Islamic State is \u201cnot Islamic.\u201d\n\n\n\nWanting neither to dignify ISIS as a legitimate power nor to suggest that there is any clash between the Islam and the West, Obama runs in circles. The West is not at war with Islamists, therefore the Islamists with which the West is at war must not really be Muslims. Poof. The relative merits of an enemy\u2019s theology would seem to be no matter for an American president\u2019s attention, but it has become a gag reflex for Democrats when confronted with escalations of the ongoing struggle.\n\n\n\n(This has a cousin in the oft-heard argument from Westerners and non-Muslims about what \u201cmoderate Muslims\u201d ought to do. As if Muslims were waiting for cues from Bill Maher on what direction their religion ought to take.)\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to Hillary Clinton, United Methodist, presumptive Democratic nominee and, now, amateur theologian and sociologist. In her speech calling for an escalation of the war against ISIS, Clinton explained who Muslims are. \u201cMuslims are peaceful and tolerant people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\u201d\n\n\n\nGlad that\u2019s settled\u2026\n\n\n\nGood luck with the base, Hillary! - WaPo: \u201cA 32-hour protest about the racial climate at Princeton ended Thursday night when the president and students reached an agreement that included consideration of the idea of renaming the university\u2019s storied Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.\u201d\n\n\n\n[#mediabuzz - Host Howard Kurtz breaks down all the latest on coverage of the Paris attacks and the political consequences with guests including Mary Katherine Ham.

Louisiana voters head to the polls election runoff Saturday after a brutal battle for the governor\u2019s mansion between Democrat John Bel Edwards and Republican Sen. David Vitter. Edwards seemed to be cruising to the finish line powered a vicious attack ad aimed at Vitter\u2019s involvement in a 2008 prostitution scandal. Debates have been a bloodbath with Edwards and Vitter calling each other liars before a heckling crowd in their final faceoff on Tuesday.\n\nBut the focus in the state, as elsewhere, has turned to current national security concerns after the Paris attacks and Vitter is seizing on the Syrian refugee issue to tie Edwards to President Obama\u2019s ISIS woes. A PAC backing Vitter is running a chilling ad that points to Edwards partnering with Obama, noting refugees have already been relocated in the state and the risks of a new influx to Louisiana.\n\nCome Saturday, the party hopes the focus on current issues translates into a redo of the outcome in Kentucky\u2019s gubernatorial race last month, where what was predicted to be a close contest turned out to be a resounding victory for Republican Matt Bevin. Vitter\u2019s challenge seems to be substantially greater, however. There\u2019s been a dearth of reliable polling and runoffs pose special challenges on turnout models, but a University of New Orleans poll taken a week after the Oct. 24 primary election showed Edwards with a 22 point lead.\n\n\n\nEarly snapshot - WSJ: \u201cEarly voting has jumped significantly in Louisiana\u2019s race for governor\u2014up 58% compared to 2011\u2014giving Democrats some reasons for cautious optimism in a race with national implications. By any modern political calculus, it\u2019s the Republican, U.S. Sen. David Vitter, who should win when voters go to the polls on Saturday.\u201d\n\n\n\nDraw! - NYT: \u201c[I]n Mississippi\u2026a mathematically improbable tie in a State House of Representatives race has triggered a state statute that calls for the winner to be determined \u2018by lot.\u2019\u2019 On Friday the two candidates, the Democratic incumbent, Blaine Eaton II, and his Republican challenger, Mark Tullos, will meet in Jackson, the state capital, and draw straws to determine the victor. In a vote tallied earlier this month, each candidate received exactly 4,589 votes.\u201d\n\n\n\nSO YOU\u2019RE SAYING IT COULD HAVE GONE BETTER\u2026\n\nWMUR: \u201cA crane crashed through the roof of a Merrimack home Thursday where workers were cutting trees. The owner of the house on Turkey Hill Road said she hired Healey Tree Works to cut down 20 trees on her property. The crew was cutting down the last tree when the crane hit a septic tank in the backyard, which opened a sinkhole. The crane toppled over and smashed into the roof of the home, where two people were inside. The people inside weren't hurt, but a worker was left dangling from the tree. When the operator tried to move the crane, the climber was injured when it hit his foot. The injured climber was taken to a nearby hospital. The homeowner said she has owned the house for 28 years but never knew about the second septic system that caused the problem.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is the digital politics editor for Fox News.
