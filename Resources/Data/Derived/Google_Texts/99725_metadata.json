By all accounts it was a successful first rehab start for the Rockies\u2019 Gold Glove third baseman.\n\nArenado is on track to rejoin the Rockies on Thursday when they open a 10-game homestand by hosting the Dodgers. He said he would like about 25 at-bats in Triple-A to get ready for his return to the majors.\n\nHey, Walt Weiss, is there any chance Arenado comes back before then? Perhaps for part of the three-game series that begins in Washington D.C. on Monday?\n\n\u201cIf he gets two hits and two RBIs every night on his rehab assignment, I\u2019ll push for it,\u201d the manager quipped Sunday before the Rockies took on the Brewers at Miller Park.\n\nIt\u2019s not likely that the Rockies would cut short Arenado\u2019s rehab stint, but it\u2019s not impossible.\n\n\u201cWe got a good report on Nolan,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe looked really good, a couple of hits, a couple of RBIs. You never know how a guy is going to show up after missing that much time, but he showed up really good last night.\u201d\n\nArenado sustained a mallet fracture to his middle left finger while sliding headfirst into second base in the Rockies\u2019 3-2 loss May 23 at Atlanta. He was placed on the disabled list the next day. The Rockies are 9-24 during in his absence.\n\nSaturday night, Arenado flagged down a hard liner off the bat of the Iowa Cubs\u2019 Josh Vitters to end the Cubs\u2019 third inning, and later made a nice play on Vitters\u2019 grounder to end the seventh.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get as many (chances at third) as you would like, but I got that last (play) that was tough, and it was great,\u201d Arenado told MLB.com. \u201cIt felt fine and didn\u2019t hurt my finger. Even when I hit (the double) to left, there was no pain at all.\u201d\n\nPregame notes of note:\n\n* The Rockies will continue to monitor right-handed starter Jhoulys Chacin, who is worried about his lack of fastball velocity after getting lit up by the Brewers in a 7-4 loss Saturday.\n\n\u201cI really don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with my arm. I can\u2019t get strong,\u201d the right-hander said after most of his fastballs arrived at the plate at about 86 mph. \u201cEven if I throw extra hard, I can get one (pitch), but then I can\u2019t throw the next one hard.\u201d\n\nSaid Weiss: \u201cWe have been looking at it. We are seeing the same thing. The ball is maybe not coming out of his hand like we are used to seeing. He\u2019s such a tough kid that he\u2019s finding a way to compete without his best stuff.\u201d\n\n* Drew Stubbs is getting increased playing time in center field and he\u2019s producing at the plate, too. He went 3-for-4 with a double and an RBI Saturday, and he\u2019s hitting .316 with five home runs, 10 doubles, two triples and 17 RBIs since May 1.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Drew Stubbs,Jhoulys Chacin,Nolan Arenado,Walt Weiss", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Nolan Arenado, the Rockies' Gold Glove third baseman, had two hits and two RBIs in his rehab game with Triple-A Colorado Springs Saturday night and is on track for a Thursday return.", "title": "Nolan Arenado ready to return to Rockies?; update on pitcher Jhoulys Chacin", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/06/29/nolan-arenado-ready-rockies-already-plus-update-jhoulys-chacin/18037/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/05/nolan-arenado-495x343.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Nolan Arenado, the Rockies' Gold Glove third baseman, had two hits and two RBIs in his rehab game with Triple-A Colorado Springs Saturday night and is on track for a Thursday return.", "creator": "@psaundersdp", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/06/29/nolan-arenado-ready-rockies-already-plus-update-jhoulys-chacin/18037/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/05/nolan-arenado-495x343.jpg", "title": "Nolan Arenado ready for return?;  Jhoulys Chacin update", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Nolan Arenado, the Rockies' Gold Glove third baseman, had two hits and two RBIs in his rehab game with Triple-A Colorado Springs Saturday night and is on track for a Thursday return."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe004c\"", "article_summary": "Arenado is on track to rejoin the Rockies on Thursday when they open a 10-game homestand by hosting the Dodgers.\nHe said he would like about 25 at-bats in Triple-A to get ready for his return to the majors.\nMILWAUKEE \u2014 Nolan Arenado was a big hit with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox Saturday night, going 2-for-4 with two RBIs and a run scored.\n\u201cHe looked really good, a couple of hits, a couple of RBIs.\nBy all accounts it was a successful first rehab start for the Rockies\u2019 Gold Glove third baseman."}
