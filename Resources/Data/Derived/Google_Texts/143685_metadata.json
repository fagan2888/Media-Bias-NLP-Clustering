He is the author of the forthcoming \u201cThe Cynic: The Political Education of Mitch McConnell.\u201d\n\nThere is a rhetorical infestation loose in Washington, and left untreated, it will devour what little remains of honest communication in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nIt is the f-word. No, not that one. The other one \u2014 the one that, in either its adjectival or adverbial variations, seems to adorn ever more political pronouncements.\n\nThere it was in April when President Obama lamented the lack of progress in the Middle East peace talks: \u201cSo far we have seen some movement on both sides to acknowledge that this is a crisis long-running that needs to be solved. What we haven\u2019t seen is frankly the kind of political will to actually make tough decisions.\u201d\n\nThere it was when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) made his case for an interventionist U.S. foreign policy at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March: \u201cQuite frankly, we would much rather just focus on our lives here. But we cannot ignore the reality of who we are.\u201d\n\nAnd when Hillary Rodham Clinton fended off questions about the 2012 deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya: \u201cThere are answers \u2014 not all of them, not enough, frankly,\u201d she told a CNN town-hall audience in June.\n\nAnd we heard it when Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) chided then-Secretary of State Clinton for her January 2013 testimony on the Benghazi attacks: \u201cThere are many questions that are unanswered. And the answers, frankly, that you\u2019ve given this morning are not satisfactory to me.\u201d\n\nFrankly. To be frank. In all frankness. In whatever form, the word is meant to imply that the speaker is letting down his or her guard, letting you in on the real deal, even if it is not entirely helpful to the speaker or the speaker\u2019s interests to be doing so. As my Webster\u2019s dictionary puts it, \u201c \u2018Frank\u2019 stresses lack of shyness or secretiveness or of evasiveness from considerations of tact or expedience.\u201d\n\nThink of the word\u2019s most famous uttering: Rhett Butler\u2019s valedictory line to Scarlett O\u2019Hara after she weepingly pleads: \u201cIf you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?\u201d Rhett answers, \u201cFrankly, my dear, I don\u2019t give a damn.\u201d This is the classic usage, delivering a jolt of true revelation that leaves Scarlett stunned on the threshold of their home as he strides into the night.\n\nIncreasingly, though, the word\u2019s promise of candid revelation is a hollow one. Instead, it has become merely a way to accentuate an opinion that costs the speaker nothing \u2014 the word is deployed not to signal that the speaker is veering off-message but to pad the message itself.\n\nEven in ordinary use, far from Congress or Washington television studios, it has taken on an unpleasant resonance, imbuing a tinge of self-importance and knowingness to pronouncements of the Facebook and Twitter age, when everyone\u2019s an insider. \u201cFrankly, I don\u2019t think this season of \u2018Girls\u2019 is as good as last year\u2019s.\u201d \u201cTo be perfectly frank, I\u2019m not sure the food there is worth the wait.\u201d\n\nBut in Washington the word is even more irksome, combining the puffery of its common use with the disingenuousness of the politician\u2019s claim to forthrightness. Take a few examples from the president, who has shown the capacity for true candor but for whom the f-word is usually a telltale sign that he\u2019s in fully canned mode.\n\nHere was Obama in May 2012 attributing his evolution on same-sex marriage partly to his daughters: \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t dawn on them that somehow their friends\u2019 parents would be treated differently. It doesn\u2019t make sense to them. And \u2014 and frankly \u2014 that\u2019s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective.\u201d There was nothing inexpedient about this frankness: It was entirely in Obama\u2019s interest to attribute his blatantly calculated shift on same-sex marriage to the cross-generational wisdom of his daughters. It made him seem thoughtful and open-minded \u2014 a dad listening to his kids at the dinner table, rather than a politician safely coming around on an issue only after much of the country passed him by on it.\n\nAnd here was Obama making his case for his reelection later the same year: \u201cThis election will determine our economic future for the next generation,\u201d he said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in July. \u201cAnd, frankly, the choice could not be clearer.\u201d The only thing that could possibly have made that line truly frank was if he had proclaimed that the choice was not clear.\n\nThe 2012 campaign offered plenty of other examples, as when Mitt Romney declared that the comments by Missouri Republican and then-Senate candidate Todd Akin about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d were \u201cinsulting, inexcusable and, frankly, wrong.\u201d Romney needed badly to separate himself from Akin; there was nothing frank in declaring him mistaken.\n\nAnd a couple of weeks earlier, House Speaker John Boehner had this to say: \u201cListen, President Obama said that small-business tax hikes threaten our economy. Frankly, the Democrats\u2019 \u2018sequester\u2019 threatens our national security.\u201d Here, the word is pure partisan amplifier: Boehner might as well have substituted \u201cgive me a break\u201d or \u201coh, yeah?\u201d\n\nThe misuse has even crept into court decisions. When two Republican-appointed judges on the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued a July ruling in favor of a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, they wrote that they had come down against the law \u201cfrankly, with reluctance.\u201d This seemed hard to believe, given that at oral arguments, the judges had barely been able to conceal their scorn for the law \u2014 at one point, one of them, Judge Raymond Randolph, declared, \u201cIf the legislation is just stupid, it\u2019s not up to the court to save it.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like someone terribly \u201creluctant\u201d to upend the law.\n\nIn its degradation, \u201cfrankly\u201d joins a bevy of partisan fillers that have overtaken political rhetoric, such as Obama\u2019s ultimate favorite, \u201clet me be clear,\u201d typically deployed when he is being anything but clear.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this plague is just another manifestation of hyper-polarization. Politicians know that voters hunger for authenticity, so their instinct is to pepper their talk with hints of independence, as if they\u2019re straying from their side\u2019s orthodoxy. But so far apart and so sharply delineated have the sides become that the odds that someone is actually going to wander across, even for a split second, are unlikely.\n\nAll of which has rendered the word meaningless. So be warned, Washington: If you\u2019re declaring how you frankly feel, know that from now on, we won\u2019t give a damn.\n\nTwitter: @AlecMacGillis\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nIn Obama\u2019s speeches, one favorite phrase: \u201cLet me be clear.\u201d\n\nPlease, President Obama.
