The case challenged the requirement of companies providing contraceptive coverage to their female workers as most Americans are covered by employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\nArvan gave the audience a brief about the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) that was passed in 1933 by Congress. He explained that the act prevents restrictions caused by various laws based on \u201creligious exercise\u201d.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby arts and crafts company run by David Green, filed its lawsuit in 2012 after dropping its coverage to provide contraceptives Plan-B and Ella. The Hobby Lobby Company and Conestoga Wood Specialties emphasized that they run their businesses based on Christian principles. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that corporations controlled by religious families cannot be required to pay for contraception coverage for their female workers. The decision caused a major stir as the public were concerned that the decision violated the Affordable Care Act, a federal law, in the attempt of protecting religious freedom.\n\nMollie Hamel, a senior Government and World Affairs student said, \u201cThis is my body, my autonomy, basically it should be my decision what choices I make and what actions I take.\u201d She added, \u201cI believe the decision should be based on what options a woman and her doctor discuss, a doctor and patient decision, not a supreme court.\u201d\n\nGuest speaker William Myers, an assistant professor of Government World Affairs, touched on the moral of the Hobby Lobby case with a main focus being on the theory of Kantianism, which is based on treating people like humans rather than like objects.\n\n\u201cPregnancy is not a disease, therefore the use of contraceptives is a deception. People now think pregnancy is to be stopped or that they have a choice to prevent life when it\u2019s a blessing. It\u2019s pure deception.\u201d Jake, a Christian health care provider in favor of the Hobby Lobby decision explained, adding, \"Prevention is a word used to avoid something that harms you negatively and pregnancy should not be viewed that way.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last week, \u00a0the\u00a0University of Tampa\u2019s well renowned Sykes Chapel was filled with students and professionals full of anticipation as they prepared to...", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Creative Loafing: Tampa Bay", "description": "Last week, \u00a0the\u00a0University of Tampa\u2019s well renowned Sykes Chapel was filled with students and professionals full of anticipation as they prepared to...", "title": "UT ObamaCare discussion touches on sex, religion and politics"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "google-site-verification": "7ehqC5TVlujj_KkCw_cMXSyKukkqxKv9SOkcxE1CbCI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The Hobby Lobby Company and Conestoga Wood Specialties emphasized that they run their businesses based on Christian principles.\nThe Hobby Lobby arts and crafts company run by David Green, filed its lawsuit in 2012 after dropping its coverage to provide contraceptives Plan-B and Ella.\nArvan gave the audience a brief about the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) that was passed in 1933 by Congress.\nUT ObamaCare discussion touches on sex, religion and politicsLast week, the University of Tampa\u2019s well renowned Sykes Chapel was filled with students and professionals full of anticipation as they prepared to discuss some of the issues pertaining the rejection of contraceptive mandates for corporations.\nHe explained that the act prevents restrictions caused by various laws based on \u201creligious exercise\u201d."}
