Reason's Alex Manning followed Sabo around the streets of LA as he put up posters mocking Hillary Clinton's race for the White House.\n\n\"When you consider how many artists out there are leftists, it's a huge percentage. So right off the bat that sets me apart...and that kind of made it possible for someone with mediocre skills to stand out,\" says Sabo. \"People will say, 'Oh, there have always been conservative artists,' and that may be true, but they weren't mean. My focus was to be mean, nasty, and just as bad as Bill Maher or anyone else. I like to think I was pretty good at it.\"\n\nThrough the 2016 election, Sabo expects to remain focused on left-wing targets, but he hasn't ruled out attacking Republicans he finds objectionable.\n\n\"If a Republican politician does something completely gross, then of course I'll jump on them. I'm probably going to jump on Jeb Bush. I don't want to see another Bush in office.\"\n\nProduced by Alex Manning. Additional camera by Sabo wearing a GoPro.
