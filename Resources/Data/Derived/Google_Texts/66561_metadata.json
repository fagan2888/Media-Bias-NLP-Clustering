Christie derided House Republicans on Thursday, comparing their infighting to \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d an HBO fantasy show rife with palace intrigue, Machiavellian plots and assassinations.\n\nAP FILE PHOTO Gov. Chris Christie\n\nChristie, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, said the American people were tired of the \u201cugly\u201d drama in Congress that led Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to withdraw unexpectedly from the race for speaker Thursday.\n\nMcCarthy\u2019s abrupt exit set off a scramble for the top job in the House. He had been expected to succeed Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who was planning to retire in the coming weeks after years of struggling to unify the GOP caucus.\n\nRepublicans control both chambers of Congress, but the House contingent has become increasingly splintered between moderate lawmakers open to compromise with President Obama and conservatives who would prefer to buck the president on major issues. In the end, not even McCarthy, the GOP\u2019s current majority leader, could muster the 218 votes needed to become speaker.\n\nFor Christie, McCarthy\u2019s exit was the latest example of the egotistical \u201cdysfunction\u201d in Congress. He reacted to the news with weary indifference \u2014 but he also seized on it to reinforce his own anti-Washington campaign message.\n\n\u201cNobody in America cares,\u201d Christie told reporters after an event at a manufacturing plant.\n\n\u201cThis is \u2018Game of Thrones,\u2019\u201d Christie said, referring to the bloody HBO drama. \u201cWho\u2019s going to get the title, and who\u2019s going to sit in the special big chair, and who\u2019s going to get the great table at the restaurant in Washington. What the American people want is a Congress that actually does something.\u201d\n\nChristie had not endorsed McCarthy and declined to say who should succeed Boehner. Instead, he called for a \u201cstrong\u201d leader and urged Republicans to pass legislation that would repeal Obama\u2019s signature health-care legislation \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 as well as measures to restructure the federal tax code and defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cI just hope that whoever they ultimately settle on will be somebody who will have support inside the caucus and be strong enough to actually do something,\u201d Christie said. \u201cThis president should be forced to veto tax reform if that\u2019s what he wants to do, he should be forced to veto a repeal and replacement of Obamacare. He should be forced to veto these things so the American people know who the obstructionist is in Washington, D.C. Right now, they can only conclude it\u2019s the Congress.\u201d\n\nSome of the most conservative House Republicans agree with Christie on the need to defund Planned Parenthood. But like Boehner and McCarthy, Christie said he did not support efforts to defund Planned Parenthood by shutting down the federal government. That puts the governor at odds with 151 Republicans who voted last week against a bill to keep the government running because it included money for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cIt is a fundamental failure of the people who run the government to have the federal government shut down,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d\n\nThe remarks came in Christie\u2019s 27th town hall-style event this year in New Hampshire. Strategists say the state, which holds the first presidential primary, is crucial to his chances of winning the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nDespite his frequent travels to New Hampshire \u2014 Christie is holding six town halls in the state over three days this week \u2014 he has struggled to make inroads. A poll by NBC, The Wall Street Journal and Marist University released Monday showed Christie had the support of 7 percent of New Hampshire\u2019s likely GOP voters, virtually unchanged since he declared his candidacy in July, when he had 6 percent.\n\nThe poll showed Christie in sixth place among GOP candidates. Businessman Donald Trump led the field at 21 percent, the poll showed, followed by former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina at 16 percent.\n\nEmail: rizzo@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Gov.
