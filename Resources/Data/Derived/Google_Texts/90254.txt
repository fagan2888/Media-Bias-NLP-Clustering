[Former Charlotte Mayor Patrick] Cannon was slapped with a felony voter-fraud charge after he cast an absentee ballot in the 2014 mid-term election in the weeks following his sentencing. As a newly convicted felon, Cannon had lost his right to vote.

In an item of news you may have missed this week, the former mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina was hauled out of federal prison, where he is already serving a sentence for accepting over $50,000 in bribes from undercover FBI agents, to plead guilty to felony vote fraud charges. Jen Wilson of the Charlotte Business Journal reports:

Gee, I wonder what political party Cannon is part of? The author of the article doesn’t mention that.

So Mayor Cannon gets a freebie with his vote fraud, no extra time, quite a deterrent, that. But of course, as the Democrats always claim, vote fraud isn’t really a problem.

Cannon was transported from a federal prison in West Virginia this week to answer the charge. The Charlotte Observer reported that pleading guilty to the lesser voter-fraud charge is not expected to impact his release from prison . He is due to be released in January, but he could be placed on house arrest or moved to a halfway house as early as this summer, according to that report.

At the time, Cannon apologized and said he had voted by mistake, that he was simply not thinking about what he was doing.
