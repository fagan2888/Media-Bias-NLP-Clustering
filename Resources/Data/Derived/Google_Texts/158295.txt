As a member of our community and a business owner, I am conscious of the economics of our town.

While I am sometimes frustrated with people’s purchasing patterns, I know that a town this size simply cannot support some of the businesses we would like to see. In my heart, I believe that we will best survive if we look at ourselves and our community and find things — create things — that make us happier, brighter and more welcoming than your average small town. To do that, we have to constantly share our successes with one another and celebrate each step forward.

Historically, one of the vehicles for doing that was the local paper. The local paper would investigate, critique and celebrate the “going ons” of our town. We have lost that influence.

Meaning no criticism of the current HTR Media staff, we have become a homogenized Gannett document — nearly the same as all the neighboring Gannett papers.

So tonight I was able to read this paragraph in our paper — “A Neillsville man accused of having sex with a donkey earlier this month now faces criminal charges and possible jail time.”

Carrying that story in the HTR decreases the value of a column inch in our paper to less than a plugged nickel. The story has no local appeal, and quite frankly, I do not think it is newsworthy in any venue.

No doubt the perpetrator and his family are humiliated beyond belief, and given the fact that donkeys cannot read, I don’t think they feel any safer.
