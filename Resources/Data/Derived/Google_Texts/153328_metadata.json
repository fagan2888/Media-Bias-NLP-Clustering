(AIG), which wants to avoid paying for the entertainer\u2019s defense against defamation claims by several women, who have also accused him of sexual abuse.\n\nCosby cited financial pressures for his request.\n\nIn June, AIG filed suit against Cosby in Massachusetts and California over homeowners\u2019 insurance policies the company had issued to Cosby in those states. AIG claims the policies cover personal injury claims \u2013 including defamation \u2013 but not for personal injury claims arising from sexual, physical or mental abuse.\n\nCosby is facing defamation lawsuits filed by Tamara Green, Therese Serignese and Linda Traitz in Massachusetts; and model Janice Dickinson in California, based on denials by Cosby or his representatives of claims of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn papers he filed in the federal court in Springfield, Massachusetts, Cosby said he would face \u201csubstantial prejudice\u201d by being forced to defend simultaneously lawsuits by AIG over the policies, and by the women over the defamation claims.\n\n\u201cAllowing the coverage lawsuits to continue would force Mr. Cosby to fight a multi-front war against both the underlying plaintiffs, in two lawsuits, and against AIG in two lawsuits, thereby draining resources, money and time that could be channeled into the defense against the Underlying Lawsuits,\u201d his lawyers wrote in a brief asking for either a dismissal or stay of the AIG lawsuit. \u201cForcing Mr. Cosby to fight a four-front battle would demonstrate AIG\u2019s complete disregard for the best interests of Mr. Cosby and would indisputably manifest itself in AIG directly impairing Mr. Cosby\u2019s ability to defend himself in the Underlying Lawsuits.\u201d\n\nAIG has not responded publicly to the lawsuit.\n\nMore than 40 women have accused Cosby, 78, of drugging and sexually assaulting them over the course of several decades.\n\nCosby has not been criminally charged, and his representatives have denied any wrongdoing on his part.\n\nThe cases are AIG Property Casualty Co v. Green et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 15-30111; and AIG Property Casualty Co v. Cosby et al, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 15-04842.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Cosby has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by AIG, which wants to avoid paying for the entertainer\u2019s defense against defamation claims by", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "Bill Cosby has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit filed by AIG, which wants to avoid paying for the entertainer\u2019s defense against defamation claims by women who have also accused him of sex\u2026", "title": "Bill Cosby seeks to dismiss AIG lawsuit over defamation defense", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2015/09/15/bill-cosby-seeks-to-dismiss-aig-lawsuit-over-defamation-defense/", "image": {"width": 985, "identifier": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2011_Bill_Cosby.jpg", "height": 1200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2011_Bill_Cosby.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T20:48:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T20:48:14+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7135\"", "article_summary": "AIG claims the policies cover personal injury claims \u2013 including defamation \u2013 but not for personal injury claims arising from sexual, physical or mental abuse.\nIn June, AIG filed suit against Cosby in Massachusetts and California over homeowners\u2019 insurance policies the company had issued to Cosby in those states.\n\u201cForcing Mr. Cosby to fight a four-front battle would demonstrate AIG\u2019s complete disregard for the best interests of Mr. Cosby and would indisputably manifest itself in AIG directly impairing Mr. Cosby\u2019s ability to defend himself in the Underlying Lawsuits.\u201dAIG has not responded publicly to the lawsuit.\n15-30111; and AIG Property Casualty Co v.
