Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. on June 30, 2014, that allowed the owners of closely held for-profit corporations to exclude certain types of health care services and products\u2014in this case, contraceptive counseling and methods\u2014from their employees\u2019 health insurance plans. That decision could set in motion a potential landslide of additional lawsuits against the Affordable Care Act, and an increasing number of Americans may be affected.\n\nThe Obama administration has issued new rules to ensure that women covered by employer-based insurance are able to access all forms of contraception that have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, without cost sharing. However, it is up to Congress to find a broader fix so that this misguided decision does not affect millions more Americans.\n\nDonna Barry is the Director of the Women\u2019s Health and Rights Program at the Center for American Progress.
