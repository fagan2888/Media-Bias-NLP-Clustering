(AP) - Michigan running back De\u2019Veon Smith seems to have survived a scare.\n\nSmith\u2019s right ankle was injured on a run in a 31-0 win over No. 22 BYU on Saturday and he didn\u2019t return to the game.\n\nHe limped off the field, barely putting weight on his right foot. He was later taken across the field on a cart to the locker room, where X-rays were negative.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI got a little banged up, but it\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\nSmith had run for 125 yards on 16 carries, including a tackle-breaking, 60-yard touchdown, against the Cougars. He leads the Wolverines (3-1) with 331 yards rushing and four TDs.\n\n\u201cYes, I expect to play next week,\u201d Smith said.\n\nMichigan opens Big Ten play at Maryland.\n\n___\n\nAP college football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michigan running back De'Veon Smith seems to have survived a scare.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Michigan running back De\u2019Veon Smith seems to have survived a scare.", "title": "Michigan\u2019s Smith hurts ankle, says he\u2019ll play next week", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/26/michigan-rb-smith-leaves-game-with-apparent-ankle-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/915d34954e4f212b830f6a706700f33b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/915d34954e4f212b830f6a706700f33b.jpg", "description": "Michigan running back De'Veon Smith seems to have survived a scare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Michigan\u2019s Smith hurts ankle, says he\u2019ll play next week"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYes, I expect to play next week,\u201d Smith said.\nSmith\u2019s right ankle was injured on a run in a 31-0 win over No.\nMichigan opens Big Ten play at Maryland.\nANN ARBOR, Mich.
