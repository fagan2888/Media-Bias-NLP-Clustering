(AP) - An unmanned aircraft the size of a push lawnmower was launched shortly after a report of a person being held at knifepoint. With red, green and white lights flashing below its rotors, the drone slowly circled the scene and relayed sharp images to those watching from afar on a digital screen.\n\nThe mock police scene that played out Tuesday kicked off an annual unmanned aircraft conference in Grand Forks, home to the first drone test site in the country to open for business. Another demonstration featured the Draganflyer X4ES recording evidence, such as skid marks and debris, from a two-car accident.\n\n\u201cThe possibilities are endless,\u201d said pilot Jake Stoltz, who helped navigate the drone and its sensors Tuesday. The exhibition was meant to show the shape of things to come when drones reach the commercial market, he said.\n\nBased at the Grand Forks Air Force Base, the test site is one of six in the country where experts are working on the safety of flying drones in civilian airspace and the public perception of having them above. The Federal Aviation Administration does not currently allow the commercial use of drones, but it is working to develop operational guidelines.\n\nStoltz touted the plane\u2019s ability to go from a crime scene to a crop scene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already testing uses in agriculture,\u201d Stoltz said. \u201cI\u2019m not an expert, but I find it amazing that one day you will have farmers using them to check on the health of their crops.\u201d\n\nAt least 75 percent of the drone use in civilian airspace is expected to involve agriculture. When the Northern Plains Unmanned Aircraft Systems Test Site became operational last spring, it began testing how drones can check soil quality and the status of crops. Unmanned aircraft could help farmers by using images taken from above with infrared photography and other technology to show the heat or water content of their plants.\n\nMichael Toscano, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, said Tuesday that drones could help keep the family farm alive.\n\n\u201cThe average farmer today is 58 1/2 years old,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the ways to keep the young people on the farms is using robotics, because this is cool technology and farmers feel it\u2019s a way to keep their sons and daughters on the farm.\u201d\n\nStoltz, who grew up in western North Dakota, agrees.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s another exciting piece of technology that younger farmers will probably embrace, versus the farmer who has been doing it his way for 30 years already,\u201d he said.\n\nWatching the drones in action could also ease the worries of some who perceive the aircraft as an invasion of privacy, said Tim Schuh, the Grand Forks police corporal who led the demonstration.\n\n\u201cPeople come and see this little 5-pound helicopter and wonder why we were making such a big deal about it,\u201d Schuh said. \u201cI think when people see a lot of the capabilities of the aircraft, it will put their minds at ease.\u201d\n\nA survey unveiled at the conference Tuesday by UND professors Cindy Juntunen and Thomasine Heitkamp showed a high rate of acceptance for the drones. The survey of 728 participants in 16 northeastern North Dakota counties found that people\u2019s top concern about unmanned aerial systems is safety, not personal privacy.\n\n\u201cThat was a surprise,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cIt also may speak to the fact that we don\u2019t know how educated people are about what (drones) do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An unmanned aircraft the size of a push lawnmower was launched shortly after a report of a person being held at knifepoint.
