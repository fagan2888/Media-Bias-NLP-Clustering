Vector Capital Takes Saba Software Private in $390M Deal

Private equity firms, including TA Associates, have shown more interest in acquiring software companies as the technology has moved to the cloud

Vector Capital is taking Saba Software (OTC PINK: SABA)private in a $390 million deal.

Redwood Shores, California-based Saba Software develops cloud-based software for companies looking to hire employees.

The purchase price works out to $9 per share. Saba's shares closed at $8.80 on Feb. 10, before the deal was announced. Shares were trading at about $8.55 on the morning of Feb. 11.

Saba said in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that while it was working on Nasdaq restatement, it was evaluating strategic alternatives, including a sale. The company was delisted as a result of accounting issues.

Vector Capital is a technology focused private equity firm based in San Francisco. In July, the firm acquired IPValueManagement Inc., an intellectual property service provider, for an undisclosed amount. Vector won Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Seller of the Year Award for 2013.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Morrison & Foerster are advising Saba on the deal. Shearman & Sterling LLP is Vector's legal counsel.

Private equity firms have been picking up software companies for a while, especially as the technology transitions to the cloud. Venture capital-backed Nimboxx acquired cloud-software developer Verde earlier in February, and before that, in January, TA Associates bought a majority stake in Access Technology Group.
