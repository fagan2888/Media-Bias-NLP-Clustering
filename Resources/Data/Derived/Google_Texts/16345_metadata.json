The Connecticut native was on the men\u2019s rowing team and belonged to a fraternity. Many of those in attendance tonight were those closest to him: teammates and fraternity brothers. \u201cAnytime that a tragedy like this occurs, the university pulls together and we really support each other, and that\u2019s really the reason why the community came out tonight, \u201csays Konwerski.\n\nSouth African rescuers have called off the search after diver and helicopter searches proved futile. Some still hold on to the hope that his body will be found.\n\nNBC4 reported:\n\nUpton\u2019s mother, Margaret Mirowski said she and her husband will fly to South Africa tomorrow and launch a search of her own. A GoFundMe page has been set up to fund their trip.\n\nUpton is a member of the Kappa Alpha fraternity and the GW men\u2019s rowing team, according to Kappa Alpha\u2019s Facebook page and the GW Hatchet.", "article_metadata": {"home_name": "Washington D.C.", "geoLat": "38.807", "description": "Students and teachers alike gathered at a gymnasium on the George Washington University campus Wednesday night to attend a private vigil for Nick Upton.", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aggrego.SunTimes.National", "locale": "en_US", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@SunTimesDC"}, "og": {"site_name": "Washington D.C.", "description": "Students and teachers alike gathered at a gymnasium on the George Washington University campus Wednesday night to attend a private vigil for Nick Upton.", "title": "Vigil held at GW to honor Nick Upton", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://bullseye-prod.aggrego.org//wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/82/2015/09/CN8qWdXWgAABokA.jpg?o=eyJ3aWR0aCI6MCwiaGVpZ2h0IjowLCJ4IjowLjUsInkiOjAuNX0%3D&s=TiRbBO0DuaobNwlj0hV%2FcIgI6Ak%3D", "updated_time": "2015-09-03T17:01:26+00:00", "url": "http://dc.suntimes.com/dc-news/7/82/234250/student-and-teachers-honor-drowned-gw-student/", "type": "article"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "gmt_offset": "-4", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=930568317", "article": {"section": "Washington D.C.
