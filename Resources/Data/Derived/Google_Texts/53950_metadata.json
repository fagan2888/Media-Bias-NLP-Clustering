Marco Rubio Marco RubioSenate GOP ties Iran sanctions fight to defense bill Analysis: Pa. senator missed most Budget Committee hearings Susana Martinez fires back at Trump MORE.\n\nThe 15-second spot opens with the question, \u201cWho owns Marco Rubio?\u201d before showing a picture of the Florida senator adorned with logos of big-money contributors including Wells Fargo, Honeywell, Goldman Sachs and other financial services companies.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis is what our political system has turned into,\u201d the narrator says.\n\n\u201cLarry Lessig is the only presidential campaign with the will and the way to fix it.\n\nA Lessig aide confirmed to The Hill that the campaign will spend more than $150,000 to air the ad in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThe Harvard law professor's next ad will again not target a Democratic primary opponent, but will instead feature former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R).\n\n\"Money is the central issue. It\u2019s true that money is a problem across the field, but it\u2019s important for us in the Democratic primary to attack the issue in a way that doesn\u2019t alienate the base right away,\" a campaign spokesperson said.\n\n\"So that\u2019s why we went with the obvious Republican targets first.\u201d\n\nLessig, who is running an underdog campaign centered on campaign finance reform as his single issue, announced this month that he\u2019s raised $1 million for his campaign in about four weeks. That\u2019s already far surpassed the second-quarter fundraising haul for former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee and former Sen. Jim Webb (Va.), two candidates who will make the Democratic debate stage next week.\n\nBut because Lessig hasn\u2019t scored high enough in presidential polls \u2014 most of which are not even testing his name \u2014 he won\u2019t join those candidates for Tuesday\u2019s event.\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley raised $2 million during the one month between his announcement and the end of the second quarter. None of those candidates have announced their hauls for the third quarter that closed at the end of September.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton raised more than $47 million in the second fundraising quarter, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raised $15 million. The gap between those two candidates narrowed for the third quarter, where Clinton brought in $28 million and Sanders brought in $26 million.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"Who owns Marco Rubio?\" the 15-second spot asks.", "description": "\"Who owns Marco Rubio?\" the 15-second spot asks.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"Who owns Marco Rubio?\" the 15-second spot asks.", "title": "Lessig targets Rubio in first ad", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/256351-lessig-targets-rubio-in-first-ad", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/lawrencelessig_081115getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-08T12:08:27-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-10-08T12:08-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/256351-lessig-targets-rubio-in-first-ad", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-08T11:12-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Ben Kamisar", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Lawrence Lessig, Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-08T11:12:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-08T12:08:27-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/256351-lessig-targets-rubio-in-first-ad", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"Who owns Marco Rubio?\" the 15-second spot asks.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lessig targets Rubio in first ad"}, "dcterms.title": "Lessig targets Rubio in first ad"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb51\"", "article_summary": "The Harvard law professor's next ad will again not target a Democratic primary opponent, but will instead feature former Florida Gov.\nA Lessig aide confirmed to The Hill that the campaign will spend more than $150,000 to air the ad in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Clinton raised more than $47 million in the second fundraising quarter, while Sen.
