Toomey Calls for Full Obamacare Repeal\n\nWritten by Doug Dooling, Jr., Contributing Writer\n\nSenator Pat Toomey (R-PA) joined the Starbucks-free set of Morning Joe this morning to double-down on his calls to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cThis bill can\u2019t be fixed. I think it\u2019s built on completely flawed premises and internal contradictions,\u201d the Senator said.\n\nHis appearance comes during a media frenzy when the ACA, which pundits colloquially call \u201cObamacare,\u201d has been the target of fresh criticism from Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) and national Republican leaders. Cruz declared that any vote for the budget of the United States that funds the ACA is akin to voting for \u201cObamacare.\u201d The junior Senator from Pennsylvania has not been a participant in these recent demands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re [the GOP] not completely unified, as you know, and that\u2019s a little bit problematic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you control only one out of the three [branches of government], you don\u2019t get to dictate all of the terms.\u201d\n\nAlthough Toomey would not criticize Cruz, he believed that Congress could dismantle the ACA piece-by-piece. One of the items that Toomey would like to peel from the act is the medical device tax. On his Senate website, Toomey says that the medical device tax will cost the Pennsylvania economy $100 million per year. Toomey said that it was not \u201crocket science\u201d to know that the ACA hinders businesses and that it was contrary to the interest of creating jobs.\n\n\u201cHealthcare should be controlled by individuals,\u201d is how the Senator succinctly put it.\n\nHe opposes any unilateral action from President Obama to implement the Affordable Care Act. Instead, Toomey provided his own \u201cSerenity Prayer\u201d on how he would defund the president\u2019s healthcare law.\n\n\u201cSystematically repeal the pieces we can, delay the things we can\u2019t repeal and wait for the days we can repeal the rest.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the segment, Chuck Todd hinted that Pat Toomey was a Republican-In-Name-Only (RINO) for not signing a letter to defund Obamacare. However, Scarborough countered that the definition of a RINO is a politician who knows how to win.\n\nToomey narrowly defeated Joe Sestak (D-Delaware) in 2010 and the retired admiral has already made it clear he intends on facing Tommey again in 2016.\n\nSeptember 23rd, 2013 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Senate, Top Stories | 13 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an interview on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d, Senator Pat Toomey doubled down on his calls to repeal the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/sen-toomey-calls-for-full-obamacare-repeal/51285/", "description": "In an interview on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d, Senator Pat Toomey doubled down on his calls to repeal the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Sen.
