Vickie Armstrong, an Akron Republican, and former Sen. Robert Hagedorn, an Aurora Democrat, points out how online advertising insinuated that State Auditor Dianne Ray\u2019s office supports the measure, when she is precluded by law from doing so.\n\nIn the online ads, Amendment 68 proponents said the audit determined state schools \u201cneed funding\u201d and imply support for the ballot measure would translate into those dollars.\n\n\u201cNowhere does the audit report state any conclusion of either the (Office of the State Auditor) or Auditor Ray that \u2018Colorado Schools Need Funding,\u2019 \u201d according to the letter signed by Sharon Eubanks, deputy director of the legislative services office. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a false reading of the report to use its objectives and limited factual findings to draw the (self-serving) conclusion supporting Amendment 68.\u201d\n\nEubanks called the efforts \u201cfalse or reckless statements that are illegal under state law.\u201d\n\nOfficials with the campaign disagreed with the characterization, but relented nonetheless.\n\n\u201cThe Yes on 68 campaign provided only accurate information detailing the state auditor\u2019s report about the poor financial health of many Colorado school districts,\u201d spokeswoman Monica McCafferty said in an e-mail. \u201cYet in order to not prolong any confusion or controversy, we promptly removed the online banner ad.\u201d\n\nOpponents said it\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve seen issues with accuracy in advertising.\n\n\u201cThis is the second time supporters of Amendment 68 have been caught lying in their advertising,\u201d said Bill Cadman, chairman of the No on 68 campaign. \u201cIf they take this many liberties with the truth before the election, imagine how they\u2019ll deal with us after the vote, after they are locked into the (state) constitution.\u201d\n\nThe audit, released Aug. 25, is a fiscal health analysis of Colorado school districts and uses a variety of benchmarks to determine how districts are doing. The report found a number of school districts had missed some of the benchmarks \u2014 only one missed all three \u2014 indicating some questions over whether they could weather their obligations through the next three years.\n\nOf the state\u2019s 176 school districts, 20 missed at least two of the benchmarks, the report found. All 20 districts explained the problem in part as a spending-down of their reserve monies \u201cdue to reductions in state funding,\u201d the report shows.\n\nThe ad used the Office of the State Auditor\u2019s official logo with the headline \u201cAuditor says Colorado Schools Need Funding\u201d beneath other text that says \u201cAmendment 68 Will Help.\u201d\n\nThe amendment asks voters to authorize limited-stakes gaming at horse racetracks in Arapahoe, Mesa and Pueblo counties. Currently, Arapahoe Park in Aurora is the only horse track operating in those counties.\n\nRhode Island-based Twin River Casino, which owns Arapahoe Park, is the chief backer of Amendment 68.\n\nDavid Migoya: 303-954-1506, dmigoya@denverpost.com or twitter.com/davidmigoya", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Legislative Services: Report misused in casino-campaign ads", "title": "Colorado Legislative Services: Report misused in casino-campaign ads", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/22/colorado-legislative-services-report-misused-in-casino-campaign-ads/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140922__bz25CASINOS12_HRp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140922__bz25CASINOS12_HRp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-22T17:15:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:17:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Consumer news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbee0\"", "article_summary": "Rhode Island-based Twin River Casino, which owns Arapahoe Park, is the chief backer of Amendment 68.\nOf the state\u2019s 176 school districts, 20 missed at least two of the benchmarks, the report found.\n\u201cThis is the second time supporters of Amendment 68 have been caught lying in their advertising,\u201d said Bill Cadman, chairman of the No on 68 campaign.\nAll 20 districts explained the problem in part as a spending-down of their reserve monies \u201cdue to reductions in state funding,\u201d the report shows.\n\u201cNowhere does the audit report state any conclusion of either the (Office of the State Auditor) or Auditor Ray that \u2018Colorado Schools Need Funding,\u2019 \u201d according to the letter signed by Sharon Eubanks, deputy director of the legislative services office."}
