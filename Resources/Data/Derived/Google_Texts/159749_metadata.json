Bush and the governorship of Republican Donald Carcieri, the state experimented with a nation-leading \u201cglobal waiver\u201d to lower costs in exchange for flexibility.\n\nEven though the experiment was largely successful, intervening governors and the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA; ObamaCare) appear to have blocked parts of the reform and let others peter out.\n\nNow, progressive Democrat Gov. Gina Raimondo has convened a Working Group to Reinvent Medicaid, with a collection of reforms of her own, designed to save or raise $91.1 million in state money next year\u2013a little less than 10 percent of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.\n\nThe claim of \u201creinvention\u201d notwithstanding, the two reform plans share many of the same strategies\u2013such as streamlining services for difficult, expensive cases and addressing long-term care in the least comprehensive way that still addresses patients\u2019 needs. Still, they have different emphases, tilting right and left with the politics of their respective administrations.\n\nOne action that the ACA prevented in the global waiver, for example, was an increase in premiums that beneficiaries would have paid for subsidized health insurance. By contrast, the Raimondo working group proposes to double the possible tax that commercial insurers pay on the assumption that children who receive Medicaid services would otherwise receive them through private insurance.\n\nThe most significant difference between the packages may be their presentation. The waiver was a policy proposal negotiated with the federal government. Raimondo\u2019s working group is a budgetary mandate for which she accounted in her budget proposal for the next fiscal year, even before she\u2019d convened her roomful of technocratic experts.\n\nAs noted in a brief analysis that this writer developed with Foundation for Government Accountability health policy expert Josh Archambault for the RI Center for Freedom & Prosperity, Raimondo\u2019s approach could result in implementation of the plan with eyes closed. Fifty-three percent of the savings could wind up transferring costs to private insurers, providers, and employers.\n\nIn the context of the budget process, such steps run the risk of becoming hidden taxes, as the private sector picks up new bills in one area so the government can spend the liberated tax money on unrelated programs that shouldn\u2019t be priorities.\n\nAlthough the working group put specific dollar amounts on its proposals, another 27 percent of the savings should actually be considered speculative. For years after the global waiver, local journalists dogged its architects for overestimating the savings. But the waiver was an experiment; the Raimondo working group\u2019s plans will affect whether the state is able to balance its expenditures and revenue next year.\n\nA change in the working group\u2019s final report from its previous draft illustrates the risk. \u201cBundled payment arrangements for maternity and childbirth\u201d comes with a savings prediction of $1.9 million.\n\nIn the penultimate draft, however, that suggestion had been stuck in a table of \u201cadditional initiatives with savings in future years.\u201d Before its final meeting, the working group may have come across evidence that the reform would be faster-acting than expected, but the appearance is not that the list consists of sure-things on which policymakers should bank.\n\nSeveral of the reform initiatives would actually thwart their role as savings, to the extent that they are successful. Cutting the rate that the state pays for hospital visits for Medicaid patients gives the hospitals incentive to charge more to non-Medicaid customers. Turning around and offering those hospitals bonuses as incentive to meet reform goals, as the proposal also does, would simply eat into the savings.\n\nOther proposals are not so much reforms as gimmicks to shift cost burdens to federal taxpayers. Making sure beneficiaries are billed in the categories that provide the greatest federal match isn\u2019t really a savings to the system.\n\nMeanwhile, an increase in the nursing home \u201cbed tax\u201d would trigger higher federal matching dollars, while another collection of incentive programs would simply shuffle the money back to the providers.\n\nIn a final analysis, Governor Raimondo\u2019s Medicaid reforms might be an excellent symbol of the budget tendencies of a struggling big-government state. Policies that might save money, increase efficiencies, and boost the economy are speculative, while user fees and payment reductions create stealth taxes and new spending becomes part of the baseline for the next year.\n\nAt the same time, local elected officials, who are immediately accountable to the people\u2013and see them every day as they go about their lives\u2013move more responsibility to their governing peers in Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Rhode Island's proposed Medicaid reforms are just business as usual: government shifting costs to the private sector.", "title": "Rhode Island\u2019s Medicaid reforms just shift costs to balance the budget - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/shutterstock_240935290.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-11T09:34:59+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/217812/rhode-island-medicaid-reforms/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "published_time": "2015-05-08T13:16:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T09:34:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Rhode Island's proposed Medicaid reforms are just business as usual: government shifting costs to the private sector.", "title": "Rhode Island\u2019s Medicaid reforms just shift costs to balance the budget - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/shutterstock_240935290.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Rhode Island's proposed Medicaid reforms are just business as usual: government shifting costs to the private sector."}, "article_summary": "In a final analysis, Governor Raimondo\u2019s Medicaid reforms might be an excellent symbol of the budget tendencies of a struggling big-government state.\nAlthough the working group put specific dollar amounts on its proposals, another 27 percent of the savings should actually be considered speculative.\nRaimondo\u2019s working group is a budgetary mandate for which she accounted in her budget proposal for the next fiscal year, even before she\u2019d convened her roomful of technocratic experts.\nGina Raimondo has convened a Working Group to Reinvent Medicaid, with a collection of reforms of her own, designed to save or raise $91.1 million in state money next year\u2013a little less than 10 percent of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending.\nBy contrast, the Raimondo working group proposes to double the possible tax that commercial insurers pay on the assumption that children who receive Medicaid services would otherwise receive them through private insurance."}
