Aaron Schock.\n\nIn each case, voters will pick a party nominee in a primary election July 7. The winners will face off in a Sept. 10 special general election across the territory that sprawls from the Mississippi River to Cropsey, northeast of Bloomington.\n\nBreitbart news editor Mike Flynn, now of Quincy, and former corrections employee Donald Rients of rural Benson delivered petitions to the State Board of Elections in Springfield as Republican candidates.\n\nState Sen. Darin LaHood, R-Peoria, submitted paperwork on the first day candidates were eligible to do so last week.\n\nFlynn said as a sixth-generation native of the district, he would focus his campaign on core, conservative issues, arguing that \u201cthis area deserves conservative representation and it has not had that for decades.\u201d\n\nAmong the policies he wants to push, Flynn cited continued pushes to repeal Obamacare \u2014 focusing not just on what he called \u201ctoken votes,\u201d but on systematically working on a wholesale defunding of the policy across government \u2014 and addressing President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders earlier in the year related to immigration policy.\n\nRients did not return a phone message seeking comment on his candidacy.\n\nThough the district\u2019s voting pattern has leaned heavily toward Republicans, two Democrats also filed.\n\nRob Mellon, a social studies teacher in Quincy, and Adam Lopez, a member of the Springfield District 186 School Board, joined the race. Lopez is an insurance executive; Mellon sought his party\u2019s nomination in the 2014 primary election, losing to eventual nominee Darrel Miller of Danvers.\n\nA host of other potential candidates had floated their names, but clearing the hurdle of getting more than 1,000 valid signatures for Republicans and more than 600 for Democrats \u2014 numbers based on previous voter turnout \u2014 can prove a challenge for many.\n\nTypically, to avoid challenges to their petitions, candidates will try to get at least twice the number of required signatures. LaHood turned in about 4,000 signatures; Flynn said he turned in just more than 2,000.\n\n\u25a0 Another Aaron Schock staffer is served a grand jury subpoena\n\n\u25a0 GOP's Darin LaHood favored in race to replace Aaron Schock\n\nChris Kaergard can be reached at 686-3135 and ckaergard@pjstar.com.
