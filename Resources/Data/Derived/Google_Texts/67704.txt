Two state lawmakers -- one an orthopedic surgeon and the other a dentist -- have submitted an eight-year health plan for Florida that includes having the state run its own Medicaid program, the Tampa Bay Times reports.



According to the Times, the 29-page proposal from state Reps. Julio Gonzalez, R-Venice, and Fred Costello, R-Ormond Beach, would give doctors the control of health care decisions. It also would cap the amount of the state budget spent on health care at 33 percent, the Times reports.
