The Kansas Highway Patrol say speed was a factor in a crash that shut down a portion of west Kellogg in Wichita.

The crash happened around 9 p.n. Friday between West Street and Meridian. Troopers says 17-year-old Tamara Schmidt was traveling at a high rate of speed in the inside lane and sideswiped three other vehicles.

Her pickup then left the roadway and rolled, coming to rest near the on-ramp from Meridian to westbound Kellogg.

Schmidt was hospitalized with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Reports state she was not wearing a seatbelt.

None of the six people in the other vehicles were hurt.

A portion of Kellogg in west Wichita was shut down Friday evening due to a crash.

It happened around 9 p.m. on westbound Kellogg near Meridian. Dispatchers said the crash involved three to five vehicles, one of which overturned onto its side.

One person was taken to a local hospital with potentially serious injuries.

All westbound lanes were shut down while emergency crews worked to clear the scene. Traffic was diverted at Seneca.

Further details were not immediately available.
