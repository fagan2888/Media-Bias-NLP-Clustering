But do those subsidies apply to more than just working- and middle-class consumers on the individual market? The Center of the American Experiment accuses the MNsure system of paying subsidies to the wealthy, based on testimony from health-insurance brokers in Minnesota:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s happening all over the nation and all over Minnesota,\u201d said Harlan Johnson, a Pequot Lakes health insurance broker and MNsure Health Industry Advisory Council member. \u201cI\u2019ve looked people on the MNsure Board of Directors right in the eye and told them this. They know it, but they don\u2019t want to deal with it.\u201d It\u2019s a legal, but dirty little secret among health insurance agents and brokers who help Minnesotans apply for and pick health care plans. \u201cWhen a millionaire on Medicaid calls you and says, \u2018I\u2019m going to spend the winter in Florida. Can you help me find a doctor,\u2019 it\u2019s like, what?\u201d said Dave Racer, a long time St. Paul health-care consultant. Strange, but true. High net worth individuals who keep their taxable income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level\u2014about $22,000 for a couple\u2014qualify for Medicaid under Obamacare. The reason? The Affordable Care Act eliminated the assets test to determine eligibility for medical welfare. Applicants qualify solely on the basis of their modified adjusted gross income.\n\nPart of the issue is the complicated nature of Medicare, which unlike Medicaid is ostensibly not a welfare program. People pay all of their working lives into the Social Security system, and therefore there is no means testing for qualifying. But Medicaid is a means-tested program, intended to help low-income families cover their basic health care needs. (How well that works is another matter.) Not including assets helps protect people who may have moderate but mostly non-liquid wealth from having to descend into total poverty before getting assistance.\n\nClearly, though, that\u2019s a loophole that some wealthy Minnesotans are willing to exploit \u2014 at taxpayer expense. \u201cA few of them might be at $3 million or $4 million in assets,\u201d Johnson told CAE. \u201cThey chose to take advantage of the situation, and they\u2019re not doing anything illegal.\u201d If the only income they receive is Social Security, then they can qualify for Medicaid, or for private insurance bolstered by taxpayer subsidies. Either way, that comes out of the pockets of taxpayers, as do the rest of the subsidies that supposedly make ObamaCare \u201caffordable.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only problem MNsure has faced in recent weeks about its spending and its accountability. The system has repeatedly failed at verifying eligibility for subsidies at all, which has cost the state at least $115 million, and perhaps as much as $271 million in benefit payments:\n\nSmall wonder that enrollments were \u201cgoing well\u201d in late January. First, people face tax penalties if they don\u2019t comply, but it also looks like the incentives are set up for those who need it least to push their way to the head of the subsidy line. \u201cMonopoly money,\u201d indeed.\n\nUpdate: I got an e-mail this evening from a reader who wishes to remain anonymous. Part of the problem is that the wealthy who still have to buy health insurance may end up having no choice but to enroll in Medicaid, he explains:\n\nThe problem is that if I even go into the MNSure website to examine insurance plans, it will automatically sign me up into Medical Assistance, which as you know is Minnesota\u2019s Medicaid. And once signed up it\u2019s been only with great difficulty that I\u2019ve been able to un-sign up. Its taken dozens of hours on the phone, directed to offices hundreds of miles away and even when completed it took months for the Medicaid to stop. In the mean time I end up carrying insurance while the state also pays an insurance company to manage my (unused) Medicaid. I\u2019m almost certain I spent one year doubly insured despite their insistence that I wasn\u2019t (I kept getting literature and insurance cards throughout the year). I\u2019ve now taken to doing my investment planning to deliberately create investment income solely to avoid being thrown back on Medical Assistance. Which I agree sounds pretty crazy. The question I keep asking myself is how can such a system persist? I don\u2019t see millionaires deliberately lobbying to be on Medicaid. But I can easily imagine that with the close link between social services and the companies that actually deliver these services \u2026 creates an effective lobbying operation inside the agencies and at the St. Paul capital.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Plus: $271 million lost in overpayments?", "title": "Does MN ObamaCare exchange subsidize millionaires?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/17/does-mn-obamacare-exchange-subsidize-millionaires/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@GoingRedBook"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-17T23:41:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T01:47:03+00:00"}, "keywords": "Mark Dayton, MNSure, ObamaCare, subsidies, wealthy,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Does MN ObamaCare exchange subsidize millionaires?\nThey know it, but they don\u2019t want to deal with it.\u201d It\u2019s a legal, but dirty little secret among health insurance agents and brokers who help Minnesotans apply for and pick health care plans.\nHigh net worth individuals who keep their taxable income below 138 percent of the federal poverty level\u2014about $22,000 for a couple\u2014qualify for Medicaid under Obamacare.\nPeople pay all of their working lives into the Social Security system, and therefore there is no means testing for qualifying.\n\u201cA few of them might be at $3 million or $4 million in assets,\u201d Johnson told CAE."}
