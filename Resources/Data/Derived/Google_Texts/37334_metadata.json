But the resort behemoth isn\u2019t retooling its Web addresses. All the company\u2019s .ski domains \u2014 like vail.ski and breckenridge.ski \u2014 redirect back to the company\u2019s longtime addresses.\n\n\u201cWe purchased them as a proactive measure in the event that .ski may someday be how our guests connect with us digitally,\u201d Vail Resorts spokeswoman Kelly Ladyga said.\n\nTelluride also joined the growing coalition of early .ski claimants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always trying to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to marketing and technology trends,\u201d Telluride ski area\u2019s vice president of sales and marketing Matt Windt said,\n\nnoting that the .ski domain redirects to the resort\u2019s venerable address, tellurideskiresort.com. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth in brand awareness around Telluride, and it\u2019s important for our resort to own the Telluride brand. The .ski domain plays into that.\u201d\n\nDenver-based domain company Name.com is one of several sites where people can register their .ski website names.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado snowsports jump on .ski domain for websites", "title": "Colorado snowsports jump on .ski domain for websites", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/15/colorado-snowsports-jump-on-ski-domain-for-websites/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825__CD13SKIDEATH_AC13002xp1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825__CD13SKIDEATH_AC13002xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T17:15:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T01:03:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdabad\"", "article_summary": "In the first few days, snowsports fans claimed almost 5,000 .ski domains, including more than 1,000 ski resorts, ski brands and snowsports athletes.\nThe .ski domain plays into that.\u201dDenver-based domain company Name.com is one of several sites where people can register their .ski website names.\nThe .ski domain launched onto the Web last week, creating the Internet\u2019s first domain space for snow sports.\nThe new top-level domain is a fresh start for athletes, ski makers, ski resorts and other snowsports companies seeking to carve their own corner of cyberspace.\nTom Kelly, vice president of communications for the U.S."}
