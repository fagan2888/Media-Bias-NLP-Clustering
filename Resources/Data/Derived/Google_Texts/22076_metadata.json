Our Constitution puts the military under civilian leadership, that\u2019s why the president is called the commander-in-chief. It is a fundamental tenant to our country\u2019s democracy. Congress decides whether to fight and the president manages the fight, but as commander-in-chief, Mr. President, you seem more concerned with the politics of war and the campaign promises to end conflicts and close Gitmo than in protecting Americans.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "udge Jeanine Pirro argued \".ISIS doesn't have a morale problem, they're not a JV team, they're not on the run, and we're not winning.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "udge Jeanine Pirro argued \".ISIS doesn't have a morale problem, they're not a JV team, they're not on the run, and we're not winning.\"", "title": "Pirro: 'We're Not Winning' Against ISIS - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Pirro-214-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/14/pirro-were-not-winning-against-isis/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "udge Jeanine Pirro argued \".ISIS doesn't have a morale problem, they're not a JV team, they're not on the run, and we're not winning.\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Pirro-214-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Pirro: 'We're Not Winning' Against ISIS - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "ISIS, Jeanine Pirro, President Obama, War on Terror,Breitbart TV, Jihad, Middle East,ISIS", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "War on Terror", "published_time": "2015-02-14T22:10:01-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Jihad,Middle East"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabc1\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Saturday, the Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cJustice with Judge Jeanine\u201d host Judge Jeanine Pirro argued \u201c.ISIS doesn\u2019t have a morale problem, they\u2019re not a JV team, they\u2019re not on the run, and we\u2019re not winning.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPirro stated that unless the surrounding of a Marine base by ISIS fighters was taken seriously, \u201cWe are setting ourselves up for a loss of American lives.\u201d She continued, \u201cone minute, ISIS\u2019 morale is sinking.\nOur Constitution puts the military under civilian leadership, that\u2019s why the president is called the commander-in-chief.\nThe next, they\u2019re circling our Marines\u2026ISIS doesn\u2019t have a morale problem, they\u2019re not a JV team, they\u2019re not on the run, and we\u2019re not winning.\u201dShe then said to the president \u201cyou keep telling us that we\u2019re winning, but we\u2019ve been kicked out of Libya, Syria, and now Yemen.\u201d And \u201cyou\u2019re not a serious leader.\nIt is a fundamental tenant to our country\u2019s democracy.\nCongress decides whether to fight and the president manages the fight, but as commander-in-chief, Mr. President, you seem more concerned with the politics of war and the campaign promises to end conflicts and close Gitmo than in protecting Americans.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}
