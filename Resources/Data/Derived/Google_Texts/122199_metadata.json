REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\n4738202\n\nThe Supreme Court began a new term Monday and after last Spring\u2019s big losses on gay marriage and Obamacare, conservatives are wary of the next few months where the highest court in the land is set to take on several major issues.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to take on cases involving union dues, abortion, affirmative action, the death penalty, Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate and more.\n\nAn Associated Press story Monday cited experts saying the term would be good for conservatives, a kind of bounce back after major losses last term, but others aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nA key reason for the AP\u2019s confidence is that many of the issues set to come before the court this term have already been ruled on in similar cases by the justices, and they often voted conservative.\n\n\u201cThis term, I\u2019d expect a return to the norm, in which the right side of the court wins the majority, but by no means all of the cases,\u201d Georgetown University law school\u2019s Irv Gornstein told The AP.\n\nEd Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, doesn\u2019t share the same outlook.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not nearly as optimistic about conservative chances as many folks on the left say I should be,\u201d Whelan told The Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nOf the cases, the Supreme Court is likely to hear the first major abortion case in nearly a decade, a case that will examine the constitutionality of Texas\u2019 strict abortion regulations, which have reduced the number of abortion clinics in the state to nearly single digits.\n\nThe court will also decide whether public unions can force workers to pay dues even if they aren\u2019t members of the union. A loss on this case would be devastating to public unions, which are already on the decline.\n\nAnother case would give the court the opportunity to end affirmative action, the practice where universities consider race as a factor in admissions.\n\nThe contraception mandate could get the court\u2019s attention is well. A group of nuns in a legal battle with the mandate grabbed national headlines when Pope Francis met with them during his stateside visit last month.\n\nThese weighty decisions will surely bleed over into the 2016 race, as rulings will come down in June of 2016, just months before the election.\n\nFollow Casey on Twitter and like him on Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
