Court of Appeals said that the DEA was correct in its assertion that an insufficient number of clinical studies exist to \u201cwarrant a judicial review of cannabis\u2019 federally prohibited status,\u201d which the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with.\n\nBut as marijuana legalization advocate Russ Belville pointed out in an article for High Times, the court\u2019s ruling is more about whether or not the DEA was following its own rules than whether or not marijuana should be rescheduled.\n\nCurrently marijuana is classified as a Schedule I substance, meaning that the U.S. government does not recognize a valid use of marijuana at any time \u2014 even for medical purposes \u2014 and believes marijuana is highly addictive, has a high potential for abuse, and functions as a gateway drug. Other Schedule I substances include heroin and phencyclidine (PCP).\n\nMoving marijuana to a lower classification such as Schedule V would mean that marijuana had known health benefits and was not likely to be abused as much as other drugs.\n\n\u201cThe DEA requires we show real, FDA-approved research proving marijuana is medical, safe and non-addictive, and since the DEA won\u2019t let that research happen, there is nothing forcing them to change the scheduling of cannabis,\u201d Belville wrote.\n\n\u201cBut what about the 19,000+ published studies on cannabis\u2019 medical benefits? The federal government patents on the medical effects of cannabinoids? The four surviving federal medical marijuana patients still receiving U.S. government-grown schwag? The 20 states with medical marijuana and the millions who are living testament to marijuana\u2019s medical miracles?\u201d\n\nEach year the U.S. spends about $40 billion fighting the war on drugs, even though no one has ever died from consuming or smoking too much marijuana.\n\nSince a large percentage of the DEA\u2019s money comes from drug sting operations, specifically marijuana trafficking, many marijuana advocates have questioned whether the DEA opposes legalization simply because they don\u2019t want to lose that income. According to a report from Americans for Safe Access, a medical marijuana patient advocacy group, each raid costs taxpayers around $17,000.\n\nState vs. federal law\n\nSince 1996, 20 states have legalized marijuana for medical use, and last year two states \u2014 Washington and Colorado \u2014 legalized recreational use of the drug, creating a direct conflict between state and federal law.\n\nThough some lawmakers such as Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have pushed for the passage of federal legislation that would allow states to legalize marijuana for medical or recreational use, citing a waste of taxpayer and law enforcement resources, most lawmakers have been rather passive toward the legalization issue.\n\nThe Obama administration has been quiet in its stance on marijuana legalization, even though during his 2008 bid for the White House Obama indicated he would not crack down on medical marijuana users.\n\nBut in an interview with Mint Press News, Allen St. Pierre, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), a marijuana legalization advocacy group, said the federal government has continued to raid large-scale marijuana retailers around the country, and as of November 2012, Obama had shut down more dispensaries that President George W. Bush did in his eight years in office.\n\nHowever, in response to the passage of the legalization legislation in Colorado and Washington, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced last month that it had decided to defer its legal right to challenge the marijuana legalization laws and would not file a lawsuit against either state for failure to follow the laws under the federal Controlled Substances Act \u2014 at least for now.\n\nAs Mint Press News previously reported, the DOJ\u2019s announcement made it clear that both states would be allowed to continue implementing state rules and regulations for recreational marijuana even though the substance will remain illegal under federal law. However the DOJ failed to mention anything about states that legalized medical marijuana or industrial hemp.\n\nThough the DOJ\u2019s new stance on marijuana wasn\u2019t as progressive as many had hoped, states have continued to introduce legislation that legalizes medical marijuana, recreational marijuana and/or industrial hemp.\n\nWhy? Because legalization appears to be what the majority of Americans want.\n\nA poll released earlier this year by Quinnipiac University found that as of December 2012, voters supported legalization of marijuana 51 to 44 percent. As Mother Jones reported, \u201cEven in the relatively conservative states of Florida, Iowa and Kentucky, polls released in the past week have shown majority support for recently proposed medical marijuana laws.\u201d\n\nLegalization: only a matter of time?\n\nIn 2014, voters in Alaska are expected to vote on legislation that would legalize recreational marijuana, and by 2017, ten other states are expected to also have initiatives on the ballot that would legalize marijuana.\n\n\u201cMost Americans are tired of seeing their tax dollars used to arrest and prosecute adults for using a substance that is objectively less harmful than alcohol,\u201d said Marijuana Policy Project executive director Rob Kampia. \u201cVoters and state legislators are ready for change, and the federal government appears to be ready, as well.\n\n\u201cMarijuana prohibition has been just as problematic and counterproductive as alcohol prohibition,\u201d Kampia said. \u201cWe look forward to working with elected officials, community leaders, organizations, and other local and national allies to develop more effective and efficient marijuana policies.\u201d\n\nOne of those ten states is California.\n\nThough California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana, voters in the state have yet to pass legislation legalizing recreational use of the substance. Many advocates said that because the state has borne the brunt of the federal government\u2019s crackdown on marijuana, many voters in the state were likely reluctant to pass any legislation to further legalize the substance.\n\nBut on Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union announced they were working to put legalization back on the state\u2019s ballot. Before any legislation appears on the ballot, however, the ACLU said it would be creating a new panel to study marijuana legalization in California in preparation for a 2016 ballot measure that would legalize the substance.\n\nThe panel is to be led by the state\u2019s Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, and will include academics, drug policy experts, law enforcement authorities, and officials from Colorado and Washington.\n\nNewsom said he is in support of legalizing marijuana because \u201cenough\u2019s enough. I can\u2019t sit back and support the status quo any longer.\u201d He explained that even though he doesn\u2019t smoke marijuana, he isn\u2019t concerned about any political fallout that may occur for his decision to take a stand on the issue.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like smoking anything else \u2014 I want a regulatory regime that doesn\u2019t advertise to kids, that doesn\u2019t allow public use and secondhand smoke,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, while California\u2019s 2010 legalization measure was defeated with 53.5 percent of voters voting against the measure, a new poll found that legalizing recreational marijuana received support from 65 percent of polled voters.\n\nIn addition to efforts to legalize recreational marijuana, a few states are also considering legislation that would legalize medical marijuana, including Ohio, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The highest court says there\u2019s not enough evidence to warrant taking a second look at marijuana\u2019s Schedule I status., California, Controlled Substances Act, legalization, Marijuana, Schedule I, Supreme Court,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "The highest court says there\u2019s not enough evidence to warrant taking a second look at marijuana\u2019s Schedule I status., California, Controlled Substances Act, legalization, Marijuana, Schedule I, Supreme Court,", "title": "Supreme Court Sides With Feds On Marijuana Prohibition", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/supreme-court-sides-with-feds-on-marijuana-prohibition/170885/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101813_MJ_16x9.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-22T09:41:26-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The highest court says there\u2019s not enough evidence to warrant taking a second look at marijuana\u2019s Schedule I status., California, Controlled Substances Act, legalization, Marijuana, Schedule I, Supreme Court,", "creator": "@katierucke", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101813_MJ_.jpg", "title": "Supreme Court Sides With Feds On Marijuana Prohibition", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2013-10-19T05:03:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-22T09:41:26-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf51\"", "article_summary": "Supreme Court Sides With Feds On Marijuana ProhibitionThe highest court says there\u2019s not enough evidence to warrant taking a second look at marijuana\u2019s Schedule I status.\nThough the DOJ\u2019s new stance on marijuana wasn\u2019t as progressive as many had hoped, states have continued to introduce legislation that legalizes medical marijuana, recreational marijuana and/or industrial hemp.\nIn addition to efforts to legalize recreational marijuana, a few states are also considering legislation that would legalize medical marijuana, including Ohio, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\nAccording to a report from Americans for Safe Access, a medical marijuana patient advocacy group, each raid costs taxpayers around $17,000.\nThe four surviving federal medical marijuana patients still receiving U.S. government-grown schwag?"}
