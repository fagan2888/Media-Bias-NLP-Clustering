It's officially over for Nikki Reed and Paul McDonald. Reed, 26, filed for divorce this week after the couple announced their split in March.

TMZ reports that the actress filed papers, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for their breakup. This is the first marriage for both Reed and McDonald, 29.

The Twilight actress married McDonald in October 2011 in Malibu, Calif., just months after they first met. The stars were introduced at the premiere of Little Red Riding Hood in March of that year.

"We couldn't be happier!" Reed told Us at the time of her nuptials to the American Idol alum. "We're so glad this day has come!"

The pair revealed their decision to part ways two months ago, but seem to still be on good terms, as a rep for Reed told Us in March, "After much consideration, Nikki Reed and Paul McDonald are ending their marriage. They will continue to share their love of music, and are still working on their debut album, I'm Not Falling, releasing in 2014."

"They remain best friends and look forward to their continued journey together," the statement continued.

Earlier this month, Reed was spotted on a double date with rumored hookup Derek Hough, and his sister Julianne Hough and her boyfriend, Brooks Laich. A source told Us she and Derek were "making out like fiends" and "dancing up a storm." She has yet to comment on her new romance.
