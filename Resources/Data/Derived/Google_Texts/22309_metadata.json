Stewart called out Sebelius, who has been tasked with managing the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act, for allowing a one-year delay on the implementation of the employer mandate but not the individual one.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very openly left during the whole government shutdown, but I was very surprised at how hard he went after Kathleen Sebelius on Obamacare, specifically, and kept pressing her multiple times during the interview on why businesses can get a one year delay and individuals can\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t have a really good answer for him, \u201d Osterman told Koolidge.\n\nThe pair then talked about the massive problems the healthcare exchanges set up by Obamacare have faced since they opened on Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cSebelius admitted, as the \u2018understatement of the year,\u2019 that it started a little bit rockier than we\u2019d like,\u201d Osterman said. \u201cWhen you have months, years to prepare for this \u2013 this roll-out has been coming for quite some time \u2013 and you\u2019re supposedly having the best tech people in the country working on it, make sure it works properly because this is very important to a lot of Americans to be able to sign up for healthcare, and it\u2019s just a mess.\u201d\n\nOsterman also talked about about Texas Rep. Steve Stockman\u2019s State of the Union date, fake Obamacare enrollee Chad Henderson, and the impact that the government shutdown is having on Washington, D.C.\n\nListen to Kelsey on The Michael Koolidge Show here.
