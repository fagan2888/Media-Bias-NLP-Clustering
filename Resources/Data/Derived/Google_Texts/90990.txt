Colorado 67 has reopened from U.S. 24 to Cripple Creek after closing because of a hailstorm that moved through the area Sunday afternoon, according the Teller County Sheriffâ€™s Office.

The road was closed about 5 p.m. and reopened roughly two hours later.

A weather system that moved through the area dropped hail and rain in Teller and El Paso counties.
