Generally, he was written off as some kind-of evangelist that didn't know what he was talking about.\n\nDespite this, LaLanne was given the green light to host a show called The Jack LaLanne Show. To date, it's the longest-running exercise program and, according to his son Jon LaLanne, 53, it was key in saving a rich nation from poor health. \"Nobody was working out anymore,\" Jon told Medical Daily. \"In the 50s, people were smoking and drinking and work was so important, but they weren't moving their body.\"\n\nMoving around was the foundation of LaLanne's show. He would spend his 15-minutes of airtime encouraging his audience to get off their couch, even enlisting the help of home furniture, like a chair. After \"Anything is possible,\" LaLanne's favorite saying was, \"Fitness is king, nutrition is queen, and when you put them together, you get a kingdom.\"\n\nA huge component to LaLanne's nutrition ideals was juicing. Yep, LaLanne was also among the first to advocate the benefits of juicing raw fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet. He was doing as early as the 50s, creating a power juicer in the process.\n\nJack LaLanne's new-and-improved Fusion Juicer Justin Caba\n\nIt's this ahead-of-his-time philosophy that the documentary. LaLanne's wife, plus close friends Clint Eastwood, Lou Ferrigno and several celebrity trainers, get together to recall LaLanne's unmatched enthusiam for getting others fit and healthy, as well as take the audience around to the places LaLanne frequented. Each of his friends speaks to his lifelong achievements and how much of what we've come to know as the fitness industry today would not be possible without him.\n\nThe one aspect of his dad's life that Jon is particularly excited to see more of? His TV show. \"Most people don\u2019t know he was on TV for 35 years. He changed the mindset of the country \u2014 I saw it happen first hand,\" Jon said. \"I find, people think my father is a juicer guy, [but] he was so much more than that. He had the first exercise show on network television and to this day, they have a course in public schools that teacher\u2019s take for extra credit on the effects of exercise and brain function. I know this, because my friend\u2019s wife is a teacher and she had to take the course.\"\n\nJon's father was famous, sure, but to him and his sister Yvonne, LaLanne was just \"a dad who walked up and down the stairs on his hands at birthday parties.\" Which isn't to say he wasn't heavily influenced by his dad \u2014 he was. The thing he appreciated most was that his dad never forced anything on anyone (even after telling his son he didn't get enough exercise \"from that surfing crap\"). \"When it\u2019s forced, it\u2019s not sincere,\" Jon said. \"That person has to make that [lifestyle] choice. Then that choice will blossom into something that\u2019s very, very solid.\"\n\nLaLanne himself regularly switched up his routine, sometimes putting on handcuffs to break swimming records, but ultimately did everything in moderation. He told Jon he hated working out, but he knew it was good for him, physically and mentally, so he focused on the fact that the rewards outweigh the pain. \"It\u2019s not hard to change your life if you want to lose weight, you [just] have to make it your lifestyle,\" Jon said. \"Make something painful into fun, or at least try to. I started out knowing nothing, and it took a lot of pain and aggravation to learn the skills that I acquired. You don\u2019t learn if you don\u2019t make mistakes.\"\n\nLaLanne's documentary will be available to view online Wednesday, Oct. 8th, at www.fusionlifebrands.com/jacklalanne100.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "happy, 100th, birthday, jack, lalanne, anything, possible, new, documentary, will, commemorate", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "\"Anything Is Possible,\" is a new documentary that commemorates Jack LaLanne, the \"Godfather of Fitness.\"", "title": "This Fitness Documentary Will Inspire The Hell Out Of You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/happy-100th-birthday-jack-lalanne-anything-possible-new-documentary-will-commemorate-305272", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/elaine-lalanne.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Anything Is Possible,\" is a new documentary that commemorates Jack LaLanne, the \"Godfather of Fitness.\"", "title": "This Fitness Documentary Will Inspire The Hell Out Of You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/happy-100th-birthday-jack-lalanne-anything-possible-new-documentary-will-commemorate-305272", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/elaine-lalanne.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/elaine-lalanne.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-26T17:38:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-26T17:38:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"Anything Is Possible,\" is a new documentary that commemorates Jack LaLanne, the \"Godfather of Fitness.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb98\"", "article_summary": "After \"Anything is possible,\" LaLanne's favorite saying was, \"Fitness is king, nutrition is queen, and when you put them together, you get a kingdom.\"\nA huge component to LaLanne's nutrition ideals was juicing.\n\"Nobody was working out anymore,\" Jon told Medical Daily.\nTo date, it's the longest-running exercise program and, according to his son Jon LaLanne, 53, it was key in saving a rich nation from poor health.\n\u201cHe wanted to help people help themselves,\u201d Elaine LaLanne told the audience gathered inside the Tribeca Film Center for a special preview of the upcoming \u201cAnything Is Possible\u201d \u2014 the documentary that commemorates her late husband Jack LaLanne."}
