Officials estimate the tally reaches well over $1 million county-wide.\n\nTen to 12 inches of rain in one night wreaked havoc on Lincoln County roads and bridges. Part of this bridge north of Canton is in the creek, the other pieces were carried away by floodwaters.\n\n\"The bridge deck is gone. The brand new bridge deck is somewhere downstream and I don't know if we know where yet,\" Harold Timmerman said.\n\nOn more highly traveled roads like Highway 135, Lincoln County Emergency Management Director Harold Timmerman says traffic is down to one lane in spots.\n\n\"Half the road is gone. They're getting traffic through it if the traffic is careful,\" Timmerman said.\n\nTimmerman says with all the damage to roads like this one, it sets the county back two to three years when it comes to projects.\n\nMore than a dozen roads are closed because of flood damage. Timmerman says crews are everywhere in the county they can be. They're doing what they can to fix the problem, but it could take a while.\n\n\"Nobody's ever seen damage this extensive from any storm that we've had. Even some people that are 70-80 years old said they've never seen this much water,\" Timmerman said.\n\nWhile the county will be busy cleaning up the roadways, Canton residents who need help with flood cleanup are asked to call 211.\n\nView Lincoln County Road Closure map", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Lincoln County is assessing damage to area roads and bridges now that much of the flooding has gone down.
