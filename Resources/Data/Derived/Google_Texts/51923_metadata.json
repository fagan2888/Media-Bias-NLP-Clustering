Cochran\u2019s election to a seventh term in November now seems a foregone conclusion, and boy, are a lot of conservatives mad.\n\n\u201cThere is something a bit unusual about a Republican primary that\u2019s decided by liberal Democrats,\u201d McDaniel fumed on election night, slamming Cochran and the GOP establishment for \u201conce again reaching across the aisle [and] abandoning the conservative movement.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut whatever else the election outcome meant, Cochran\u2019s \u201creaching across the aisle\u201d made his victory a noteworthy instance of something that supposedly doesn\u2019t and can\u2019t happen in Mississippi even today: A white GOP politician sought support among Democrats, and particularly black Democrats. And far from being politically powerless, they tipped the election.\n\nUnder Mississippi\u2019s open-primary rules, anyone who hadn\u2019t already voted in the Democratic primary could vote in the Republican runoff. The Cochran camp openly solicited crossover support, as John Hayward wrote in Human Events, \u201cthrough a combination of race-baiting attacks on McDaniel, and touting his [Cochran\u2019s] ability to make government larger and bring home more goodies from Washington.\u201d National Review called it a \u201cTwo-Faced Victory\u201d: In majority-black neighborhoods, Cochran\u2019s ads and mailers played up his support for historically black colleges and food stamps. In predominantly white districts, other pamphlets highlighted his support for the National Rifle Association and his opposition to abortion and Obamacare.\n\nWhat especially outraged many conservatives was a flyer circulated in largely black precincts bearing the ominous heading \u201cThe Tea Party intends to prevent blacks from voting on Tuesday.\u201d It urged voters to re-elect Cochran in order to prevent a \u201creturn to the bygone era of intimidating black Mississippians from voting.\u201d No one is surprised when Democrats play the race card that way, Rush Limbaugh told his radio audience, but for the Republican establishment to do so was \u201creally reprehensible.\u201d\n\nIt was reprehensible. But really: Who over the age of 11 is surprised when incumbents resort to reprehensible tactics to beat back a challenger? Or when voting blocs and politicians who normally wouldn\u2019t give each other a second glance across a crowded room choose to snuggle up as bedfellows when mutual interests emerge? The NAACP\u2019s most recent civil rights \u201creport card\u201d gives Cochran an F, but that didn\u2019t stop black voters from turning out in force. \u201cWith Cochran, we know what we\u2019ve got, and we like what we\u2019ve got,\u201d the president of the NAACP\u2019s Jackson branch announced.\n\nSomehow all the voter intimidation that the Tea Party was accused of plotting never materialized. On the eve of the election, The New York Times fretted that McDaniel\u2019s campaign was bent on \u201cScaring Away Black Voters in Mississippi.\u201d But black voters weren\u2019t scared. There was no reason they should be. This isn\u2019t June 1964, when volunteers James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman were murdered by the Klan for trying to register black citizens to vote. It is June 2014, when at the faintest whiff of voting-rights discrimination a battalion of civil rights attorneys is ready to march into federal court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the Supreme Court last year struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, critics warned frantically that minority voting rights were in mortal peril. Congressman John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, said the court had \u201cput a dagger in the heart\u201d of what the civil rights movement had achieved. The ruling was \u201cas lamentable as Plessy or Dred Scott,\u201d wailed The Atlantic. From the hue and cry, you could have been forgiven for thinking that the court had pronounced Jim Crow-era literacy tests and poll taxes constitutional after all, and advised black voters to forget about ever flexing their electoral muscles again.\n\nWell, don\u2019t tell that to McDaniel. Cochran\u2019s appeal to black voters may not have been honorable. It certainly wasn\u2019t conservative. But it was indubitably effective: In the 24 Mississippi counties with black majorities, turnout soared by an average of 40 percent from the primary to the runoff. One of the most senior members of the state\u2019s Republican establishment just won the fight of his career. What turned the tide was the exercise by black citizens of their right to vote \u2014 a right that is no longer endangered anywhere in America, not even in Mississippi.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.81464040", "eomportal-id": 316282, "description": "Tea Party insurgent Chris McDaniel came tantalizingly close to knocking off Senator Thad Cochran in Mississippi\u2019s Republican primary runoff last week, but a surge in black voter turnout saved the six-term incumbent\u2019s bacon.
