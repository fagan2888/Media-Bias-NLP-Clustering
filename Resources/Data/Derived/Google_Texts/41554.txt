Hot Springs, SD

The oldest operating tourist attraction in western South Dakota's Black Hills is ready for business, under new owners.



Evans Plunge is a warm mineral water park in the town of Hot Springs. Last year residents approved a measure for the city to buy the park for $1.5 million.



The sale of the 125-year-old facility included the warm water pool, land, water rights and buildings.



A ribbon-cutting ceremony is scheduled for March 29. Children up to 12 will be able to swim all day for $2 each, and there will be guided tours, door prizes and refreshments.
