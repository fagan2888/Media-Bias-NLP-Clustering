In response to Schuylkill Center and the Five Star Rating: You’re obviously not in the health care field and long term care or you would know the state never announces their inspection. Perhaps if you kept your building in top-notch condition, you would not worry about when they walk into the building like we do.

This is for the person from Pottsville calling in about Schuylkill Center receiving advance notice of inspection from the state: I’d like to inform you that you’re totally wrong. You should get your facts straight and not from the local pub.

To the person who thinks we are children: We are adults. Obama has put us in debt every year he has been in office. Obama has had the IRS, NSA and VA scandal. He and Hillary did not send help when it was needed in Benghazi. Watch “Thirteen Hours” and you will learn about our government and our people. We are adults.

“Thirteen Hours” is a movie produced for entertainment, not for educational purposes.

FYI: Just because you are admitted to a hospital that’s in your network doesn’t mean the doctors that are employed at that hospital are also in network. It just happened to me recently. The doctors were not in network and were not covered. If you’re not going to be admitted to the hospital, you need to check that out if they’re putting you in for observation, your insurance may not cover that. That happened to me as well. You need to check these things out. Insurance is so screwed up since Obamacare, nobody knows what they’re doing. Just be sure to check. Make sure you’re admitted and not just in for observation. Make sure the doctors are also in network, not just the hospital.

We have great people in this area. Thank you to the person who found my lost key at Boscov’s. You are a sweetheart.
