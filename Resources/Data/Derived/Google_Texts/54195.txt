The much-anticipated federal trial over North Carolina’s ‘monster’ voting rights law gets underway today in Winston-Salem. As Policy Watch’s courts and law reporter Sharon McCloskey explains, opponents are seeking relief from what they say is the most restrictive law of its kind in the nation:

The gist of the case against the state is that the challenged provisions made voting harder for North Carolinians — “burdened” their fundamental right to vote — in violation of the 14th Amendment, and that those burdens fell disproportionately upon minority voters, giving them “less opportunity” to participate in the political process, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

The challengers ask the court to view the voting changes through a wide lens, taking into consideration the cumulative impact HB 589 has on all voters and the historical and social implications it has in particular for black voting opportunity in North Carolina.

With testimony from some of the nearly 100 voters, lawmakers and experts the challengers have identified as possible witnesses along with other evidence to be introduced at trial, they’ll argue that North Carolina voters in large numbers came to rely on measures like same-day registration and two weeks of early voting – which were intended to and did increase voter participation.

For example, over 90,000 voters relied on same-day registration in each of the presidential elections it was available, the challengers contend in their trial brief, and some 700,000 ballots were cast on the specific early voting days eliminated by the new law in each of those elections.

African-American voters in particular relied on those changes to expand their voting options — using same-day registration twice as much as white voters in three of the last six elections in which it was available, casting out-of-precinct provisional ballots twice as often as white voters, and using early voting at increasingly higher rates than white voters in recent general elections.

Scaling back voting options which increased black participation was not unintended, the challengers say, pointing to demographic voting date lawmakers requested when considering HB 589.

As the Justice Department argues in its trial brief:

The General Assembly adopted HB 589 in part for the racially discriminatory purpose of rolling back the gains black citizens had achieved under the State’s prior election laws. This intent forms a second basis for holding that HB 589 violates Section 2.
