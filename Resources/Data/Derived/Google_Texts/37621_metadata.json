Thomas Massie, R-Garrison (Photo: AP/File)\n\nTwo months after first being elected to Congress, Thomas Massie made it clear he didn\u2019t want John Boehner as Speaker of the House.\n\nIn Jan. 2013 and also this January, he voted against re-electing the Republican from West Chester as speaker.\n\nMassie, R-Garrison, still hasn\u2019t warmed to Boehner\u2019s leadership.\n\nThe congressman who represents Northern Kentucky\u2019s Fourth Congressional District is one of three who have signed on to a resolution to boot Boehner from the speaker\u2019s chair. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., introduced the resolution \u2013 seen as largely symbolic by many political experts \u2013 that would force a new election by the entire House to pick a speaker.\n\nSome Republicans, particularly those who identify with the tea party like Massie, have felt Boehner hasn\u2019t stayed true to Republican principals. The resolution lists eight reasons why they want another leader of the House. It accuses Boehner of punishing members for votes he doesn\u2019t like and causing the \u201cpower of Congress to atrophy.\u201d\n\nBoehner should have allowed debate on topics, such as President Barack Obama getting involved in the conflicts in the Middle East, Massie said.\n\n\u201cEvery time he\u2019s chosen not to act and let the president act, the power of the House atrophies,\u201d Massie said. \u201cWe should be debating the declaration of war and use of force.\u201d\n\nBoehner has shrugged his shoulders at the coup efforts, telling the Associated Press it\u2019s \u201cno big deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got broad support amongst my colleagues,\u201d he said at a recent press conference.\n\nDoes Massie\u2019s opposition hurt his ability to get anything done in Congress and hurt Northern Kentucky\u2019s clout? Massie said he finds the question laughable.\n\n\u201cI find it laughable the notion that you come to Congress and hand your voting card to leadership so you can get something done for your constituents,\u201d Massie said. \u201cWhat you could get done is get your name on a bill lobbyists have passed just so you can go back home and say you could get a bill passed.\u201d\n\nMassie said his opposition might mean leadership might take his name off some bills to deny him credit. But he doesn\u2019t think it will stop him from getting things done. He said his bill to audit the Federal Reserve will likely get passed, just in a bill with someone else\u2019s name on it.\n\nMassie also suspects Boehner has dried up his campaign funds in Washington. Massie has one of the lowest campaign fundraising totals this year, raising $40,000 January through June. Only five other incumbent House members have raised less, two of which are non-voting delegates from Guam and American Samoa. But Massie said he doesn\u2019t rely on Washington money.\n\nMassie thinks this is what people in the Fourth Congressional District elected him to do. Some Republican leaders in Northern Kentucky agree.\n\nMany Republicans in Northern Kentucky would like to see Boehner fight harder to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and reform immigration policies, said Brett Gaspard, chairman of the Boone County Republicans.\n\n\u201cI think conservatives need to find ways to put pressure on Speaker Boehner to advance our causes,\u201d Gaspard said. \u201cTo that end, this might be the best option to accomplish that goal.\u201d\n\nMany political experts don\u2019t give the resolution much of a chance of succeeding.\n\nBut Massie thinks there\u2019s a chance. They have until the next Congress convenes in 17 months to get the votes. But even if it doesn\u2019t succeed, he hopes it puts pressure on Republican leadership to have more debate and to stop intimidation.\n\n\u201cIf our leadership will betray Republican principles and betray an orderly and inclusive process, you will see more and more members joining,\u201d Massie said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1IcYOyY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The congressman who represents Northern Kentucky\u2019s Fourth Congressional District is one of three who have signed on to a resolution to boot Boehner from the speaker\u2019s chair.", "p": {"domain_verify": "8c50ff021dfc409ea7325f425f178799"}, "og": {"site_name": "Cincinnati.com", "description": "The congressman who represents Northern Kentucky\u2019s Fourth Congressional District is one of three who have signed on to a resolution to boot Boehner from the speaker\u2019s chair.", "title": "NKY\u2019s Massie leading the charge to oust Boehner", "url": "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2015/08/01/nkys-massie-leading-charge-oust-boehner/31009769/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/cincinnati.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The congressman who represents Northern Kentucky\u2019s Fourth Congressional District is one of three who have signed on to a resolution to boot Boehner from the speaker\u2019s chair.", "title": "NKY\u2019s Massie leading the charge to oust Boehner", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Cincinnati/B9318289353Z.1_20150801222821_000_GLBBGK29F.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@enquirer", "site": "@enquirer", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600019252", "fb": {"app_id": 157995810912644}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/John Boehner", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Persons/John Boehner", "title": "NKY\u2019s Massie leading the charge to oust Boehner", "author": "Scott Wartman", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7e972509815038099be0de9d968053e0017d60c8/c=116-0-417-401/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Cincinnati/B9318289353Z.1_20150801222821_000_GLBBGK29F.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46d729d8f3d768b717d4a020d4552b4eef49b4a8/c=66-0-467-401/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Cincinnati/B9318289353Z.1_20150801222821_000_GLBBGK29F.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4d8d36144bd2e13bc60f90ebcfb1ac87a90627f9/c=0-0-534-400/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Cincinnati/B9318289353Z.1_20150801222821_000_GLBBGK29F.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f880bad1e08da3dac20a53ff02ab53c3f837f2d0/c=0-50-534-350&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Cincinnati/B9318289353Z.1_20150801222821_000_GLBBGK29F.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-01T22:28:21-04:00", "shorthed": "NKY\u2019s Massie out front to oust Boehner", "articleid": 31009769, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eec6fd4cafba6c9b20fad3b0475b2dc4dc63a0e1/c=0-50-534-350/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Cincinnati/B9318289353Z.1_20150801222821_000_GLBBGK29F.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70f689c316271227bf89628d0e373ea257e6d4c8/c=154-0-380-401/local/-/media/2015/08/01/Cincinnati/B9318289353Z.1_20150801222821_000_GLBBGK29F.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Some Republicans, particularly those who identify with the tea party like Massie, have felt Boehner hasn\u2019t stayed true to Republican principals.\nU.S. Rep.
