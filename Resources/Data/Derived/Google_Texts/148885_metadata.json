And one bishop would rather pay fines, no matter how much they might be.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops today issued a \u201cSpecial Message\u201d at the conclusion of their fall General Assembly, November 13, in Baltimore. They unanimously passed the special message, which can only be issued as such meetings and strongly condemned the HHS mandate.\n\nThey said that, with its \u201ccoercive mandate,\u201d the Obama administration \u201cis refusing to uphold its obligation to respect the rights of religious believers.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeginning in March 2012, in United for Religious Freedom, we identified three basic problems with the HHS mandate: it establishes a false architecture of religious liberty that excludes our ministries and so reduces freedom of religion to freedom of worship; it compels our ministries to participate in providing employees with abortifacient drugs and devices, sterilization, and contraception, which violates our deeply-held beliefs; and it compels our faithful people in business to act against our teachings, failing to provide them any exemption at all,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cDespite our repeated efforts to work and dialogue toward a solution, those problems remain. Not only does the mandate undermine our ministries\u2019 ability to witness to our faith, which is their core mission, but the penalties it imposes also lay a great burden on those ministries, threatening their very ability to survive and to serve the many who rely on their care,\u201d the bishops added.\n\nThey continued: \u201cThe current impasse is all the more frustrating because the Catholic Church has long been a leading provider of, and advocate for, accessible, life-affirming health care. We would have preferred to spend these recent past years working toward this shared goal instead of resisting this intrusion into our religious liberty. We have been forced to devote time and resources to a conflict we did not start nor seek.\u201d\n\nUltimately, they promised to resist the mandate if it is not corrected or rescinded.\n\n\u201cAs the government\u2019s implementation of the mandate against us approaches, we bishops stand united in our resolve to resist this heavy burden and protect our religious freedom,\u201d they said. \u201cWe will continue our efforts in Congress and especially with the promising initiatives in the courts to protect the religious freedom that ensures our ability to fulfill the Gospel by serving the common good.\u201d\n\nWhat would that resistance look like?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Catholic Bishops: We Will Not Comply With the HHS Abortion Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The nation's Catholic bishops have a message for President Barack Obama: They will not comply with the HHS mandate that compels groups to pay for birth control", "title": "Catholic Bishops: We Will Not Comply With the HHS Abortion Mandate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/11/13/catholic-bishops-we-will-not-comply-with-the-hhs-abortion-mandate/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/pichealth16-190x129.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "catholic,bishops,comply,hhs,mandate,abortion", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The nation\u2019s Catholic bishops have a message for President Barack Obama: They will not comply with the HHS mandate that compels groups to pay for birth control and drugs that may cause abortions.\nThey unanimously passed the special message, which can only be issued as such meetings and strongly condemned the HHS mandate.\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops today issued a \u201cSpecial Message\u201d at the conclusion of their fall General Assembly, November 13, in Baltimore.\n\u201cAs the government\u2019s implementation of the mandate against us approaches, we bishops stand united in our resolve to resist this heavy burden and protect our religious freedom,\u201d they said.\nThey continued: \u201cThe current impasse is all the more frustrating because the Catholic Church has long been a leading provider of, and advocate for, accessible, life-affirming health care."}
