In addition to the vast information required for public release, the new rules also extend permit requirements, creating additional costs for potential frackers.\n\nOil companies must notify neighbors of fracking sites and provide them with permits. After notification, the nearby property owners can subsequently request for a contractor to come test the water. The company doing the drilling must pay for that cost.\n\nThe regulations were adopted as the state\u2019s Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources released a report concluding fracking \u201ccould, in a worst-case scenario, \u2018generate greenhouse gas emissions that may have a significant impact on the environment,\u2019\u201d according to the LA Times. The Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources is the agency in charge of enforcing the fracking regulations.\n\n\u201cIt is concluded that the public remains severely divided on the subject of whether well stimulation treatments should be entirely prohibited at a statewide level, or if they should remain legal practices,\u201d the report added.\n\nDespite the regulations standing as the strictest in the U.S., environmental groups claim the state needs to go further.\n\nThe Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental organization, released a statement Wednesday criticizing Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown for implementing the regulations prior to the release of a California study evaluating fracking risks.\n\n\u201cGov. Brown has recklessly given fracking the thumbs up before scientists can finish studying this toxic technique,\u201d Hollin Kretzmann said in the statement. \u201cBy refusing to ban dangerous oil extraction or even wait for scientists to finish evaluating the risks in our state, the governor is putting the people of California in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nBrown has clashed with environmental organizations before, refusing pushes for a statewide fracking ban, claiming natural gas produces lower carbon emissions than alternative energy sources while touting fracking\u2019s economic benefits, according to The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California implemented new hydraulic fracturing regulations Wednesday, making the state home to perhaps the strictest fracking rules in the nation.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "California implemented new hydraulic fracturing regulations Wednesday, making the state home to perhaps the strictest fracking rules in the nation.", "title": "California Implements Strictest Fracking Regulations In U.S.", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150702_CAFracking_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-02T17:51:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IwfGT1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "California implemented new hydraulic fracturing regulations Wednesday, making the state home to perhaps the strictest fracking rules in the nation.", "title": "California Implements Strictest Fracking Regulations In U.S.", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150702_CAFracking_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "domestic production", "published_time": "2015-07-02T15:42:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T17:51:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jerry Brown, fracking, hydraulic fracturing, DOGGR, California"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafe7\"", "article_summary": "California implemented new hydraulic fracturing regulations Wednesday, making the state home to perhaps the strictest fracking rules in the nation.\nThe Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources is the agency in charge of enforcing the fracking regulations.\nJerry Brown for implementing the regulations prior to the release of a California study evaluating fracking risks.\nDespite the regulations standing as the strictest in the U.S., environmental groups claim the state needs to go further.\nThe regulations force increased transparency and accountability through expanded monitoring and reporting of air and water quality, public disclosure of chemicals used in fracking procedures, and estimates of the environmental impact fracking activities may cause."}
