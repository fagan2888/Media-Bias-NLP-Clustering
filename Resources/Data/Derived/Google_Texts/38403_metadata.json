But former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown\u2019s U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire hasn\u2019t exactly been the smoothest of rides.\n\nA series of uncharacteristic missteps have hampered Brown. They started before he jumped into the race this spring, making him appear unfocused. Bumbles like this in December, when he was asked what New Hampshire Republicans were telling him about running.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard from the Republicans up here is they\u2019re thankful that I\u2019ve been around for a year helping them raise money, raise awareness as to the issues that are affecting not only people here in Massachu\u2026 uh, in New Hampshire, but also in Massachusetts obviously.\u201d\n\nThe gaffes have some wondering if the Republican U.S. Senate Primary in New Hampshire, now less than a month away, is more competitive than it might appear.\n\nPollster Andy Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, believes Brown will beat out his primary challengers \u2014 state Sen. Jim Rubens and former Sen. Bob Smith. But he suggests the contest could be closer than many in the Brown camp care to admit.\n\nMost polls \u2014 and they are almost two months old now \u2014 show Brown way ahead by 30 points, but with 40 percent of GOP voters still undecided.\n\nAnd the Mayday political action committee \u2014 a super PAC run by Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig \u2014 recently said it was getting behind Sen. Rubens with $2 million in media buys on his behalf.\n\n\u201c[Rubens is] running more as kind of a Libertarian, so he can tap into some of that Libertarian, Tea Party energy in the Republican party,\u201d Andy Smith said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he\u2019s got a strong chance of winning, but I wouldn\u2019t say that Brown has this in the bag yet for the primary.\u201d\n\nBrown has at times tried to ignore his challengers. For example, after speaking at a New Hampshire Farm Bureau picnic last week he left while the other candidates stayed to field questions from voters.\n\nBrown has instead focused on the popular Democratic incumbent in the race, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen \u2014 trying to convince voters, especially reluctant Republicans, that he\u2019s the most likely to beat Shaheen in the general election.\n\n\u201cSen. Shaheen has voted with the president over 99 percent of the time on these very important issues, those failed policies,\u201d Brown said at a recent town hall event in Salem, New Hampshire, hammering Shaheen\u2019s voting record and her support of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThe president\u2019s not up for re-election right now, but guess what? His number one supporter is.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re questioning and complaining,\u201d he added, \u201cwell the best way to do that is to allow me to go down there to be that check and balance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy getting traction with some voters, like Jim Boyd and a woman who would only identify herself as Patricia, who spoke to us at Avellino\u2019s Deli, in the bell-weather town of Stratham.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the stuff that Obama is for is totally what I\u2019m against,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my full of the politicians that we have, so Scott will be a new face and a new look at things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like what he did in Massachusetts,\u201d Patricia added. \u201cI think he\u2019s honest. He follows through on what he says he\u2019s going to do and he\u2019s got vision and he\u2019s out there with the people. I would give him a chance. Why not?\u201d\n\nBut analysts think Brown still needs to galvanize the GOP base. Even one of Brown\u2019s most prominent New Hampshire Republican supporters, former House Speaker Doug Scamman, isn\u2019t ready to drop the victory balloons yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2013 James Pindell, political director at WMUR-TV in Manchester Scott Brown\u2019s greatest asset and his biggest problem is the idea of Scott Brown. Why is he running? And he\u2019s got to answer that question.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s ahead, yes,\u201d Scamman said. \u201cAnd I think he will win, but you never know until the votes are counted.\u201d\n\nJames Pindell, political director at WMUR-TV in Manchester, says Republicans are Brown\u2019s biggest problem \u2014 especially gun owners who are still smarting over Brown\u2019s support of a federal assault weapons ban after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\n\nThe president of the group Gun Owners of New Hampshire has said he\u2019s not a fan of Brown\u2019s record, and pointed out Brown declined to sign a pledge on how he\u2019d vote on gun issues.\n\nStill, Pindell thinks the skeptics will warm up to Brown, that he will win the primary and will make the race with Shaheen competitive.\n\n\u201cOnce Scott Brown gets through the Republican primary and they begin to consolidate behind him, we\u2019re going to see this automatically become a single digit race,\u201d Pindell said.\n\nBut that\u2019s not where Brown is now.\n\nMost polls this summer, including a WMUR and University of New Hampshire survey, show Brown behind Shaheen by an average of 10 points. Which leads Pindell to conclude that Brown still has a major question to answer.\n\n\u201cScott Brown\u2019s greatest asset and his biggest problem is the idea of Scott Brown. Why is he running? And he\u2019s got to answer that question,\u201d Pindell said. \u201cIf he\u2019s running because he thinks New Hampshire needs a centrist, then OK. If he wants to run to represent New Hampshire because he thinks he can be the best senator, then OK. But if Democrats are going to be able convince people that he\u2019s running because this is an ego trip, that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d\n\nWith control of the U.S. Senate possibly at stake, Pindell and UNH pollster Andy Smith both predict it\u2019ll be one of the most closely watched races in the country, and the most expensive in New Hampshire history.\n\nRelated Coverage:", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "For some, he is Mr. Charisma \u2014 smooth on the campaign hustings.
