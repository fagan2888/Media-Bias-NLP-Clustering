She will be greatly missed,\u201d Denver Zoo President/CEO Shannon Block said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nKimbo was believed to have been born in Thailand in March 1970. She was sent to the Caldwell Zoo in Tyler, Texas, before coming to the Denver Zoo in December 2012, the news release says. She was \u201ca shy girl\u201d and was recognized by the freckles on her trunk.\n\nKimbo was the first new female elephant to move from another zoo into Toyota Elephant Passage.\n\nKimbo had a difficult spell in late September, often displaying abdominal discomfort, a news release says.\n\nThen within the last week, Kimbo\u2019s appetite began to diminish, and over the past two days she has refused both food and water.\n\n\u201cDecisions like these are always very difficult and they are not ones we take lightly. Unfortunately, additional diagnostic tests and treatment would require more invasive measures and would not likely resolve her advanced issues,\u201d said Brian Aucone, senior vice president for animal care and conservation.\n\nThe average life expectancy for female Asian elephants in zoos is 46.9 years old. Denver Zoo still has four other Asian elephants, female Dolly and males Groucho, Bodhi and Billy.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver zoo elephant \u2018Kimbo\u2019 dies after refusing to eat and drink", "title": "Denver zoo elephant \u2018Kimbo\u2019 dies after refusing to eat and drink", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/11/denver-zoo-elephant-kimbo-dies-after-refusing-to-eat-and-drink/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141011__kimbop1.jpg", "height": 417}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141011__kimbop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-11T10:40:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T17:03:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd04e\"", "article_summary": "A beloved female Asian elephant was euthanized Friday night after it had stopped eating and drinking for two days, Denver Zoo officials say.\nDenver Zoo still has four other Asian elephants, female Dolly and males Groucho, Bodhi and Billy.\n\u201cHaving lost her quality of life, Kimbo was humanely euthanized\u2026\u201dThe news release said that Kimbo had a sweet disposition.\nShe will be greatly missed,\u201d Denver Zoo President/CEO Shannon Block said in a statement on Saturday.\nKimbo was the first new female elephant to move from another zoo into Toyota Elephant Passage."}
