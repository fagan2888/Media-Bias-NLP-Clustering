Another Republican running for president, Senator Ted Cruz, called the new net neutrality rules \u201cObamacare for the internet,\u201d even though he was pretty far off.\n\nNow, presidential politics has turned an argument over market structure between competing business interests\u2014reductively, those that build and maintain the internet\u2019s physical infrastructure, and those that make the software that runs on that infrastructure\u2014into a fight between the political parties, with Democrats backing the net neutrality rules.\n\nAnd, for Bush, it\u2019s not just net neutrality that gets his goat. He also opposes, among others, rules put in place after the financial crisis to prevent consumers from being ripped off by banks and stop those banks from gambling with federally-insured money; efforts that limit fracking on federal lands; and rules that require industrial farms to consult the EPA before spraying pesticides.\n\nAll these rules have costs and benefits that should be debated, and there\u2019s no doubt some may be failures and worth removing\u2014the Obama administration itself launched initiatives to cut unneeded red tape.\n\nBut when Jeb Bush argues that all of Obama\u2019s rules \u201ccost\u201d Americans $1.9 trillion a year, it\u2019s worth remembering that the number under his brother\u2019s administration was $1.75 trillion\u2014and that the oft-questioned estimate (pdf) he relies on doesn\u2019t even attempt to take into account any of the benefits of regulation.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget\u2019s latest estimate (pdf) of the net benefit of regulations passed during the Obama administration is $200 billion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor contending for the Republican presidential nomination, says he'd repeal a raft of government rules on taking office.
