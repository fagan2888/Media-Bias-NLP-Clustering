Many folks came out to Greenway Park near Raider Drive in Cleveland on Saturday for a spring art show organized by the Greenway Public Arts Commission and the Allied Arts Council.

Artists of all ages took part in Chalk The Walk, creating a ribbon of art with chalk along the greenway. There was music and storytelling on the park stage by entertainers of all ages. The show culminated with Benton Blount, a finalist in season ten of America's Got Talent.
