Since she had a heart transplant several years ago, she's on the gold plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with what they pay, I\u2019m not happy with what they\u2019re charging,\u201d Crisp said.\n\nShe pays a premium of $425 a month with $100 government subsidy, but now that premium could be going up dramatically.\n\n\u201cI was in shock, I couldn\u2019t believe they were going to increase it that much,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Healthcare.gov, rate increases with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma range from 10 to nearly 44 percent.\n\nOklahoma Deputy Insurance Commissioner Mike Rhoads said the same thing is happening across the country and with other carriers here in Oklahoma. Other carriers may not be proposing as drastic of hikes since they don\u2019t have as big of market share.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, the carriers, everybody that\u2019s participating in the marketplace, are seeing what the actual experience, the actual claims cost experience is for all the new enrollees they picked up in 2015,\u201d Rhoads said.\n\nRhoads said at least one Oklahoma carrier has filed notice they will no longer participate in the Affordable Care Act, and others are still deciding.\n\nThe U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services said federal subsidies would soften the impact of any rate increases, or customers could try to find less expensive plans.\n\nBut Crisp said with her condition, less coverage isn't an option, and she's running out of them.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I\u2019m on a fixed budget right now,\u201d she said.\n\nRhoads said the Oklahoma Insurance Commission doesn't have to approve any rate increases with individual plans. The federal government does.\n\nA spokesperson from Blue Cross Blue Shield said the company's administrative costs have decreased, and last year, they were under the premium-to-claim cost ratio mandated by the federal government.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Big price hikes are likely coming for Oklahomans who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
