Researchers examined the data of 145,193 Swedish brothers enlisted in the Swedish National Services for mandatory military service between 1984 and 1997, and found that the trend was visible primarily in obese teenagers who grew up to earn less \u2014 but not necessarily in normal weight teenagers who gained large amounts of weight as they got older. Previous research only showed this wage trend affected obese women.\n\nThe authors compared the loss of money among Swedish obese teenagers to that of people who shaved three years of school off their education. \u201cTo put this figure in perspective, the estimated return to an additional year of schooling in Sweden is about six percent,\u201d the authors said. \u201cThe obesity penalty thus corresponds to almost three years of schooling, which is equivalent to a university bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201d\n\nThe researchers also discovered a parallel trend among young men in the U.S. and the U.K., showing that it appears to be specific to males who were overweight teenagers. Their theory is that obese adolescents may be more likely to suffer self-esteem problems and discrimination by peers and teachers, knocking down their levels of cognitive and non-cognitive skills (meaning memory, attention, logic \u2014 and motivation, self-confidence, and persistence, respectively). Of course, this is quite a general statement \u2014 more research will need to be done to understand why men who were obese as teenagers on the whole get paid less than their normal weight peers.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) state that obesity among children in the U.S. has doubled in the past 30 years, and quadrupled for adolescents.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that the rapid increase in childhood and adolescent obesity could have long-lasting effects on the economic growth and productivity of nations,\u201d lead author Paul Nystedt of J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden said in the press release. \u201cWe believe that the rationale for government intervention for these age groups is strong because children and adolescents are arguably less able to take future consequences of their actions into account.\u201d\n\nThe trend the study is examining isn\u2019t exactly a new notion \u2014 it\u2019s been referred to as the obesity wage penalty. Studies have shown that obese women experienced the most discrimination when it came to lower salaries due to their weight. \u201cVarious studies have shown that overweight people are seen as less conscientious, less agreeable, less emotionally stable, less productive, lazy, lacking in self-discipline, and even dishonest, sloppy, ugly, socially unattractive, and sexually unskilled; the list goes on and on,\u201d Freek Vermeulen writes on Forbes, ultimately contributing to a drop in salary.\n\nBut is this stereotype truly backed up by solid evidence? Some studies have shown that obese and hypertensive men performed worse on cognitive performance tests, and research at NYU Langone Medical Center found that obese children performed more poorly on memory and spelling tasks. \u201cTheir brains are not firing on all pistons,\u201d Dr. Antonio Convit, professor of psychiatry and medicine and director of the BODyLab, said in a press release. \u201cThe more overweight that youth are, the more they experience the medical consequences of obesity, and the greater the difficulties they have in all these areas of cognitive functioning.\u201d Whether this is a consequence caused by physical or biological reasons \u2014 or if it\u2019s a matter of psychological and emotional problems created by obesity stigma \u2014 is still being examined.\n\nThe Swedish study is the first, however, to identify the pattern in men. \u201cThese results reinforce the importance of policy combating early-life obesity in order to reduce healthcare expenditures as well as poverty and inequalities later in life,\u201d the authors write in the abstract.\n\nSource: Lundborg P, Nystedt P, Rooth D. \u201cBody Size, Skills, and Income: Evidence From 150,000 Teenage Siblings.\u201d Demography, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obesity stigma, obesity, obesity wage penalty", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers found that men who had been obese teenagers were paid 18 percent less than those who had been normal weight teens.", "title": "Obesity Doesn\u2019t Pay: Fat Teens Grow Up To Get Paid 18% Less Than Peers", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obesity-doesnt-pay-overweight-teens-could-grow-get-paid-18-less-normal-weight-peers-304618", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/obese-teen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers found that men who had been obese teenagers were paid 18 percent less than those who had been normal weight teens.", "title": "Obesity Doesn\u2019t Pay: Fat Teens Grow Up To Get Paid 18% Less Than Peers", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/obesity-doesnt-pay-overweight-teens-could-grow-get-paid-18-less-normal-weight-peers-304618", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/obese-teen.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/obese-teen.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-23T18:44:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-23T18:55:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers found that men who had been obese teenagers were paid 18 percent less than those who had been normal weight teens."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4d2\"", "article_summary": "The authors compared the loss of money among Swedish obese teenagers to that of people who shaved three years of school off their education.\nAccording to a new study published in the journal Demography, obese teenage men earn up to 18 percent less than normal weight peers.\nStudies have shown that obese women experienced the most discrimination when it came to lower salaries due to their weight.\nStudies have shown that obese women suffer from discrimination in the workplace, particularly when it comes to making money; they are paid less than thin women.\nOf course, this is quite a general statement \u2014 more research will need to be done to understand why men who were obese as teenagers on the whole get paid less than their normal weight peers."}
