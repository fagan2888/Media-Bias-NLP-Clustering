The fatal shootings of Klarkowski, Richard Lewin and Raleigh Butler stemmed from a botched marijuana deal, police said. ( Associated Press )\n\nTodd Klarkowski (Associated Press)\n\nIt has been more than 1,000 days since Boulder resident Todd Klarkowski was gunned down at a home in Sonoma County, Calif., along with two other men in what prosecutors called a marijuana deal gone awry.\n\nBeginning Monday, the alleged triggerman, Mark Cappello of Central City, is finally expected to stand trial.\n\nSonoma County Superior Court Judge Robert LaForge will preside over a trial that could last two to three months, according to Joe Stogner, the Santa Rosa, Calif., lawyer who is court-appointed to defend Cappello.\n\nOn Dec. 22, a hearing was held on a defense motion to dismiss all charges against Cappello, based on the alleged insufficiency of the evidence presented at Cappello's preliminary hearing \u2014 which occurred more than two years ago.\n\nMark Cappello (Associated Press)\n\nThat motion failed, which did not surprise Stogner.\n\n\"The motion was denied, which, in the vast majority of cases, it is,\" Stogner said. \"That motion was denied because of the low standard of proof at preliminary hearings. But we expect it to be a different scenario in front of a jury, when the standard of proof is higher.\"\n\nStogner is not the first lawyer to represent Cappello, 49, who had been a well-known figure in Central City. He held a seat on the town's Historic Preservation Commission, to which he'd been appointed in December 2010.\n\nThe Sonoma County District Attorney's Office originally had declared it would seek the death penalty against Cappello, which prompted his original attorney, San Francisco-based lawyer Michael Meehan, to withdraw in July 2014 over his lack of experience in handling such cases.\n\nStogner was then appointed by a judge to replace Meehan, and he remains on the case despite the fact that prosecutors announced Oct. 16 that they are no longer seeking the death penalty.\n\nSonoma County Chief Deputy District Attorney Spencer Brady, the lead prosecutor on the case, said in a recent interview that the death penalty reversal came after conversations with family members of the victims, and a presentation of mitigating factors, which the defense made at the invitation of the prosecutors in a meeting at the district attorney's office, which is a routine practice in California.\n\nThe decision to no longer pursue the death penalty, Brady said, \"is consistent with the wishes of some family members, but not all.\"\n\nVictims' family members did not respond to the Camera's request for comment on the case.\n\nBrady acknowledged a resolution to the legal saga has been long in coming.\n\n\"This has been a lengthy process, but is it not unusual for a case of this complexity and magnitude,\" Brady said. \"The defense attorney was changed halfway through the process, and the new attorney had to start over, and that's the main factor\" for the delay.\n\nKey witness' credibility challenged\n\nStogner said Cappello is innocent of the charges against him, which includes three counts of first-degree murder.\n\nThose murder counts are charged with special circumstances \u2014 lying in wait, murder for financial gain, murder during the course of a robbery and murder of multiple victims.\n\nIf any one of those is proven, Brady said, Cappello would be sentenced to 75 years-to-life, and would serve \"every day of those 75 years.\"\n\nFrancis Dwyer (Associated Press)\n\nBut Stogner sounded confident about the outcome for his client, who remains held without bond at the Sonoma County Jail.\n\n\"We expect there to be literally no competent evidence presented, no reliable evidence presented, that he was in the residence where the shootings occurred, at the time of the shootings themselves,\" Stogner said in a recent interview.\n\n\"The prosecution is relying almost exclusively on the testimony of an accomplice, the same individual who ended up with a lot of the marijuana from the transaction and disposed of the alleged murder weapon,\" he added.\n\nOdin Dwyer (Associated Press)\n\nKlarkowski, 43, was shot and killed execution style Feb. 5, 2013, along with 46-year-old Richard Lewin, of Huntington, N.Y., and Raleigh Butler, 24, of Sebastopol, Calif. The three were slain in a bedroom of the home of Butler's mother in Forestville, a small Sonoma County community.\n\nThe prosecution has alleged that Klarkowski and Lewin had planned to buy 100 pounds of marijuana from Butler. Klarkowski, who knew Cappello, had contacted Cappello about driving the contraband to the East Coast, according to investigators.\n\nCappello, it is alleged, hired Francis Raymond Dwyer, 68, and his 40-year-old son Odin Leonard Dwyer, of Black Hawk, to assist him.\n\nIn an October 2013 preliminary hearing, a detective said that Odin Dwyer told investigators that Cappello used a .45-caliber automatic pistol to kill Klarkowski, Lewis and Butler as they sat on Butler's mother's bedroom floor, packaging the marijuana for transport to New York.\n\nOdin Dwyer had told police that tension had developed between Cappello and the victims over $275,000 that Cappello was supposed to bring to the meeting, but didn't.\n\nOdin Dwyer claimed that he was in the kitchen of the house when the shots were fired, and that he had seen Cappello standing with his arm extended, holding the gun, the victims sprawled on the floor, according to testimony from a detective at the preliminary hearing.\n\nThe detective said that according to Odin Dwyer's account to investigators, Cappello then spoke to Odin Dwyer, saying, \"It had to be done.\"\n\nTrial not expected to move at quick pace\n\nOdin Dwyer and his father, Francis Dwyer, pleaded no contest in May to numerous felonies, including involuntary manslaughter and accessory, respectively, and agreed to testify truthfully at Cappello's trial.\n\nBoth men, like Cappello, originally had been charged with three counts of murder.\n\nFrancis Dwyer was alleged to have waited at a nearby motel when the pot-deal-turned-triple-slaying occurred. He was arrested a few weeks later at his home in Truth or Consequences, N.M.\n\nOdin Dwyer -\u2014 who had briefly been a line cook at the Lazy Dog restaurant on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall \u2014 was arrested in Adams County about the same time as his father.\n\nAbout 60 pounds of marijuana traced to the crime ultimately were recovered from a storage locker that police said Odin Dwyer had leased in Westminster.\n\nStogner, Cappello's lawyer, made clear that he believes Odin Dwyer will present major credibility issues as a key state witness against his client and has not been truthful about his role in the crimes.\n\n\"We have doubts that are very, very serious about whether the case can be proven, and specifically, about whether Mark Cappello was even present when the shootings occurred,\" Stogner said.\n\nEven with the trial now scheduled to start Monday, there is little hope for a quick resolution to a case that has lingered painfully for the victims' families for close to three years.\n\n\"We think it's going to start slow, because there are many more motions that have to be litigated. That, plus jury selection, could take the better part of January,\" Stogner said. \"We expect to begin (testimony) in late January or possibly early February.\"\n\nCharlie Brennan: 303-473-1327, brennanc@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/chasbrennan", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29333947/todd-klarkowski-murder-california-pot-deal", "sailthru.author": "By Charlie Brennan \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:29333947:view"}, "startDate": "2016-01-02T11:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "It has been more than 1,000 days since Boulder resident Todd Klarkowski was gunned down at a home in Sonoma County, Calif., along with two other men in what prosecutors called a marijuana deal gone awry.", "title": "Calif. triple slaying that claimed Boulder man's life in '13 nearing trial", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29333947/todd-klarkowski-murder-california-pot-deal", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0101/20160101__04DCAKLAw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2016-01-03T22:46:39-0700", "endDate": "2026-01-01T13:49:51-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Charlie BrennanStaff", "pubDate": "2016-01-01T13:56:23-0700", "sailthru.date": "2016-01-02T11:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "Calif. triple slaying that claimed Boulder man's life in '13 nearing trial", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0101/20160101__04DCAKLAw~1_300.jpg", "description": "It has been more than 1,000 days since Boulder resident Todd Klarkowski was gunned down at a home in Sonoma County, Calif., along with two other men in what prosecutors called a marijuana deal gone awry.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_29333947/todd-klarkowski-murder-california-pot-deal", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "It has been more than 1,000 days since Boulder resident Todd Klarkowski was gunned down at a home in Sonoma County, Calif., along with two other men in what prosecutors called a marijuana deal gone awry.", "title": "Calif. triple slaying that claimed Boulder man's life in '13 nearing trial"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2016/0101/20160101__04DCAKLAw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "The three were slain in a bedroom of the home of Butler's mother in Forestville, a small Sonoma County community.\nOdin Dwyer (Associated Press)Klarkowski, 43, was shot and killed execution style Feb. 5, 2013, along with 46-year-old Richard Lewin, of Huntington, N.Y., and Raleigh Butler, 24, of Sebastopol, Calif.\nThe detective said that according to Odin Dwyer's account to investigators, Cappello then spoke to Odin Dwyer, saying, \"It had to be done.\"\nFrancis Dwyer (Associated Press)But Stogner sounded confident about the outcome for his client, who remains held without bond at the Sonoma County Jail.\nAbout 60 pounds of marijuana traced to the crime ultimately were recovered from a storage locker that police said Odin Dwyer had leased in Westminster."}
