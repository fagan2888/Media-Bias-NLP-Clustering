If there's a systematic change we need to make, that's great.\"\n\nThe City of Tucson pays $45 million annually in a subsidy to keep Sun Tran on the road, $30 million of that for 43 fixed routes which are the subject of the strike.\n\nThere has been talk in the past of the RTA, passed by voters in 2006, taking over the transit system which is ever increasingly becoming a regional system.\n\nStill, a vast majority of the passengers are Tucson residents.\n\nIf the RTA takes responsibility of the system, it would need voter approval and the city want's a share of voting power which matches its ridership.\n\nThat's a sticking point.\n\nMeantime, frustrations are apparent at the Ronstadt Transit Center downtown, the hub for a majority of riders.\n\n\"Too many people are suffering, not just the riders,\" says Ward 1 Councilwoman Regina Romero. \"It's very important to conclude and end this strike.\"\n\nRomero has asked for an agenda item on Tucson City Council study session this week, where all members can discuss any options they might have for ending the strike.\n\nTeamsters members have asked for high wages, and better safety.\n\nSome have criticized the union members for asking for more money, but union members pointed out that their wages have been frozen for three years and under the present offer from Sun Tran, they'd be frozen three more.\n\n\"How would any person trying to raise a family deal with that with the rising cost of living,\" said Fred Yamashita, chair of the Pima Area Labor Foundation. \"Is that acceptable? For most people it's not acceptable, to union workers either.\"\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
