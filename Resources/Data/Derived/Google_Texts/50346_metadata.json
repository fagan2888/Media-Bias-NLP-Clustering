I did it. I moved on,\u201d Julie Chen said about her plastic surgery.\n\n\"I don't like to live with regrets. I did it. I moved on,\u201d Julie Chen said about her plastic surgery. The Talk / YouTube\n\nFollowing ex-Cub Sammy Sosa\u2019s continued skin bleaching, celebrity alterations are set to get even more jarring. This time, it is \u201cBig Brother\u201d host Julie Chen, who recently revealed that her first agent pressured her into getting plastic surgery \u2013 to look less Asian. On Wednesday\u2019s The Talk, the former news anchor told interviewers that her eye surgery was the only way to surmount the racism she faced in Ohio as a 25-year-old Asian American.\n\nAccording to USA Today, Chen began her career as a local news reporter in Dayton, Ohio. One holiday season, she asked the news director if she could fill in for the vacationing news anchors. His response would haunt her for years.\n\n\u201cHe said, 'You will never be on this anchor desk, because you're Chinese,'\u201d Chen told her interviewers. \u201cHe said 'Let's face it Julie, how relatable are you to our community? How big of an Asian community do we really have in Dayton? ... On top of that because of your heritage, because of your Asian eyes, I've noticed that when you're on camera, when you're interviewing someone you look disinterested and bored because your eyes are so heavy, they are so small.' \"\n\nChen was shocked by her news directors reply, which felt \u201clike a dagger in [her] heart\u201d and made her \u201cvery insecure\u201d about her career. She would watch clips of herself over and over again. Each time, she would only see her eyes.\n\nDistraught, Chen began meeting with agents to find a new position elsewhere. Her dream, she said, was to work in New York City. However, her news director\u2019s sentiment proved to be more pervasive than she had first thought.\n\nWhen a \u201cbig-time\u201d agent told her that he couldn\u2019t represent her unless she had plastic surgery, she realized she had no choice. Chen agreed to have East Asian blepharoplasty \u2013 a cosmetic procedure that modifies the upper eyelids to make the eyes look bigger. The change in appearance, she said, was \u201cdramatic.\u201d\n\n\"I don't like to live with regrets. I did it. I moved on,\u201d Chen said. \u201cNo one's more proud of being Chinese than I am.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "julie chen plastic surgery, julie chen surgery asian, east asina blepharoplasty, julie chen the talk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "On Wednesday, Julie Chen revealed that the East Asian blepharoplasty was the only way she could get agents to represent her in Dayton, Ohio.", "title": "TV-Host Julie Chen Had Plastic Surgery To Look 'Less Asian'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/julie-chen-had-plastic-surgery-look-less-asian-tv-host-reveals-how-racism-pressured-her-having-east", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/12/chen.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Wednesday, Julie Chen revealed that the East Asian blepharoplasty was the only way she could get agents to represent her in Dayton, Ohio.", "title": "TV-Host Julie Chen Had Plastic Surgery To Look 'Less Asian'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/julie-chen-had-plastic-surgery-look-less-asian-tv-host-reveals-how-racism-pressured-her-having-east", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/12/chen.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/12/chen.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-12T21:31:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-12T21:33:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "On Wednesday, Julie Chen revealed that the East Asian blepharoplasty was the only way she could get agents to represent her in Dayton, Ohio."}, "article_summary": "This time, it is \u201cBig Brother\u201d host Julie Chen, who recently revealed that her first agent pressured her into getting plastic surgery \u2013 to look less Asian.\nI moved on,\u201d Julie Chen said about her plastic surgery.\n\u201cHe said, 'You will never be on this anchor desk, because you're Chinese,'\u201d Chen told her interviewers.\nWhen a \u201cbig-time\u201d agent told her that he couldn\u2019t represent her unless she had plastic surgery, she realized she had no choice.\nChen agreed to have East Asian blepharoplasty \u2013 a cosmetic procedure that modifies the upper eyelids to make the eyes look bigger."}
