That\u2019s when I testified before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee about how Obamacare forced my insurance company to cancel my health care plan \u2014 a plan that I liked and wanted to keep.\n\nHere are the facts: Last September, I received a cancellation letter from my insurance provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina. It simply read: \u201cYou must transition to a new, Affordable Care Act-compliant medical plan.\u201d With one sentence, I had lost my health insurance.\n\nThis directly broke President Obama\u2019s \u2014 and Harry Reid\u2019s \u2014 promise that I, along with 4.7 million other Americans who lost their health plans thanks to Obamacare, could keep my plan if I liked it.\n\nThat should be enough to disprove any claim that Obamacare hasn\u2019t actually harmed anyone. The problems didn\u2019t end with the cancellation, though. My insurance company offered me the cheapest plan they could find that roughly matched my canceled plan. I was hopeful that they would find something that roughly matched my old plan\u2019s price tag of $202 per month.\n\nThat was too much to ask for. The cheapest plan they could offer cost $584 per month \u2014 a 189 percent increase over my old monthly premium. It also increased my deductible by $1,500 and nearly doubled my co-pays.\n\nThis isn\u2019t chump change. This new, Obamacare-compliant health plan would cost as much $12,008 each year \u2014 more than double the $5,924 I ever would have paid with my old plan. Even if I don\u2019t have a single medical expense during the year, I\u2019ll still be paying over $4,500 more each year. God forbid I catch a cold.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I can do to defray this cost, either. I\u2019m not eligible for subsidies. I\u2019m thus stuck paying for a plan that I can\u2019t afford, and I have Obamacare\u2019s one-size-fits-all benefits and coverage mandates to thank for it. Never mind that, as a 61-year-old woman, I have no need for the maternity care, the newborn care and the pediatric services that Obamacare forces me to pay.\n\nIf stories like mine don\u2019t qualify as \u201chorror stories,\u201d then the White House didn\u2019t get Mr. Reid\u2019s memo. Late last year, President Obama\u2019s administration tried to undo the damage that Obamacare has caused by strong-arming insurance companies into extending canceled plans for 2014. Recently, they even announced that plans like my canceled policy could even be extended into 2017.\n\nThis only delays the inevitable. Mr. Obama is on the record saying that plans like mine are \u201csubstandard\u201d and deserved to be canceled. It\u2019s just a matter of time before that happens \u2014 and based on the slew of delays, that will likely be when it\u2019s the least politically damaging for the president and his party.\n\nThe extension didn\u2019t fully fix the problem that Obamacare created. After my old plan was renewed, my health plan\u2019s premiums still jumped by 23 percent.\n\nNo matter what choice I make, Obamacare forces me to pay more money for my health care. Whether it\u2019s next year or the year after that, I\u2019ll eventually be forced onto the expensive plan that I neither want nor can afford.\n\nApparently, this ordeal doesn\u2019t make me a victim of Obamacare. Maybe the \u201creal\u201d victims are among the other 4.7 million people who lost their insurance. I keep looking for the law\u2019s silver linings, but all I can find is a bronze plan I can\u2019t afford and a bunch of broken promises.\n\nSheila A.
