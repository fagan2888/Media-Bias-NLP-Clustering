SACRAMENTO-

About 200 people in the country illegally, healthcare workers and students march to the California State Capitol Monday morning in support of Senate Bill 4, which would give undocumented Californians the ability to apply for health insurance via a federal waiver.

There are about 2.6 million undocumented immigrants living in the state who are unable to apply for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

Proponents believe it is more of a human rights issue than a political one.

"I don't know you, but I hope that you are in good health, and I would hope that you would wish the same for me." undocumented immigrant and marcher Alesso Nicra said.

Opponents counter by saying the Affordable Care Act passed in part because it was guaranteed illegal immigrants would not be covered.

"These efforts by California politicians to provide ever more benefits and to blur the lines between legal and illegal behavior will simply encourage more illegal immigration," said Ric Oberilnk, of Californians for Population Stabilization.

The Senate Health Committee will take up the issue Wednesday.
