(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)\n\n4665267\n\nThe race for the White House is about to get serious.\n\nOn Thursday, 10 of the 17 Republican presidential contenders will take the stage in Cleveland for the first GOP debate, hosted by Fox News. What follows are 27 questions for the debate: Seven general question for all the candidates and two specific queries for each of 10 participants.\n\nGeneral Questions For Everyone\n\nName a figure outside of politics who you would consider nominating to your Cabinet. What would you nominate them for and why?\n\nPresident Barack Obama is often criticized for playing too much golf. What is appropriate amount of leisure time for an American president?\n\nWho is the smartest liberal writer you read?\n\nLibertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel says he always asks potential hires, \u201cWhat is one thing you believe to be true that most do not?\u201d How would you respond?\n\nWhat policy does another country get right that we would be well served to adopt in our country?\n\nDo you believe President Obama is a bad person, or just politically misguided?\n\nWhat three books most influenced your political worldview?\n\nQuestions For Donald Trump\n\nYou\u2019ve explained that you donated campaign funds to liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi in order to get them to do business-related favors for you. As you put it recently, \u201cwhen you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.\u201d What, specifically, did Clinton and Pelosi do for you in exchange for your donations?\n\nYour plan for defeating ISIS consists mainly of \u201cbomb[ing] the hell\u201d out of the oil fields the terror group controls. Considering you have no military experience, what military experts or former military officers did you consult on your plan? What did they say?\n\nQuestions For Jeb Bush\n\nSome conservatives criticize you for being MIA during the major political battles of the Obama years. Why were you so silent? Why didn\u2019t you, for instance, forcefully speak out against Obamacare at the time it was being debated?\n\nSome Republican foreign policy thinkers have criticized you for your association with former Secretary of State James Baker. What is the best piece of foreign policy advice he has given you? Is there any advice he has given you that you profoundly disagree with?\n\nQuestions For Scott Walker\n\nGovernor, you have been all over the board on immigration. At one point you favored a pathway to citizenship for America\u2019s illegal immigrant population, then this year you came out against it, then we hear you may have told donors that you still support it, which your campaign then denied. Let\u2019s try to get some clarity: Could you ever imagine supporting a pathway to citizenship for any portion of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in this country? If not a pathway to citizenship, what about any type of pathway to legalization that would allow illegal immigrants to stay in the country, albeit without the possibility of obtaining citizenship?\n\nHow do you distinguish yourself on foreign policy from some of your rivals, particularly Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio?\n\nQuestions For Marco Rubio\n\nOne criticism of you is that while you are an impressive orator, you really haven\u2019t accomplished all that much besides getting elected to various political offices at a young age. What are your top three professional accomplishments?\n\nDo you regret supporting the intervention in Libya? If you think America\u2019s intervention in Libya was merely a failure of implementation, what exactly would you have done differently to ensure that Libya became a flourishing liberal democracy instead of a failed state and a terrorist safe haven?\n\nQuestions For Rand Paul\n\nPeople are still uncertain whether you are all that different from your father on foreign policy. Since World War II, do you believe American actions abroad, on balance, have ultimately been a force for good or a force for ill?\n\nIn 2013, you told Breitbart News that if you were president, \u201cany attack on Israel will be treated as an attack on the United States.\u201d I imagine that struck some of your more libertarian supporters as a strange position for you to take, to put it nicely. So explain to them why an attack on Israel should be considered an attack on the United States.\n\nQuestions For Ted Cruz\n\nOn July 25, 2013, you \u2014 not a staff member, you \u2014 appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show and said that those who didn\u2019t support your Defund Obamacare strategy were part of the Republican \u201csurrender caucus.\u201d Do you really consider someone like former Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn an enabler of Obamacare because he opposed your strategy, which he and many others viewed as quixotic, on efficacy grounds?\n\nIf reports are to be believed, you are not very well liked by most of your Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle. While you might say this is a good thing \u2014 i.e. you are standing up to the Washington establishment \u2014 how could you possibly get anything accomplished as president if you are unable to work effectively with Congress?\n\nNEXT PAGE: Questions For Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson And John Kasich\n\nQuestions For Chris Christie\n\nBy the standards conservatives have held President Obama to for various scandals, why shouldn\u2019t you be blamed for Bridgegate since one of your top aides was directly involved? Even if you weren\u2019t personally involved as the evidence so far suggests, is it fair to say you created a culture where a deputy of yours would think such an action was acceptable?\n\nThere are over a half a dozen governors in the race and many can boast that they presided over impressive economic numbers during their tenures as the chief executive of their respective states. Your state, however, has witnessed nine credit downgrades during your time as governor. How can you claim you are more capable of handling the national economy than some of your competitors whose states thrived when they were presiding over them?\n\nQuestions For Mike Huckabee\n\nYou\u2019ve come out against reforming America\u2019s entitlement programs. But these programs have over $80 trillion in unfunded liabilities. How do you propose covering that gap other than wishful thinking? And why shouldn\u2019t the retirement age go up for certain entitlement programs as life expectancy goes up? In short, governor, are you not just pandering on this critical issue?\n\nYou were paid to sell a diabetes cure that the medical community considers bogus. What\u2019s more, you claim in an ad that you used the technique to cure your own diabetes. But when pressed on this recently, you admitted that was actually not the case. Why should the American people vote for somebody who appears to have deceived desperate sick people for financial gain?\n\nQuestions For Ben Carson\n\nNo one denies you were anything but world-class neurosurgeon, but how does working as a neurosurgeon prepare you to lead the United States? What qualities do you have that would make you a good president?\n\nYou have said you would not have invaded Afghanistan after 9/11. Explain, in detail, how you would have responded to the 9/11 attacks?\n\nQuestions For John Kasich\n\nYou have framed your support for Medicaid expansion in religious terms. Besides Medicaid expansion, what other government programs do you believe God supports?\n\nWhy do you so often sound annoyed to be questioned?\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Here are some illuminating queries for the Republican candidates.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The race for the White House is about to get serious.
