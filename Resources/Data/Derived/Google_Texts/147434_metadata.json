Another important finding, other than the insurance-based disparity, is the steady decline in the rate of smoking over a decade (2005 to 2014), from 20.9% to 16.8%\u2014these numbers seem well on target to achieving a smoking rate of 12% or lower by 2020, per the Healthy People 2020 targets . The average number of cigarettes smoked per day dropped by about 3 percentage points, from 16.7% to 13.8% during the study period.The highest smoking rates were observed among:\u00b7 Males\u00b7 Young adults\u00b7 People below the poverty line\u00b7 People with a disability\u00b7 People with a General Education Development certificate\u00b7 People who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual. press release announcing the results of the study, from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, says that while the results prove that the fight against this devastating habit has made huge strides, there\u2019s much work needed to meet the goals of \u201cprotecting Americans from the number one cause of preventable death.\u201d The organization urges continued national efforts on multiple fronts, including higher taxation on tobacco products, smoke-free laws, and barrier-free health insurance for smoking cessation treatments, among others.Smoking cessation treatments have gained improved coverage, especially under the Affordable Care Act. A recent report by the CDC, addressing cessation coverage, found that only 9 states cover all 9 evidence-based cessation treatments (individual counseling, group counseling, nicotine gum, nicotine patches, nicotine lozenge, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler, bupropion, and varenicline).Praising the findings from the report, CDC Director Tom Frieden, MD, MPH, said, \u201cSmoking kills half a million Americans each year and costs more than $300 billion.
