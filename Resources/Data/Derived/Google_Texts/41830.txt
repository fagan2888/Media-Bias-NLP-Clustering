UPDATE — 10/27, 1:30 PM ET:

The mysterious brunette has been removed from the healthcare.gov website and replaced with a new graphic showing a series of instructions for applying for health care.

Fox News also reported on-air that an administration official denied the image was a photoshop composite and was indeed a photograph of a real person. The official, however, declined to release her name.

Here is what users see now:

You have probably seen her face before, but do you know who that brunette girl is smiling back at you when you log onto healthcare.gov?

Odds are you don’t, but you aren’t alone.

Multiple media outlets, including USA Today and Fox News, have scoured the Internet and looked through stock photo agencies’ catalogs, social media and even through photographs of Democratic operatives — but the mysterious girl has yet to be found.

The woman, who media outlets are desperately trying to identify, has become the face of the glitch-ridden healthcare.gov website.

CNN even devoted an entire segment to her, asking for information about who she may be.

“Have you seen the Obamacare girl? She’s not missing, but she is almost impossible to miss,” CNN’s Jeanne Moos said.

According to Fox News, the website’s source code indicates the image file’s name is “Adriana.” TheBlaze was unable to locate “Adriana” within the home page’s source code on Saturday.

TheBlaze reported on Wednesday about how the mysterious woman has become the “enigmatic Mona Lisa of health care.”
