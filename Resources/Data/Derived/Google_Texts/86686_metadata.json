In the fight against ISIS, he restated his insistence that the US ought to \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d areas where Islamic State fighters are based.\n\nRelated: Close the Borders, Monitor Muslims \u2013 GOP Candidates Respond to ISIS Attacks\n\nDuring a joint press conference with Argentine President Mauricio Macri, Obama said that defeating ISIS and protecting national security are together his number one priority, but he won\u2019t be distracted from his strategy by misguided proposals at the height of the campaign season that would be counter-productive or harmful to the national interest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot on my plate, but my top priority is to defeat ISIL and to eliminate the scourge of this barbaric terrorism that\u2019s been taking place around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we see high profile attacks in Europe, but they are also killing Muslims throughout the Middle East. People who are innocent, people who are guilty only of worshipping Islam in a different way than this organization. They are poisoning the minds of young people everywhere, not just in Europe but the United States and probably Argentina.\u201d\n\nThe main issue, he added, is \u201chow do we do it in an intelligent way. And our approach has been continuously to adjust to see what works, and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWhat has worked, he said, are the allied air strikes on ISIS\u2019s leadership, infrastructure and their financial systems, as well as special U.S. operators partnering with Iraqi security forces and going after leadership networks, couriers and disrupting their bases in Raqqa and Mosul.\n\nRelated: Trump Does a U-Turn on How He\u2019d Fight ISIS\n\n\u201cWe have taken away 40 percent of their territory and ISIL leadership has been hunkered down, and we are going to continue to press on them until they are driven out of their strongholds until they\u2019re destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile we are doing that, we\u2019re also extraordinarily vigilant about preventing attacks in our homeland and working with our allies to prevent attacks in Europe.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s difficult and challenging \u201cto identify very small groups of people who are willing to die themselves and can walk into a crowd and detonate a bomb. My charge to my team is to find every strategy possible to successfully reduce the risk of such terrorist attacks even after we go after their beating hearts in places like Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t do \u2013 and what we should not do\u2014is take approaches that are going to be counter-productive,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when I hear people say we should carpet bomb Iraq or Syria, not only is that inhumane, not only is that contrary to our values, but that would likely be an extraordinary mechanism for ISIL to recruit more people willing to die or explode bombs in an airport or a subway station. That is not a smart strategy.\u201d\n\nAs for Cruz\u2019s proposal to police Muslim neighborhoods in the U.S., Obama said that one of the great strengths in the US, and the reason there hasn\u2019t been more terrorist attacks here, is cooperation from Muslim community leaders in discouraging radical activities.\n\nRelated: Trump \u2013 Turn US Military into the World\u2019s Rent-a-Cop\n\n\u201cSo any approach that would single them out or target them for discrimination is not only wrong and un-American but it also would be counter-productive because it would reduce the strength, the anti-bodies we have to resist terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as the notion of having surveillance of neighborhoods where Muslims are present, I just left a country (Cuba) that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance,\u201d he said, adding that Cruz\u2019s father fled Cuba for America in search of freedom. \u201cThe notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense. It\u2019s contrary to who we are and it\u2019s not going to help defeat ISIL.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama on Wednesday took the unusual step, during a press conference in Buenos Aires, of specifically criticizing proposals made by Texas senator and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz in the aftermath of the ISIS terror attacks in Brussels as \u201cinhumane\u201d and \u201ccounter-productive.\u201d", "title": "Obama Rips Cruz for \u2018Inhumane\u2019 Comments on Brussels", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/Obama-Rips-Cruz-Inhumane-Comments-Brussels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz-aipac_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/23/Obama-Rips-Cruz-Inhumane-Comments-Brussels", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-cruz-aipac_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama on Wednesday took the unusual step, during a press conference in Buenos Aires, of specifically criticizing proposals made by Texas senator and Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz in the aftermath of the ISIS terror attacks in Brussels as \u201cinhumane\u201d and \u201ccounter-productive.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In the fight against ISIS, he restated his insistence that the US ought to \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d areas where Islamic State fighters are based.\n\u201cAnd we see high profile attacks in Europe, but they are also killing Muslims throughout the Middle East.\nIt\u2019s contrary to who we are and it\u2019s not going to help defeat ISIL.\u201d\nPeople who are innocent, people who are guilty only of worshipping Islam in a different way than this organization.\n\u201cThe notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense."}
