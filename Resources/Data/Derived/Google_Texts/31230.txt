It’s been one week since Malaysia Airlines flight 370 mysteriously disappeared with 239 people on board. Since then, CNN has gone all in on the story, dedicating nearly 100% of its coverage to flight 370, despite the fact that very little in the way of concrete facts or evidence have emerged. One week later, the flight’s disappearance seems to be as much of a mystery as it was when it first happened.

This has led to quite a bit of… speculation on the part of CNN’s anchors, reporters, correspondents and guests. The latest “exclusive” theory to appear on the network’s website involves the highly unlikely scenario that the plane landed on a remote island in the Indian Ocean.

As New Day host Chris Cuomo explained on Wednesday there are more questions than answers in a story like this and the reason CNN stays on top of it so intensely is that “being everywhere the story is” grants them the best shot at breaking any actual new developments.

It’s also been an unexpected boon for the network’s ratings, as Anderson Cooper found out Wednesday night when he beat Fox’s Bill O’Reilly in the key 25-54 demo for the first time in almost a year. The network experienced a similar boon when they went wall-to-wall on Ukraine, albeit with much less speculation-centric coverage.

Of course, the other big cable outlets, Fox and MSNBC, have been covering this story, but no one has been nearly as obsessively dedicated as CNN.

And as the video below attests, a lot of the network’s conversation over the past week has been alarmingly long on airing speculation and seriously short on concrete facts.
