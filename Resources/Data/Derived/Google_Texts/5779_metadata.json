The ad attacks Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Iowa, on Obamacare before pivoting to immigration reform. At 0:21 into the ad text reads \u201cBruce Braley: Giving Lawbreakers Food Stamps and Medicare\u201d; at the bottom is a citation to \u201cThe Heritage Foundation, 5/6/13.\u201d\n\nThe commercial is online here\n\nAt first blush, it looks like just another lazy, generic attack ad, aired by a group that clearly doesn\u2019t think highly of voters\u2019 intelligence. It even includes, for the third consecutive cycle, ridiculous claims that the Affordable Care Act \u201ccuts\u201d Medicare \u2013 a claim that\u2019s been discredited countless times, and given the Republican agenda, a claim that doesn\u2019t even make sense.\n\nBut just below the surface, Crossroads is playing an even more bizarre game. For one thing, it\u2019s citing research from Jason Richwine, who gained national notoriety after arguing that white people are inherently smarter than people of color.\n\nFor another, the anti-immigration message is itself hard to take seriously. Under comprehensive immigration reform, undocumented immigrants can eventually become citizens, making them eligible to receive the same benefits of citizenship as everyone else. By this reasoning, Iowa\u2019s Bruce Braley supports \u201cgiving lawbreakers food stamps,\u201d but so too does John McCain, Marco Robio, and plenty of other Republicans.\n\nIndeed, let\u2019s not overlook the inconvenient detail that Karl Rove\u2019s group is attacking the Iowa Democrat for agreeing with Karl Rove.\n\nDave Weigel reported this morning:\n\nIt\u2019s just a little jarring to see this message coming from American Crossroads. Karl Rove, who raises funds for the group, has spent more than a decade telling Republicans that they need to be careful about how they discuss immigration if they want to win Hispanic votes. \u201cIt is \u2026 important that Republicans avoid calling a pathway to citizenship \u2018amnesty,\u2019 Rove wrote a year ago.\u201d And here\u2019s Crossroads, telling Iowans that any pathway to citizenship is amnesty. It\u2019s a long, long way from the Bush presidential campaigns. \u201cSeems to me that, if there\u2019s a story here, it\u2019s that Rove and American Crossroads supported the same amnesty that they\u2019re hitting Braley for supporting in that ad,\u201d Richwine told me in an email.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Karl Rove's attack operation has a new strategy: attack Democrats who have the audacity to agree with Karl Rove.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/karl-roves-group-blasts-bruce-braley-agreeing-karl-rove", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Karl Rove's attack operation has a new strategy: attack Democrats who have the audacity to agree with Karl Rove.", "title": "Karl Rove's group blasts Bruce Braley for agreeing with Karl Rove", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/karl-roves-group-blasts-bruce-braley-agreeing-karl-rove", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/453312584.jpg?itok=QLQ4zIEu", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Karl Rove's group blasts Bruce Braley for agreeing with Karl Rove", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/karl-roves-group-blasts-bruce-braley-agreeing-karl-rove", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/453312584.jpg?itok=0SA0IXsP", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Karl Rove's attack operation has a new strategy: attack Democrats who have the audacity to agree with Karl Rove."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-08T11:34:05-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Karl Rove's attack operation has a new strategy: attack Democrats who have the audacity to agree with Karl Rove.", "nv": {"tags": "crossroads-gps,election-2014,elections,equality,immigration,immigration-reform,iowa,jason-richwine,karl-rove,rachel-maddow-show", "author": "steve-benen", "published": 1, "date": "10/08/2014 11:34:05 EDT", "title": "Karl Rove's group blasts Bruce Braley for agreeing with Karl Rove", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/karl-roves-group-blasts-bruce-braley-agreeing-karl-rove"}, "news_keywords": "Election 2014, Elections, Immigration, Equality, Crossroads GPS, Immigration Reform, Iowa, Jason Richwine, Karl Rove"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, let\u2019s not overlook the inconvenient detail that Karl Rove\u2019s group is attacking the Iowa Democrat for agreeing with Karl Rove.\nThe ad attacks Rep.
