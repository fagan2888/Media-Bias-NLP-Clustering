Daugaard unveiled his annual proposal Tuesday in Pierre.\n\nSouth Dakota has brought in millions more from the unclaimed property fund because more banks have moved home offices to the state and the legislature decreased the time for the public to claim the money from five years to three years - making more money available.\n\nThat money will help pay off state bills and free up funds for education and Medicaid providers. If it wasn\u2019t for the windfall, Daugaard said Tuesday\u2019s budget proposal would have been different.\n\n\u201cFortunately, the situation has changed since September and of course the most significant change was in the unclaimed property that we received just last month,\u201d Daugaard said.\n\nDaugaard proposes using the extra millions along with other one-time funds to pay for the new Building South Dakota economic development fund and to pay off high-interest bonds.\n\n\u201cDoing this frees enough ongoing dollars to fund schools, providers and salary policy at a high level,\u201d Daugaard said.\n\nIt means South Dakota school districts will get a three percent increase next year, which is higher than the 1.6 percent inflation increase. Medicaid providers and state employees will also get a three percent increase.\n\n\u201cThis is a prudent use of one-time dollars to remove a liability just as in your own home you might use an inheritance to pay off your mortgage early,\u201d Daugaard said.\n\nDaugaard says the plan frees up money not only for the next budget but also future years, putting South Dakota on more solid financial footing.\n\n\u201cI look forward to continuing to work with you this year and through your efforts we\u2019re building an even stronger South Dakota,\u201d Daugaard said.\n\nLegislators have been receptive to the plan so far. Both Republicans and Democrats have called the proposal innovative.\n\n\u201cJust in the hallway conversation, so far, people have been very receptive to it and pretty excited about the concept. They\u2019re probably more excited about a 3.0 increase in education and health care,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Tim Rave of Baltic said.\n\nThe Associated School Boards of South Dakota calls the plan a good first step. Executive Director Wade Pogany said districts would ultimately like to see a 3.8 percent increase to get schools back to the funding levels before the cuts to education were made in 2011, but he says the group is grateful for the three percent increase proposed by Daugaard.\n\nDemocratic Representative Susan Wismer, who serves on the Joint Appropriations Committee, also calls the proposal innovative but would like to see even more money for schools and Medicaid providers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still at less money than they were five years ago and we\u2019re all dealing with increased costs everywhere. We\u2019re paying our nursing home workers a wage they can\u2019t live on without federal assistance themselves, and we\u2019re thumbing our nose at federal money but not increasing our Medicaid rate more,\u201d Wismer said.\n\nDaugaard said during the address that he is not going to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act at this point because the federal government is unreliable and the roll out of the new health care law has been \u2018chaotic.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard says a nearly $70 million windfall from the state&rsquo;s unclaimed property fund will allow the state to hand", "title": "Daugaard Unveils 2014 Budget Proposal", "url": "http://www.keloland.com/news/article/politics/daugaard-unveils-2014-budget-proposal", "image": "http://assets.keloland.com/images/images/default-source/agriculture/crops/barley/54250.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521498541203189}, "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.3.5630.0 PE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard says a nearly $70 million windfall from the state&rsquo;s unclaimed property fund will allow the state to hand"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7bf7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI look forward to continuing to work with you this year and through your efforts we\u2019re building an even stronger South Dakota,\u201d Daugaard said.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the windfall, Daugaard said Tuesday\u2019s budget proposal would have been different.\nDaugaard says the plan frees up money not only for the next budget but also future years, putting South Dakota on more solid financial footing.\nThe Associated School Boards of South Dakota calls the plan a good first step.\nIt means South Dakota school districts will get a three percent increase next year, which is higher than the 1.6 percent inflation increase."}
