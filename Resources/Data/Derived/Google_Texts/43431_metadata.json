The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services projected hospitals nationwide would save $5.7 billion last year from serving fewer uninsured patients.\n\nKettering hasn\u2019t released numbers for fiscal 2014, but administrators have acknowledged that they have seen a reduction in charity and uncompensated care costs as well as an increase in Medicaid patients.\n\nIn addition to cost savings, Kettering has a strong market position and \u201cmanageable capital spending plans,\u201d according to Moody\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis upgrade by Moody\u2019s affirms Kettering Health Network\u2019s strategy to align best practices for patient care among our facilities,\u201d said Kettering President Terri Day. \u201cThis strategy helps us to continually improve quality while closely managing delivery costs. CEO Fred Manchur and I have worked closely with our leadership team to develop a road map that will help us achieve the highest levels of patient satisfaction, quality and safety, and financial performance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Moody\u2019s Investor Services has upgraded its credit rating for Kettering Health Network based largely on the hospital company\u2019s ability to rein in expenses over the past two years and manage capital expenditures, the global rating agency said Tuesday.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/kettering-health-credit-rating-upgraded-by-moodys/nnCr4/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/de/42/DDN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Moody\u2019s Investor Services has upgraded its credit rating for Kettering Health Network based largely on the hospital company\u2019s ability to rein in expenses over the past two years and manage capital expenditures, the global rating agency said Tuesday.", "title": "Kettering Health credit rating upgraded by Moody\u2019s"}, "twitter": {"site": "@daytondailynews", "description": "Moody\u2019s Investor Services has upgraded its credit rating for Kettering Health Network based largely on the hospital company\u2019s ability to rein in expenses over the past two years and manage capital expenditures, the global rating agency said Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Kettering Health credit rating upgraded by Moody\u2019s"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/business/kettering-health-credit-rating-upgraded-by-moodys/nnCr4/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3014621/news/business/kettering-health-credit-rating-upgraded-by-moodys/nnCr4/", "keywords": "b2bnewsletter", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "b2bnewsletter"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb4a1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis upgrade by Moody\u2019s affirms Kettering Health Network\u2019s strategy to align best practices for patient care among our facilities,\u201d said Kettering President Terri Day.\nBy Randy TuckerStaff WriterMoody\u2019s Investor Services has upgraded its credit rating for Kettering Health Network based largely on the hospital company\u2019s ability to rein in expenses over the past two years and manage capital expenditures, the global rating agency said Tuesday.\nMoody\u2019s attributed the ratings upgrade to Kettering\u2019s \u201cimpressive volume growth\u201d in key areas, such as inpatient admissions, outpatient visits and total surgeries.\nKettering has also benefited from the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio under the Affordable Care Act, according to Moody\u2019s, which has a stable ratings outlook on Kettering.\nIn addition to cost savings, Kettering has a strong market position and \u201cmanageable capital spending plans,\u201d according to Moody\u2019s."}
