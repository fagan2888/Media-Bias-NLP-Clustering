But a new study brings to our attention that a few truly natural GMOs \u2014 crops whose genomes were naturally altered through bacteria \u2014 exist. And one of them is a very common vegetable: the sweet potato.\n\nResearchers at the International Potato Center in Lima, Peru, embarked on a project to find the genes from bacteria found in 291 sweet potato varieties. The scientists discovered that bacteria likely served as genetic engineers themselves, up to 8,000 years ago, when they inserted themselves into the sweet potato\u2019s ancestor. In short, bacteria were making GMOs way before we figured out how to use bacteria to make GMOs.\n\n\u201cPeople have been eating a GMO for thousands of years without knowing it,\u201d Jan Kreuze, a virologist who led the study, told NPR. Another example is corn: Ancient farmers in Mexico specifically chose the larger versions of maize\u2019s ancestor, which were tiny compared to modern corn stalks. Over time, they bred it into what it looks like now.\n\nAgrobacterium: The Original Genetic Engineers\n\nThe authors write in their abstract, \u201cAgrobacterium rhizogenes and Agrobacterium tumefaciens are plant pathogenic bacteria capable of transferring DNA fragments bearing functional genes into the host plant genome. This naturally occurring mechanism has been adapted by plant biotechnologists to develop genetically modified crops that today are grown on more than 10 percent of the world\u2019s arable land, although their use can result in considerable controversy.\u201d So there you have it: Even before humans began messing with crop genes, the bacteria we currently harness were doing it.\n\nSweet potatoes, unlike regular potatoes, aren\u2019t tubers \u2014 instead, they\u2019re swollen parts of the root. The scientists believe that the bacteria genes altered the plant\u2019s ancestor to the point where the root was changed into something edible. Once people began farming sweet potatoes thousands of years ago, they chose the puffed up roots (with the bacteria genes) over others because they were tastier, resulting in making the genetically modified sweet potato widespread.\n\nThe authors believe that the study might bring some comfort to people who are concerned about the safety of GMOs. Greg Jaffe, GMO expert at the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, told NPR that he wasn\u2019t at all surprised by the findings. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s familiar with genetic engineering wouldn\u2019t be surprised that the [bacteria] Agrobacterium inserted some DNA into some crops.\u201d As a result, there\u2019s likely to be other common crops that were genetically altered \u2014 naturally \u2014 by bacteria thousands of years ago.\n\nThe Controversy\n\nSo why are we still scared of GMOs, and why the vicious controversy? Aside from those who are concerned that GMO use increases the use of pesticides and herbicides, there are people who worry that giant food companies manufacturing GMO products make these seeds intellectual property. Others simply feel as though companies \u201cplaying God\u201d is immoral and unnatural. But research, for the most part, has shown that GMOs are safe \u2014 although not enough research has been done yet. One recent study found that widespread anti-GMO sentiment could be rooted in misguided popular psychology and ethics instead of science.\n\nBut as Beth Skwarecki writes on Lifehacker, there are better ways to attack the negatives of the food system than focusing primarily on GMOs.\n\nThere are serious problems with our food system and the way it\u2019s based on industrial agriculture. Subsidies support sugar-laden and processed foods, while people on low incomes have trouble affording healthy, sustainably grown produce. Meanwhile, needed farmland is being turned into housing developments, massive amounts of pesticides and fertilizers are finding their way into the environment, and corporate giants like Monsanto have far too much power. Passing around infographics about which GMO-containing foods to boycott, or putting tons of effort into passing GMO labeling laws, isn\u2019t going to do anything to solve these problems. They will just make it easier for already-privileged people to buy food they feel good about\u2014which may well be just as bad for their health and the environment as the food they\u2019re avoiding.\n\nSource: Kyndt T, Quispe D, Zhai H, Jarret R, Ghislain M, Liu Q.
