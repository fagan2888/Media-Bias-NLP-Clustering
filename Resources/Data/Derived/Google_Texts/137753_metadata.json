There are no textbooks and no notebooks. Just sheets of paper and some pencils and crayons that two young refugee women use to teach children like Anas how to read and write, count and draw, sing songs and recite poems.\n\nBut even Anas might be considered one of the luckier ones of Syria\u2019s long conflict, which reached its third anniversary Saturday. Nearly half of Syria\u2019s school-age children \u2014 2.8 million and counting \u2014 cannot get an education because of the devastation and violence, UNICEF recently reported. The numbers might even be greater, a tragedy for a country where once nearly all school-age children completed primary school.\n\n\u201cThey come every day, these sad parents, begging me to take their children to school,\u201d said Etaf Seif Abdel Samad, the principal of a public grade school in Beirut, where Syrian children learn with the Lebanese side by side.\n\nShe added: \u201cThey\u2019ve lost everything in Syria and all they have in Lebanon is the interest in their children\u2019s future.\u201d\n\nMore than 2 million of those who should be in school remain in Syria, where classrooms have been bombed, used as shelters or turned into military barracks. Another 300,000 Syrian children don\u2019t attend school in Lebanon, along with some 93,000 in Jordan, 78,000 in Turkey, 26,000 in Iraq and 4,000 in Egypt, UNICEF officials in Geneva say.\n\nThose numbers likely are higher, as UNICEF can\u2019t count the children whose parents didn\u2019t register with the United Nations refugee agency. Experts say that puts a whole generation of Syrians at risk of coming of age illiterate, lost to a war that has killed some 140,000 people already. UNICEF estimates more than 10,000 children have died in the violence.\n\nThe conflict has unleashed massive suffering across all segments of Syrian society, but the impact on children has been especially acute. Malnutrition and illness stunts their growth; a lack of schooling derails their education; and the bloody trauma of war sears deep psychological scars.\n\nWith no end to fighting in sight, Syrian refugees are increasingly desperate to have their children obtain the most basic education. They plead with principals to take them into Lebanon\u2019s overcrowded public schools, send them to makeshift classes in tents and offer them to mosques to study with sheiks.\n\nAt Anas\u2019 tent classroom, near Majdal Anjar, a border town in the east of Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa valley, children\u2019s drawings hung on the plastic walls and an out-of-season Christmas tree decoration dangled from the ceiling. Anas, the oldest of the children on a colorful carpet, wore a sweater and warm trousers, though he sat barefoot in the cold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Generation missing out on school in wartime Syria", "title": "Generation missing out on school in wartime Syria", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Generation missing out on school in wartime Syria", "title": "Generation missing out on school in wartime Syria", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/15/generation_missing_out_on_school_in_wartime_syria/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/mideast-lebanon-syria-lost-generation.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Generation missing out on school in wartime Syria", "title": "Generation missing out on school in wartime Syria", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/mideast-lebanon-syria-lost-generation.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Barbara Surk", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The numbers might even be greater, a tragedy for a country where once nearly all school-age children completed primary school.\n\u201cThey come every day, these sad parents, begging me to take their children to school,\u201d said Etaf Seif Abdel Samad, the principal of a public grade school in Beirut, where Syrian children learn with the Lebanese side by side.\nAnother 300,000 Syrian children don\u2019t attend school in Lebanon, along with some 93,000 in Jordan, 78,000 in Turkey, 26,000 in Iraq and 4,000 in Egypt, UNICEF officials in Geneva say.\nThose numbers likely are higher, as UNICEF can\u2019t count the children whose parents didn\u2019t register with the United Nations refugee agency.\nWith no end to fighting in sight, Syrian refugees are increasingly desperate to have their children obtain the most basic education."}
