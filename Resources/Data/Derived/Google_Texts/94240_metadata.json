More work awaits those fighting for human rights for all, an end to housing discrimination, and health care for everyone.\n\nOpponents of these decisions like to talk about state\u2019s rights, an issue that has a long and sometimes tortured history, ranging from discussions of constitutional powers under the 10th Amendment to its use as coded language for supporting racial discrimination and outright racism.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t talk about enough are states\u2019 wrongs. And, with regard to the Affordable Care Act, it is vital to talk about states in the wrong. The law as originally intended required states to expand Medicaid. The Supreme Court, as part of its 2012 decision upholding the law's constitutionality, made expansion an option for states. Funding was unchanged: the federal government pays 100 percent of the costs from 2014 to 2016 and then phases down to 90 percent by 2020. Coverage is provided to adults under age 65 with income up to 138% of the federal poverty level and children up to age 18 up to that income level or higher. Thirty states, including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, said yes, as did the District of Columbia.\n\nTwenty-two states said no to Medicaid expansion\u2013and with that choice left 4.3 million Americans uninsured. Those states simply chose not to provide health coverage to low-income individuals. That is a states\u2019 wrong, and the health impact of this wrong is to be far reaching. One study estimated that thousands of people would die every year as the result of states' failure to expand Medicaid.\n\nWhich states are in the wrong? Maine, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. (Montana is currently in discussions with the federal government and Alaska is considering Medicaid expansion.)\n\nMost but not all of the states refusing to offer expanded coverage are in the south and are places where the slogan \u201cstate\u2019s rights\u201d has long been used to justify discrimination. In some of these states, in the wake of the racially motivated and horrific act of domestic terrorism and mass murder at the Emanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston, S.C., elected officials have brought down the confederate flags flying on state property. Good move (although let\u2019s be clear, the Confederacy was defeated 150 years ago so it\u2019s a bit late). Yet some of the same elected officials who want to remove what South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley calls \u201ca symbol that divides us\u201d are still happy to maintain a divide between those who can access health insurance and those who cannot.\n\nThe denial of Medicaid expansion is a states\u2019 wrong that we must overcome.\n\nRead more about The Public's Health.\n\nMore Coverage Parkinson's disease: Need to know\n\nApr 28 - 11:11 PM", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160526, "editdate": "20150701T03:30:00", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/public_health/The-Affordable-Care-Act-and-States-Wrong.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/getcovered_medicare_map_060415_976px.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Affordable Care Act and States' wrong"}, "cg": "health", "keywords": "Janet Golden, Jonathan Purtle, and Michael Yudell", "description": "Denying health insurance to low-income people in 22 states is not about states' rights.
