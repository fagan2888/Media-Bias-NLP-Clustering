Many people qualified for federal subsidies that kept their monthly premiums well under $100.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of people coming to the site were able to get on and do what they were intending to do,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylva Burwell said Sunday on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press, adding that 500,000 people had signed onto the website.\n\nBy most accounts, the federal marketplace that handles enrollment for 37 states ran smoothly \u2014 a far cry from last year\u2019s disastrous rollout that turned www.healthcare.gov into an embarrassment for President Barack Obama, spurred several staff departures and made the site virtually unusable for two months.\n\nState exchanges that had encountered big problems last year\u2014including Maryland, Massachusetts and Hawaii\u2014all reported no major issues this weekend.\n\nState exchanges that had encountered big problems last year \u2014 including Maryland, Massachusetts and Hawaii\u2014all reported no major issues this weekend.\n\nStill, there were some hiccups, with consumers and enrollment counselors facing sporadic delays accessing the website to set up an account and buy coverage. Some of those who bought coverage last year had trouble getting into their accounts because they had forgotten their passwords.\n\nMeanwhile, the insurance exchanges run by 13 states and the District of Columbia functioned well \u2014 with the exception of the one in Washington state, which was shut down Saturday because it was giving out incorrect subsidy information. The site was fixed and back online Sunday morning.\n\nTo give consumers assistance, enrollment events were held across the country over the weekend, at hospitals, clinics, churches, community centers, malls, libraries \u2013 even at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome,\u201d said Joy Floyd after she got help buying a plan for $11.75 a month at the Children and Family Services Center in Charlotte, N.C. She had tried and failed to sign up for coverage last year because of website problems.\n\nLike most enrollees, Floyd will face additional cost-sharing as a result of deductibles and co-pays when she sees doctors, gets tests or buys prescriptions.\n\nUncertainties Ahead\n\nDespite this year\u2019s far smoother opening, the enrollment process continues to face plenty of uncertainties, including the response of a confused and still uninformed public, among them 20 million uninsured who did not enroll the first year; a shorter enrollment period and premium increases that many of the 7 million people who bought coverage last year will face unless they shop around.\n\nRecent political and legal developments also cast a shadow, including a hostile GOP taking control of Congress in January and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to hear a challenge to the subsidies that millions of people have relied upon to reduce the cost of their coverage.\n\nRicot Telcy, 37, a West Palm Beach, Fla., security guard, knew nothing about the legal challenge, but was pleased to learn he and his wife could get coverage for about $300 a month\u2014about the same price his wife had been paying for herself.\n\nAcross town, at an event at a medical society office, Rick Pierre, 40, enrolled in about an hour in a plan that will cost him nothing in premiums because he qualifies for a large subsidy. \u201cI\u2019m very excited,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Obama administration expects about 9 million people to get coverage on the exchanges before open enrollment ends Feb. 15. The marketplaces are a cornerstone of the health law because they help expand health coverage to millions of Americans who do not get health coverage at their jobs. More than eight in 10 people buying policies last year received a government subsidy to lower their premiums.\n\nPeople must enroll by Dec. 15 if they want their coverage to start in January. In most states, those who bought coverage last year will be re-enrolled automatically if they do nothing by that date \u2013 a scenario that could result in higher costs since most premiums and benefits are changing.\n\nThe exchanges and the publicity around them also spurred millions of people to sign up for Medicaid, which has expanded eligibility under the health law in 27 states.\n\nSome Wrestle With Higher Premiums, Confusion\n\nIn Philadelphia, Joseph Krakauskas, a retired 62-year-old, showed up two hours early at an enrollment event to secure a place at the front of the line. He has just found out that his current premiums were going to triple next year and he needed help finding a new plan. \u201cThis is almost like a bait and switch,\u201d he said of the rate increase. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re getting away with this.\u201d\n\nKrakauskas wasn\u2019t able to access his account through the website, however. Still, a counselor found him an HMO plan for $128 a month, higher than he was paying last year, but about half of what his old plan would cost in 2015.\n\nDespite the government\u2019s efforts to streamline the application, confusion and difficulty navigating the website also brought in many people, including Sarah White of Philadelphia, a mother of two.\n\n\u201cI have a doctoral degree,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that this is so complicated for even someone with [her education] is ridiculous. But here I am trying to get help and I have hope.\u201d\n\nDemand for coverage was particularly high in California, where 1.2 million residents signed up for coverage last year.\n\nBy 9 a.m. Saturday, dozens had lined up for a festive enrollment event in Los Angeles sponsored by SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. Most of the applicants came prepared \u2013 holding envelopes with pay stubs, birth certificates and Social Security cards. As each finished signing up, volunteers cheered, applauded and snapped photos.\n\nAlejandro Irigoyen, 45, said he missed the deadline last year and didn\u2019t want to risk doing that again. When he injured his foot recently, he paid about $500 for a doctor\u2019s visit, X-rays and medicine. With the help of an enrollment counselor, Irigoyen signed up for a plan which will cover both him and his 23-year-old son for about $75 a month.\n\n\u201cI feel much more secure,\u201d Irigoyen said.\n\nThe enrollment event took place in a heavily Latino neighborhood, and most of the counselors spoke Spanish. California exchange officials had been heavily criticized last year for not doing enough to reach out to the state\u2019s large Latino population. Several of the families at Saturday\u2019s event said they hadn\u2019t previously enrolled in coverage because they have family members who are in the country illegally and feared telling the government too much.\n\nAfter being reassured their information wouldn\u2019t be given to immigration authorities, Crescencio Lorenzo, 48, a legal resident, came to the enrollment event with his daughter, Andrea, a U.S. citizen, and his wife, Susana Lorenzo, 48, who is in the country illegally. He and his daughter enrolled in Medicaid. \u201cThey told us not to worry,\u201d about jeopardizing his wife, he said.\n\nWeather And Glitches Are Issues In Ohio, Washington\n\nSome enrollment events failed to draw consumers, including the \u201cRock Enroll\u201d event at Cleveland\u2019s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Officials blamed snow flurries. By mid-afternoon, Barb Wynveen, a navigator with the Carmella Rose Health Foundation, said she\u2019d had no walk-ins, and all of her half-dozen scheduled appointments had been a bust.\n\nThere was more foot traffic at Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Health Services, a community health center primarily serving the poor. Counselor Khalil Ismail met with Prempal Kaur, a woman in her 50s who spoke mostly Punjabi, and her daughter, Ravinder Kaur, who translated.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a citizen. She\u2019s a widow, a single mother,\u201d explained Ravinda Kaur, who had traveled from Chicago to help her mother apply for insurance coverage. \u201cAnd she works at the Convenient Food Mart, where she makes minimum wage.\u201d\n\nBefore she left, Prempal Kaur was enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nIn Washington state, meanwhile, the shutdown of the website to fix a glitch led people to start filling out applications the old-fashioned way \u2014 with paper and pen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly frustrating,\u201d said Gary Zablocki, a 51-year-old carpenter at an event at the Southcenter Mall in Tukwila, a Seattle suburb.\n\nJoanna Richards at WCPN in Cleveland , Elana Gordon at WHYY in Philadelphia, Ann Doss Helms at The Charlotte Observer, Nick Nehamas at The Miami Herald, Lisa Stiffler and Patrick Marshall at The Seattle Times, Jordan Shapiro at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Wes Venteicher at The Chicago Tribune and Robert Calandra at The Philadelphia Inquirer also contributed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThe vast majority of people coming to the site were able to get on and do what they were intending to do,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylva Burwell said Sunday on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press, adding that 500,000 people had signed onto the website.", "pubdate": 20141117, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "\u201cThe vast majority of people coming to the site were able to get on and do what they were intending to do,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Sylva Burwell said Sunday on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press, adding that 500,000 people had signed onto the website.", "title": "Healthcare.gov is back for open enrollment.
