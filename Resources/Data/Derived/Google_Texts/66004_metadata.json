They weren't letting people savor the moment,\" said Klein, 34, a Kensington, Brooklyn, resident, who estimates he was with the mayor for \"two seconds.\"\n\nKlein was one of thousands of New Yorkers who waited to take their picture with de Blasio, braving freeing temperatures during a dank afternoon on the Upper East Side.\n\nFree tickets to the \"open house\" were distributed last week. Staff passed out hot beverages to cold attendees as music played and everyone inched forward, occasionally passing warming tents before the line reached the house.\n\n\"We're trying to get everyone a chance,\" de Blasio said of the rapid pace in between greetings. \"We set up the system to try to get the most people in the door and give them a chance to see the place.\"\n\nDespite Klein's disappointment -- \"He should have spent more time with me\" -- he and other attendees said the short meeting was worth the wait.\n\nPetal Hwang, 39, and her son Derek waited outside for a little over two hours to see de Blasio at Gracie, which the mayor repeatedly called \"the people's mansion.\"\n\n\"It belongs to all the people. Did you know that? All the people of the city,\" de Blasio told Hwang's 11 year old. \"So you have a one out of 8.4 million share of this place.\"\n\nAfter the mayor and Derek briefly chatted about his Harlem middle school, Hwang said the meeting was worth the wait and the cold.\n\nAdded Klein, \"It was very nice for him to open his home to the public. I don\u2019t think any mayor's ever done that.\"\n\nFollow Anna Sanders on Twitter @AnnaESanders", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Yorkers brave freezing cold to meet Mayor Bill de Blasio at Gracie Mansion open house", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "New Yorkers brave freezing cold to meet Mayor Bill de Blasio at Gracie Mansion open house", "title": "New Yorkers brave freezing cold to meet de Blasio at Gracie Mansion", "url": "http://www.metro.us/local/new-yorkers-brave-freezing-cold-to-meet-de-blasio-at-gracie-mansion/tmWnae---cd7rmhP00VoQ/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$mkzbewt2ydyulp5fhvltc9p9zqaeaf0/credit-office-of-the-mayor-614x408.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "New Yorkers brave freezing cold to meet Mayor Bill de Blasio at Gracie Mansion open house", "title": "New Yorkers brave freezing cold to meet de Blasio at Gracie Mansion", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$mkzbewt2ydyulp5fhvltc9p9zqaeaf0/credit-office-of-the-mayor-614x408.jpeg"}, "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "mediatype": "Article", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "keywords": "Local,Region New York,Gracie-Mansion,bill de blasio, Gracie Mansion, New York City news, New York City politics, upper east side", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-11", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/local", "published_time": "2014-01-05T19:21:12Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-05T19:21:12Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local,Region New York,Gracie-Mansion,bill de blasio, Gracie Mansion, New York City news, New York City politics, upper east side"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84fc\"", "article_summary": "Thousands of New Yorkers waited hours in freezing temperatures to take their picture with Mayor Bill de Blasio during an open house at Gracie Mansion Sunday.\nPetal Hwang, 39, and her son Derek waited outside for a little over two hours to see de Blasio at Gracie, which the mayor repeatedly called \"the people's mansion.\"\nA handshake, the snap of a camera and Klein said he was whisked out of the mansion by Mayor Bill de Blasio's staff.\nKlein was one of thousands of New Yorkers who waited to take their picture with de Blasio, braving freeing temperatures during a dank afternoon on the Upper East Side.\nAfter the mayor and Derek briefly chatted about his Harlem middle school, Hwang said the meeting was worth the wait and the cold."}
