Bush, whose victory here in 2000 was pivotal in his presidential campaign.\n\nThough Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign pulled a negative ad attacking Mr. Cruz on Thursday, saying it wanted to stay positive, Mr. Cruz\u2019s aides released two harshly negative ads attacking Mr. Trump for his use of eminent domain to try to demolish an elderly woman\u2019s home in Atlantic City \u2014 one suggesting his behavior was childish, the other accusing him of a \u201cpattern of sleaze.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz also introduced a television advertisement mocking Mr. Rubio as little more than a \u201cpretty face\u201d and hitting him for his prior support of a path to citizenship for people in the country illegally. The Cruz campaign later took the ad down after BuzzFeed reported that one of the actresses in it had started in adult films.\n\nSome of the most intense Republican skirmishing here is expected between the Bush and Rubio campaigns, as it appears increasingly unlikely that both will be able to advance beyond South Carolina. So each has embraced the same imperative: Take the other out.\n\nDuring his swing across the state on Thursday \u2014 which started at a resort near Hilton Head and ended at a Christian school outside Greenville \u2014 Mr. Rubio was as biting about Mr. Bush as he has ever been.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the conservative movement would be excited about Jeb Bush,\u201d he said in the interview with reporters on his plane. \u201cOn the major issues facing the conservative movement over the last seven years, he\u2019s been basically missing in action. He hasn\u2019t really been a part of that fight.\u201d He cited Republican-led battles against the Affordable Care Act and Common Core as examples.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nResponding to assertions from Mr. Bush and others that he has not made tough or consequential decisions, Mr. Rubio called Mr. Bush\u2019s experience in world affairs inferior to his own as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees.\n\n\u201cJeb has no foreign policy experience,\u201d he said. \u201cNone.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if he wants to make this election about experience, well, the most important job of the president is to be commander in chief.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush, in Columbia, S.C., pointed to his leadership of the Florida National Guard and long list of advisers. \u201cI\u2019m pretty fluent on the issues of foreign policy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Marco can say that he has a record, but what would it be? That he goes to committee hearings and talks to people?\u201d\n\nAs he fights for a strong finish, Mr. Rubio, who was criticized for running a cautious, buttoned-up campaign, is increasingly trying to show spontaneity and sincerity.\n\nWith breakfast at Cracker Barrel, a 45-minute news conference \u2014 the longest he said he had given in almost a decade \u2014 and attempts to reveal more about himself and his family life, Mr. Rubio said he was opening up as a way to \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d about him.\n\nDoing so, he hopes, will help shatter the caricature of him as mechanical and stilted that developed after last week\u2019s Republican debate, when he repeated himself four times.\n\nAt the Christian school outside Greenville, Mr. Rubio wistfully described the importance of having his family travel with him.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEvery morning when I wake up,\u201d he said, with his family at his side, \u201cI get to see my kids, even if for a brief moment.\u201d\n\nHe also toed the conservative line on social issues that are important to many voters here. When asked about same-sex marriage, he said that he hoped and believed that the Supreme Court would eventually overturn its decision that the Constitution guarantees a right to such marriages.\n\nAnd when asked about the removal of the Confederate flag from the State House grounds in Columbia, he said in the interview that while he thought the South Carolina lawmakers had eventually made the right call, it was their decision alone to make.\n\nAnd as president, he said, he would not have weighed in. \u201cI\u2019m not sure a president is a positive contributor to that debate,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160211211956, "twitter": {"description": "Senator Marco Rubio, opening a more aggressive phase of his campaign, suggested Thursday that Donald J.
