The former presidential candidate is stumping for Republicans ahead of the midterms. John Bazemore/AP\n\nPresident Barack Obama hasn\u2019t been welcome in Senate battlegrounds this election cycle, but Mitt Romney \u2013 who once worried he'd be a \u201closer for life\u201d \u2013 has proved to be a valuable commodity for the Republican Party on the campaign trail.\n\n[READ: Mitt Romney's Third Act]\n\nRomney\u2019s not on a ballot his year, but he\u2019s using whatever political capital he has left to fire up the GOP base. This week, Romney\u2019s campaigning for Republicans in Georgia, Colorado, Michigan, Louisiana and Kentucky, and his practiced role of criticizing the Obama administration has come in handy as the GOP seeks to nationalize closely contested Senate elections.\n\nIn Colorado on Monday, Romney managed to attract hundreds of residents to a local high school, where he attacked Obama for the rise of the Islamic State group and shortcomings of the Affordable Care Act. At a Michigan banquet hall on Thursday, he'll enliven supporters at the \u201cComMITT to the Comeback Rally.\u201d\n\nEven as a twice-crushed Republican presidential contender, Romney has emerged in the 2014 midterm election cycle as an amicable party elder and a foil on the trail for the unpopular Obama. He\u2019s a stark reminder for voters of what they could have had in the White House, with the goal of reminding them it\u2019s not too late to realize their mistake and elect a Republican-controlled Senate to hold Obama accountable.\n\n\u201cRomney can appeal to swing voters who have soured on the president\u2019s agenda and realize we need a Republican Senate to act as a check on the president\u2019s power over the next two years,\u201d says Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for Romney.\n\nBut Romney\u2019s not just swooping in and stumping for candidates at fundraisers and public events in the final weeks of the campaign \u2013 he's been active since the beginning of the cycle. Romney took risks early on and endorsed Republicans in contentious primaries. He even appeared in an ad for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce touting business-minded GOP Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho.\n\n[ALSO: Chris Christie's Birthday Party and the Elephant in the Room]\n\nEven as the Republican bench of potential presidential candidates in 2016 appears deep with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio all possible contenders, Romney\u2019s name is still in the mix. His visibility on the campaign trail has caused some to wonder if the former Massachusetts governor might have another presidential run in him, and photographs of a smiling Romney shaking hands at rallies begs the question of whether he's ready to retire for good.\n\nRomney\u2019s fueled the rumors by refusing to completely shut the door on the speculation.\n\n\"We'll see what happens,\" he said in a recent interview with The New York Times Magazine.\n\nNo matter what 2016 brings, however, there's no doubt Romney\u2019s efforts in 2014 prove he is a resilient figure.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "the-ballot-2014/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Mitt Romney Hits the Campaign Trail, Fuels Rumors of Comeback", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The former presidential candidate is a key surrogate for Republicans in the 2014 midterms.", "title": "Romney Hits the Campaign Trail, Fuels Comeback Rumors", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/ballot-2014/2014/10/02/mitt-romney-hits-the-campaign-trail-fuels-rumors-of-comeback", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c1/0a/9ddc9d9d4ed29d36fad67ba95526/141002-romney-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Mitt Romney Hits the Campaign Trail, Fuels Rumors of Comeback", "description": "The former presidential candidate is a key surrogate for Republicans in the 2014 midterms.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 2, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lauren Fox,Pulse,picks,Romney, Mitt,2014 Congressional elections,Republican Party,politics,campaigns,Politics [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The former presidential candidate is a key surrogate for Republicans in the 2014 midterms."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd9ce\"", "article_summary": "Mitt Romney greets the lunch crowd at The Varsity restaurant in Atlanta on Wednesday.\n[READ: Mitt Romney's Third Act]Romney\u2019s not on a ballot his year, but he\u2019s using whatever political capital he has left to fire up the GOP base.\nJohn Bazemore/APPresident Barack Obama hasn\u2019t been welcome in Senate battlegrounds this election cycle, but Mitt Romney \u2013 who once worried he'd be a \u201closer for life\u201d \u2013 has proved to be a valuable commodity for the Republican Party on the campaign trail.\nNo matter what 2016 brings, however, there's no doubt Romney\u2019s efforts in 2014 prove he is a resilient figure.\nHe even appeared in an ad for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce touting business-minded GOP Rep.
