It is business as usual. Babies are being born, the sick are being taken care of in the ER, clinics, and ICU. The medical staff, nurses, and support staff, continue to do the amazing job of keeping the safety-net hospital open and flourishing for our community.\n\nMyself and my fellow doctors are very saddened by Harry Weis' leaving. Harry did a fantastic job of financially turning around the hospital under very difficult circumstances. He was remarkable in his unwavering understated leadership through many difficult times. The financial successes he engineered year after year will be part of his legacy. Under his steady leadership the hospital has not only recovered, but has grown to add services which include bariatric surgery and vaginal birth after Caesarian section (Vbac), the only hospital in the county offering this service. Harry will be greatly missed by all of us. We wish him and his family all the best.\n\nLevel II Trauma is coming to Natividad. This is no accident. Harry and the administrative leadership of the hospital, Dr. Gary Gray, chief medical officer; Daniel Leon, chief financial officer; Andrea Rosenberg, administrative assistant; Dr. Alex Di Stante, trauma director, and many others have worked with an incredible sense of mission and determination to make this a reality.\n\nThere will be changes at Natividad. The will be a new CEO. One thing that will not change is the commitment to excellence of every person who works there.\n\nOur mission continues.\n\nJim Hlavacek, MD, is chief of staff of Natividad Medical Center\n\nRead or Share this story: http://bit.ly/1rN2amp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "One thing that will not change at Natividad is every person's commitment to excellence.", "og": {"site_name": "The Salinas Californian", "description": "One thing that will not change at Natividad is every person's commitment to excellence.", "title": "At Natividad Medical Center, our mission continues", "url": "http://www.thecalifornian.com/story/opinion/2014/07/28/natividad-medical-center-mission-continues/13291863/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thecalifornian.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One thing that will not change at Natividad is every person's commitment to excellence.", "creator": "@salnews", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db37794507ab15783c1a8291933affbea6df90d1/c=0-0-1200-1200&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Salinas/2014/07/28/soapbox.jpg", "title": "At Natividad Medical Center, our mission continues", "site": "@salnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=871223774", "fb": {"app_id": 149812628403064}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc730\"", "article_summary": "Jim Hlavacek, MD, is chief of staff of Natividad Medical CenterRead or Share this story: http://bit.ly/1rN2amp\nI get this question all the time, especially now with the unfortunate and untimely departure of Harry Weis, the CEO.\nThe medical staff, nurses, and support staff, continue to do the amazing job of keeping the safety-net hospital open and flourishing for our community.\nMyself and my fellow doctors are very saddened by Harry Weis' leaving.\nLevel II Trauma is coming to Natividad."}
