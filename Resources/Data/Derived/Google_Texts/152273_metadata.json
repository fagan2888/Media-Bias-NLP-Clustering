At this point, in fact, the best way to know Trump\u2019s next move may be to find out whatever it is most pundits are expecting; because the complete opposite will probably happen instead.\n\nSo I\u2019m not going to join the New Republic\u2019s Jeet Heer in prophesying doom for Trump 2016, not just yet. But I think he\u2019s right to wonder if Trump hasn\u2019t crossed a Rubicon of sorts with his recent attack on Dr. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and peerless grifter who may snatch the Iowa caucuses from Trump\u2019s hands \u2014 and who Trump likened to a \u201cchild molester\u201d on Thursday.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has made a huge mistake,\u201d Heer writes. Not because comparing an opponent to a child molester is beyond the pale \u2014 which it obviously is, even for Trump \u2014 but because Carson, Heer says, \u201cis far and away the most personally popular candidate in the GOP race.\u201d (That\u2019s true, by the by; a recent poll showed that 71 percent of Republicans view Carson favorably, with only 18 percent seeing him in a negative light.)\n\nEven if they don\u2019t think he should be the next president, in other words, Republicans love them some Ben Carson. And while that isn\u2019t necessarily reason enough for Trump to go easy on the good doctor, the difference between Carson and other recipients of Trump\u2019s bile, Heer writes, is that Republicans want to like Carson \u2014 they almost need to like him, in fact. Why? For reasons of both ideology and electoral politics. Heer continues:\n\n[Carson\u2019s] inspiring life story speaks to large constituencies in the party, ranging from evangelical Christians who love tales of redemption, to economic conservatives who treasure Horatio Alger narratives of the poor pulling themselves up by their bootstraps. As a successful black man who supports hard-line conservative policies, he\u2019s a cherished piece of evidence that the GOP is as it claims to be: a party for all races.\n\nAs a general description of how Trump is misreading his audience, I think Heer is on the money. (And if you doubt that Republicans care about being perceived as bigoted, just check out how popular the \u201cAll the Democratic candidates are white!\u201d talking point is among the #tcot crowd.) But there\u2019s a reason why I\u2019m not quite willing to co-sign his view that the attack on Carson could be Trump\u2019s downfall.\n\nHe\u2019s got the basic dynamic right. The problem is, he\u2019s looking at the wrong candidate. Because if anything Trump said on Thursday undoes him, it won\u2019t be his broadside against Carson. It\u2019ll be his equally transgressive attack on Marco Rubio, the Florida senator and pseudo-frontrunner who seems to be the only GOPer who understands how to deal with Trump on his own terms. Rubio \u201cwants amnesty,\u201d Trump said. And he wants it because he\u2019s Hispanic.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will The Donald's attacks on Carson and Rubio spell doom for him?
