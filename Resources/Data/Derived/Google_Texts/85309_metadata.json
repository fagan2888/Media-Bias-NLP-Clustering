Murrell Smith (R-Sumter) has introduced legislation to loosen the state\u2019s certificate of need restrictions on the ability of health providers to build or open new health care facilities.\n\nSmith\u2019s bill would create several new exemptions, making it easier for new providers to add facilities.\n\nThe bill would exempt capital expenditures by health care facilities from certificate of need (CON) approval requirements if the funds are used to expand existing health services or those previously approved, as well as for new hospital beds.\n\nBarton Swaim, communications director for the South Carolina Policy Council (SCPC), says Smith\u2019s law is an important first step in bringing competition to the state\u2019s health care marketplace.\n\n\u201cCON laws are like any other regulation; they are barriers to anyone wanting to enter the market,\u201d Swaim said. \u201cIf a certain institution, say, offers lackluster service, in many cases that institution is protected from competition as long as a competitor can\u2019t get a certificate.\u201d\n\nSwaim says there is little or no evidence CON laws have lowered the costs of medical care or improved access to it.\n\nLittle Evidence of Success\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s CON laws require medical providers to obtain government approval before offering new services, expanding the size of a health care facility, or purchasing certain medical equipment costing more than $600,000.\n\nAccording to the SCPC, there are currently a combined 20 different medical services and items of medical equipment that require CON approval in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Carolina is one of 36 with CON laws, which were established with the expectation they would slow the rise of health care costs, in large part by limiting duplication of services and expensive technology. Research suggests CON laws have failed to achieve their goal.\n\nA recent study for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University by professors Thomas Stratmann and Jacob Russ found CON laws not only raise the price of medical care by preventing new medical providers from competing with existing hospitals, but they also reduce the availability of medical equipment and hospital beds.\n\nThe authors found states with CON laws had 99 fewer hospital beds per 100,000 residents and lower availability of MRI services, CT scanners, and optical and virtual colonoscopies.\n\nOther research has generally found similar results, and data from the Kaiser Family Foundation show health care costs are 11 percent higher in CON states than in non-CON states.\n\n\u2018Corruption Waiting to Happen\u2019\n\nSwaim says he\u2019s concerned about the inherent danger of corruption in the state\u2019s CON system.\n\n\u201cIn South Carolina, CON laws have placed more power in the hands of a few lawmakers,\u201d Swaim said. \u201cThey exercise huge powers over state agencies like the one that administers the CON program \u2026 which means CON certificates tend to go to groups that know the right lawmakers. In a system lacking transparency like ours, CON laws are corruption waiting to happen.\u201d\n\nGov. Nikki Haley (R) has announced her opposition to CON laws, and she vetoed funding to administer the program in July 2013, but her veto was overturned by the South Carolina Supreme Court in April 2014.\n\nOthers in South Carolina are pushing for the full repeal of CON, as opposed to Smith\u2019s effort to create new exemptions. Vanessa Anderson, policy director for Americans for Prosperity\u2013South Carolina, argued for full repeal in a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chair Rep. Brian White (R-Anderson).\n\n\u201cCertificate of Need restricts access to health care, increases costs, and further complicates the bureaucratic maze that is Obamacare,\u201d Anderson wrote. \u201cIt is neither compassionate, nor fair to demand that the most vulnerable pay out-of-control rates for procedures that could be done at a much lower cost.\u201d\n\nSwaim says he doubts a full repeal will be passed.\n\n\u201cIn South Carolina, lawmakers rarely just get rid of pernicious laws or taxes,\u201d Swaim said. \u201cWhat they do instead is carve out exemptions for their friends, allies, or just whoever has the best lobbyist.\u201d\n\nMatthew Glans (mglans@heartland.org) is a senior policy analyst at The Heartland Institute.\n\nInternet Info\n\n\u201cDo Certificate of Need Laws Increase Indigent Care?\u201d Thomas Stratmann and Jacob Russ, Mercatus Center: https://www.heartland.org/policy-documents/do-certificate-need-laws-increase-indigent-care", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "South Carolina state Rep.
