They complain that she has too much control over who sees the president. That she skews his decision-making with her after-hours visits. That she is an incorrigible yes-woman. That she has, in effect, become the chief architect of his very prominent and occasionally suffocating bubble.\n\nThere is an element of truth to this critique. While aboard Air Force One at the end of the 2012 campaign, Jarrett turned to Obama and told him, \u201cMr. President, I don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re not getting eighty-five percent of the vote.\u201d The other Obama aides in the cabin looked around in disbelief before concluding that she\u2019d been earnest.\n\nStill, Jarrett\u2019s role is far more textured than this narrative would suggest. She has served as a teller of hard truths, urging Obama to clean up his initial remarks about Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates\u2019s arrest in 2009, which, she worried, sounded disrespectful to police. She is an all-wise interpreter of the president\u2019s thoughts. When the White House began taking flak for its man-cave sensibilities, senior officials consulted Jarrett to figure out where Obama stood. \u201cThe White House counsel Greg Craig stopped by,\u201d recalls a former Jarrett aide. \u201cHe was like, \u2018Hey, is the president worried about this?\u2019\u201d (He was.) Jarrett even plays the role of advance dining scout for the Obamas, locating restaurants discreet and exacting enough to serve the first family. (Fiola Mare in Georgetown has become a standby.)\n\nSo adept is Jarrett at catering to the president\u2019s needs that Michelle Obama has, at least on one occasion, chafed at the portrayal of their relationship. Late in the 2008 campaign, Vogue published a long profile of Jarrett titled \u201cBarack\u2019s Rock.\u201d According to a senior campaign aide, Michelle sniffed about the magazine bestowing a title that she considered hers.\n\nJarrett\u2019s job may be nothing less than to reflect the most authentic version of Barack Obama back at himself. \u201cMy speculation has always been, when you are any president or Democratic nominee, at the pinnacle of American political power, you are necessarily surrounded by layer and layer of bureaucracy,\u201d says a former White House aide. \u201cYou\u2019re completely disconnected. For someone to come to you and say, \u2018I am going to be the person who is your connection to the real you\u2019 ... is very attractive.\u201d\n\nAnd Jarrett is, in turn, our connection to the real Barack Obama. A decade after his ascent, there is still a basic unknowability about him, a puzzling gap between his talents and the public\u2019s enthusiasm for his years in office. No wonder Jarrett inspires such fevered theorizing. She is the closest we have to a human decoder ring\u2014the only person who can solve the mystery of why this president has left so many feeling so unfulfilled.\n\nThe Clinton alumni Obama initially hired to run his White House and hash out his economic policy were flamboyantly centrist, fanatical about winning over financial markets and moderate voters. In their view, a Democratic president could make no bigger mistake than becoming a captive of the left. And they acted as if they owned the place.\n\nThey certainly didn\u2019t view Jarrett as much of a threat. She had enjoyed real clout on the campaign, but the way she used it\u2014encouraging Obama to give his famous race speech, and bringing Latinos, blacks, gays, and women into the heart of the operation at a time when the post-racial rhetoric had gotten thick\u2014didn\u2019t win her much respect. Even after Obama made Jarrett a senior adviser and put her in charge of outreach to constituency groups, her lack of Washington experience made her easy to dismiss. \u201cLarry Summers\u2019s office was literally across the floor [from ours],\u201d says a former Jarrett aide of the president\u2019s top economic adviser. \u201cIt was amazing how little he looked at her, talked to her. It was so clear he kind of wanted ... nothing to do with her.\u201d\n\nThat was a mistake. Jarrett was a beloved figure among the fresh-faced Obama-hands who flocked to Washington. She shepherded their careers, clucked about their health, and turned up unexpectedly at weddings and maternity wards. And though she had been a confidant of Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s since the early \u201990s, the three became even closer after the election. It gradually became clear that she had the president\u2019s blessing to challenge his top brass and better align his White House with the outsider ethos of his candidacy.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Obama called in Summers, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, and other members of the economic team to discuss their plan for reforming the financial system. The president was generally pleased with the product, but concerned that it wasn\u2019t aggressive enough. \u201cI want you to go think about, if we were going to do something more in three or four areas, what would they be?\u201d Obama told them, according to a former administration official. \u201cBring me a proposal.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, the economic team presented their ideas to other White House staffers, but not the president. They\u2019d tacked on only the most marginal of changes. \u201cNo, we were right the first time. We shouldn\u2019t do anything else,\u201d is how the official sums up their basic message. Although Jarrett said she didn\u2019t think they\u2019d done what Obama had instructed them to do, they brought the proposal to him anyway. The president responded as though he\u2019d been primed against it. \u201cHe comes in and says, \u2018This is not what I asked for,\u2019\u201d says the official. \u201cYou can be sure she talked to the president first.\u201d\n\nJarrett\u2019s inescapable presence made her an object of fear and scorn. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty toxic,\u201d says another former administration official. \u201cShe went to whatever meeting she wanted to go to\u2014basically all of them\u2014and then would go and whisper to the president. Or at least everyone believed she did. ... People don\u2019t trust the process. They think she\u2019s a spy.\u201d\n\nBut Jarrett\u2019s involvement clearly served the president well. Over the next several months, Jarrett set up meetings between Obama and more hawkish reformers like former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Bill Donaldson. Eventually, Obama took up Volcker\u2019s idea of blocking taxpayer-backed banks from making speculative bets, which both Summers and Geithner had resisted.\n\nJarrett also made her influence felt among the men who plotted Obama\u2019s political strategy. In the spring of 2010, Donna Brazile, a New Orleans native and Democratic elder who ran Al Gore\u2019s presidential campaign, watched with horror as the administration slow-played its response to the BP oil spill. After weeks of back-channeling to White House political director Patrick Gaspard, Brazile finally took her frustration public. \u201cOne of the problems I have with the administration is that they\u2019re not tough enough,\u201d she said on ABC. \u201cThey are waiting for BP to say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve got a new plan to stop the oil leak.\u2019 They need to stop it, contain it, clean it up.\u201d\n\nThis set off a debate within the White House over whether the president should call Brazile, until, according to a former aide, chief of staff Rahm Emanuel shut it down in favor of his longstanding view that \u201cthe worst thing you could possibly do is reward bad behavior.\u201d Jarrett did not consider the matter settled, however. She waited until she and Gaspard were safely away from Emanuel and inside the Oval Office, at which point she asked Gaspard a leading question about the utility of a call. \u201cSounds good, get her on the phone,\u201d the president replied. Jarrett called Brazile and handed her cell phone to Obama.\n\nThe move validated every one of her rivals\u2019 fears. And, as with Summers, personal grievances may have explained it. Emanuel had objected to Jarrett\u2019s portfolio at the start of the administration and questioned the secret-service detail she maneuvered to receive a few months later. In return, Jarrett seemed keen to undermine him.\n\nAt one point, Obama personally ordered Emanuel to rein in his habit of screaming at subordinates. Emanuel soon lost his cool at a subsequent meeting and received another talking-to from the president. He was convinced that Jarrett had ratted him out. It was the sort of tradecraft Emanuel himself might have admired had he not been on the receiving end. As a former White House official told me: \u201cIn the wild, they would have been natural allies. In captivity, they became natural enemies.\u201d\n\nWhatever the case, calling Brazile was unquestionably the right approach. A few months later, the administration pressured an African American Department of Agriculture employee named Shirley Sherrod to resign after right-wing journalists circulated a video of her appearing to denigrate poor whites. Within a few days, it became apparent that the clip was egregiously out of context and that the ouster of Sherrod, whose husband had been a prominent civil rights leader, was unfair. Critics were furious at the trigger-happy White House\u2014Jim Clyburn, the House\u2019s third-ranking Democrat, told The New York Times he didn\u2019t think a \u201csingle black person was consulted before Shirley Sherrod was fired.\u201d For her part, Brazile was far less cutting than she had been during the BP spill. She didn't single out the administration for blame.\n\nJarrett\u2019s work behind the scenes served the president well so long as people like Larry Summers, Rahm Emanuel, and Robert Gibbs (the former press secretary, with whom Jarrett also clashed) remained inside the building. She diversified the views he received without stifling internal debate. But then, one by one, the big personalities left. After two years, Summers and Gibbs had been replaced by far more amenable actors; Emanuel\u2019s strong-willed successor, Bill Daley, lasted less than a year before being replaced by a relative cipher, too.\n\nToday, Obama\u2019s top economic adviser is Jeff Zients, a former management consultant and Jarrett pal who had no experience in government before joining the administration. The senior adviser seat that David Axelrod once occupied now belongs to Dan Pfeiffer, and the chief of staff is Denis McDonough. Both joined Obama in 2007 and have long since made their peace with Jarrett\u2019s influence. \u201cMy sense is Denis does his best to not turn that into a reckoning kind of relationship,\u201d one former White House official told me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to test it.\u201d\n\nAs Jarrett has outlasted her rivals, it has increasingly fallen on her to do more than simply protect Obama from those who might undermine his presidency. She must nudge him when he becomes self-satisfied and rein in his worst political impulses. It is a position for which she is uniquely unqualified.\n\nValerie Jarrett is not above keeping a shit list\u2014or as hers was titled, a \u201cleast constructive\u201d list. One progressive activist recalls Jarrett holding the document during a meeting and noticing her own name on it, along with the names of others in the room. \u201cIt was kind of an honor,\u201d the activist told me. This was not out of character for Jarrett. The woman who once resisted Emanuel\u2019s commandment against rewarding bad behavior has often gone out of her way to suppress dissent among ideological allies and others who question the president. (A White House official says the document was prepared by a staffer acting without orders and that it is not a common practice.)\n\nConsider her interactions with the LGBT community when they agitated for an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors. Jarrett had been one of the Obama team\u2019s biggest supporters of gay rights since the campaign (long before Obama himself \u201cevolved\u201d on the marriage question). She had even authored a memo advising the president to sign the executive order. But when Obama decided against it in 2012, he dispatched Jarrett to deliver the news to four or five groups active on the issue.\n\nThe meeting was a minor fiasco. A BuzzFeed reporter had broken word of the gathering just before it began, prompting Jarrett to lecture everyone in the room for several minutes about speaking to the press. She fumed that the reporter was outside \u201cwriting stories,\u201d and told the activists that \u201cwe can\u2019t have White House meetings if you do this kind of thing.\u201d\n\nThen, after ticking off the administration\u2019s good deeds on behalf of gays, Jarrett offered no rationale for why Obama was shelving the executive order. She held out the possibility of a study to gauge the order\u2019s effect on business, even though the question had been studied to death. About halfway through the meeting, Jarrett finally produced an explanation: a likely legal challenge. But the legal precedent was clear thanks to executive orders banning other forms of discrimination.\n\nHad Jarrett leveled with the activists\u2014conceding that the decision was political, probably intended to avoid a backlash among business\u2014none of the groups would have been pleased, but many probably would have accepted the verdict and kept details out of the press. The previous fall, the Human Rights Campaign had commissioned a poll showing overwhelming, bipartisan support for the executive order, but declined to make it public for months so as not to embarrass the administration. The Center for American Progress, another group in attendance, had encouraged the LGBT community to abide by a moratorium on public pressure to allow for negotiation.\n\nInstead, the reaction to the meeting was woeful, epitomized by a scathing Washington Post piece quoting the activists. \u201cThere was a blowup,\u201d says one longtime advocate. \u201cPeople were withholding money. ... Straight donors, gay donors were like, \u2018What is this?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen the president made Jarrett his ambassador to the world outside the White House, he did so with a specific purpose in mind: to communicate how important he considered these relationships. \u201cYou know she\u2019s speaking for the president, more so than anyone else on the staff,\u201d says a trade association leader who\u2019s met with Jarrett multiple times.\n\nBut Jarrett\u2019s obsessiveness about control, and her response to even good-faith criticism, are often self-defeating. \u201cShe just cuts off. It\u2019s stone cold,\u201d says one person who received this treatment. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be a conversation.\u201d A former administration official recalls publicly registering a gentle, offhand criticism of the White House, only to draw a one-line e-mail from Jarrett: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me first?\u201d Even Jarrett\u2019s most benevolent comments\u2014\u201cI want you to be my best friend,\u201d she likes to say\u2014implicitly threaten an abrupt loss of favor.\n\nWith the LGBT community, the agita subsided thanks to the president\u2019s unplanned turnabout on gay marriage the following month. (Obama finally signed the executive order this July.) But on other issues, her heavy-handedness has been more costly. Earlier this year, after House Republicans rejected John Boehner\u2019s overtures on immigration reform, a number of activist groups turned their attention away from Congress and toward the White House. They wanted Obama to sign an executive order protecting illegal immigrants from deportation over the next few years, the way he had back in 2012 for those brought to the country as minors.\n\nThe pressure mounted when Janet Murgu\u00eda, president of the National Council of La Raza, one of the largest and most established Latino rights groups, gave a speech in March calling out both Boehner for having \u201cpulled the plug on legislation\u201d and Obama for denying he had \u201cthe authority to act on [his] own.\u201d Echoing a line that was circulating on the left, she dubbed Obama \u201cthe deporter-in-chief.\u201d\n\nA week and a half later, the president and Jarrett summoned representatives from 15 to 20 reform groups to the White House for a meeting. Unlike the gay rights meeting two years earlier, there was no directive about keeping the discussion out of the press. But the activists were later told that the success of the meeting would be judged by the media coverage. \u201cEven if you think that, it was like, \u2018Eeeewww,\u2019\u201d says one of the reformers who attended. \u201cI was embarrassed by the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe president was in a foul mood, spending most of the next two hours lecturing the activists. You guys are turning on me, Obama said, according to several attendees. That\u2019s what Republicans want, you\u2019re taking the pressure off Boehner. If I was a GOP strategist, I\u2019d be thrilled by what you\u2019re doing. When some of the activists pointed out that the situation in the House was hopeless, Obama would interrupt and talk over them. (Administration officials say Boehner had assured them he would take another shot at the legislation.)\n\nFinally, when it was Murgu\u00eda\u2019s turn to speak, she tried to put her earlier remarks in context. She explained that, while she\u2019d been critical of the administration, she had also criticized Republicans and had urged her community to elect a more amenable Congress. \u201cIt took him what felt like ten minutes\u2014it was probably thirty seconds\u2014to compose himself. You could just feel the tension,\u201d says one activist in the room. Whereupon Obama fell into an extended monologue: You\u2019ve been around this town. You know the press will only report criticism of me. The La Raza president looked on the edge of tears as he spoke. Meanwhile, \u201cValerie was sitting next to him, staring, giving Murgu\u00eda stink eye,\u201d says the activist.\n\nRelations with groups that had been critical only grew worse from there. Some were scrubbed from White House e-mail lists, not invited to subsequent meetings, or both. Another activist recalls not hearing from the White House for months, only to get a passive-aggressive e-mail after leveling a harsh critique of the president. \u201cI don\u2019t work for you,\u201d the activist wrote back.\n\nIn late June, the president reversed course and effectively promised to sign the sought-after executive order by the end of the summer. Some of the critics had been rehabilitated, but not Murgu\u00eda, who was left out of the Rose Garden event where the president announced his decision. \u201cIt was such a shitty thing to do,\u201d says one of the activists of Murgu\u00eda\u2019s treatment. In any case, the president soon changed his mind yet again. In September, he announced that he wouldn\u2019t consider the order until after the election. Suddenly, all the bad will that had built up throughout the year came pouring forth. \u201cWhere we have demanded leadership and courage from both Democrats and the president, we\u2019ve received nothing but broken promises and a lack of political backbone,\u201d the head of a prominent pro-immigration group told the Post.\n\nJarrett\u2019s highly disciplined outreach effort had been a tactical mess. While the White House held some two-dozen meetings to take the pulse of activists throughout the summer, there was rarely a meaningful back-and-forth on strategy, especially in the run-up to the big announcements. \u201cIt does make it hard for dissenting voices to be raised,\u201d says another activist who deals with the administration on the issue. \u201cAlmost everything is raised to the level of personal loyalty.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton White House was porous and chaotic, with numerous staffers working numerous angles at any given moment. But it made advocates feel like part of the process. \u201cPeople protected them more with the press,\u201d says one of the activists. \u201cNo one protects Obama. Part of being hermetically sealed is, if you don\u2019t want shit to leak, the higher the premium is on leaks, which gives advocates more of an incentive to leak.\u201d In fact, it\u2019s precisely because the activists don\u2019t feel listened to that they speak to the press. And when the White House complains, it exposes itself even further. \u201cThey show you where they\u2019re vulnerable,\u201d says the activist. \u201cIf you\u2019re worth your salt as an activist, that\u2019s where you hit them. See: \u2018deporter-in-chief.\u2019\u201d\n\nJarrett isn\u2019t always standoffish when outsiders are critical. After business leaders complained about the president\u2019s occasional populist flourish\u2014most notably his late 2009 comment that \u201cI did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers\u201d\u2014Jarrett began pressing Axelrod and the speech-writing team to strip potentially inflammatory lines from his public statements. \u201cValerie viewed Wall Street and the business community as a constituency and was generally uncomfortable with expressions of chastisement toward Wall Street,\u201d Axelrod told me by e-mail.\n\nOn one level, it was Jarrett\u2019s job to soothe the fragile egos of corporate executives. The relationship between the White House and business is one of the many relationships that Jarrett\u2019s Office of Public Engagement formally oversees. But on a deeper level, Jarrett fundamentally empathized with the concerns of business in ways she sometimes didn\u2019t with other groups. \u201cYou could tell she felt at home with private-sector business leaders,\u201d says a former aide. \u201cEven health care\u2014it was a presidential priority, the entire White House was involved. But I\u2019d never seen her animated until it was CEOs talking about health care.\u201d\n\nThis may seem at odds with Jarrett\u2019s first-term role as Obama\u2019s liberal id. But back then she was largely acting in opposition to the Clintonites around Obama. In terms of who she believes has the power to make or break the presidency, and therefore who needs access to the highest levels of the White House, Jarrett is not so different from her nemeses.\n\nJarrett was groomed from birth to be a thoroughly establishment figure\u2014her family\u2019s roots in Chicago go back several generations\u2014and she accepted her destiny gracefully. She worked as a corporate lawyer and later ran Mayor Richard Daley\u2019s housing and transit authorities. When Harvard Law Professor David Wilkins conducted a study of the Chicago legal world in the late \u201990s, he found that most of the city\u2019s lawyers were acquainted with Jarrett. \u201cValerie is the liaison between the white North Shore elites and the black South Sides elites,\u201d he told David Remnick in The Bridge, a biography of Obama. Upon accepting the White House job, Jarrett resigned from no fewer than seven corporate and nonprofit boards.\n\nAny casual follower of Jarrett\u2019s West Wing comings and goings these days will notice a distinct fondness for big shots, corporate or otherwise. It\u2019s not just that Jarrett is a fixture at the standard A-list events\u2014parachuting into New York for Time magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People Gala, popping into a birthday party for Britain\u2019s Prince George. Jarrett also inhabits a much more rarefied plane than the standard Washington eminence. She attends the highest-profile arguments at the Supreme Court and often accompanies the president on fund-raising trips to New York, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley. She recently made a cameo on \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and appeared in a Billie Jean King documentary.\n\n\u201cShe went to whatever meeting she wanted to go to\u2014basically all of them\u2014and then would go and whisper to the president,\u201d says a former White House official. \u201cPeople don\u2019t trust the process. They think she\u2019s a spy.\u201d\n\n\u201cValerie\u2019s probably best known as the go-to person for the real opinion leaders in business and in the celebrity world,\u201d says a former administration official. By contrast, she can come across as bored when meeting with the political world\u2019s grayer operators. One leader of an influential but relatively anonymous advocacy group recalls arranging a meeting with Jarrett to explain how his team was advancing a cause dear to the president. \u201cI felt like she was looking at her watch. She was annoyed that I even felt it was reasonable for me to meet with her,\u201d says this person. \u201cHow dare I take up her time?\u201d\n\nIn some cases, this outlook has served the administration well. Jarrett made an ally of Rupert Murdoch on immigration reform and soothed Silicon Valley in the tense moments after the NSA revelations. \u201cShe has very strong relationships with Facebook and Google,\u201d says her fellow senior adviser, John Podesta.\n\nJarrett also helped mastermind the public-relations campaign to enroll seven million Americans in Obamacare prior to this March\u2019s deadline. She spent months fine-tuning a plan to reach the uninsured \u201cwhere they are,\u201d by which she meant enlisting the figures they look to for guidance: community leaders, DJs, pop-culture icons. \u201cI can remember dozens of times going back to her with plans, having this x\u2019d out and that crossed out. This person is a bad idea for this, not that,\u201d recalls an aide. Jarrett excelled at making the biggest asks personally. \u201cWhen it came to getting other major people involved\u2014you know, Zach Galifianakis, an LL Cool J tweet in the Grammies, Katy Perry\u2014we were like, \u2018We need to have Valerie make this call, sit in on this meeting,\u2019\u201d says Anton Gunn, one of the administration officials in charge of the enrollment push.\n\nBut in other cases, Jarrett\u2019s establishmentarianism has simply reinforced the administration\u2019s blind spots. There is, for example, Jarrett\u2019s underappreciated influence in an area like budget policy. After Republicans took control of the House in 2011, Obama had to decide whether to stick with his efforts to boost the fragile economy or join in the deficit-cutting that Republicans were demanding. He opted for the latter, agreeing to slice billions from the 2011 budget. While some administration economic officials argued for staring down the House GOP, the approach never had a chance. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a huge debate because [former adviser David] Plouffe and Bill [Daley] and Valerie agreed,\u201d a senior White House official told me later that year.\n\nThe White House believed that avoiding a fight was better for the economy and would help the two sides reach an even bigger deal later on\u2014one that raised taxes and cut trillions in spending over ten years. This was flawed in two ways. First, notwithstanding the enthusiasm for deficit-cutting on the set of \u201cMorning Joe\u201d (where Jarrett is an occasional guest), it was a perverse priority at a time when the country still faced an unemployment crisis. Second, the White House completely misunderstood the psychology of House Republicans, who took Obama\u2019s concessions as a vindication of their anti-spending mania and repeatedly balked at tax increases. Inexplicably, the White House continued to pursue a deal for years after the GOP showed its bad faith, efforts that Jarrett supported as well.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only time she got burned by assuming good intentions. In 2010, Jarrett met with members of the Business Roundtable, a group representing the largest corporations in the country. She was proud that she had dialed back the president\u2019s occasional verbal salvos and hoped it might win him some support in exchange. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Last time I was here, you guys told us the key thing was the rhetoric,\u2019\u201d recalls a former colleague. \u201c \u2018Look at the president\u2019s speeches. They\u2019re very different in tone based on your input.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s chairman took this all in, then offered the all-too-predictable response. \u201cYes, yes, we noted that,\u201d he said, according to the colleague. \u201cWe have five other objections.\u201d\n\nThe Obama era has been deeply disorienting for the left. Eight years ago, progressives would have delighted at the idea of a president who withdrew from Iraq, remade the rules for Wall Street, slowed the proliferation of greenhouse gases, brought the country within spitting distance of universal health care, and multiplied the rights of gays and lesbians. And yet it\u2019s hard to be a self-respecting progressive these days and not feel a frustration that borders on disillusionment. The victories have been muddled, the errors unforced, the ambitions preemptively scaled back.\n\nHow could these two legacies coexist in one presidency? They emanate from the worldview that Jarrett and Obama share\u2014call it \u201cboardroom liberalism.\u201d It\u2019s a worldview that\u2019s steeped in social progressivism, in the values of tolerance and diversity. It takes as a given that government has a role to play in building infrastructure, regulating business, training workers, smoothing out the boom-bust cycles of the economy, providing for the poor and disadvantaged. But it is a view from on high\u2014one that presumes a dominant role for large institutions like corporations and a wisdom on the part of elites. It believes that the world works best when these elites use their power magnanimously, not when they\u2019re forced to share it. The picture of the boardroom liberal is a corporate CEO handing a refrigerator-sized check to the head of a charity at a celebrity golf tournament. All the better if they\u2019re surrounded by minority children and struggling moms.\n\nNotwithstanding his early career as a community organizer, Obama, like Jarrett, is fundamentally a man of the inside. It\u2019s why he put a former Citigroup executive and Robert Rubin chief of staff named Michael Froman in charge of assembling his economic team in 2008, why he avoided a deep restructuring of Wall Street, why he abruptly junked the public option during the health care debate, why he so ruthlessly pursues leakers and the journalists who cultivate them. It explains why so many of his policy ideas\u2014from jobs for the long-term unemployed to mentoring minority youth\u2014rely on the largesse of corporations.\n\nIt\u2019s the boardroom liberal in Obama who gets bent out of shape over criticism from outsiders, despite having once urged progressives to press him the way civil rights activists like A. Philip Randolph pressured Franklin Roosevelt. He is a president profoundly uncomfortable with populist rhetoric. He prefers to negotiate behind closed doors, as he did on the stimulus, health care, and deficit reduction, rather than wage a state-by-state political campaign to force concessions. Except for a handful of moments over the last six years\u2014like when the administration tried to pass a second stimulus bill known as the American Jobs Act\u2014Obama has rarely tried to mobilize public opinion in any sustained fashion. He has been consistently slow and half-hearted about taking unilateral action.\n\nBill Clinton was in many ways more conservative than Obama, whom you couldn\u2019t imagine signing a draconian welfare law, or an anti-gay-marriage law, or, for that matter, de-regulating Wall Street. But Clinton was not above riling up voters for partisan gain. By August of 1995, the year Republicans took over Congress, Clinton and his surrogates were flogging them daily over \u201cMedicare, Medicaid, education, and the environment.\u201d When Republicans retook the House in 2011, Obama spent most of the year shunning partisan taunts in hopes of consummating a grand bargain. And Jarrett was there at his side, amplifying those sensibilities. \u201cThe context for that is that it\u2019s consistent with who the president is,\u201d Jarrett\u2019s first-term chief of staff, Michael Strautmanis, told me. \u201cShe has only one agenda. And it is the president\u2019s agenda\u2014either from conversations he\u2019s had with her, what she\u2019s heard him say, or based upon their history together.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, the way the White House runs these days does even less to check Obama\u2019s inclinations. According to a former high-level aide, there is no longer a daily meeting between the president and his top advisers. Under the old system, if the president waved off one adviser\u2019s objection to his preferred plan of action, another could step in to vouch for the objection\u2019s merit. The advice Obama gets now, though, comes more regularly through one-off interactions with the likes of Jarrett and Denis McDonough, who don\u2019t have anyone else to back them up. In the second term, observes the former aide, \u201cMaybe the president says, more often than in the past, \u2018We\u2019re doing it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe result is that Obama has become even more persuaded of his righteousness as the years have gone on. His belief that he can win over opponents is unshaken. Unfortunately, these opponents include a party in the throes of radicalism and a self- interested class of ultra-rich that increasingly calls to mind plutocracy\u2014not people whose better instincts you can appeal to. Obama and Jarrett should know this. Any time they have made preemptive concessions to the GOP or business leaders, their negotiating partners have simply pocketed the concessions and asked for more. From the budget battles to immigration reform, they have consistently overestimated the ability of Republican elites to reason with their rank and file. As recently as early this year, the official White House position was that it preferred Congress to ban workplace discrimination against gays. Congress!\n\nPerhaps no episode illustrates this mind-set better than the fate of the consumer agency that the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill created. In 2010, Jarrett and two other advisers persuaded Obama to install a genuine populist in the person of Elizabeth Warren to set up the agency. But they never intended for her to actually run it, a promotion Warren aggressively sought. \u201cHaving Warren in the short-term role was their elegant solution,\u201d says a former administration official. \u201cIt was the best way to appease the left while preserving [Obama\u2019s] reasonableness to business. That\u2019s what drives him: Do they look reasonable? ... That\u2019s what Valerie\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Barack Obama and Valerie Jarrett would govern as reasonable people. It\u2019s who they are. The tragedy is that we live in surpassingly unreasonable times.\n\nCORRECTION: This story initially said that Donna Brazile \"limited her kvetching to private phone calls and struck her best 'we\u2019re all in this together' posture\" during the Shirley Sherrod episode.
