In the video which was sent only to those who have signed up for his campaign email lists, the president again pitches the \"tech surge\" intended to fix Healthcare.gov. And he appeals for help...?\n\n\"I am asking for your help,\" he says. \"I'm asking you to be a part of Team Obamacare. We won't be able to reach everyone who deserves the safety and security of affordable health insurance without you.\"\n\nWhat does that even mean? Is he turning Obamacare into a door-to-door Amway campaign now?\n\n\"I'm asking you to help tell your friends, families, coworkers, classmates, neighbors and anyone else about what the Affordable Care Act can mean for them.\"\n\nYep. Obamacare is Amway now. Actually, that's unfair to Amway, which sells lots of useful products, and which actually does pay its salespeople. Obama wants his supporters to become his sales force, for free.\n\nWatch the president's surreal video here.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Your President Wants You to 'Join Team Obamacare' and Shut Up About the Website's Problems Already | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "Does he do anything, besides talk and fundraise?", "title": "Your President Wants You to 'Join Team Obamacare' and Shut Up About the Website's Problems Already", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/your-president-wants-you-to-join-team-obamacare-and-shut-up-about-the-websites-problems-already/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2013/10/obama-videopitch.jpg", "updated_time": 1464072249, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Does he do anything, besides talk and fundraise?", "title": "Your President Wants You to 'Join Team Obamacare' and Shut Up About the Website's Problems Already", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/your-president-wants-you-to-join-team-obamacare-and-shut-up-about-the-websites-problems-already/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/31/files/2013/10/obama-videopitch.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Your President Wants You to 'Join Team Obamacare' and Shut Up About the Website's Problems Already | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "Your President Wants You to 'Join Team Obamacare' and Shut Up About the Website's Problems Already", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0518\"", "article_summary": "Your President Wants You to 'Join Team Obamacare' and Shut Up About the Website's Problems AlreadyYour President Wants You to 'Join Team Obamacare' and Shut Up About the Website's Problems AlreadyPresident Obama has followed up his bizarre Rose Garden Obamacare pitch with an equally bizarre online video.\n\"I'm asking you to be a part of Team Obamacare.\nObamacare is Amway now.\nIn the video which was sent only to those who have signed up for his campaign email lists, the president again pitches the \"tech surge\" intended to fix Healthcare.gov.\nIs he turning Obamacare into a door-to-door Amway campaign now?"}
