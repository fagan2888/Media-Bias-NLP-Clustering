The drink menu these days is as critical as the food menu as it influences a customer\u2019s restaurant experience, as well as a restaurant\u2019s branding strategy and growth.\n\n\"Being a fast casual restaurant is all about being on trend,\" Elizabeth Friend, senior analyst at Euromonitor International, said during Monday at the Fast Casual Executive Summit in Miami. \"The most interesting growth we\u2019re seeing in beverages is in lighter flavorings.\"\n\nThe three major beverage trends for 2016 will be \"adult\" sodas involving mixology, more innovation in coffees and teas, and sophisticated juices. Those \"adult\" sodas and mixology (with or without alcohol) reflects a new world in the beverage experience, said Friend.\n\nThis also includes \"sparkling\" beverages, which are often being handcrafted as customers are seeking sophisticated flavors, especially bitter and sour.\n\n\"Mixology equals experience,\" Friend said. \"A lot of this trend is being driven because sugar and sweet are not the main drivers anymore.\"\n\nMore coffee and tea innovation is also trending. There are many ways coffee and tea can be served such as cold-brewed tea and new espresso drinks.\n\n\"Coffee is not just for coffee shops anymore,\" Friend explained, as quality coffee drinks can be made and served at all kinds of restaurants.\n\nSophisticated juices are gaining in popularity. Green, herbal, functional, refreshing, and juices that are not too sweet lead the pack.\n\n\"Sophisticated juices is all about packaging and presentation,\" Friend said. \"People want a sense of discovery, something they can talk about.\"\n\nEnsuring a fast casual\u2019s beverage program is the right one is vital as consumers have endless choices in beverages.\n\nTo determine what to put on the drink menu and what to leave off requires restaurants to identify some important factors.\n\n\"You have to ask, \u2018Is it a right fit?\" said Scott Davis, creative director and managing partner of Culinary Concepts Group. \"What capabilities do you have in your restaurant concept?\"\n\nThat's why having a beverage program plan is essential. Do you want your beverages to drive restaurant traffic or the check average, are questions that require answers.\n\n\"You don\u2019t want beverages to be a meal replacement,\" Davis warned.\n\nHaving beverages integrate with the brand is an important consideration and how to make that integration happen requires a strategy. Does your staff have the capability to make quality, handcrafted beverages and do so consistently, for example. Does your restaurant have the proper equipment to make a major beverage program change?\n\nMike Remes, corporate chef for Burger 21, said fast casual operators can win with their customers by making beverages as important as the food offerings and making sure there is a clear brand connection that provides a strong customer experience.\n\n\"Go beyond the \u2018better burger experience,'\" Remes said. \"Be fun. Be playful. Be nostalgic with something that reminds you of your childhood.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beverages are an important aspect of the consumer dining experience and play a critical part of a restaurant\u2019s branding efforts.
