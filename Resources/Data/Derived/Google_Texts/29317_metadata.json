McAuliffe points with his liberal base in Virginia. (Molly Riley/AP)\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe will make a renewed push to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act this week when he presents legislators with a budget plan that calls for extending the government health-care program to 400,000 uninsured Virginians.\n\nThe planned announcement is widely seen as symbolic given fierce opposition to expansion in the GOP-dominated House. But the move has raised Republican hackles if not hopes among expansion advocates, setting the stage for more partisan warfare in a Capitol where a more collegial \u201cVirginia way\u201d once held sway.\n\nMcAuliffe (D) devoted much of his first year in office to his chief campaign promise, first by trying to woo House Republicans, then by seeking to find a way around the General Assembly. Failing on both fronts, he seemed to turn his focus to job creation.\n\nBut this month, McAuliffe\u2019s health secretary indicated that the governor was gearing up for Round 2. Health and Human Resources Secretary William A. Hazel Jr. told reporters that he expected Medicaid to be \u201ca big topic again\u201d in the legislative session that begins in January.\n\nFew people expect McAuliffe to devote as much political capital and energy to this second push as he did to the first. But keeping the issue alive could win him points with his liberal base, as will other seemingly quixotic battles, such as trying to persuade the Republican-controlled General Assembly to tighten restrictions on guns.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a realist on it,\u201d said former Virginia Commonwealth University political scientist Bob Holsworth. \u201cI think he wants to make a statement.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe will present a plan to expand Medicaid on Wednesday morning, when he proposes amendments to the current two-year budget to House and Senate money committees. His proposal, first reported by the Associated Press, projects that the program would generate savings of $100 million in 2016. But it sets that money aside for future use instead tapping it to help the state close a $322 million shortfall.\n\nMcAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy declined to discuss the Medicaid plan, except to say, \u201cI will not dispute\u201d the AP article, which was based on unidentified sources.\n\n\u201cThe governor has been pretty clear that he believes this is a moral, fiscal and economic imperative,\u201d Coy said.\n\nHouse Majority Leader M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d to hear that the governor would include Medicaid expansion in the budget amendments given that the House voted overwhelmingly three times this year to reject expansion.\n\nReviving the Medicaid issue will only make it harder to find common ground on areas where bipartisan agreement is possible, such as job creation and veterans affairs, Cox said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help, to be blunt,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThat issue was very divisive last year.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe and a slim bipartisan coalition in the state Senate have supported expansion under President Obama\u2019s signature health-reform law. They say it would provide needy Virginians with health care, help hospitals hurt by Affordable Care Act cuts and create more than 30,000 jobs.\n\nHouse Republicans are staunchly opposed to extending an entitlement program to able-bodied adults. They also doubt the federal government can afford to bankroll most of the $2 billion-a-year cost.\n\nCritics of expansion noted that the budget plan sets aside the projected $100 million in Medicaid savings, seeing it as evidence that even McAuliffe knows expansion will not happen.\n\n\u201cI think that speaks volumes as to what the governor\u2019s expectations and his purpose\u201d are, said Sen. Mark D. Obenshain (R-Harrisonburg).\n\nSome Democrats gave McAuliffe credit for not giving up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth trying,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Richard L. Saslaw (D-Fairfax).\n\nSaid Sen. Janet D. Howell (D-Fairfax): \u201cIt\u2019s the time of year when miracles happen.\u201d\n\nBut even some advocates for expansion conceded that the expansion plan was not likely to go anywhere.\n\nSen. John C. Watkins (Powhatan) is one of three moderate Senate Republicans who this year supported a form of expansion that would have used the federal money to buy private insurance for enrollees. Coy declined to say whether McAuliffe would propose that sort of \u201cprivate-option plan\u201d or more conventional Medicaid expansion.\n\nBut either way, Watkins doubted McAuliffe would win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s trying to pick as many fights as he can,\u201d Watkins said, also noting McAuliffe\u2019s announcement on gun restrictions. \u201cHe\u2019s going to hit all the issues, I guess.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democrat will make his announcement when he presents legislators with a budget plan.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Democrat will make his announcement when he presents legislators with a budget plan.", "title": "Virginia Gov.
