Mark Udall\u2019s staff did nothing improper in pressuring an agency to revise its health-insurance cancellation figures.\n\nState Insurance Commissioner Marguerite Salazar defended the Democratic senator at a Tuesday legislative hearing, saying that testy email exchanges like the ones between his aides and state regulators happen \u201call the time.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies on Tuesday rejected a request for an investigation into whether Mr. Udall\u2019s staff tried to intimidate state Division of Insurance employees into downsizing the Obamacare-spurred cancellation figures.\n\nSEE ALSO: GOP: Colorado\u2019s Udall pressured state to \u2018trash\u2019 health insurance figures\n\n\u201cThere is no information to support an allegation of real (or perceived) intimidation, or inappropriate or undue pressure,\u201d said department Executive Director Barbara Kelley in a letter. \u201cThere was a disagreement among staff about how to characterize the data.\u201d\n\nA series of emails released last week by the website Complete Colorado showed that Mr. Udall\u2019s staff challenged state regulators after they released figures in November showing that nearly 250,000 Coloradans had received health-insurance cancellation notices.\n\nOne email from Jo Donlin, director of external affairs for the state insurance division, said that Mr. Udall\u2019s staff \u201cwants to trash our numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSen. Udall says our numbers were wrong. They are not wrong. Cancellation notices affected 249,199 people. They want to trash our numbers. I\u2019m holding strong while we get more details,\u201d said Ms. Donlin in a Nov. 14 email.\n\nColorado Republicans, outraged by the apparent exoneration of Mr. Udall and his staff, accused state bureaucrats of trying to help Mr. Udall out of a jam. Ms. Salazar was appointed by Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper, who also appoints the heads of state agencies.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Regulatory Agencies can run interference on behalf of Sen. Udall and his abusive staff if it chooses, but the intimidating emails from Udall\u2019s staff speak for themselves,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Amy Stephens, who filed the request for an investigation.\n\nMs. Stephens is one of several Republicans seeking the party\u2019s nomination to run against Mr. Udall, who is up for re-election in November.\n\n\u201cThis incident remains unprecedented in Colorado where a United States senator and his staff attempted to intimidate a state agency to falsify public records to help that senator\u2019s political agenda,\u201d said Ms. Stephens.\n\nRep. Cory Gardner, Colorado Republican, described Ms. Salazar\u2019s downplaying of the episode as \u201cspin gone wild,\u201d according to the Colorado Observer.\n\n\u201c[S]he\u2019s a Democratic appointee and she is answering to a Democratic governor who is doing everything he can to try and cover for one of the most vulnerable U.S. senators in the nation for an election coming up in just a few months,\u201d said Mr. Gardner.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Gardner released a letter Tuesday from the state Division of Insurance showing that 335,484 Coloradans have now received health-insurance cancellations as a result of the Affordable Care Act, up 86,285 from the number reported in November.\n\nMr. Udall\u2019s staff argued that the vast majority of those receiving cancellations were immediately offered new policies that met the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expanded requirements, although critics argue that the renewals also came with higher premiums.\n\nUdall spokesman James Owens said in a statement that the \u201cproductive interaction\u201d between the Senate staff and state insurance officials \u201chelped the Division of Insurance arrive at a number that has more relevance for health care consumers because cancellations with renewal options are different from cancellations without renewal options.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was Sen. Udall\u2019s objective all along \u2014 to ensure that the vast majority of Coloradans who received notice became aware that they could re-enroll in a health insurance plan,\u201d said Mr. Owens.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Mark Udall, Marguerite Salazar, Division Of Insurance, Colorado Department Of Regulatory Agencies", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/15/republicans-cry-foul-colo-regulators-clear-sen-uda/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/09/c864cfc7487d7201480f6a7067008932.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Republicans cry foul as Colorado regulators clear Sen.
