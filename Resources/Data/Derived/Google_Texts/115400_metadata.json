The federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services is sticking to an Oct. 1 deadline to roll out the updated and vastly expanded system known as ICD 10.\n\nGet ready for a paperwork meltdown at the medical office.\n\nThere are hundreds of other crazy codes in the new system, many that would make you shake your head. Search yourself if you don\u2019t believe me, at icd10data.com.\n\nThe parrot bite is hardly novel. The new system has all sorts of codes for injuries at the beaks of birds, whether pecked by a turkey, snapped by a duck, or struck by a macaw (which, as far as I know, is a kind of parrot). And if you\u2019re unlucky enough to be in a spacecraft collision, your hospital better not pass it off as a run-of-the-mill outer orbit crash. For this they must select among specific subcodes to get paid for treating spacecraft injuries.\n\nRemember the poor guy who got sucked into a jet engine? What could a \u2018subsequent encounter\u2019 possibly be?\n\nThe new medical code book also demands highly specific details about where the injury took place. It\u2019s not good enough that it happened at a cultural event. There are separate codes for injuries at museums, art galleries, music halls, theaters, and opera houses.\n\nOf course, the really ridiculous codes won\u2019t mean much as a practical matter. But the expanded system would turn a standard one-page \u201csuper bill\u201d summarizing, say, services at the Orthopedic Department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center into a 278-page tome. The number of codes to describe a basic injury like a sprained wrist would balloon from four to 72.\n\nCompanies that specialize in medical information technology, such as athenahealth Inc., of Watertown, are working overtime to adapt systems to the new codes and make it easier for medical providers to make the correct choices quickly.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to do this but we have to,\u201d says Jasmine Gee, director of product marketing at athenahealth. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to make it not seem not like a daunting endeavor.\u201d\n\nThe federal government is behind the push to adopt the new ICD 10 standards in the United States, but the codes were actually endorsed by the World Health Organization more than two decades ago. Other countries have been using them for years.\n\nMost US health care providers will need to use the big new code book for medical record keeping. But some \u2014 largely hospitals \u2014 will have to use the ICD 10 codes on their bills if they want to get paid. Medical information executives in America can\u2019t complain too much about updating the current system, established more than 40 years ago. But health care providers and insurers say the time and expense is a strain because they are also spending big to adapt to the Affordable Care Act, electronic medical records, and other initiatives at the same time.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts estimates it\u2019s spending $45 million to incorporate the 10 code. Halamka says Beth Israel is spending $5 million \u2014 from a total IT operating budget of $30 million.\n\nThey\u2019re spending the money because there\u2019s no choice.
