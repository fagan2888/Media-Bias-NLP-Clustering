Criticize him, Matthew Tully learned, and you\u2019ll hear from his fans. A lot of his fans. One of them agreed to meet and explain The Donald\u2019s appeal.\n\nMichael Gaskey of Indianapolis at the Illinois Street Food Emporium on Monday. (Photo: Matthew Tully)\n\nI don\u2019t get it.\n\nYep, I admit it, not only do I consider Donald Trump to be the most glaring example of all that is wrong with American politics, but I also don\u2019t get what his supporters see in him. I\u2019ve watched the debates, the interviews and the speeches, and I\u2019ve read what would amount to several books about him.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t get it.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I expect to come to an agreement with him on a policy level. Barring a series of severe concussions, that\u2019s never going to happen. But I can usually understand a popular politician\u2019s appeal, or see why so many voters consider a candidate to be presidential material. Not this time.\n\nIt can\u2019t just be the bombast and the insults. There has to be more. I want to understand. I want to get it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where Michael Gaskey came in.\n\nGaskey is a retiree who grew up in Pittsburgh, made a career in information technology, and now lives with his wife in a condominium in the Butler-Tarkington area. A onetime Kennedy Democrat, he became a Reagan Republican because of his dislike of big government and then \u201cjust kept moving further to the right.\u201d He likes candidates who \u201csay what\u2019s on their minds,\u201d believes there are too few of them, and sends $50 to the Trump campaign every month \u201cjust so he knows there are little people out here who support what he\u2019s saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think the guy is a leader,\u201d Gaskey told me, \u201cand I don\u2019t think there are many people who are running that you can say that about.\u201d\n\nBefore I continue, here\u2019s a little background to give you a sense of who Gaskey is: He\u2019s 70 years old but works out most days and could pass for 60. He\u2019s a NRA-supporting, Rush Limbaugh-listening, great-grandfather of eight who likes his diverse neighborhood and thinks Fox News can be too soft on President Obama. He opposes government handouts, but the night before we talked he was at his church wrapping gifts for low-income families; he talks tough but at home he makes sure that when his wife comes home from work each night the laundry is done, dinner is on the stove, and a glass of wine is on the table.\n\nThat\u2019s Michael Gaskey. He\u2019s a nice guy.\n\nHe wrote me Sunday to criticize my recent column on Trump and then, after a few emails back and forth, agreed to meet me at a Northside breakfast joint Monday morning to explain the allure of the front-running Republican presidential candidate that he supports.\n\nAs we started our first cups of coffee, Gaskey walked me back to 1980 and President Jimmy Carter\u2019s handling of the Iran hostage crisis. He said he was embarrassed for his country and was quickly sold on Ronald Reagan \u2014 both by his conservative politics and by his way of communicating and leading that \u201cmade you hold your head high.\u201d\n\nEven though Reagan would not be conservative enough by today\u2019s standards, Gaskey said, \u201cHis decisiveness and his ability to communicate could have kept me in his fold. Which is what I like about Trump. It\u2019s the way he communicates. It\u2019s decisive, and it\u2019s from the heart. He says what he thinks.\u201d\n\nTrump has said millions of immigrants who came to this country illegally should be sent back to their home countries, and the United States should build a massive wall to protect the southern border.\n\n\u201cI absolutely love that,\u201d Gaskey said.\n\nTrump recently called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country. That backs up what Gaskey called his top concern heading into the 2016 elections: national security. He doesn\u2019t believe there is an adequate vetting process for refugees and others, and he sees Islam as a dangerous force for evil. He dismisses arguments that Islam is at its core based on peace. \u201cIt is really about convert or kill,\u201d he said.\n\nAs we talked, Gaskey and I couldn\u2019t have disagreed more, and we have wholly different criteria for what makes a good president. Where I see recklessness, he sees truth-telling. Where I see hate and discrimination, he sees a leader who cares so much that he sometimes gets carried away with his words.\n\nIn Trump, he sees \u201csomeone who has made a career of negotiating deals. I believe he is a man who will say what needs to get done and then find a way to get it done, because he always has. Sometimes that requires a compromise, but he won\u2019t fold. And that\u2019s all Congress is doing.\u201d\n\nLike many Trump supporters, Gaskey\u2019s support stems from a distrust of President Obama. It\u2019s a distrust that is so deep-seated that, admittedly, many of us cannot fully comprehend it.\n\nGaskey bought a couple of guns and signed up for a lifetime permit after hearing Obama talk about gun control, and after hearing the NRA\u2019s views about the president. When I mentioned that it seemed to me that Obama hadn\u2019t really pushed any groundbreaking gun-control ideas, Gaskey said his concern was not what Obama has done \u201cbut what he looks like he would do.\u201d\n\nThat goes beyond guns.\n\n\u201cI think Obama would clamp down on your freedom on behalf of some favored class of people,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like Trump would impact my ability to do something.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Obama, of course. Like many others driving Trump\u2019s poll numbers, Gaskey\u2019s support can be traced to a frustration with a Republican Congress he thinks has not taken on the president with full commitment. He would like to see the government shut down, and kept shut down, until Obamacare is repealed. That sentiment drove recent elections that gave Republicans control of Congress, he said, and it should be driving policy.\n\n\u201cThey are gutless,\u201d he said of congressional Republicans, sounding a bit like Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s irritating beyond belief to cast your vote for people who say they will do X, and then they get in and do Y.\u201d\n\nBut why Trump, I asked? Plenty of other Republican candidates have run on similar platforms. His answer was simple. First, the establishment is broken and has sold out the conservative masses. Second, he thinks Trump has the tenacity to stick with his promises and to take on big fights without worrying about political decorum. Although he likes Ted Cruz, Gaskey said the senator from Texas, like most candidates, is relying on big-money interests to help fund his campaign.\n\n\u201cCruz has someone paying his bills, and it\u2019s more than my neighbor and me contributing $50. If someone gives you money, you have to give something back. Trump is losing money on this campaign. He\u2019s sticking his neck out to do it.\u201d\n\nAfter a few more cups of coffee, I was still struggling to fully understand the Trump phenomenon, but I had a better sense of his appeal. The former reality show star has clearly tapped into an intense frustration with the politics of the day. At a time when so many candidates and so many campaign ads seem like they come out of a factory, he\u2019s offering a blunt message that doesn\u2019t fit into a typical political model.\n\nLike it or not, his message is direct and simple at a time when our problems are frustratingly complex and global. Trump is offering hot passion after so many years of President Obama\u2019s professorial cool. As much as I oppose what Trump has been saying, his views on immigration, Islam and what he calls a \u201cstupid\u201d political class have connected on a fundamental level with many voters.\n\nToward the end of our 90-minute chat, Gaskey perfectly summed up Trump\u2019s appeal.\n\n\u201cWhen you see him with his rants, he\u2019s basically saying what my wife and I just said to each other over dinner,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he has a recorder in our house and he\u2019s been listening to what we\u2019re saying.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful thing when a politician can tap into what people are feeling and then amplify their concerns. Trump has certainly done that. And while I still consider his rise to be the worst thing to hit American politics in a long time, I do understand that many see in him their voices and their concerns.\n\nYou can reach me at matthew.tully@indystar.com or on Twitter: @matthewltully.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1QJGeTY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "As Donald Trump leads in the polls, a fan explains why so many have embraced his message", "og": {"site_name": "Indianapolis Star", "description": "As Donald Trump leads in the polls, a fan explains why so many have embraced his message", "title": "Tully: A Trump supporter explains the appeal", "url": "http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/matthew-tully/2015/12/15/tully-trump-supporter-explains-appeal/77353580/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/indystar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Donald Trump leads in the polls, a fan explains why so many have embraced his message", "title": "Tully: A Trump supporter explains the appeal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/15/Indianapolis/B9320110256Z.1_20151215103639_000_GKPCS72Q4.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@indystar", "site": "@indystar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=559965350", "fb": {"app_id": 108716282521686}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Jimmy Carter", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Jimmy Carter", "title": "Tully: A Trump supporter explains the appeal", "author": "Matthew Tully", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists/matthew-tully", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/06ba27a0362a386e9000c02e5ad114cc3f2d85e9/c=714-0-2550-2448/local/-/media/2015/12/15/Indianapolis/B9320110256Z.1_20151215103639_000_GKPCS72Q4.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70261845367a788a3f907a9f1f073a9c7298db27/c=408-0-2856-2448/local/-/media/2015/12/15/Indianapolis/B9320110256Z.1_20151215103639_000_GKPCS72Q4.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/209496ef8e15ec974055f2b972cb017799a2d254/c=0-0-3264-2448/local/-/media/2015/12/15/Indianapolis/B9320110256Z.1_20151215103639_000_GKPCS72Q4.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5366816a2be01ce320de9a1b7d4fcd3d9671846/c=0-306-3264-2142&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/12/15/Indianapolis/B9320110256Z.1_20151215103639_000_GKPCS72Q4.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-15T18:15:16.020000-05:00", "shorthed": "Tully: A Trump supporter explains the appeal", "articleid": 77353580, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd81f7b80aef18fc9ff3cd911b276728a9998bb7/c=0-306-3264-2142/local/-/media/2015/12/15/Indianapolis/B9320110256Z.1_20151215103639_000_GKPCS72Q4.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ddfec6da1e1c49c540a50418fed8521c9471641/c=944-0-2321-2448/local/-/media/2015/12/15/Indianapolis/B9320110256Z.1_20151215103639_000_GKPCS72Q4.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "donald trump, trump voters, trump news, trump polls, trump twitter, indianapolis, indy star, indiana politics"}, "article_summary": "And that\u2019s all Congress is doing.\u201dLike many Trump supporters, Gaskey\u2019s support stems from a distrust of President Obama.\nHe\u2019s a NRA-supporting, Rush Limbaugh-listening, great-grandfather of eight who likes his diverse neighborhood and thinks Fox News can be too soft on President Obama.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like Trump would impact my ability to do something.\u201dBut it\u2019s not just Obama, of course.\nBut I can usually understand a popular politician\u2019s appeal, or see why so many voters consider a candidate to be presidential material.\nIn Trump, he sees \u201csomeone who has made a career of negotiating deals."}
