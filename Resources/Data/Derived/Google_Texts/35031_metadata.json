The batch made available Friday, containing roughly 2,000 pages, covers a variety of subjects, including the North American Free Trade Agreement among the U.S., Mexico and Canada that went into effect in 1994.\n\nIn winning congressional approval of the pact the year before, Clinton had to overcome opposition among many fellow Democrats, concerned about its effects on U.S. jobs, and it was approved due to strong support from Republicans.\n\nIn a private 1995 letter to Clinton released yesterday, then-White House aide Rahm Emanuel complained that Mexico looked to be getting \u201cthe better end of the deal\u201d on NAFTA and a $12 billion loan agreement.\n\nEmanuel, now the mayor of Chicago, wrote that an October 1995 state visit by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo hurt Clinton more with American voters than it helped him with investors.\n\n\u201cI know that Wall Street was happy with the visit, but for the rest of America it looks like we gave them $12 billion and our jobs and they give us narcotics and immigrants,\u201d Emanuel wrote to Clinton on Oct. 13, 1995. \u201cThe lack of progress on narcotics or immigration only show that the Mexicans got the better end of the deal.\u201d\n\nEmanuel had lobbied for votes on Clinton\u2019s behalf for NAFTA\u2019s ratification by Congress. His effort led some organized labor supporters to back his opponent in a 2002 Democratic congressional primary in Chicago. Emanuel won the primary and spent six years in the House of Representatives before becoming President Barack Obama\u2019s first White House chief of staff in 2009. He was elected mayor in 2011.\n\nEmanuel, who earned a reputation in Washington for his brusque manner, in his 1995 letter unloaded on colleagues that worked on the president\u2019s National Security Council staff.\n\n\u201cI know that I am in the minority and hold a contrary view, but I think the visit from Zedillo was a net loss for you and shows that we do not coordinate your politics with the NSC,\u201d Emanuel wrote. \u201cThis trip only reinforces the public\u2019s perception that we are elitist and removed from their concerns on jobs and drugs. I would only hope that in the future their would be better coordination between the NSC and your own politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jonathan Allen", "twitter": {"description": "President Bill Clinton was coached to combat the narrative that his \u201chealth-care debacle\u201d was the result of influence from his \u201cultraliberal wife\u201d and \u201cwonky\u201d elites, according to the fifth batch of Clinton administration documents released by his presidential library.", "title": "Aide to Clinton: \u2018Liberal Wife\u2019 Blamed for Health Debacle", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-06/aide-to-clinton-liberal-wife-blamed-for-health-debacle", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/it0jzejO8B9I/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Jonathan Allen", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Rahm Emanuel,Liberal,Health,Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton", "news_keywords": "Rahm Emanuel,Liberal,Health,Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-06/aide-to-clinton-liberal-wife-blamed-for-health-debacle", "parsely-title": "Aide to Clinton: \u2018Liberal Wife\u2019 Blamed for Health Debacle", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-06-07T04:00:01.007Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "President Bill Clinton was coached to combat the narrative that his \u201chealth-care debacle\u201d was the result of influence from his \u201cultraliberal wife\u201d and \u201cwonky\u201d elites, according to the fifth batch of Clinton administration documents released by his presidential library.", "parsely-tags": "Rahm Emanuel,Liberal,Health,Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-06-07T04:00:01.007Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "President Bill Clinton was coached to combat the narrative that his \u201chealth-care debacle\u201d was the result of influence from his \u201cultraliberal wife\u201d and \u201cwonky\u201d elites, according to the fifth batch of Clinton administration documents released by his presidential library.", "title": "Aide to Clinton: \u2018Liberal Wife\u2019 Blamed for Health Debacle", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-06/aide-to-clinton-liberal-wife-blamed-for-health-debacle", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/it0jzejO8B9I/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "President Bill Clinton was coached to combat the narrative that his \u201chealth-care debacle\u201d was the result of influence from his \u201cultraliberal wife\u201d and \u201cwonky\u201d elites, according to the fifth batch of Clinton administration documents released by his presidential library."}, "parsely-post-id": "N6RDA16JIJVR01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/it0jzejO8B9I/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf5d\"", "article_summary": "\u2018Fierce\u2019 Controversy\u201cThe major elements of your program were considered moderate when first proposed,\u201d Magaziner wrote to Clinton, listing talking points for the president to use.\nPresident Bill Clinton was coached to combat the narrative that his \u201chealth-care debacle\u201d was the result of influence from his \u201cultraliberal wife\u201d and \u201cwonky\u201d elites, according to the fifth batch of Clinton administration documents released by his presidential library.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to solve the problems of the health-care system without creating fierce controversy.\u201dSince February, the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas, has released thousands of pages of previously withheld Clinton administration documents.\nIn a private 1995 letter to Clinton released yesterday, then-White House aide Rahm Emanuel complained that Mexico looked to be getting \u201cthe better end of the deal\u201d on NAFTA and a $12 billion loan agreement.\n\u201cThis trip only reinforces the public\u2019s perception that we are elitist and removed from their concerns on jobs and drugs."}
