I am going to be making the case every single day, and I hope you join me,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the keynote address at the House Democrats\u2019 annual issues conference.\n\nHis speech to lawmakers gathered in a ballroom at the Sheraton Society Hill Hotel echoed the agenda he presented in his State of the Union address last week. This time, though, he egged on the friendly crowd to stand tough in support of Obamacare, deportation amnesty and what he calls \u201cmiddle-class economics,\u201d which entails higher taxes on the wealthy and businesses to pay for tax breaks and other benefits for poor and middle-class families.\n\nThose same types of polices, he said, were responsible for the nation\u2019s economic recovery, including falling unemployment, record job growth and a booming stock market.\n\n\u201cThere is no economic metric that is not better than when I took office,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThe record shows that we were right and middle-class economics does work. So the bottom line is this: We\u2019ve got to make sure it continues to work.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s Republican critics have argued that the slow recovery from the Great Recession, the worst economic tailspin in more than 70 years, occurred in spite of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, not because of them.\n\nStill, the president said the agenda he championed was an intrinsic part of what the Democratic Party stands for. Embracing it, he said, would propel the party\u2019s comeback from disastrous elections in November, for which he said he was willing to take some blame.\n\nThe president\u2019s remarks fell into a cadence reminiscent of his campaign speeches from 2008 and 2012, including a refrain in which he urged Democrats to say \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019m positive about, when we are shy about what we care about, when we are defensive about what we\u2019ve accomplished, when we don\u2019t stand up straight and proud and say, \u2018Yes, we believe that everyone in this country should have health insurance and we are glad that we are making that happen. Yes, we believe that families shouldn\u2019t be torn apart and we are glad that we are fighting for immigration reform. Yes, we believe in middle-class economics and we don\u2019t apologize for trying to make sure that some wonderful young man or young woman out there can actually afford to go to college even if their parents didn\u2019t go,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cWe need to stand up and go on offense and not be defensive about what we believe in,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are Democrats.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama also promised to veto any bills passed by the Republican-led Congress that would repeal Obamacare, loosen Wall Street reforms or rescind his executive action that grants legal status and work permits to up to 5 million illegal immigrants.\n\n\u201cIf that bill makes it to my desk, I\u2019ll be happy to veto it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe mocked House Republicans for announcing first legislation they plan to take up in February would be a bill to repeal Obamacare, saying they have tried more than 50 times to repeal his signature legislative accomplishment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost count at this point,\u201d he said.\n\nHe touted his upcoming budget, which he promises will boost spending by 7 percent \u2014 about $74 billion \u2014 split evenly between defense and domestic programs to end the automatic budget cuts known as sequestration. He said a healthy economy and shrinking deficits made it possible.\n\nThe president\u2019s fiery rhetoric dovetailed with the message, policy and political strategy adopted by House Democrats at the three-day conference, which was titled \u201cGrow America\u2019s Economy, Grow American Paychecks.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama and his House allies have honed a message that attempts to appeal to middle-class voters with promises of higher wages and demonizes Republicans for siding with the wealthy elite and against working families.\n\nRep. Steve Israel of New York, who is in charge of developing the party\u2019s political message as chairman of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, said Republicans are vulnerable to attacks for their policies that protect the rich at the expense of middle-class Americans.\n\n\u201cWhen Mitt Romney stands up and talks about his concern for the middle class, that tells us how afraid they are of this issue. They know they lose and lose badly on this issue,\u201d Mr. Israel told reporters earlier at the conference.\n\nHe said the strategy received broad support in the caucus, which has undergone a period of intense soul-searching after widespread loses in the midterm elections that gave Republicans complete control of Congress with a majority in the Senate and the largest majority in the House in nearly 100 years.\n\n\u201cThe caucus is now absolutely united around, galvanized around and mobilized around creating the contrast between the Republicans, who will consistently protect and defend corporate tax loopholes for the wealthiest, and Democrats, who are going to be out there with the gloves on, fighting every day for middle-class economic growth and opportunities for people who are not in the middle class to get into it,\u201d Mr. Israel said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama vowed Thursday to freely wield his veto power and confront the Republican-controlled Congress with an aggressive liberal agenda, as he rallied House Democrats to join him in the fight.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama vowed Thursday to freely wield his veto power and confront the Republican-controlled Congress with an aggressive liberal agenda, as he rallied House Democrats to join him in the fight.", "title": "Obama rallies House Democrats to fight for liberal agenda", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/29/obama-rallies-house-democrats-to-fight-for-liberal/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/29/3d1f71dad431a9046c0f6a706700f58b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/29/3d1f71dad431a9046c0f6a706700f58b.jpg", "description": "President Obama vowed Thursday to freely wield his veto power and confront the Republican-controlled Congress with an aggressive liberal agenda, as he rallied House Democrats to join him in the fight.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama rallies House Democrats to fight for liberal agenda"}, "Author": "S.A.
