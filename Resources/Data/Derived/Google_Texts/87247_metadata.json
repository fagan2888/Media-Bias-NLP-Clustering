The exception was the Home Health & Hospice sector, which declined 33% in year-over-year deal volume. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act generally benefited health care services M&A activity in 2015,\u201d Phillips added. \u201cThe shift to value-based outcomes and reimbursement made the post-acute sectors especially appealing for investors.\u201d\n\nHospital merger and acquisition activity remained strong in 2015, up 3% to 102 transactions, compared with 99 transactions in 2014. An average of 2.6 hospitals were involved in each transaction, compared with an average of 1.8 in 2014 and 3.3 in 2013. \u201cSeveral deals resulted from the mega-mergers of 2013,\u201d Phillips observed. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more sales resulting from bankruptcies, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid coverage.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 Health Care Services Acquisition Report, Twenty-Second Edition, contains more than 350 pages of hard-to-find information on all publicly announced hospital, managed care, laboratory services, physician medical group, behavioral health, home health and hospice, and rehabilitation mergers and acquisitions in 2015.
