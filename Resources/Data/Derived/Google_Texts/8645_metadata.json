I was always an athlete \u2014 first playing softball and basketball, later cross country and track, before I found my true love in crew and had the good fortune to row in the varsity boat for four years at Bryn Mawr College. Since graduating, I\u2019ve run the Philadelphia marathon twice, and consider my workout routine a priority.\n\nI owe my love of sports largely to my mother, who was in the first class of Title IX athletes, captain of the Penn State women\u2019s field hockey team, and competed at the international level when her options were much more limited. My mother, and the other women before me, fought tooth and nail for increased recognition of women\u2019s rights in sport. Due to their efforts, being an athlete was much more accessible to me than it was to them.\n\nBut revelations of the incredible wage and equipment disparity between women and their male counterparts during this year\u2019s Women\u2019s World Cup reveals we still have a ways to go. That despite incredible progress, the power of women\u2019s sport is not something we fully value.\n\nSports teach a remarkably important lesson to a woman \u2014 that her body is a powerful tool for her to train and apply as she pleases to support goals totally and utterly independent from anything to do with men. It is one of the most feminist things a woman can learn \u2014 that her body is strong and beautiful and hers. There are so many pressures forced upon women\u2019s bodies in our world \u2014 so much of our worth given to looking a certain way to please men. So much judgment and legal attack around the choices we make with our bodies that assert they are not really ours to make choices about.\n\nSports literally revolutionized how I thought about my own body. Sports helped me appreciate my strength and self-worth in a way I will be forever grateful for.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, a friend of mine began measuring her waist and arms and legs with a measuring tape. She started encouraging me to do the same. For a brief period of time I did. I started skipping lunch and taking measurements of my limbs and waist every morning.\n\nBut very quickly, sports saved me.\n\nAt my school, you had to pass a physical every year in order to be cleared to play.\n\nThe year of my experiments with a measuring tape, my physical revealed that I had grown almost two inches and lost a pound. I remember the doctor asked me how I felt about food and if I ever felt lightheaded.\n\nI very quickly realized that he might not clear me to play if he thought I had a \u201cproblem.\u201d So I laughed and assured him I did not. The next day I threw out the measuring tape.\n\nI wish I could say that it was a revelation there and then that my body was beautiful and strong and I was worthy, no matter what. But it wasn\u2019t. Over time, though, sports helped teach me that lesson.\n\nAfter dislocating my left shoulder a couple of times playing basketball my junior year of high school I had what would be the first of two surgeries to repair it. In this injury, sports taught me that winning isn\u2019t everything, that your body must be loved and trained responsibly, and the discipline and focus demanded in my recovery \u2014 combined with my desire to get back into the game and the supportive messages of my coaches, teammates and parents \u2014 finally sank in. And my love and respect for the competition, my love and respect for the game, finally led me to love and respect myself too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No more dieting, no more trying to look a certain way to please men -- my body is strong and beautiful and mine", "author": "Lina Blount", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "No more dieting, no more trying to look a certain way to please men -- my body is strong and beautiful and mine", "title": "Sports saved me: I was skipping lunch in middle school \u2014 until I realized I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to play if I had a \u201cproblem\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/12/sports_saved_me_i_was_skipping_lunch_in_middle_school_until_i_realized_i_wouldnt_be_allowed_to_play_if_i_had_a_problem/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/women_world_cup_team.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No more dieting, no more trying to look a certain way to please men -- my body is strong and beautiful and mine", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/women_world_cup_team.jpg", "title": "Sports saved me: I was skipping lunch in middle school \u2014 until I realized I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to play if I had a \u201cproblem\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Sports saved me: I was skipping lunch in middle school \u2014 until I realized I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to play if I had a \u201cproblem\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, women's sports, Women's World Cup", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Picks, women's sports, Women's World Cup, Life NewsI\u2019m incredibly lucky that I grew up in the post-Title IX era.\nAnd my love and respect for the competition, my love and respect for the game, finally led me to love and respect myself too.\nWhen I was in middle school, a friend of mine began measuring her waist and arms and legs with a measuring tape.\nMy mother, and the other women before me, fought tooth and nail for increased recognition of women\u2019s rights in sport.\nAt my school, you had to pass a physical every year in order to be cleared to play."}
