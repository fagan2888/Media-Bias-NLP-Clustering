Facebook\n\nSeattle Seahawks fans set a world record during yesterday\u2019s matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, making CenturyLink Field the \u201cworld\u2019s loudest stadium\u201d in the sports history. The previous record was set by fans at Ali Sami Yen Sport Complex Turk Telekom Arena in Istanbul, Turkey during a soccer match in 2011.\n\nAt the 1:15 mark in the first quarter, Seahawk\u2019s defensive end Michael Bennett sacked 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, bringing the entire Seattle fans to their feet. Guinness World Records representative Phillip Robertson recorded the noise level at 131.9 decibels, .2 decibels higher than the previous record set in Istanbul.\n\nSeahawks fans, affectionately known as the 12th man, weren\u2019t done after initially breaking the record. After running back Marshawn Lynch\u2019s second touchdown of the day in the fourth quarter, the crowd shattered both of the previously held records with 136.6 decibels, Seattlepi.com reported. This record-breaking effort was organized by former Seahawks lineman Joe Tafoya and his group Volume 12.\n\nAccording to Alison Grimes, assistant clinical professor of head/neck surgery at UCLA's David Geffen School of Medicine, people at sporting events don\u2019t understand the damage they are inflicting on their hearing. \u201cNoise in cumulative over the lifetime,\u201d Grimes told NBC News. \u201cIf you\u2019re literally talking about 130 decibels \u2013 nobody should ever be exposed to that. There isn\u2019t a safe amount of time for 130 decibels. It\u2019s physically painful as well as acoustically damaging.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "seattle, seahawks, san, francisco, 49ers, guinness, world, record, loudest, crowd", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Guinness World Record for the \"world's loudest crowd\" was shattered yesterday during the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers.", "title": "Seahawks Fans Set Guinness World Record As 'Loudest Crowd' In Sports History", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/seattle-seahawks-fans-set-guinness-world-record-loudest-crowd-sports-history-256895", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/seattle-seahawks.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Guinness World Record for the \"world's loudest crowd\" was shattered yesterday during the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers.", "title": "Seahawks Fans Set Guinness World Record As 'Loudest Crowd' In Sports History", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/seattle-seahawks-fans-set-guinness-world-record-loudest-crowd-sports-history-256895", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/seattle-seahawks.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/16/seattle-seahawks.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-16T13:25:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-16T13:25:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Guinness World Record for the \"world's loudest crowd\" was shattered yesterday during the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc974c\"", "article_summary": "The Guinness World Record for the \"world's loudest crowd\" was shattered yesterday during the matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and the San Francisco 49ers.\nFacebookSeattle Seahawks fans set a world record during yesterday\u2019s matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, making CenturyLink Field the \u201cworld\u2019s loudest stadium\u201d in the sports history.\nGuinness World Records representative Phillip Robertson recorded the noise level at 131.9 decibels, .2 decibels higher than the previous record set in Istanbul.\nSeahawks fans, affectionately known as the 12th man, weren\u2019t done after initially breaking the record.\nAt the 1:15 mark in the first quarter, Seahawk\u2019s defensive end Michael Bennett sacked 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, bringing the entire Seattle fans to their feet."}
