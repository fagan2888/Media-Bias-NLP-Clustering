2014: The year in graphics

The last year has been fruitful for information visualization at the Los Angeles Times. We’ve had some hits and a few misses, and tried some things we’ve never seen before. Our best work is collected below, including drought and earthquake coverage, statistical looks at crime, healthcare, pollution and transportation, and illustrations of events in science and technology.
