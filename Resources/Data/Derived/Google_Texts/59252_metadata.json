Sebelius pointed out that now those whose employers don\u2019t offer insurance will have another, cheaper option than the current marketplace.\n\nFor the majority of the interview, Stewart challenged Sebelius on potential confusion over the Affordable Care Act, and questioned her about the \u201cidea of staying with a market-based solution for a problem where people can\u2019t be smart consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are too many externalities in health care that I honestly don\u2019t understand why businesses wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to decouple health insurance from their responsibility, and why the government wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance to create a single-payer system that simplifies this whole \u2018garbledegook,\u2019 and creates the program that I think American deserves,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nClose video Obamacare changed this woman\u2019s life HHS Secy.

He has refused to negotiate with the GOP House on the law even as the Republicans used the health law to bring the government to a shutdown amid budget negotiations.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Comedian Jon Stewart challenged the government\u2019s health chief to a little race Monday night.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/jon-stewart-challenges-affordable-care-act", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Comedian Jon Stewart challenged the government\u2019s health chief to a little race Monday night.", "title": "Jon Stewart mocks Affordable Care Act\u2019s rocky start", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/jon-stewart-challenges-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/ap776210063876.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/jon-stewart-challenges-affordable-care-act", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ap776210063876.jpg?itok=hMX5lrFU", "height": 553}, "title": "Jon Stewart mocks Affordable Care Act\u2019s rocky start", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Comedian Jon Stewart challenged the government\u2019s health chief to a little race Monday night."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-08T12:31:54-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "traci-lee", "tags": "health,health-care-reform,media,society,martin-bashir", "contentId": "http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/10/08/jon-stewart-mocks-affordable-care-acts-rocky-start/", "title": "Jon Stewart mocks Affordable Care Act\u2019s rocky start", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/martin-bashir/jon-stewart-challenges-affordable-care-act", "date": "10/08/2013 12:31:54 EDT", "published": 1}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Comedian Jon Stewart challenged the government\u2019s health chief to a little race Monday night.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Society, Media"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcc5b\"", "article_summary": "President Obama has repeatedly defended his signature health law as bringing affordable care to under-served populations.\nA Kaiser Family Foundation/NBC survey found last month that the majority of Americans were more confused than enthusiastic about the Affordable Care Act.\nKathleen Sebelius introduces Martin Bashir to Amanda Barrett, for whom the Affordable Care Act has made her struggle with MS financially bearable.\nSebelius pointed out that now those whose employers don\u2019t offer insurance will have another, cheaper option than the current marketplace.\nSebelius mostly dodged Stewart\u2019s questions regarding the individual mandate responded that the Affordable Health Care program was intended to help the millions of Americans who are uninsured, for various reasons."}
