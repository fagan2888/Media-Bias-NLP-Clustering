(WNCN) \u2013 Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican running for re-election in 2016, visited Campbell University\u2019s medical school on Thursday.\n\nWNCN political reporter Beau Minnick had a chance to talk to Burr about multiple issues. Here are some of the highlights of their conversation.\n\nBurr on President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on gun control:\n\n\u201cI am concerned from a standpoint of what he asked governors to do. He asked governors to break the law.\n\n\u201cHealthcare privacy is a federal statute. You have to protect medical privacy of every patient.\n\n\u201cBy saying to governors, \u2018We want you to send the mental health records to the databank so that we can incorporate that in there,\u2019 One, he asked them to break a federal law.\u201d\n\nOn the 2016 election:\n\n\u201cFrom a standpoint of those Americans that were concerned with whether government has gotten too big or too intrusive in their lives, this will be an issue for them in November.\u201d\n\nOn Obamacare:\n\n\u201cThere are good things that came out of the president\u2019s healthcare plan. We shouldn\u2019t let preexisting conditions control whether somebody has access to insurance.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, \u201cWhen you look at the central promise of the Affordable Care Act, affordability, it\u2019s been anything but that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made healthcare unaffordable for many that found it affordable before.\u201d\n\nIn his role as chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he said measuring intent is critical.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re talking about Kim Jong Un, whether you\u2019re talking about ISIS, intent in many cases is a greater threat than their capabilities.\n\n\u201cIf the intent there is to do something, then we have to spend a tremendous amount of time and efforts to make sure that we\u2019re protected against that intent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
