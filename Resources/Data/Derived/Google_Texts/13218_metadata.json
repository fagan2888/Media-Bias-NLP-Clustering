Nadine Garcia, Director of the Office of Minority Health, said in a statement.\n\nA May HHS report showed a gap of 20 percentage points between the proportion of uninsured African Americans and Latinos and the turnout among those communities in the months after the October 2013 launch of the Obamacare enrollment website. Experts say a host of factors \u2014 including persistent misinformation about Obamacare and some states\u2019 reluctance to expand Medicaid \u2014 likely come into play.\n\nA survey conducted by the Commonwealth Fund in February, for example, found that less than half of Latinos in the U.S. knew about their state\u2019s health exchange, compared to 68 percent of blacks and 69 percent of whites. Latino advocacy groups say the breakdown in communication between Latinos and the federal government \u2014 caused in part by the delayed launch of the Spanish language health exchange site, CuidadoDeSalud.gov \u2014 thwarted efforts to galvanize Latinos. Even when the site later launched in December 2013, not much time passed before Spanish-speaking patrons bemoaned the translation errors and confusing navigation.\n\nImmigration concerns have also stunted insurers\u2019 attempts to increase Obamacare enrollment among Latinos. In February, The National Alliance for Hispanic Health, an organization that at one point reported 4,000 Obamacare-related phone calls, told CNN that counselors often encountered mixed-status families \u2014 groups that had at least one undocumented immigrant. Skepticism among many Latinos hasn\u2019t waned, even with Assurances by the federal government that healthcare data would not be shared with immigration officials.\n\n\u201cA lot of Latino people don\u2019t come because they\u2019re afraid,\u201d Ruben Acosta, a Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles, told Yahoo News in March shortly after he and his wife took a leap of faith and applied for health insurance. \u201cObama promised that [applicants\u2019 immigration status] information won\u2019t be shared, but he also promised he\u2019d pass immigration reform.\u201d\n\nObamacare enrollment numbers among African Americans, a historically underserved population, have also waned, but for reasons largely beyond their control. More than 2.5 million people of color live in states that have yet to expand Medicaid coverage. The coverage gap, as a result, has locked them out of health care coverage. Additionally, many African Americans don\u2019t have enough income to qualify for subsidies given to purchase private insurance through federal exchanges.\n\nYoung African Americans, a demographic that accounts for 40 percent of America\u2019s total black population, haven\u2019t been quick to sign up for Obamacare. That may be part of a larger issue when it comes to healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 34, nicknamed \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d. Members of this group may have not accessed health care before the rollout of Obamacare, giving many of them little incentive to participate in the federal health program.\n\nBut health officials say that African Americans stand to benefit the most from Obamacare\u2019s offerings \u2014 including preventative and specialized care \u2014 that could help them proactively tackle a host of ailments including diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension. Last December, Kathleen Sebelius, then health and human services secretary, raised this point in the midst of a Medicaid expansion fight in Georgia, a state with the second highest number of uninsured African Americans.\n\n\u201cThe health care law is working to address long standing disparities in health care coverage and improve the health of the African-American community,\u201d said Sebelius in a press statement. \u201cThrough the Health Insurance Marketplace, 6.8 million uninsured African Americans have new options for affordable health coverage that covers a range of benefits, including important preventive services with no out of pocket costs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Federal government officials have their sights turned on minorities who have yet to sign up for health plans through the marketplaces.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Federal government officials have their sights turned on minorities who have yet to sign up for health plans through the marketplaces.", "title": "Why The Government Is Trying To Increase Obamacare Outreach To Blacks And Latinos", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/12/3566820/obamacare-outreach-minorities/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP607454687059.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Federal government officials have their sights turned on minorities who have yet to sign up for health plans through the marketplaces.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP607454687059-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why The Government Is Trying To Increase Obamacare Outreach To Blacks And Latinos", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP607454687059.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP607454687059.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-12T10:32:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd872a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe health care law is working to address long standing disparities in health care coverage and improve the health of the African-American community,\u201d said Sebelius in a press statement.\nImmigration concerns have also stunted insurers\u2019 attempts to increase Obamacare enrollment among Latinos.\nThe coverage gap, as a result, has locked them out of health care coverage.\nHealth Why The Government Is Trying To Increase Obamacare Outreach To Blacks And Latinos CREDIT: AP Photo/Nick Ut Esther Guzman, left, gets insurance information from Janelle Hartley, right, Thursday March 13, 2014, during a Covered California rally in Los Angeles.\nYoung African Americans, a demographic that accounts for 40 percent of America\u2019s total black population, haven\u2019t been quick to sign up for Obamacare."}
