Tribe recently filed comments with the EPA saying that the Clean Power Plan is \u201ca remarkable example of executive overreach and an administrative agency\u2019s assertion of power beyond its statutory authority.\u201d\n\nUnder the Clean Power Plan, the EPA will set targets for each state by identifying the \u201cbest system of emission reductions,\u201d according to the White House. The White House release says it will be up to the states to decide how best to meet lower emission expectations, but Tribe says that the agency simply does not have the authority to enact the Clean Power Plan.\n\nAccording to an article Tribe wrote for The Wall Street Journal, the EPA would use the Clean Power Plan to dictate the energy mix used in each state and leave the state with no choice in implementing its plan to lower carbon emissions. In a precedent set more than 20 years ago in New York v. United States (1992) and reaffirmed by a 7-2 vote as recently as 2012 in NFIB v. Sebelius, (the ObamaCare decision), holds that such federal commandeering of state governments defeats political accountability and violates basic principles of federalism.\n\nThe legal justification for this rule is Section 111 of the 1970 Clean Air Act, but Tribe says the EPA\u2019s interpretation of Section 111 is flawed. In reality, \u201cthis part of the law expressly says that it may not be used to regulate power plants where, as is the case in this situation, those plants are already being regulated as Congress contemplated under another part of the law, Section 112,\u201d says Tribe.\n\nTribe accuses the Clean Power Plan of taking power not given to it by Congress, and that despite frustration felt from congressional inaction, the EPA should not be allowed to use the Clean Power Plan to decide the energy mix used in each state.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) agrees, saying that current regulations work, and that adding more regulations would severely damage the economy. \u201cThe EPA\u2019s regulations are working,\u201d said Howard Feldman, API senior director of regulatory and scientific affairs. The EPA\u2019s own data shows that under current regulations, ozone levels in the U.S. declined by 18% between 2000 and 2013, an API report claims. \u201cNew standards could significantly damage the economy by imposing unachievable emission targets on almost every part of our country,\u201d said Feldman.\n\nAccording to the API lowering the standards for emissions from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 60 ppb would put 46 of the lower 48 states out of compliance. The regulations would also cost $270 billion per year and risk millions of jobs, according to estimates from NERA Economic Consulting.\n\nImportant disclosures: The information provided herein is believed to be reliable; however, EnerCom, Inc. makes no representation or warranty as to its completeness or accuracy.
