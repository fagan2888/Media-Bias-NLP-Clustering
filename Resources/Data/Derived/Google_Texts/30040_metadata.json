I would not have been scared, except that I traveled with my wife and our four children, aged 5, 7, 14 and 18. On our last taxi ride, we could not find a van to fit us all, so we rode in two taxis. Mine carried me and my two daughters, aged 5 and 14, while the driver blasted Willie Nelson singing \u201cCity of New Orleans\u201d (a city that is also considered very dangerous).\n\nIt was a surreal moment, traveling in one of the most dangerous cities in the world with my babies in tow. I gave a nod to the radio. \u201cWillie,\u201d I said, and he gave me a grin and vigorous \u201cs\u00ed.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of American cowboy culture in Honduras, but along with silly hats, Honduras has also taken one of our other worst ideas\u2014libertarian politics. By the time I\u2019d made it to San Pedro Sula, I\u2019d seen much of the countryside and culture. It\u2019s a wonderful place, filled with music, great coffee, fabulous cigars and generous people, but it\u2019s also a libertarian experiment coming apart.\n\nPeople better than I have analyzed the specific political moves that have created this modern day libertarian dystopia. Mike LaSusa recently wrote a detailed analysis of such, laying out how the bad ideas of libertarian politics have been pursued as government policy.\n\nIn America, libertarian ideas are attractive to mostly young, white men with high ideals and no life experience that live off of the previous generation\u2019s investments and sacrifice. I know this because as a young, white idiot, I subscribed to this system of discredited ideas: Selfishness is good, government is bad. Take what you want, when you want and however you can. Poor people deserve what they get, and the smartest, hardworking people always win. So get yours before someone else does. I read the books by Charles Murray and have an autographed copy of Ron Paul\u2019s \u201cThe Revolution.\u201d The thread that links all the disparate books and ideas is that they fail in practice. Eliminate all taxes, privatize everything, load a country up with guns and oppose all public expenditures, you end up with Honduras.\n\nIn Honduras, the police ride around in pickup trucks with machine guns, but they aren\u2019t there to protect most people. They are scary to locals and travelers alike. For individual protection there\u2019s an army of private, armed security guards who are found in front of not only banks, but also restaurants, ATM machines, grocery stores and at any building that holds anything of value whatsoever. Some guards have uniforms and long guns but just as many are dressed in street clothes with cheap pistols thrust into waistbands. The country has a handful of really rich people, a small group of middle-class, some security guards who seem to be getting by and a massive group of people who are starving to death and living in slums. You can see the evidence of previous decades of infrastructure investment in roads and bridges, but it\u2019s all in slow-motion decay.\n\nI took a van trip across the country, starting in Copan (where there are must-see Mayan ruins), across to the Caribbean Sea to a ferry that took my family to Roatan Island. The trip from Copan to the coast took a full six hours, and we had two flat tires. The word \u201ctreacherous\u201d is inadequate\u2014a better description is \u201cpost-apocalyptic.\u201d We did not see one speed limit sign in hundreds of kilometers. Not one. People drive around each other on the right and left and in every manner possible. The road was clogged with horses, scooters and bicycles. People traveled in every conceivable manner along the crumbling arterial. Few cars have license plates, and one taxi driver told me that the private company responsible for making them went bankrupt. Instead of traffic stops, there are military check points every so often. The roads seemed more dangerous to me than the gang violence.\n\nThe greatest examples of libertarianism in action are the hundreds of men, women and children standing alongside the roads all over Honduras. The government won\u2019t fix the roads, so these desperate entrepreneurs fill in potholes with shovels of dirt or debris. They then stand next to the filled-in pothole soliciting tips from grateful motorists. That is the wet dream of libertarian private sector innovation.\n\nOn the mainland there are two kinds of neighborhoods, slums that seem to go on forever and middle-class neighborhoods where every house is its own citadel. In San Pedro Sula, most houses are surrounded by high stone walls topped with either concertina wire or electric fence at the top. As I strolled past these castle-like fortifications, all I could think about was how great this city would be during a zombie apocalypse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My family and I traveled last month to a Honduras city known for its libertarian ideals.
