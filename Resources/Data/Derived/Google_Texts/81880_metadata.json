We received many stellar questions including one that we\u2019re guessing is on the minds of many of you: What specifically can we do to fix our economy?\n\nTurns out, Reich has a clear plan of action \u2014 which he lays out in this video \u2014 to ensure there is \u201cupward mobility again, in our society and in our economy.\u201d He also believes that political engagement by all Americans will help \u201cchange the rules\u201d that created the widening income gap between the top one percent and everyone else, and contributed to the Great Recession. Reich has set up a \u201ctake action\u201d area on the film\u2019s website, where he is promoting actions we can take to improve the future health of America\u2019s economy.\n\nInequality for All opens on September 27, 2013. (See Bill\u2019s interview with the film\u2019s director, Jacob Kornbluth.)\n\nAnd thank you to all our Facebook fans for the intelligent contribution you make to Bill\u2019s on-going conversation about America\u2019s democracy.\n\nBe sure to tune in this weekend to Moyers & Company to see the entire interview with Robert Reich.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Reich shares his plan of action for making our economy healthier and better for everyone.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "Robert Reich shares his plan of action for making our economy healthier and better for everyone.", "title": "Clip: Robert Reich\u2019s Plan for Fixing America\u2019s Economy | Moyers & Company | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130912_0190-Reich_promo.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://billmoyers.com/segment/robert-reich%e2%80%99s-plan-for-fixing-america%e2%80%99s-economy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robert Reich shares his plan of action for making our economy healthier and better for everyone.", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130912_0190-Reich_promo.jpg", "title": "Clip: Robert Reich\u2019s Plan for Fixing America\u2019s Economy | Moyers & Company | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"tag": "robert reich"}, "pubdate": 20130918, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe68\"", "article_summary": "Clip: Robert Reich\u2019s Plan for Fixing America\u2019s EconomyAhead of Bill\u2019s interview with economic analyst Robert Reich about Inequality for All, his new documentary about America\u2019s widening income gap, we asked our smart, engaged community on Facebook what they wanted Bill to ask Reich.\nBe sure to tune in this weekend to Moyers & Company to see the entire interview with Robert Reich.\n(See Bill\u2019s interview with the film\u2019s director, Jacob Kornbluth.)\nAnd thank you to all our Facebook fans for the intelligent contribution you make to Bill\u2019s on-going conversation about America\u2019s democracy.\nReich has set up a \u201ctake action\u201d area on the film\u2019s website, where he is promoting actions we can take to improve the future health of America\u2019s economy."}
