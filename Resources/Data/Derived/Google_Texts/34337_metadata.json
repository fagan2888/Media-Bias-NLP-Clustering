But cable TV can do bad things even to good people.\n\nOn Friday night, MSNBC host Chris Hayes and I discussed Obamacare on the Bill Maher show.\n\nAmong other things, I made the point\u2014not original to me\u2014that Obamacare's rules are accelerating the trend to part-time work.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Chris returned to his own MSNBC show to deliver an after-the-fact rebuttal.\n\nChris even brought a chart, to buttress his contention that the trend to part-time labor was driven by the 2008 recession, not 2010 Obamacare regulations:\n\nThere's some truth to what Chris says. But mixed with that portion of truth is a larger portion of polemic and apologetic.\n\n\n\nThe reporter who has most closely studied the question of Obamacare and part-time work, Jed Graham of Investor's Business Daily, makes the important point that not all part-time jobs are created equal. To see Obamacare's effects in action, Graham argues, you have to focus on the low-wage end of the work force. In these sectors, a legislated increase in costs can have big impacts on hours and wages. To demonstrate this impact, Graham has charts of his own: four of them.\n\nThe overall economy has been recovering since the summer of 2009. In a recovery, you'd expect to see more people working\u2014and working longer hours. What we're seeing instead is a continuing trend away from full-time work in the most wage-sensitive economic sectors.\n\nThat's the point Chris Hayes ignored.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201309270945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/davidfrum", "description": "As a general rule, I have a lot of time for Hayes, who I think is more interested in facts and data than most people on cable TV.
