You might suspect this isn't really how health-care policy works. You\u2019d be right.\n\nYour best source for memory-of-a-fruit-fly narrative whiplash-journalism is, as always, Politico. Today\u2019s lead story supplies a dramatic behind-the-scenes account of the heroic work by administration staffers who, not long ago, were wallowing in their own haplessness. The untold moment that flipped the fate of Obamacare, and Obama\u2019s presidency, and the liberal project itself, turns out to be the intervention of a movie star:\n\nThe story of how the administration turned around a historic management failure surprised even many of the people involved, according to current and former administration officials, advocates, industry executives and supporters on the Hill. And it had a lot to do with Bradley Cooper.\n\nLong story short: Cooper happened to be at a state dinner and talked Valerie Jarrett into getting President Obama to appear on \u201cBetween Two Ferns,\u201d causing \u201ca 40 percent spike in traffic from the day before.\u201d\n\nNot to be a killjoy, but a single-day bump of 40 percent is a rounding error. What\u2019s more, a last-minute enrollment surge was always going to happen, ferns or no ferns, because people do stuff at the last minute. Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney didn\u2019t appear on \"Between Two Ferns,\" but his health-care plan still had a huge last-minute surge of young, healthy people:\n\nThe seven-million-customer number is itself a creation of mindless narrative journalism. It was the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s guesstimate of how many people would enroll in the new state exchanges. It was not a measure of how many customers the exchanges needed to reach critical mass. Then the administration started referencing the number, which gave the press corps permission to start treating it (in a classic piece of self-fulfilling logic) as a \u201csymbolic goal.\u201d\n\nThe biggest trouble with seven million is that it\u2019s not the number of people benefiting from Obamacare. Conservatives are picking away at the figure, correctly arguing that it does not show a terribly high reduction in the uninsured. What they haven\u2019t conceded is that, in many ways, seven million wildly understates the number of Obamacare beneficiaries.\n\nIt ignores people under 26 enrolling in their parents\u2019 plans, and people enrolling in Medicaid. It likewise ignores the fact that probably millions of people have obtained insurance off the exchanges, and millions more can still obtain insurance through the exchanges after the deadline has passed. The last two points are important enough to merit a bit of explanation.\n\nWho are these guys?

But when the website was broken, lots of people who made too much money to qualify for tax credits went ahead and bought plans straight from insurance companies. These new plans are part of Obamacare \u2014 that is, they comply with new regulations banning insurers from discriminating against people with high health risks. There\u2019s no official count of how many people have done this, but, as Katie Thomas reports, the number may be in the millions.\n\nSecond, the deadline for the exchanges is widely misunderstood. The point of an open enrollment period is to prevent people from gaming the system by waiting until they\u2019re sick or injured to get insurance. But it has exceptions for people who experience a \u201cqualifying event,\u201d like losing their employer-sponsored coverage. How many people will have these kinds of qualifying events that let them sign up past the March 31 deadline? Probably about four million.\n\nNarrative hyperventilation has a certain self-fulfilling power. If reporters start writing more positive stories about Obamacare, then support for the law will probably creep up a little, causing Democratic candidates to talk it up a little more. But things have fundamentally not changed.
