The survey examines small business owners' perspective on such issues as modern technology use, professional and personal worries, work-life balance, and government and institutional support.\n\n\"We have served small businesses for eight years and always want to stay as informed as possible so that we can best understand their state of mind and challenges,\" Louis Gagnon, Yodle chief product and marketing officer, said in a written statement.\n\nAsked about their technology and marketing approaches, 51 percent of small business owners use modern technology for accounting, followed by 39 percent who use technology for appointment booking and scheduling, 34 percent for CRM, 25 percent for point-of-sale systems, and 14 percent for acquisition marketing.\n\nAlmost one in four (23 percent) of small business owners report they don't spend any money on marketing, while just more than half (56 percent) spend less than $500 a month.\n\nAnother area within technology and marketing in which small business owners are lacking: websites. According to the survey, 52 percent of small business owners do not have a website, and 90 percent do not have a mobile-optimized website.\n\nSmall business owners also reported significant professional and personal worries.\n\nTheir top professional worries include:\n\nFinding new customers (42 percent)\n\nAffording health care and other employee benefits (39 percent)\n\nKeeping current customers (33 percent)\n\nPaying bills for the business (33 percent)\n\nMore than six in ten respondents (61 percent) also stated they think the Affordable Care Act will have a negative impact on small businesses.\n\nThe top personal concerns for small business owners are:\n\nAffording health care (48 percent)\n\nSaving for retirement (46 percent)\n\nProviding an adequate lifestyle for their family (33 percent)\n\nBut despite these concerns, 91 percent of survey respondents said they are happy to be small business owners, including 55 percent who are \"extremely happy.\" A majority of small business owners (59 percent) also shared they would likely not consider selling their business over the next few years, indicating optimism and satisfaction.\n\nAbout the survey:\n\nFor its inaugural Small Business Sentiment Survey, Yodle Inc. commissioned an online survey in June 2013 through a third-party research firm to measure the true sentiment of small business owners. The 306 small business owners surveyed from across the country own small businesses in a variety of white- and blue-collar industries, ranging from financial services and law to construction.\n\nRelated articles:", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Terri Eyden"}, "dcterms.title": "Modern Technology Lacking in Most Small Businesses", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Trends"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "Modern Technology Lacking in Most Small Businesses", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/technology/trends/modern-technology-lacking-in-most-small-businesses", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/default-16x9.jpg?itok=FWa8WdE3", "updated_time": "2013-09-05T17:33:22+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/technology/trends/modern-technology-lacking-in-most-small-businesses", "card": "summary", "title": "Modern Technology Lacking in Most Small Businesses"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/technology/trends/modern-technology-lacking-in-most-small-businesses", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.date": "2013-09-05T17:33+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"Small business\",\"Marketing\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"Trends\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"Trends\",\"Technology\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_17482\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-05T19:33:22+01:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-05T19:48:23+01:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "Trends", "sft-tag": "Small business", "sft-date": "Sep 5th 2013", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Technology", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-17482", "publishtime": "2013-09-05T19:33:22:000Z"}, "sft-title": "Modern Technology Lacking in Most Small Businesses"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda86d\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this summer, Yodle polled 306 US small business owners across a large array of service industries for its inaugural Small Business Sentiment Survey .\nThe 306 small business owners surveyed from across the country own small businesses in a variety of white- and blue-collar industries, ranging from financial services and law to construction.\nAnother area within technology and marketing in which small business owners are lacking: websites.\nThe survey examines small business owners' perspective on such issues as modern technology use, professional and personal worries, work-life balance, and government and institutional support.\nAbout the survey:For its inaugural Small Business Sentiment Survey, Yodle Inc. commissioned an online survey in June 2013 through a third-party research firm to measure the true sentiment of small business owners."}
