Two people were hurt in an accidental shooting early Saturday morning at a south Wichita bar.

It happened around 1:30 a.m. at Shot Time II in the 32000 block of South Exposition, near 31st Street South and Seneca.

Sgt. Ron Hunt said officers were originally called to the report of two walk-in shooting victims at Via Christi-St. Joseph hospital. One man said he accidentally discharged his handgun while at the bar. The bullet went through his right thigh and into the left thigh of the other man seated beside him.

Their injuries are not considered life-threatening.

Sgt. Hunt said the man who had the gun has a concealed carry handgun (CCH) license and admitted to having several drinks while in possession of the firearm.

He also refused to cooperate with law enforcement, Hunt said. He was arrested for aggravated battery.
