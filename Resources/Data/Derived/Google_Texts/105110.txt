Two backcountry skiers were caught in an avalanche near Silverton on Saturday that sent a wall of snow cascading over Red Mountain Pass.

The slide happened about 11:30 a.m. above U.S. 550 where a group of five skiers were descending a mountainside, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center said.

The skiers caught in the slide were carried by a wall of snow, officials said. No information was released on any injuries to the pair.

The CAIC says the skiers were not buried by the avalanche.

A pile of debris left by the avalanche was 12 to 15 feet deep and up to 350 feet wide, according to the CAIC.

Colorado avalanches have caught 17 people this year, including five who were buried and four who were killed.
