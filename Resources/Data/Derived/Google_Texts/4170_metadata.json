Bobby Jindal\u2019s ideas still in play in Louisiana\n\nStephanie Grace: Perhaps hard to believe, but there's one set of ex-Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s ideas still in play in Louisiana\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that seems to unite the warring factions that make up the state\u2019s political class, it\u2019s the firm belief that many of former Gov. Bobby Jindal\u2019s policies should be undone.\n\nLegislators, Republican and Democratic alike, are in the process of enthusiastically passing bills that can be read as direct rebukes to the former governor. During the special session, they reversed the gimmicky SAVE Act adopted last year to allow Jindal to claim he hadn\u2019t raised taxes when he really had. During the current regular session, they\u2019re on track to ban governors from issuing big raises in their final days in office without legislative approval, as Jindal did despite a huge budget hole.\n\nAnd even as Gov. John Bel Edwards and the Legislature continue to grapple with the budget mess, there seems to be consensus that the state should expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d control the growth of the popular TOPS scholarship program, and try to rein in runaway business tax giveaways \u2014 all efforts Jindal had blocked. But there\u2019s one area where Jindal\u2019s legacy appears safe, and that\u2019s K-12 education.\n\nAfter his easy re-election campaign in 2011, the first thing Jindal did was push a massive education overhaul that promoted school choice. Among other things, his package strengthened charter schools and expanded the use of vouchers to pay for private school tuition.\n\nLike many of Jindal\u2019s other initiatives, this one dovetailed with the priorities of national movement conservatives he was trying to court in preparation for his ultimately failed presidential run. Unlike some of those other moves, though, this one seems to still have widespread support, even though a governor with a very different outlook now occupies the Capitol\u2019s fourth floor.\n\nFor evidence, look no farther than the apparent failure of Edwards\u2019 K-12 agenda, which included bills to limit new charters and curb eligibility for private school vouchers.\n\nIn hindsight, it\u2019s really not surprising that these moves would run into trouble. Edwards ran for governor with early and strong support from teachers unions and local school board leaders, and he didn\u2019t deny his priorities aligned with theirs. But he also didn\u2019t actively promote his education agenda in speeches or ads aimed at a wider audience.\n\nAnd despite Edwards\u2019 easy win last November, other results suggest elementary and secondary education wasn\u2019t an issue that drove voters to him. The same electorate that handed Edwards a decisive victory over David Vitter also chose a Legislature that generally favors charter schools and other components of the school choice movement that Jindal had championed. It also elected a Board of Elementary and Secondary Education majority that supports the so-called reform movement, and that is sticking with Education Superintendent John White even though Edwards said during the campaign that he should be replaced.\n\nWeakening the governor\u2019s hand still further is the fact that there are plenty of school choice proponents within his own Democratic base, particularly in New Orleans. His early failure to get his favored House speaker elected resulted in an unfriendly education committee in the lower chamber. And even in the Senate, where President John Alario made assignments aimed at giving the governor a chance to succeed, there was significant opposition.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that proponents of school choice remain organized and aggressive, even without a champion in the Governor\u2019s Mansion.\n\nCommon Core may seem to be an exception to the lasting support for Jindal\u2019s priorities, but it\u2019s one that proves the rule.\n\nThe former governor once was a strong backer of the new education standards, which were designed to teach analytical thinking and allow Louisiana students to be compared to their peers nationwide. He reversed himself only after tea party activists and other potential primary voters started complaining that Common Core, which was developed by a bipartisan group of governors and state education leaders but also favored by the Obama administration, amounted to a federal takeover. Ironically, Edwards also was against Common Core, which was equally unpopular with his union supporters.\n\nAnd sure enough, Jindal\u2019s flip-flop created a clean break with his former reform movement allies in the Legislature and BESE, and with White.\n\nAs for Edwards and his bid to shift some power back into the hands of local school boards and restrict the use of vouchers, success probably was never in the cards.\n\nToo many of the key players who once worked with Jindal on education still are there. And they remain as motivated as ever.\n\nStephanie Grace can be contacted at sgrace@theadvocate.com.
