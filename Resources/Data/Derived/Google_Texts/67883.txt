The Rollout of the Affordable Care Act has been marred by glitches and political opposition.

The Affordable Care Act opened enrollment at the end of 2013. And now as Americans send in their 2014 taxes, some may be paying penalties to the IRS as a result of not having health insurance. For 2014, the penalties equal $95 per adult or 1 percent of modified adjusted gross household income (whichever is greater).

But there are ways to avoid paying a penalty. Take a look at our list below and see if you can sniff out the legitimate exemptions for avoiding the health insurance penalty for 2014.

These hardships do not exempt people from having to pay back money to the IRS if the subsidies they received were too large, based on their income.

We also want to hear about your experience with Obamacare â€“ particularly when it comes to penalties. Did you have to pay one? How did your plan work (or not)? Did you switch, renew or drop your plan? Have you been able to navigate Medicaid?
