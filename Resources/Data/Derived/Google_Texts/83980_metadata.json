Nikki Haley\u2019s response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech Tuesday night was widely seen as a repudiation of the generally anti-immigrant message being peddled by current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump. But in interviews Wednesday, the woman seen as a strong contender for a Republican vice presidential nomination wasn\u2019t shy about taking some swipes at other top GOP contenders.\n\nThere was, however, one notable exception.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes on Nikki Haley as Republicans Battle for Control\n\nHaley, the daughter of immigrants from India, conceded Wednesday that much of what she said Tuesday night was directed at Trump. She criticized the \u201cangry\u201d voices in the Republican Party that were creating an unwelcoming atmosphere for the very voters that the party needs to attract in order to expand its base.\n\nOn Wednesday, Haley urged Trump \u2013 laughably to anybody who has been paying attention to the campaign \u2013 not to overreact to her comments.\n\n\u201cJust because you disagree with somebody doesn't mean you're not a friend,\" Haley told reporters. \"When I say it about my other friends that are running for president, they don't throw stones.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is just something that we learned in South Carolina that I'm passing along,\u201d said Haley. \u201cTake it if you want, don't take it if you don't.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Takes on Trump and the Politics of Fear in Final State of the Union\n\nTrump, of course, did take it personally, blasting Haley on Twitter for accepting campaign donations from him in the past and calling her \u201cweak\u201d on immigration policy.\n\nBut Haley didn\u2019t stop at criticizing Trump.\n\n\u201cYou know, I have disagreements with other presidential candidates,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, Jeb Bush passed Common Core, and Marco Rubio believes in amnesty, which I don\u2019t. There\u2019s lots of things.\u201d\n\nNotably, Haley balked when she was asked if she thought Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, currently Trump\u2019s closest competitor, was also part of the GOP\u2019s problem with tone.\n\nRelated: Obama Uses State of the Union to Defend His ISIS Strategy\n\nCruz, like Trump, is running as an outsider candidate, despite his status as a sitting senator. And he can back that up by pointing out that he is largely despised by most of the Republican establishment in Washington for his confrontational \u2013 and many say self-aggrandizing \u2013 tactics.\n\nWhen she was asked if Cruz was part of the GOP\u2019s problem with \u201ctone,\u201d she said, \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t heard Ted say anything in terms of the religion. If he did, I would say something about that. But I will say, tone matters, message matters, and responsibility matters.\u201d\n\nCruz, it should be pointed out, is one of the candidates who have affirmatively called for religious tests for refugees entering the United States, something Haley could hardly have missed if she so much as picks up a newspaper on a regular basis.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In her State of the Union response and in interviews the day after, South Carolina Gov.
