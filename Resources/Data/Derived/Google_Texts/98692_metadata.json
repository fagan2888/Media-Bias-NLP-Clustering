They were requested most frequently by clinical departments, chief medical officers and purchasing committees. Most of the studies looked at drugs and medical devices, but the researchers found the center also looked at care processes, organizational systems and policies, and medical and surgical procedures.\n\nAmong the review were evaluations of the effectiveness and safety of drugs for treating pain following joint replacement surgery, automated systems to monitor staff hand hygiene, and care management for patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. The average report was completed in two or three months; more than 10 percent resulted in computerized electronic health record interventions.\n\nNearly all of the report requestors responding to the survey said the review met their expectations, with three-quarters saying the reports confirmed their initial theories.\n\nOther hospitals also report success using evidence-based care models.\n\nKennedy Health System in New Jersey reduced sepsis and its complications, including mortality, by using an evidence-based care model to constantly review data from multiple departments and implement new processes. The project shifted hospital culture away from blame and punishment toward collaboration and joint action.\n\nOne way to incorporate evidence-based care into clinical settings is to promote a robust set of competencies for registered nurses and advanced practice nurses (APNs) to follow, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Evidence-based practice mentors recommended RNs develop competencies including questioning clinical practices to improve care and monitoring data assessing the effectiveness of new processes. Meanwhile, various leadership strategies such as creating a supportive culture for evidence-based practice are considered key for APNs.\n\nFor more information:\n\n- see the study abstract\n\n- read the Penn Medicine announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEvidence-based care, culture change reduced sepsis, complications at NJ hospital\n\n24 strategies nurses need for evidence-based care\n\nAHRQ: New functionalities for pediatric EHRs need to be added 'thoughtfully'\n\nNeed better evidence-based design for hospitals?
