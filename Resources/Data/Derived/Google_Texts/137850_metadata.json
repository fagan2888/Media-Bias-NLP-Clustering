That\u2019s because one thing Republicans tend to agree on is that the debt is a problem \u2014 and that fixing it will require entitlement reform or spending cuts.\n\nAt least 20 times since the Eisenhower Administration, Congress has used the debt limit as an opportunity for policy reforms. This includes the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings reforms, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the Congressional Review Act in 1996, and (most recently) the Budget Control Act in 2011.\n\nAnd until the last 48 hours, conservatives seemed to believe the only way to get Democrats to agree to fix the debt problem would be to utilize the moment of maximum leverage \u2014 which is the debt ceiling increase. \u201cThat\u2019s the moment when even liberal presidents like Barack Obama know they can\u2019t play chicken,\u201d says one Republican Senate aide.\n\nLet\u2019s get back to Heritage Action\u2019s apparent contradiction. What accounts for it? \u201cThey are so interested in vindicating their shutdown strategy, that they\u2019re willing to sacrifice principles the\u2019ve always held,\u201d says the aide. \u201cThey\u2019re forcing lawmakers to take a public position that is contrary to what they\u2019ve always believed, but they themselves will not say it publicly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re asking us to do something \u2014 not unlike what they asked us to do in filibustering a bill to block Obamacare \u2014 that goes against what we believe,\u201d the aide continued.\n\nThe up side to raising the debt ceiling (without any strings attached) is that removes fears of default, which would presumably calm the markets, and prevent Republicans from being blamed for any catastrophic economic conditions that might occur.\n\nAnd, of course, it would also allow conservatives to continue to use the government shutdown as leverage for defunding Obamacare.\n\nBut this strategy is not without its problems. In fact, it might be playing into the Democrats\u2019 hands. \u201cObama doesn\u2019t really give a shit how long the government shutdown lasts because it only hurts Republicans, says my source, \u201cbut Obama doesn\u2019t want to be the first president in history to preside over a default.\u201d\n\nThis position was echoed recently by Charles Krauthammer, who wrote: \u201cThe rule is simple: shutdown good, debt ceiling bad. Every day the debt ceiling approaches, President Obama\u2019s leverage diminishes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The case against raising the debt limit (without any strings attached)", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "During a Christian Science Monitor breakfast the other day, Heritage Action CEO\u00a0Michael Needham reportedly said,\u00a0\"[W]e should raise the debt limit,\" adding: \"My tactic is to focus on the CR.\"    But", "title": "The case against raising the debt limit (without any strings attached)", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/11/the-case-against-raising-the-debt-limit-without-any-strings-attached/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-10T220655Z_1_CBRE9991PFM00_RTROPTP_4_USA-FISCAL-e1381522367529.jpg", "height": 276}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"They're asking us to do something -- not unlike what they asked us to do in filibustering a bill to block ObamaCare -- that goes against what we believe.\"", "title": "The case against raising the debt limit (without any strings attached) Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/11/the-case-against-raising-the-debt-limit-without-any-strings-attached/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-10T220655Z_1_CBRE9991PFM00_RTROPTP_4_USA-FISCAL-e1381522367529.jpg"}, "creator": "@mattklewis", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-11 12:35:17", "sailthru.title": "The case against raising the debt limit (without any strings attached)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "debt ceiling", "sailthru.description": "During a Christian Science Monitor breakfast the other day, Heritage Action CEO\u00a0Michael Needham reportedly said,\u00a0\"[W]e should raise the debt limit,\" adding: \"My tactic is to focus on the CR.\"    But", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-10T220655Z_1_CBRE9991PFM00_RTROPTP_4_USA-FISCAL-e1381522367529.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Aside from the confusion, the notion that Republicans should raise the debt ceiling without exacting some concessions goes against years of conservative orthodoxy.\nEvery day the debt ceiling approaches, President Obama\u2019s leverage diminishes.\u201d\nThe up side to raising the debt ceiling (without any strings attached) is that removes fears of default, which would presumably calm the markets, and prevent Republicans from being blamed for any catastrophic economic conditions that might occur.\nAt least 20 times since the Eisenhower Administration, Congress has used the debt limit as an opportunity for policy reforms.\nAnd, of course, it would also allow conservatives to continue to use the government shutdown as leverage for defunding Obamacare."}
