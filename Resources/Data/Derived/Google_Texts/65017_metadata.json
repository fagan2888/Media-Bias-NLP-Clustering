We have to find ways to get it done. I\u2019ll be hurting more in the middle of the night, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nAn offense that gave up eight sacks the week before at Arizona State suffered only two, and one was clearly a coverage sack as quarterback Sefo Liufau ran around in the backfield for a long time looking for a target.\n\nWide receiver Shay Fields had a huge game with eight catches for 168 yards and two touchdowns before suffering a high ankle sprain on his second score. Running back Phillip Lindsay rushed for 93 yards on 23 carries. The defense held Arizona scoreless in the second and third quarters, after it looked like the visitors would run the Buffs out of their own building early on. The Buffs even won the turnover battle, 2-1.\n\nBut it was yet another loss, causing MacIntyre to worry about his players losing hope.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was telling them after the game, how much I appreciate them, how much I love them, how much I care for them,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThis is tough when you\u2019re a young man and putting all your heart and soul and time into something, but you have to find a way to keep moving forward. If you just shut it down and stop and give in, then you\u2019re going to give in later on in life.\u201d\n\nLiufau had an interception and a fumble in each of the previous two games, but he had a clean game Saturday, throwing for 339 yards and two touchdowns while rushing for two more.\n\n\u201cWe have a team of fighters,\u201d Liufau said. \u201cIt sucks to lose, but we never quit.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks earlier the Buffs were tied with Oregon 17-17 at halftime. The halftime score Saturday night was the same, and the Buffs took the lead at 24-17 early in the third quarter, but they couldn\u2019t finish.\n\n\u201cVery frustrating, obviously,\u201d said offensive tackle Stephane Nembot. \u201cWe fought hard and we thought we were putting ourselves in a position to win a game and it just didn\u2019t happen. We have to go back out there and practice hard and focus on the next one. Keep pushing, basically, and keep fighting. That is all we can do right now.\u201d\n\nThat next one is at Oregon State, 0-3 in the conference and 2-4 overall, but it looks like Liufau will be without his most explosive target. Fields had a 72-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, and Saturday was his second 100-yard game of the season. He had five catches for 103 yards against Oregon.\n\n\u2018Everybody has to step up and be able to pick up Shay\u2019s load,\u201d Liufau said. \u201cHe is a great player, and I hope he is not out for long, but we have plenty of guys who can stand up and be able to make big plays for us.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer\n\nEye on\u2026 The Beavers\n\nColorado at Oregon State, 8:30 p.m. Saturday, Pac-12\n\nFor the record: The Beavers are 2-4, 0-3 after losing 52-31 to Washington State.\n\nWho\u2019s hot: Freshman quarterback Seth Collins rushed for 124 yards and a touchdown against Washington State. Collins leads the team with 486 yards.\n\nWho\u2019s not: The defense isn\u2019t even slightly warm. Against Washington State, it had allowed 399 yards just in the first half.
