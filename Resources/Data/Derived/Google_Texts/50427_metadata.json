Devon Staples, 22, and his friends had been drinking and setting off fireworks Saturday night in a backyard in Staples\u2019 eastern Maine hometown, Calais, when the accident happened with a reloadable fireworks mortar tube, police have said. Staples\u2019 mother, Kathleen Staples, said she is going to reach out to lawmakers about the possibility of tighter controls over fireworks. The state should consider requiring safety training courses before allowing someone to use them, she said. She compared fireworks with other regulated items such as cars and guns. \u201cAt least it\u2019d be a little bit more than, \u2018Here you go,'\u201d Staples said. \u201cThat\u2019s an explosive. They didn\u2019t just hand me a license and put me in the car.\u201d Devon Staples also had lived in the Orlando, Florida, area, where he worked as a performer portraying Disney characters such as Gaston from \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and Goofy, his mother said. She said he believed the firework was \u201ca dud\u201d that was unlikely to hurt him. State Fire Marshal Joe Thomas said that is unlikely because the mortar had been fired once previously and he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine someone would anticipate that it was a dud.\u201d Staples\u2019 death is the first fireworks fatality in Maine since it legalized fireworks on Jan. 1, 2012, authorities said. Lawmakers had voted to repeal a 1949 law banning fireworks, reasoning the industry would create jobs and generate revenue. Democratic Rep. Michel Lajoie, a retired fire chief from Lewiston who has pushed to repeal Maine\u2019s fireworks law in the past, said Monday that he\u2019s considering trying to introduce another measure next year but acknowledged it faces long odds. Retailers have fiercely opposed any effort in the Legislature to restrict the use of fireworks. Lajoie said even a ban might not prevent injuries and deaths. \u201cThey\u2019re going to say, \u2018Well, you can\u2019t regulate stupidity\u2019 \u2026 and it\u2019s true, you can\u2019t. But the fact of the matter is you have to try something,\u201d Lajoie said. \u201cI\u2019m not giving up.\u201d\n\nNow I know what you\u2019re going to say. Austin, you\u2019re an asshole. How can you be so mean to someone whose family member was just killed?\n\nShut up. Just shut up. I\u2019m sick and tired of every time some idiot parent\u2019s dumbass kid gets dead, the rest of us have to suffer in polite silence while politicians line up to take up whatever cause they\u2019re fronting to punish the rest of us. Let\u2019s localize the stupidity, instead of spreading it to the rest of us.\n\nThe kid did us all a favor by taking himself out of the gene pool. Does that sound harsh? Well, too bad. America wasn\u2019t founded so we could be safe from fireworks. It was founded so we could be free to be whatever the hell we want. In this case, if you\u2019re an idiot, you\u2019re also free to be dead.\n\nWhen fascism comes to America, it will be sold to us with a politician standing on the graves of some parent grieving over their dead kid.\n\nRELATED: Should Society Be Aimed At Protecting Women And Children First? [PODCAST]\n\nFireworks retailers should have every right to sell their wares, caveat emptor. If you aren\u2019t intelligent enough not to know that putting a mortar on your head and lighting it might blow your head off\u2026 that\u2019s not their fault. I\u2019m even against there being warning labels on fireworks.\n\nWhy? Well, it\u2019s not that I want to kill all the stupid people\u2026 I\u2019m not that harsh. It\u2019s that I want to take off all the warning labels to let the problem sort itself out on its own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A dead moron from Maine was killed instantly when he fired a firework off from the top of his head.
