It\u2019s a familiar feeling for people who follow the Oscars, especially those who have lists of favorite films that have been left out of the Academy\u2019s best picture nominations over the years.\n\nWhether you think \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind\u201d was the big science-fiction movie that should have been nominated in 1977 instead of \u201cStar Wars,\u201d or you think \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d was an instant classic that would endure longer than its 2000 rivals such as \u201cChocolat,\u201d you might be tired of arguing about their snubs by now. Or maybe you\u2019re one of those film fanatics who believe the Academy has snubbed popular blockbusters such as \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day\u201d or comedies like \u201cThe Birdcage\u201d out of snobbery.\n\nIn that case, and in the spirit of inclusiveness, we have figured out which movies since 1968 should have been nominated for best picture in an expanded field \u2014 and we have put it all together in an interactive graphic you can find here.\n\nStarting in 2009, the Academy expanded its best picture category from five nominees to as many as 10. So what would the Oscars look like if they always allowed 10 nominees? To determine this, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s data team investigated correlations and developed a scoring system that gives weight to other award nominations, industry guild honors and Oscar nominations in other categories. It factors in the relative importance of a movie\u2019s other Oscar nominations, along with other variables such as industry guild honors and Golden Globe recognition.\n\nFor instance, a nomination for best film editing has a stronger correlation to best picture nominations than a supporting actor nod does. Another example: A film nominated for best dramatic movie at the Golden Globes is more likely to end up nominated at the Oscars than a movie that\u2019s up for the Golden Globes\u2019 award for best picture, musical or comedy.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how our system works. We pit \u201cThe Reader,\u201d which was one of the best picture nominees for 2008, against \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d\n\nKate Winslet in \u2018The Reader.\u2019 Weinstein Company/Everett\n\n\u201cThe Reader\u201d (Nominated, 18 total points)\n\nDirector \u2014 3 points\n\nActress \u2014 3 points\n\nAdapted Screenplay \u2014 3 points\n\nCinematography \u2014 3 points\n\nGolden Globe best picture (drama) \u2014 3 points\n\nBAFTA best film \u2014 3 points\n\nChristian Bale in \u2018The Dark Knight.\u2019 Warner Bros./Everett Collection\n\n\u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d (Not nominated, 21 total points)\n\nCinematography \u2014 3 points\n\nEditing \u2014 3 points\n\nDirectors Guild \u2014 3 points\n\nProducers Guild \u2014 3 points\n\nSupporting Actor \u2014 2 points\n\nSound Mixing \u2014 2 points\n\nArt Direction \u2014 2 points\n\nSound Editing \u2014 1 point\n\nMakeup \u2014 1 point\n\nVisual Effects \u2014 1 point\n\n\u201cThe Reader\u201d sounds like the usual kind of Oscar bait. It\u2019s a prestigious literary adaptation about Nazis and the post-World War II world, headlined by a director (Stephen Daldry, \u201cThe Hours\u201d) and star (Kate Winslet) with Oscar pedigrees. \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d by contrast, is just a comic-book movie, albeit a comic-book movie that received much better reviews than \u201cThe Reader.\u201d Our system doesn\u2019t take reviews or critical consensus into consideration, though, and \u201cThe Reader\u201d is certainly richer with \u201cprestige\u201d nominations. However, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d boasts nominations from the Producers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America, two honors that usually correlate to a best picture nomination at the Oscars. In terms of sheer volume, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d had eight Oscar nominations while \u201cThe Reader\u201d had five.\n\nSome of our other findings will shock you, some will make you chuckle, some will leave you scratching your head \u2014 but many may just vindicate your passionate opinions about the grievous exclusions of past years.\n\nWe figured 1968 would be a good year to start since a newer, more modern age was beginning in Hollywood, and it featured what are considered two of the biggest snubs ever: \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby,\u201d both left out of the five best picture nominees. Would a bigger field of nominations have changed things? We\u2019ll never know, but it\u2019s fun to think about what might have been.\n\nFollow @Michael_Calia and @thegeoff2000 on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Favorites from 'The Dark Knight' to '2001: A Space Odyssey' would have made the best picture cut if the Academy always allowed 10 nominees.", "title": "These Past Films Should Have Been Nominated for Best Picture", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/01/13/these-past-films-should-have-been-nominated-for-best-picture/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GJ773_tdk_P_20150112100357.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "These Past Films Should Have Been Nominated for Best Picture", "description": "Favorites from 'The Dark Knight' to '2001: A Space Odyssey' would have made the best picture cut if the Academy always allowed 10 nominees.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Michael Calia and Geoff Foster", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Favorites from 'The Dark Knight' to '2001: A Space Odyssey' would have made the best picture cut if the Academy always allowed 10 nominees.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-01-13T18:34:54-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/01/13/these-past-films-should-have-been-nominated-for-best-picture/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-85953", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Favorites from 'The Dark Knight' to '2001: A Space Odyssey' would have made the best picture cut if the Academy always allowed 10 nominees.", "title": "These Past Films Should Have Been Nominated for Best Picture", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/01/13/these-past-films-should-have-been-nominated-for-best-picture/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GJ773_tdk_P_20150112100357.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-85953", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-16T15:00:42-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0110\"", "article_summary": "For instance, a nomination for best film editing has a stronger correlation to best picture nominations than a supporting actor nod does.\nStarting in 2009, the Academy expanded its best picture category from five nominees to as many as 10.\nIt\u2019s a familiar feeling for people who follow the Oscars, especially those who have lists of favorite films that have been left out of the Academy\u2019s best picture nominations over the years.\nAnother example: A film nominated for best dramatic movie at the Golden Globes is more likely to end up nominated at the Oscars than a movie that\u2019s up for the Golden Globes\u2019 award for best picture, musical or comedy.\nHowever, \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d boasts nominations from the Producers Guild of America and the Directors Guild of America, two honors that usually correlate to a best picture nomination at the Oscars."}
