UPS scrambled on Thursday to deliver packages that had failed to arrive in time for Christmas as the No. 1 U.S. ground delivery service sought to limit the fallout from the delays.

The lag in deliveries - which triggered intense criticism on social media - could encourage eCommerce companies, like online retail giant Amazon, to spread their shipping contracts across more companies to lower risk.

"I do think it creates an opportunity for companies other than UPS and FedEx to make some inroads here," said Anthony Gallo, a senior air freight and logistics analyst with Wells Fargo Securities LLC. "There's no downside to the retailers at this point to have more competition on the delivery side."

The bad press didn't seem to worry investors. UPS shares closed at an all-time high, hitting $104.67 per share by the market's close on Thursday. UPS shares are up 42 percent so far this year, outperforming the Dow Jones Transports Index, which is up about 39 percent over the same period.

UPS said on Wednesday that a confluence of factors from bad weather, a shorter shopping season and a surge in online shopping were to blame. It stressed that only a small percentage of total packages were delayed.

All outstanding packages will be delivered by Friday, UPS spokeswoman Natalie Black said on Wednesday.
