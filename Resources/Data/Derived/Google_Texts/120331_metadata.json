Now they are awkwardly distancing themselves from him a year before the election, seeking the right balance between independence and betrayal.\n\nA popular president can help his party\u2019s candidates for Congress and governor candidates in mid-term elections. But Democrats increasingly worry they could suffer losses, much as they did in 2010, Obama\u2019s first mid-term elections.\n\nIn a twist few expected, Republicans are still hammering the issue that fueled their successes in 2010: the health care overhaul they call Obamacare. They are making life especially uncomfortable for Democratic senators in states Obama lost.\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu, facing a tough re-election bid in Louisiana, recently posed for photographers exiting Air Force One with Obama after flying from Washington to New Orleans. But she skipped the president\u2019s public event there to attend a small-dollar fundraiser elsewhere, saying it had long been on her schedule.\n\nOther Democratic lawmakers are showing similar wariness, much to Republicans\u2019 delight.\n\n\u201cVulnerable Democrats like having President Obama raising money for them in New York and Los Angeles, but avoid appearing on stage with him in their home states,\u201d said Brad Dayspring, who helps run Republican senatorial campaigns.\n\nIn nearly every state, Republicans are highlighting instances in which Democrats echoed Obama\u2019s now-disproven claim that people could keep their health insurance plans if they wanted.\n\nTo be sure, there\u2019s nothing new about lawmakers keeping an uneasy space from presidents with poor or middling popularity ratings. Several Republicans made no mention of then-President George W. Bush in their 2006 campaigns, and Bush was a bigger liability in 2008.\n\nUntil recently, Obama\u2019s personal popularity remained healthy even when many Americans disliked his policies. But Democrats are alarmed to see his approval ratings hit all-time lows in recent polls.\n\nGallup found 39 percent of Americans approving Obama\u2019s job performance in early November, and 53 percent disapproving. His numbers were slightly better two weeks later, but still far from what Democrats had hoped.\n\nObama\u2019s popularity is probably lower than 39 percent in states that voted against him. That\u2019s where Democrats are struggling to keep their Senate majority, which Republicans will seize if they can gain six net seats.\n\nIn Louisiana, which Obama lost to Mitt Romney by 17 percentage points, Landrieu generally has supported the 2010 health law revision. But she recently introduced legislation to let people keep individual health policies that don\u2019t meet the new law\u2019s minimum requirements.\n\nRepublican Rep. Bill Cassidy, hoping to oust Landrieu next year, released an online video showing her with the president on Air Force One. \u201cShe\u2019s always been Barack Obama\u2019s rubber stamp,\u201d the announcer says.\n\nIn Alaska, Democratic Sen. Mark Begich has not asked Obama to campaign for him. If Obama and other federal officials should visit Alaska, said Begich campaign manager Susanne Fleek-Green, the senator wants them to travel to the North Slope \u201cso they understand the opportunities and challenges we face with oil and gas development.\u201d\n\nObama lost Alaska by 14 percentage points last year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Pryor, seeking a third term in Arkansas, emphasizes his demands that the White House fix the health program\u2019s troubled website and hold officials accountable for shortcomings. \u201cI won\u2019t let up until these problems are fixed,\u201d Pryor told reporters after Obama hosted a White House meeting for all Democratic senators up for election in 2014.\n\nObama lost Arkansas by 24 percentage points. Blanche Lincoln, the Democratic senator who sought re-election in 2010, was clobbered by Republican John Boozman, a fate Pryor hopes to avoid. Rep. Tom Cotton is the likely GOP nominee.\n\nIn North Carolina, which Obama narrowly carried in 2008 and narrowly lost in 2012, Republicans hope unhappiness with the health care law will topple Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan in November. Hagan, seeking a second term, told The News and Observer of Raleigh in August she would \u201cbe honored\u201d to have Obama campaign for her. But Republicans are distributing a WTVD news clip that says Hagan didn\u2019t answer directly when asked if she would appear alongside the president.\n\nThat\u2019s nonsense, says Hagan spokeswoman Sadie Weiner. Hagan \u201chas said she\u2019d certainly have him campaign\u201d for her, Weiner said. But the campaign\u2019s main point, she said, is to contrast Hagan\u2019s \u201crecord of getting bipartisan results for the state and her opponents who are more interested in fringe, anti-middle class policies.\u201d\n\nHagan attended a recent fundraiser held by Vice President Joe Biden in the college town of Chapel Hill.\n\nDemocrats note that even with Obama\u2019s fallen approval ratings, congressional Republicans remain even less popular. Meanwhile, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough meets regularly, and quietly. with Democratic senators facing election next year.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2013 The Associated Press.
