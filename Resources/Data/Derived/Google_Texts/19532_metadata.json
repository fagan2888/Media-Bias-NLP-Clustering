More specifically in Pacific Beach. Okay, in Crown Point, if you must know. Happy now? He was once known as a \"somewhat popular blogger\" back when blogs were a 'thing'. He is writing the Great American Novel, minus the 'great' part.\n\nSarah Palin Liberty Universty - screencap\n\nI\u2019m sure that you will be surprised to learn that, regardless of the air of sophistication and grace with which Sarah Palin has conducted herself since dashing young John McCain formally presented her to the world at the GOP\u2019s 2008 St. Paul Debutante Ball, there have occasionally been glimpses of her darker side. Her \u2018unpleasant\u2019 side. Something about her that seems\u2026 not right. No, really. There have been times, albeit few and far between, when Sarah Palin has displayed the feral nastiness of a tweaker who suspects that he\u2019s been ripped off combined with the lack of forgiveness exhibited by a Colombian drug lord who knows that he\u2019s been ripped off.\n\nSo when perpetually tipsy Wall Street Journal word-scribbler Peggy Noonan penned a, by today\u2019s standards, fairly anodyne column about how Real America is being destroyed by that nubian rapscallion in the White House, we would have expected Sister Sarah to hallelujah the holy shit out of it. Maybe Sarah would have even sent over a couple of jars of homemade pickled moose testicles, \u2013 which Peggy would have mistaken for overly large martini olives \u2013 as a gesture of sisterly bonding. But this, remarkably enough, did not happen.\n\nNoonan\u2019s column, \u201cMeanwhile, Back In America\u2026\u201d told the tale of an America ravaged and defiled by the lustful and wanton desires of a man flush with the aphrodisiac of power. Noonan\u2019s fluttery prose documented Obama\u2019s offenses against God & nature: the Affordable Care Act, saying \u201cno\u201d to school vouchers, and the IRS \u2018scandal\u2019. For those keeping score at home, chalk this up as a two-for-three day since, in order to score a true Wingnut Trifecta, Peggy should have replaced \u2018vouchers\u2019 with \u2018BENGHAZI!\u2019 Sorry, but please enjoy a complimentary home edition of Look Whut They Doned To Mah \u2018Murica, Ma and see yourself out.\n\nAt first glance it would be easy to suspect that Sarah Palin was upset that Upper East Side Peggy Noonan would deign to speak for the simple folk of America because it is a known and provable scientific fact that those simple people are Sarah Palin\u2019s simple people and that Sarah has their hard-earned money to prove it.\n\nNo, this conflict is much more raw than that.\n\nIt seems that way back in 2008 when John McCain and Sarah Palin\u2019s love was as pure and dewy as a Nicholas Sparks novel (pick one, any one), mean old Peggy Noonan called \u201cbullshit\u201d, and probably also made a jerk-off motion with her fist, while on the teevee.\n\nHere let Peggy \u2018splain what happened:\n\nWhen the segment was over and MSNBC was in commercial, [Chuck] Todd, [Michael] Murphy and I continued our conversation, talking about the Palin choice overall. We were speaking informally, with some passion \u2014 and into live mics. An audio tape of that conversation was sent, how or by whom I don\u2019t know, onto the internet. And within three hours I was receiving it from friends far and wide, asking me why I thought the McCain campaign is \u201cover\u201d, as it says in the transcript of the conversation.\n\nRoll tape, please:\n\nMike Murphy: You know, because I come out of the blue swing state governor world: Engler, Whitman, Tommy Thompson, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush. I mean, these guys \u2014 this is how you win a Texas race, just run it up. And it\u2019s not gonna work. And \u2014 Peggy Noonan: It\u2019s over. MM: Still McCain can give a version of the Lieberman speech to do himself some good. Chuck Todd: I also think the Palin pick is insulting to Kay Bailey Hutchinson, too. PN: Saw Kay this morning. CT: Yeah, she\u2019s never looked comfortable about this \u2014 MM: They\u2019re all bummed out. CT: Yeah, I mean is she really the most qualified woman they could have turned to? PN: The most qualified? No! I think they went for this \u2014 excuse me\u2013 political bullshit about narratives \u2014 CT: Yeah they went to a narrative. MM: I totally agree. PN: Every time the Republicans do that, because that\u2019s not where they live and it\u2019s not what they\u2019re good at, they blow it.\n\nThere you have it. Over five years ago Peggy Noonan did swears on teevee about Sarah Palin and Sarah Palin heard about it and she made a note of it in her Burn Book and today she extracted her revenge by using her ShoutyFace book thing:\n\nGreat article, Peggy, but where the heck were you when I and other commonsense conservatives were sounding the warning bell in \u201908? You joined the \u201ccool kids\u201d in mocking and condescendingly criticizing \u2014 ultimately demanding that we \u201csit down and shut up.\u201d Better late than never, though, Peggy and your ilk, because, meanwhile back in America\u2026\n\nOh SNAP. And Sarah also used that \u201cbetter late than never\u201d line that she usually reserves for her daughters when their period finally happens. You have been SERVED, Peggy Noonan, total wicked burn. So go sit at your \u201ccool kids\u201d lunch table with the other \u201ccool kids\u201d while Sarah Palin sits at a table in Wal-Mart and peddles her war on Christmas books.\n\nAnd put that in your appletini and smoke it\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Sarah-Palin-Liberty-Universty-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Sarah Palin stone cold Facebook burns that hoity-toity \u2018cool kid\u2019 Peggy Noonan"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7f7\"", "article_summary": "So go sit at your \u201ccool kids\u201d lunch table with the other \u201ccool kids\u201d while Sarah Palin sits at a table in Wal-Mart and peddles her war on Christmas books.\nYou have been SERVED, Peggy Noonan, total wicked burn.\nAnd \u2014 Peggy Noonan: It\u2019s over.\nAnd Sarah also used that \u201cbetter late than never\u201d line that she usually reserves for her daughters when their period finally happens.\nMM: Still McCain can give a version of the Lieberman speech to do himself some good."}
