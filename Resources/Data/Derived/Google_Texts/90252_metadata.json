Actually, some counties within the state did start issuing marriage licenses to gay couples in 2004, but then a ballot initiative passed prohibiting same-sex marriage recognition in the state.\n\nBut another federal judge\u2019s ruling today has, rather predictably at this point, struck down Oregon\u2019s ban. Furthermore, government officials in Oregon are not going to appeal the judge\u2019s rulings, and the judge rejected an effort by the National Organization for Marriage to intervene to protect the law, meaning the battle\u2019s apparently over in Oregon. The order is effective immediately.\n\nChris Geidner at BuzzFeed notes that this is the 12th ruling against gay marriage bans since the Supreme Court last year struck down the part of the Defense of Marriage Act that allowed the federal government to refuse to recognize same-sex unions in states where they had been legalized. He also posted the ruling here.\n\nFollowing up on other recent gay marriage news: In Arkansas, the state\u2019s Supreme Court has instituted a stay on gay marriages there pending the state\u2019s appeal. A judge struck down the state\u2019s ban on May 9 and did not issue a stay. As a result, there have been several hundred licenses handed out to same-sex couples in Arkansas. That all ended on Friday (following some additional complications over a separate law that forbid clerks from handing out same-sex marriage licenses. The judge struck that law down, too).\n\nAnd in Utah, where the state is also appealing a federal judge striking down their marriage ban, the state has ordered a halt on issuing birth certificates for same-sex parent adoptions. The state\u2019s attorney general contends that recognizing same-sex adoptions should also be put on hold and the state should not recognize same-sex partners as legal parents while the state appeals the marriage decision.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "You\u2019d think a state with a progressive reputation like Oregon would be all about the gay marriage train, but that\u2019s not the case.
