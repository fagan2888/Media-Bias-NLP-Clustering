But a contract signed last week at a Lear Corp. seat plant in Indiana illustrates just how hard it will be to eliminate so-called two-tier wages.\n\n\n\nWhen the four-year agreement was announced, it appeared the UAW had put all 730 workers at the plant on a track to earn the maximum wage of $21.58 by contract end. The vast majority of the workers were two-tier workers earning $11 to $14 an hour.\n\n\n\nThen, more details became available from Southfield-based Lear and the union. The UAW explanation of the contract omitted a key concession the union had made to Lear to keep the contract affordable for the supplier.\n\nThat is, about 120 of the workers at the seat-assembly plant were given a new job classification of \"subassembly\" worker. They were told they would move in the coming weeks to a different plant in the area and not be paid the higher wages of their co-workers in the seat-assembly plant. But they would get raises: Subassembly workers will earn a maximum of $15.25 at the end of the contract with hires starting at $12 an hour.\n\n\n\nThis balancing act that eliminated two-tier wages in one plant only to re-establish it at another demonstrates why two-tier wages are likely to survive the UAW-Detroit 3 contract negotiations next year, said David Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\nErosion, not elimination\n\n\"This is a sticky problem for the UAW,\" said Cole, who has witnessed decades of Detroit 3-UAW contract talks. \"I don't think we'll see the elimination of tier two this time around. Maybe some erosion of it.\"\n\n\n\nThe Detroit 3 are profiting from a combined 130,000-person UAW workforce that is now 25 percent two-tier workers earning about $16 an hour in wages versus $28 an hour for legacy workers, Cole said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTier creep\n\nNew UAW President Dennis Williams said tackling two-tier wages is a priority of the union when he was elected in June at the UAW Constitutional Convention in Detroit.\n\n\n\nTwo-tier wages are divisive on the factory floor because new employees earn lower wages and benefits than veteran co-workers for doing the same jobs, said Jerry Dias, president of Unifor, the successor union to the Canadian Auto Workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The United Auto Workers this summer vowed again to end the practice of paying workers in the same plant different wages for the same work.
