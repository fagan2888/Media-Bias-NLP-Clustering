Bertha was centered about 60 miles (95 kilometers) east-northeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and was moving west-northwest at 22 mph (35 kph) Saturday evening.\n\nThe storm passed just southwest of Puerto Rico this afternoon, dropping between 3 to 5 inches (8-13 centimeters) of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 8 inches (20 centimeters).\n\nGov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla warned of flooding, landslides and swollen rivers, which he urged people not to try and cross.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that sounds obvious but it happens so often,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the time to take risks.\u201d\n\nAuthorities repo rted several downed trees in Puerto Rico\u2019s eastern region and two downed electrical posts. Nearly 39,000 households were without power and more than 3,000 without water. The lights also had gone out at the island\u2019s emergency management agency during a press conference this morning.\n\nOfficials said most of the power outages occurred in the island\u2019s central mountainous region following more than 1,200 lightning strikes that occurred in the area during afternoon hours alone.\n\nThe heaviest rains fell in the island\u2019s southern and eastern regions, with authorities warning people to stay indoors.\n\nJose Colon Rivera, 50, who lives in a rural area near the southern town of Cayey, said in a phone interview that he could hear the wind whistling loudly through his zinc roof.\n\n\u201cIf anything happens, I can always run,\u201d said Colon, who was watching wrestling on TV as he waited for the storm to pass.\n\nSome 220 people arrived at several government shelters in Puerto Rico\u2019s southeast region, the majority of them international athletes participating in a youth baseball tournament.\n\nIngrid Vila, gubernatorial chief of staff, said Puerto Rico\u2019s main international airport remained open but that several flights had been cancelled.\n\nAuthorities closed El Yunque rainforest, a popular tourist attraction in northeast Puerto Rico, and ferry rides to the neighboring islands of Culebra and Vieques were cancelled.\n\nDowned trees limbs also were reported across St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where a coastal buoy south of St. Thomas recorded wind gusts of 72 mph (115 kph).\n\nTropical storm warnings were in effect for the eastern Dominican Republic, southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands. A tropical storm watch was in effect for central Bahamas.\n\nAs the storm approached the Dominican Republic, authorities banned vessels from operating along the country\u2019s east coast, which is popular with tourists. Rescue crews also traveled to the country\u2019s eastern and northeast regions to help with evacuations if needed.\n\nOn Friday, Bertha passed just north of the French Caribbean island of Martinique, where it left 150,000 homes without power, government spokeswoman Audrey Hamann said in a phone interview. The storm also left hundreds of people without power along Dominica\u2019s eastern region.\n\nAntigua-based regional airline LIAT canceled several flights in Dominica, St. Lucia, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Seaborne Airlines also canceled flights in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, while the U.S. Coast Guard closed ports in southern Puerto Rico.\n\nThe storm brought some rain to a drought-hit area of southern Puerto Rico, but it was not yet known whether it rained enough to cancel strict water rationing measures that are scheduled to start on Wednesday, authorities said.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 02 Aug 2014 17:48:02 -0400", "Description": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2013 Tropical Storm Bertha swirled over the eastern Dominican Republic late today after it whipped Puerto Rico with heavy rains and strong winds that knocked out power in pa", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2013 Tropical Storm Bertha swirled over the eastern Dominican Republic late today after it whipped Puerto Rico with heavy rains and strong winds that knocked out power in pa", "title": "Bertha dumps heavy rain on Puerto Rico", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/weather/bertha-dumps-heavy-rain-on-puerto-rico-20140802/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140802/ARTICLE/140809836/AR/0/AR-140809836.jpg", "height": 2667}, "updated_time": "2014-08-02T20:11:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2013 Tropical Storm Bertha swirled over the eastern Dominican Republic late today after it whipped Puerto Rico with heavy rains and strong winds that knocked out power in", "title": "Bertha dumps heavy rain on Puerto Rico", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140802/ARTICLE/140809836/AR/0/AR-140809836.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-08-02T17:48:02Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-08-02T20:11:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd70a0\"", "article_summary": "Seaborne Airlines also canceled flights in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, while the U.S. Coast Guard closed ports in southern Puerto Rico.\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2013 Tropical Storm Bertha swirled over the eastern Dominican Republic late today after it whipped Puerto Rico with heavy rains and strong winds that knocked out power in parts of the region.\nAntigua-based regional airline LIAT canceled several flights in Dominica, St. Lucia, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.\nBertha was centered about 60 miles (95 kilometers) east-northeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic and was moving west-northwest at 22 mph (35 kph) Saturday evening.\nThe storm passed just southwest of Puerto Rico this afternoon, dropping between 3 to 5 inches (8-13 centimeters) of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 8 inches (20 centimeters)."}
