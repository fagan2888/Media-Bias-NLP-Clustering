And to top it off, when people trying to upload the documents on the healthcare.gov site, they are running into problems:\n\nThe government has a long list of documents that consumers can use to establish their eligibility. These include copies of birth certificates, Social Security cards, high school diplomas, driver\u2019s licenses, pay stubs and voter registration cards.\n\n\u201cThe law requires us to double- and triple-check this data,\u201d said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, so \u201cwe\u2019re reaching out to consumers \u2014 via mail, email and phone calls \u2014 to encourage them to provide supporting documentation.\u201d\n\nMara Youdelman, a lawyer at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for low-income people, said: \u201cIn some cases, consumers say they already sent the documents to the federal marketplace. They don\u2019t understand why they are being asked to send them in again.\u201d\n\nEven though consumers have sent documents to Serco\u2019s office in London, Ky., the government cannot always link the documents to applications for coverage filed months earlier. In addition, some consumers report persistent problems when they try to upload documents through HealthCare.gov.\n\nFor months, Republicans have asserted that the administration was lax in verifying the income and eligibility of people who applied for insurance subsidies.\n\nThe government enrolled people \u201cbefore the systems were in place to accurately confirm eligibility,\u201d said Representative Diane Black, Republican of Tennessee.\n\nIn some cases, the government told consumers that they had been found eligible for subsidized insurance and could enroll right away. But to keep the coverage, it said, they had to \u201csend the marketplace more information\u201d to verify their eligibility.\n\nRepresentative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota, said \u201cmany Americans are going to find out that they owe money to the Internal Revenue Service because their premium tax credits were paid incorrectly.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, said such remarks showed the Republicans\u2019 \u201cunending zeal to undermine the Affordable Care Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/06/hundreds_of_thousands_may_lose_obamacare_coverage.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Hundreds of thousands may lose Obamacare coverage"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7374\"", "article_summary": "For months, Republicans have asserted that the administration was lax in verifying the income and eligibility of people who applied for insurance subsidies.\nIn addition, some consumers report persistent problems when they try to upload documents through HealthCare.gov.\nBut to keep the coverage, it said, they had to \u201csend the marketplace more information\u201d to verify their eligibility.\nAccording to this New York Times article , many consumers are bewildered because they already supplied the documentation the government is asking for.\nThese include copies of birth certificates, Social Security cards, high school diplomas, driver\u2019s licenses, pay stubs and voter registration cards."}
