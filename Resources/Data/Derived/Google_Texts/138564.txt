Shoppers in New Bern may have noticed an extra police presence as they headed out for Black Friday shopping.

The New Bern Holiday Task Force is up and running and will continue through Christmas.

Patrol and traffic enforcement officers, detectives and some others working undercover will monitor big stores like Walmart, Target and the mall, along with busy downtown areas.

Task force officer Kevin Lee says, "We're looking for people who are not doing the right thing. People trying to commit larcenies, robberies in progress, burglaries. Our job is to make sure those things don't happen."

Officer Lee says their basic concern is to make sure everybody stays safe and feels safe while they do their holiday shopping.

Lee says there are ways to help protect yourself too by keeping your car doors locked, being mindful of your surroundings, and keep all the presents you buy in your trunk.

Jacksonville and Greenville will also have similar task forces.
