The state’s decision to put its 1998 Sikorsky helicopter up for sale this year didn’t attract any bidders — an online sale on EBay ended this afternoon without any takers.

Maybe the $1.5 million price tag was too much for the seven-seat helicopter.

Gov. Pat McCrory said in early May he was planning to put the helicopter up for sale, pointing out that he had used that aircraft far less than his predecessors.

The sale was in line with previously-announced plans by transportation officials, who told the News & Observer in March 2013 that the state’s fleet of planes and helicopter were too costly to justify keeping. The helicopter costs $5,200 an hour to operate and requires two pilots.

The helicopter will get another shot, and go through another round of bidding on Ebay, said Mike Charbonneau, a transportation spokesman If no takers on the second go-around, the second agency will reevaluate how best to sell the helicopter.

DOT has had luck in the past on Ebay selling its old aircraft, Charbonneau said.
