Students from Ben Franklin, Mastbaum, South Philadelphia, Furness, Dobbins, School of the Future, Kensington CAPA, Overbrook and Penn Treaty high schools walked out around noon.\n\nAs many as 600 students walked out, district spokesman Fernando Gallard said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what prompted the walkout, but students at several schools have spoken out against deep budget cuts that stripped schools of many basic supplies and services.\n\nGallard said that budget cuts were the likely reason for the walkout.\n\nHiram Rivera, executive director of the youth organizing group Philadelphia Student Union, said it was his understanding that students organized the walkout on Twitter and other social media sites. His group did not organize it, Rivera said.\n\nA photo of one flyer posted on Instagram said: \"School Wide Walk Out. 12:00 November 22, 2013.
