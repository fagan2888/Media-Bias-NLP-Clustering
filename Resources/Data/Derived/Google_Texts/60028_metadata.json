Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, let\u2019s go to both Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio talking about Trump\u2014talking about Detroit and then about Flint. This is Ted Cruz addressing the economic crisis in Detroit.\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ: Detroit is a great city with a magnificent legacy, that has been utterly decimated by 60 years of failed left-wing policy. ... The way you bring manufacturing back to America is, number one, you lift the regulations. As president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job killer in America. I will pull back the federal regulators, the EPA and all the regulators that are killing small businesses and manufacturing. And my tax plan, which is a very, very detailed plan on the website, TedCruz.org, is what\u2019s called border adjustable. We get rid of all the taxes. We get rid of the corporate income tax and the death tax and the Obamacare taxes and the payroll tax. And we replace it with a 16 percent business flat tax that is border adjustable, which means all exports are entirely tax-free and all imports pay the 16 percent business flat tax. That\u2019s a 32 percent differential. What that will do, Chris, is bring millions of manufacturing jobs back to this country, bring the steel industry back to this country, create an environment where, when we compete on a fair and level playing field, American ingenuity can beat anyone. But right now the federal government isn\u2019t giving us a level playing field.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE: Thank you, Senator.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The lead water crisis in Flint came up once during last night\u2019s debate, after Fox moderator Bret Baier asked Marco Rubio about it.\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: What happened in Flint was a terrible thing. It was systemic\u2014a systemic breakdown at every level of government, at both the federal and partially the\u2014at both the state and partially at the federal level, as well. And by the way, the politicizing of it, I think, is unfair, because I don\u2019t think that someone woke up one morning and said, \"Let\u2019s figure out how to poison the water system to hurt someone.\" But accountability is important. I will say I give the governor credit. He took responsibility for what happened, and he\u2019s talked about people being held accountable and the need to change. That\u2019s Governor Snyder.\n\nBut here\u2019s the point: This should not be a partisan issue, the way the Democrats have tried to turn this into a partisan issue, that somehow Republicans woke up in the morning and decided, \"Oh, it\u2019s a good idea to poison some kids with lead.\" It\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s outrageous. It isn\u2019t true. All of us are outraged by what happened, and we should work together to solve it. And there is a proper role for the government to play at the federal level in helping local communities to respond to a catastrophe of this kind, not just to deal with the people that have been impacted by it, but to ensure that something like this never happens again.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That\u2019s Marco Rubio. Lester Spence, you were born in Michigan, in Detroit. Flint, Detroit?\n\nLESTER SPENCE: Yeah, I had use the bathroom when they actually made those two\u2014this is\u2014so, what\u2014what Cruz\u2014\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Marco Rubio.\n\nLESTER SPENCE: What Cruz suggested is basically, again, Republican policies warmed over. It\u2019s like you significantly reduce the\u2014reduce regulation, significantly reduce taxes. In a number of cases\u2014and again, this is where Chris is really good. He was suggesting that more money would be gained than there actually was money in the line item budget, right? It\u2019s really clear that this stuff, it doesn\u2019t work for any set of black populations\u2014I mean, any black population, much less the white population. What\u2019s going on in Detroit is not the result of failed Democratic policies; it\u2019s the result of a bipartisan consensus that has been reproduced and crystallized under Republican administration. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s it. And you should be able to kind of sort of claim that. But they can\u2019t, because that\u2019s the only policy line they have. And they can\u2019t also because the racial resentment that they\u2019re using to pull voters, they kind of require a city like Detroit in order to be able to say, \"OK, that\u2019s an example of failed government. Vote for us.\"\n\nAs far as what Rubio suggested, it\u2019s really clear. Every bit of data we have suggests that, no, we do know that it wasn\u2019t a matter of the governor of Michigan saying like, \"Damn, I really don\u2019t like people in Flint. They don\u2019t vote for me. I\u2019m going to poison their water.\" But what we know is that in every single city with a significant\u2014with a majority black population, they\u2019ve basically\u2014the state has taken it over, rendered it broke and dysfunctional, whether you\u2019re talking about the Detroit Public Schools, whether you\u2019re talking about Flint, whether you\u2019re talking about Inkster, whether you\u2019re talking about Saginaw, whether you\u2019re talking about Pontiac, whether you\u2019re talking about Benton Harbor\u2014everywhere. And that\u2019s a Republican project.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We\u2019re going to have to leave it there, but we\u2019re going to continue, of course, to cover all of these issues. The Democratic debate is in Flint on Sunday night. We\u2019ll be bringing you highlights and response on Monday. And check out our website at democracynow.org.
