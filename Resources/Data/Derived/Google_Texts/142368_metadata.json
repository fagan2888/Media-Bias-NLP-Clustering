To offset the cost of this repeal, a pension-destabilization initiative would be put in place, giving businesses a different formula to fund pensions that would make them more taxable.\n\nHe has also announced his support of legislation that would ensure back pay for furloughed federal workers affected by the shutdown, of which about 6,000 reside within the 8th Congressional District.\n\nIn a press call with reporters, the congressman said that the shutdown was \u201cbrought on by leaders at the highest level.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeaders at the highest level stopped talking and announced prior to the shutdown that they would not negotiate,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cI take responsibility, I\u2019m a member of the U.S. Congress, but I am telling you that I\u2019m not happy with the fact that leaders at the highest level began negotiations this way.\u201d\n\nFitzpatrick also stated in a press call on Thursday that he would be willing to raise the debt ceiling, so long as it was done in a way that is \u201cbipartisan and responsible.\u201d\n\nThe two Democratic candidates who hope to take Fitzpatrick\u2019s seat next November were quick to criticize Fitzpatrick on his handling of the shutdown.\n\nFormer CIA officer and U.S. Army veteran Kevin Strouse called a news conference in front of his recently opened campaign office in Bristol on Thursday, and said that Fitzpatrick had \u201ccaved in to the right wing and the Tea Party faction\u201d by voting for the attempts to repeal Obamacare that helped lead to the shutdown.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Wire, Strouse said that, were he in office, he would not compromise with Republicans demanding a dismantling of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be using the government shutdown and the debt ceiling as political leverage,\u201d Strouse said. \u201cYou have a method of government that is harmful to the country, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how Republicans should be handling these discussions.\u201d\n\nThe campaign of Shaughnessy Naughton, a businesswoman and former cancer researcher who is running against Strouse, also fired shots at Fitzpatrick.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of the shutdown are being felt acutely in the Eighth District and across the country,\u201d Naughton said. In a press release, she called for the congressman to give his wages during the shutdown back to the U.S. Treasury.\n\n\u201cIf the pain of their constituents isn\u2019t enough to motivate Republicans to pass a clean spending bill, maybe the pain in their pockets will be,\u201d Naughton said. \u201cBy not getting serious about ending the shutdown, Congressman Fitzpatrick is directly responsible for the $1.6 billion hit our economy took this week.\u201d\n\nNaughton also called Fitzpatrick a \u201chypocrite\u201d for prior statements that he would support a short-term spending bill, regardless of whether or not any changes were made to Obamacare.\n\nWhen asked in a press call with reporters what would happen with the pay he received, Fitzpatrick stated that if federal workers did not get their back pay, he would donate his pay to charity. He added that he had asked for his pay to be suspended, although this has not yet happened. Fitzpatrick did not say that he would return his pay to the Treasury.\n\nAs the Midweek Wire went to press, Fitzpatrick was unavailable to respond to the criticisms leveled by Strouse and Naughton.
