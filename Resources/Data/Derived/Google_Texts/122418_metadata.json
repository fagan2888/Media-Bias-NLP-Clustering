(AP) - A Publix employee in central Florida is celebrating his 50th year working for the grocery store chain.\n\nLarry Delaney is something of a rarity at Publix. In the company\u2019s 83-year history, only 16 employees have reached the 50-year milestone.\n\nThe Ledger reports (http://bit.ly/1n2MY1S ) that Delaney\u2019s achievement was marked Friday with congratulatory signs and a surprise party with family and colleagues at the Lakeland warehouse where he works.\n\nDelaney is a retail improvement specialist. His first job was as a produce clerk at a Publix in Fort Myers in April 1964.\n\nDelaney has the third-longest tenure among active Publix employees. Another Lakeland colleague celebrated his 50th anniversary in August, and a Jacksonville produce clerk has spent 53 years with the company.\n\nPublix officials lauded Delaney\u2019s energy and passion for his work.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Ledger (Lakeland, Fla.), http://www.theledger.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Publix employee in central Florida is celebrating his 50th year working for the grocery store chain.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/13/publix-employee-in-fla-celebrates-50-year-career/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A Publix employee in central Florida is celebrating his 50th year working for the grocery store chain.", "title": "Publix employee in Fla. celebrates 50-year career"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A Publix employee in central Florida is celebrating his 50th year working for the grocery store chain.", "card": "summary", "title": "Publix employee in Fla. celebrates 50-year career"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Labor, Lakeland, Publix, Larry Delaney, Lakeland Warehouse"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe276c\"", "article_summary": "LAKELAND, Fla.
