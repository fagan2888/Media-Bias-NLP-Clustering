If something breaks like last year\u2019s ouster of Mark Driscoll -- then-pastor of Mars Hill, Seattle\u2019s largest church at the time -- the newsroom has to pull reporters from other beats to cover it.\n\nSo it was a surprise to see this story leading their web site Sunday on Medi-Share and two other Christian \u201chealth-sharing ministries\u201d that act quasi-health insurers for lots of Washington state residents.\n\nWhen Melissa Mira suffered sudden heart failure at the end of her second pregnancy last year, she worried first about her health and her baby -- then about the more than $200,000 in medical bills that began rolling in.\n\n\u201cYour world is just crashing down around you and you wonder: \u2018How is this going to be covered?\u2019 \u201d recalled Mira, 30, who spent more than a month away from her Tacoma home, hospitalized at the University of Washington Medical Center.\n\nFor Mira and her family, the answer came not through traditional health insurance, but through faith that fellow Christians would step forward to pay the bills.\n\nThe Miras -- including daughter Jael, 4, and baby Sienna Rain, now a healthy 9-month-old -- are among the growing numbers of people looking to \u201chealth care-sharing ministries\u201d across the U.S. At last count, there were more than 10,000 members in Washington state and nearly 400,000 nationwide, individuals and families whose medical costs are taken care of entirely through the organized goodwill -- and monthly payments or \u201cshares\u201d -- of like-minded religious followers.\n\nThe writer is the newspaper\u2019s health reporter and the tone is informative and respectful. It\u2019s kind of sad when it\u2019s unusual to find a piece in the secular media about religious practices that have no snark attached.\n\nThis article is one of the exceptions. It goes on to say:\n\nMembers are technically considered self-pay patients; when they visit doctors or hospitals, they\u2019re classified as not having health insurance. Instead of paying insurance premiums, they pay voluntary \u201cshares\u201d of $300 to $400 a month per family, either directly to other members or to plan organizers who match the money with patient needs.\n\nFor Veronika and Michael Boos, of Seattle, who own a small home-brewery-supply business and have three young children, joining Samaritan was more affordable than anything they found on the Washington state health-benefit exchange.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking $1,000 a month on the exchange, if you want decent coverage,\u201d said Veronika Boos, 31, who gave birth to their youngest child, Desmond, in February. The family belongs to Cross & Crown Church in Ballard.\n\nCross & Crown, by the way, is the new name for what once was Mars Hill\u2019s central church until a few months ago. I too have had to buy my insurance on the exchange and the Boos are right about the tremendous costs. So it's news when 10,000-plus people have found an alternate way around this.\n\nThe article adds that for uncovered costs (these faith plans don\u2019t do pre-existing conditions), people can post their stories on a \u201cprayer page\u201d and people will send them checks to help out. It\u2019s been my experience that if I show up at a doctor\u2019s office with no insurance, I\u2019ll get no further unless I pay in advance. I\u2019m curious what these Christians do in that situation.\n\nThe article does talk about the downside of these plans, such as lawsuits filed by some of the members who claim their care was not paid for. There\u2019s an interesting anecdote about the Washington state insurance commissioner trying to outlaw these groups and seeing the state legislature pass a law opposing his efforts. There are 29 states in which these health-sharing ministries are protected. That's a solid hook for follow-up reporting by journalists in many different markets.\n\nThe article concludes with information that gives the impression that these believers are at the least savvy consumers trying, like everyone else, to figure their way around high health care costs. It is the kind of respectful coverage I tend to see given to minority religious groups in the nation's media but not so much to Protestant evangelicals or conservative Catholics.\n\nNow if the Times would only make religion a full-time beat ...", "article_metadata": {"description": "There aren\u2019t many religion writers in the Pacific Northwest these days and \r\nthat's a shame.\r\n\r\nFor example, The Seattle Times apparently hasn\u2019t had one since Janet Tu \r\nleft the beat several years ago.
