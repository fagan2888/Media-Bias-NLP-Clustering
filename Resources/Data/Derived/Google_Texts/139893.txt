What Was Behind Ted Cruz And Cory Booker's Mystery Dinner?

Are Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Cory Booker, D-N.J., the new political odd couple?

The Tea Party Texan and the New Jersey liberal were spotted last night dining at Bistro Bis near the U.S. Capitol.

As speculation about the topic of their meeting intensified, Sen. Cruz took to twitter to suggest a more discrete meeting place:

According to a spokesperson for Sen. Cruz, "the senator often meets with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It's something they've wanted to set up for a while."

Sen. Booker's spokesman Kevin Griffis also weighed in on the bipartisan dinner.

"Senator Booker has been meeting one-on-one with his Senate colleagues since he took office, and as he pledged on the campaign trail, even if he disagrees with someone on most issues, if he can find common ground that can help New Jerseyans, that's where he's going to focus," Griffis said.

The restaurant, popular among the Capitol Hill crowd, describes itself as "sophisticated, warm and intimate" - the perfect place for a bi-partisan huddle.
