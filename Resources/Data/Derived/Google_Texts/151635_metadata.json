They suggested millennials did not care about what Kissinger did either.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nIt was typical of an establishment media class, which eschews serious reflection on the record of any current or former official\u2019s role in war crimes or atrocities. But Kissinger is someone who Clinton has mentioned multiple times during debates and at campaign events. She said during the last debate in New Hampshire, \u201cI was very flattered when Henry Kissinger said I ran the State Department better than anybody had run it in a long time.\u201d\n\nThe condemnation from Sanders was also newsworthy because most of the elite international relations scholars in foreign policy research consider Kissinger to be the best secretary of state of the past 50 years.\n\nAssessing her friendship with Kissinger not only forces her to defend her support for a war criminal, who helped fuel genocide and massive casualties in multiple countries, but it also forces her to justify support for decades of U.S. foreign policy, involving military intervention and a refusal to acknowledge systematic human rights violations.\n\nDuring the debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 11, Sanders declared, \u201cI happen to believe that Henry Kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country.\u201d\n\nSanders continued, \u201cI am proud to say that Henry Kissinger is not my friend. I will not take advice from Henry Kissinger. And in fact, Kissinger\u2019s actions in Cambodia, when the United States bombed that country, overthrew Prince Sihanouk, created the instability for Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge to come in, who then butchered some 3 million innocent people, one of the worst genocides in the history of the world. So count me in as somebody who will not be listening to Henry Kissinger.\u201d\n\nA feeble attempt was made by Clinton to turn this against Sanders. \u201cWell, I know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy, and we have yet to know who that is,\u201d Clinton replied. Sanders quickly retorted, \u201cWell, it ain\u2019t Henry Kissinger. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d The audience laughed.\n\nClinton attempted to approach the issue of her support for Kissinger again. This time, she celebrated the role he played in \u201copening up China\u201d and how \u201cincredibly useful\u201d his \u201congoing relationships with the leaders of China are to the U.S. Then, she suggested Sanders was cherry-picking advisers, who she listens to on foreign policy, in order to mount an opportunistic attack.\n\n\u201cYes, people we may disagree with on a number of things may have some insight, may have some relationships that are important for the president to understand in order to best protect the United States,\u201d Clinton stated.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, he opened up relations with China,\u201d Sanders responded. But he also \u201cpushed various type of trade agreements, resulting in American workers losing their jobs as corporations moved to China. The terrible, authoritarian, Communist dictatorship he warned us about, now he\u2019s urging companies to shut down and move to China. Not my kind of guy.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 campaign had a memo prepared for U.S. media on Kissinger\u2019s record, which they sent out to reporters immediately after this exchange occurred. Unfortunately, no U.S. media outlet chose to include the vast majority of the memo\u2019s contents in their coverage. That is because pundits judged the attack on Kissinger as silly and believed it would play no factor in convincing voters to support either candidate. Plus, few in media would disagree with Clinton\u2019s praise for Kissinger before and during the 2016 Election.\n\nIn the memo, the campaign notes, \u201cKissinger is known for direct involvement in secret coups against democratically elected presidents, support of notorious dictators, the expansion of the national security state, and various human rights violations.\u201d The memo quoted Greg Grandin, author of \u201cKissinger\u2019s Shadow,\u201d who wrote in The Nation that Kissinger was responsible for the death of three, maybe 4 million people in Vietnam, Cambodia, and other countries. The deaths of millions occurred as Kissinger colluded with \u201cbig corporations and wealthy bankers.\u201d\n\nThis is a stark indictment of brutal American imperialism and the role war has played in expanding U.S. capitalism, whether Sanders would use those terms to describe his comments or not.\n\nIt is important to consider the criticism of Kissinger within the context in which it came up during the debate: when the U.S. government\u2019s history of intervening and overthrowing governments was raised by Sanders.\n\n\u201cIn Libya, for example, the United States, Secretary Clinton, as secretary of state, working with some other countries, did get rid of a terrible dictator named Gaddafi,\u201d Sanders recounted. \u201cBut what happened is a political vacuum developed. ISIS came in, and now occupies significant territory in Libya, and is now prepared, unless we stop them, to have a terrorist foothold.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cThis is nothing new. This has gone on 50 or 60 years, where the United States has been involved in overthrowing governments. Mossadegh back in 1953. Nobody knows who Mossadegh was, democratically-elected prime minister of Iran. He was overthrown by British and American interests because he threatened oil interests of the British. And as a result of that, the shah of Iran came in, terrible dictator. The result of that, you had the Iranian Revolution coming in, and that is where we are today. Unintended consequences.\u201d\n\nAs highlighted in the memo, Kissinger played a role in the coup by overriding \u201cState Department and Pentagon objections to allow Iran broad access to military equipment.\u201d He also \u201cauthorized the CIA training of the Shah\u2019s torturous secret police. He exacerbated tensions with Tehran after the Revolution (resulting in the hostage crisis) by urging [President Jimmy] Carter to grant the Shah asylum in the United States.\u201d\n\nOn one hand, confronting Clinton over her support for Kissinger makes it possible for Sanders to suggest she supports overthrowing governments to advance U.S. foreign policy, if officials deem regime change to be necessary. It also allows Sanders to distinguish himself from Clinton. Presumably, if citizens condemn Kissinger for his role in war crimes, it stands to reason that Sanders can plot a course forward for U.S. foreign policy, which rejects such a brutal foreign policy.\n\nIf Clinton has ever disagreed with Kissinger because of his past war crimes or support for horrendous policies, she has not made her disagreements well-known to the public. Instead, Clinton has expressed pride about being a member of a \u201cfascinating club\u201d of living former secretaries of state, which transcend \u201cpartisan differences.\u201d\n\nAnother former secretary of state she celebrates is Madeleine Albright, and Albright once soberly answered a question about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iraq, which resulted in the deaths of half of a million children, by saying the price was \u201cworth it.\u201d\n\nKissinger helped Clinton find her footing as a secretary of state by checking in with her regularly, \u201csharing astute observations about foreign leaders, and sending me written reports on his travels,\u201d she wrote in her book, \u201cHard Choices.\u201d\n\nClinton wrote a review of Kissinger\u2019s \u201cNew World Order\u201d book in 2014. She called Kissinger her \u201cfriend\u201d and also highlighted how he had helped her when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cThough we have often seen the world and some of our challenges quite differently, and advocated different responses now and in the past, what comes through clearly in this new book is a conviction that we, and President Obama, share: a belief in the indispensability of continued American leadership in service of a just and liberal order,\u201d Clinton declared. (*Note: To the extent that disagreements exist, they have been kept fairly private.)\n\nIn 2009, Clinton and Kissinger were interviewed together by Jon Meacham for Newsweek. Aside from the moments in which she appeared to flatter Kissinger, what is more troublesome is how she approved of Kissinger\u2019s view of war.\n\n\u201cI would say the special experience of American wartime policy in the last 40 years, from Vietnam on, is that the war itself became controversial in the country and that the most important thing we need in the current situation is, whatever disagreements there may be on tactics, that the legitimacy of the war itself does not become a subject of controversy. We have to start with the assumption, obviously, that whatever administration is conducting a war wants to end it,\u201d Kissinger argued.\n\nClinton said, \u201cRight.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody has more at stake than the administration in office,\u201d Kissinger continued. \u201cBut if you look at the debates we had on Vietnam, Iraq, and so forth, ending the war became defined as the withdrawal of forces and as the primary if not the exclusive exit strategy. But in fact the best exit strategy is victory. Another is diplomacy. Another is the war just dying out.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if you identify exit with withdrawal of American forces, you neglect the political objective,\u201d Kissinger maintained. \u201cIn such circumstances, you trap yourself in a position in which the administration in office gets assaulted for insufficient dedication to ending the war, [and] it has to do things that can be against its better judgment. We often found ourselves there.\n\nLater, Kissinger stated, \u201cThe debate ought to be in that framework and not, do we want to end the war? How quickly can we end the war? I take it for granted that the administration wants to end it as quickly as is at all possible. Why would they not?\u201d\n\nWhat Kissinger argued is it is never reasonable or fair for there to be an antiwar backlash against the government for perpetuating war. The reason it is unfair is because every presidential administration wants to end wars. Even when those administrations start wars, if one believes Kissinger, part of the objective immediately becomes working to end the wars that were started. It\u2019s a variation of the \u201cpeace through strength\u201d mantra promoted by neoconservatives and a perfect rationale for someone like Kissinger, who has been revered instead of shunned for his role in atrocities.\n\nKissinger supports bombing ISIS with a disproportionate amount of U.S. military force because he believes that is what militants who murder Americans on television deserve. How much of this insight is wisdom, which would influence Clinton when deciding how to drag America deeper into war in Iraq? What sort of atrocities would she allow to occur?\n\nHere is the exchange between Sanders and Clinton on Kissinger:\n\nBelow is the full list of \u201cegregious acts\u201d committed by Kissinger, which the Sanders campaign tried to convince the press to pay attention last night.\n\n1. In White House tapes released in 2010, Kissinger is heard telling Nixon in 1973 that helping Soviet Jews emigrate, and escape oppression, was \u2018not an objective of American foreign policy.\u2019 He also said, \u201cAnd if they put Jews into gas chambers in the Soviet Union, it is not an American concern. Maybe a humanitarian concern.\u201d Jewish leaders and organizations expressed outrage over this. (NYT)\n\n2. Kissinger helped wage an illegal war in Cambodia between 1969 and 1973. The war wrecked the country through a huge bombing campaign that killed some 100,000 civilians, and set the stage for the rise of the genocidal Khmer Rouge. Kissinger hid the bombing from the public and U.S Congress by working with military officers to falsify records. (NYT, Politico)\n\n3. Kissinger authorized the secret bombing of Laos during the Vietnam War. There, U.S. forces conducted over 580,000 bombing missions over nine years. Laos\u2019 accounting of its casualties cites more than 50,000 people killed and injured by accidents and unexploded ordinance, more than 20,000 of them after the end of the war (Washington Post).\n\n4. In South Asia, Kissinger supported Pakistan\u2019s military dictatorship and the bloody crackdown in 1971 on what is today Bangladesh. Conservative estimates say that roughly 200,000 were killed; the official Bangladeshi estimate is three million. Ten million Bengali refugees fled to India, where untold numbers died in refugee camps. Kissinger knowingly violated U.S. law in allowing secret arms transfers to Pakistan during the India-Pakistan war, despite warnings from White House staff and State Department and Pentagon lawyers. (Politico, New Yorker)\n\n5. According to GWU\u2019s National Security Archive, the Indonesian government\u2019s invasion of Portuguese East Timor in December 1975 occurred with Kissinger\u2019s blessing, and behind the backs of Congress. Some 200,000 Timorese died during the 25-year occupation. Kissinger was aware that Suharto planned to invade East Timor, but the invasion was legally problematic because of Indonesia\u2019s use of U.S. military equipment that Congress had approved only for self-defense.\n\n6. With billions of corporate investment at stake, Kissinger helped plan a CIA-led coup in Chile in 1973 that led to the assassination of democratically elected president Salvador Allende. Allende had pledged to lead his country \u201cdown the democratic road to socialism.\u201d He was replaced by the notorious dictator, Augusto Pinochet, whose government killed at least 3,197 people and tortured about 29,000. Kissinger\u2019s top deputy for Latin America advised him make human rights central to U.S.-Chilean relations; instead Kissinger told Pinochet that his regime was a victim of leftist propaganda. \u201cIn the United States, as you know, we are sympathetic with what you are trying to do here\u2026\u201cYou did a great service to the West in overthrowing Allende.\u201d\n\n7. In the late 1960s, Kissinger was involved in the secret wiretapping of National Security Council staff. He urged Nixon to go after Daniel Ellsberg for having released the Pentagon Papers, which resulted in government charges against The New York Times for violations against the Espionage Act (the charges did not hold). NYT\n\n8. In the mid-70s, Kissinger began to urge apartheid South Africa, with which he was closely aligned, to secretly intervene in Angola\u2019s civil war to prevent (Marxist) MPLA from taking power. The U.S. was directly involved in the civil war. In addition to training Angolan combat units, U.S. personnel carried out reconnaissance and supply missions, and the CIA spent over a million dollars on its mercenary program. The war took more than 300,000 lives.\n\n9. Kissinger and Nixon\u2019s orientation toward southern African states with white majority leadership was outlined in a secret NSC policy study called the \u201cTar Baby\u201d report. Anthony Sampson noted in Black and Gold that \u201cThe Nixon-Kissinger policy effectively condoned Pretoria\u2019s apartheid system, and left it to corporations and banks to try to liberalize it.\u201d According to Grandin, such policies cost millions of lives. (The Nation)\n\n10. The Shah of Iran was installed into power as a result of a joint British-U.S. coup. Kissinger engaged a policy of unconditional support for the Shah. He overrode State Department and Pentagon objections to allow Iran broad access to military equipment, and authorized the CIA training of the Shah\u2019s torturous secret police. He exacerbated tensions with Tehran after the Revolution (resulting in the hostage crisis) by urging Carter to grant the Shah asylum in the United States. (Salon)\n\n11. In 1975, Kissinger thought he had worked out a balance of power between Iran and Iraq, and thus withdrew support for the Kurds. Iraq attacked the Kurds, killing thousands, and implemented a program of ethnic cleansing, relocating Kurdish survivors and moving Arabs into their homes. (Salon)\n\n12. In 1980, Saddam Hussein invaded Iran \u2014 a war that cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Reagan supported Iraq, but also illegally trafficked weapons to Iran (Iran-Contra scandal). Raymond Tanter of the NSC reported that at a foreign-policy briefing for nominee Reagan in 1980, Kissinger suggested \u201cthe continuation of fighting between Iran and Iraq was in the American interest.\u201d The U.S., he said, \u201cshould capitalize on continuing hostilities.\u201d (Salon)\n\n13. Newly released documents have Kissinger mapping out secret contingency plans to launch airstrikes against Havana and \u201csmash Cuba.\u201d Mr. Kissinger worried that the U.S. would look weak if it did not respond. He had previously planned an underground effort to improve relations, but after Castro sent troops to Angola to help the newly independent nation fend off attacks from South Africa and right-wing guerrillas, Kissinger started to plan a U.S. airstrike.
