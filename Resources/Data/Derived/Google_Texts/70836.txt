ASPEN — A New York businessman and Turtle Conservancy board member is asking the public to stop supporting and attending the Aspen Art Museum until iPads mounted to its desert tortoises are removed.

Andy Sabin, who is acting independent from the conservancy, said Cai Guo-Qiang’s art installation “Moving Ghost Town” — which features three African sulcata tortoises that display footage of area ghost towns on their iPads — is exploitation.

Sabin said he intends to run ads in The Aspen Times calling for the boycott.
