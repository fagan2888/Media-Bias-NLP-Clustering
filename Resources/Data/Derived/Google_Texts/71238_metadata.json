We\u2019ve got to drive 500 miles and we\u2019re each going to make about $5.\u201d\n\nHole in the Wall, a University of Texas-area rock club, is where Fastball played its first and most formative gigs, as did such artists as Spoon, Black Joe Lewis, Nanci Griffith and Timbuk3. Other fixtures included Doug Sahm, Townes Van Zandt, the Velvet Underground\u2019s Sterling Morrison (who had gone on to get a Ph.D. in medieval studies at U.T.) and Mark McKinnon, the future political consultant.\n\n\u201cHole in the Wall was the first club I went to when I was visiting from Nashville in 1975,\u201d Mr. McKinnon said. \u201cAnd I immediately thought, \u2018This town is where the music is really happening. And this town is where I want to live.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat Hole in the Wall is older than the legal drinking age makes it a rarity for Austin. The city proclaimed itself the \u201clive music capital of the world\u201d in 1991 because it had more clubs per capita than any other, but it is also a cemetery for live music venues. The scene\u2019s beloved bars do not usually last. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Armadillo World Headquarters, Vulcan Gas Company and Raul\u2019s closed. In the 1990s, Liberty Lunch shuttered its doors, and most recently, it was the venerable blues club Antone\u2019s, which is supposed to reopen under new owners at what would be its sixth location.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHole in the Wall is the second-oldest, more or less continuously running venue in the city, after The Broken Spoke, a honky-tonk that opened in 1964. Despite several ownership changes, one closure and a new back bar with a larger stage, little has changed except the food: instead of the $2.50 \u201cElfagator Melt\u201d (a vegetarian sandwich) that regulars enjoyed in the 1980s, there\u2019s $8 chicken karaage from a celebrated mini-chain, East Side King, at which Paul Qui is an owner.\n\nOriginally opened by Doug Cugini, a Buffalo transplant, Hole in the Wall was never meant to be a music venue. But local buskers on The Drag (and later George Ensle and Stephen Doster, both of whom still play in town) talked their way indoors. \u201cWe just let the people from the university and the area dictate what it became,\u201d Mr. Cugini said.\n\nThe university\u2019s influence remains. The current owner, Will Tanner, a San Antonio native who also operates four bars and restaurants in El Paso, bought the club in 2008; that year, he remembers moving to break up an argument that looked like it might turn into a fight. \u201cThey were literally arguing about string theory,\u201d Mr. Tanner said.\n\nExpanded coverage of Texas is produced by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news organization.

A longtime bartender, Debbie Rombach, who began booking the club in 1990 (and eventually became its second owner) made the Hole a punk and indie music mecca, while still accommodating country, folk and blues.\n\nWhen the band Spoon first formed, all that its lead singer, Britt Daniel, wanted was a weekend slot at the bar. \u201cIt felt like a high mountain to climb,\u201d he said. \u201cI was convinced that if we played all loud, fast songs, we\u2019d get there sooner, so that\u2019s pretty much all I wrote to start off.\u201d\n\nThe club\u2019s front stage, which is cornered up against a showcase window on The Drag, with no sound mixer, and little separation from the audience, remains the club\u2019s real heart as well as its true proving ground. \u201cIt is you, 110 volts of electricity and everybody else,\u201d Mr. Tanner said.\n\n\u201cIt was a small room that got packed so easily,\u201d Mr. Daniel said. \u201cYou felt like a king playing that place.\u201d\n\nIn 2000, Spoon shot a music video, \u201cJealousy,\u201d in the dingy and graffiti-filled men\u2019s room. \u201cI spent a lot of time in that bathroom back then,\u201d Mr. Daniel said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Hole has survived by remaining as much a neighborhood bar as a rock club. Framed photos and two illustrated murals by Todd Green hang on the walls back by the bathrooms, a Hall of Fame (\u201cor infamy,\u201d Ms. Rombach said) for regulars and employees.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s on the wall,\u201d Paul Minor, 47, the club\u2019s former production manager, said as people streamed into the room last week, when the prodigiously mustachioed Brooks Brannon, 64, a former Hole in the Wall bartender, played 100 songs in 60 minutes. \u201cHe\u2019s on the wall,\u201d Mr. Minor \u2014 who first played the club when he was 17, and led the no-cover Sunday \u201cRock and Roll Free For All\u201d house band for seven years \u2014 repeated.\n\nThen Mr. Brannon bought the room a round. \u201cI get my Social Security check tomorrow,\u201d he joked. In fact, per Tanner, the drinks were on the house.\n\n\u201cMost places in Austin, if you say, \u2018I was here between \u201990 and \u201995, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, that was a million years ago,\u2019 \u201d said Ryan Deaver, 44, yet another former Hole in the Wall bartender. \u201cHere, they go, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re the baby. I don\u2019t know who you are.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140628195108, "twitter": {"description": "Hole in the Wall, a University of Texas-area club, recently had its 40th anniversary, and the members of Fastball slammed through several frenzied rock songs for the occasion.", "title": "At 40, Austin Rock Club Celebrates Rare Longevity", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/us/at-40-austin-rock-club-celebrates-rare-longevity.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002969501"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/us/29ttCulture/29ttCulture-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/us/at-40-austin-rock-club-celebrates-rare-longevity.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002969501", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/us/at-40-austin-rock-club-celebrates-rare-longevity.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "At 40, Austin Rock Club Celebrates Rare Longevity", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 28, 2014", "edt": "AddTexas", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-07-06", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Hole in the Wall (Austin, Tex, Music Venue)", "published": "2014-06-28", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Texas,Austin (Tex),Bars and Nightclubs,Rock Music,University of Texas,Fastball (Music Group),Hole in the Wall (Austin  Tex  Music Venue)", "description": "Hole in the Wall, a University of Texas-area club, recently had its 40th anniversary, and the members of Fastball slammed through several frenzied rock songs for the occasion.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jason Cohen", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/us/29ttCulture/29ttCulture-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "29ttculture", "byl": "By JASON COHEN", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Hole in the Wall, a University of Texas-area club, recently had its 40th anniversary, and the members of Fastball slammed through several frenzied rock songs for the occasion.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/us/29ttCulture/29ttCulture-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Texas", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 28, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Hole in the Wall (Austin, Tex, Music Venue)", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Austin (Tex)", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140706020008, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/us/at-40-austin-rock-club-celebrates-rare-longevity.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/us/29ttCulture/29ttCulture-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hole in the Wall, a University of Texas-area club, recently had its 40th anniversary, and the members of Fastball slammed through several frenzied rock songs for the occasion.", "title": "At 40, Austin Rock Club Celebrates Rare Longevity"}, "pdate": 20140628, "des": "Rock Music", "articleid": 100000002969501, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "At 40, Austin Rock Club Celebrates Rare Longevity", "col": "Texas Monthly", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf102\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI could almost smell the van, playing those songs,\u201d Mr. Zuniga said afterward.\n\u201cIt is you, 110 volts of electricity and everybody else,\u201d Mr. Tanner said.\n\u201cThey were literally arguing about string theory,\u201d Mr. Tanner said.\n\u201cHole in the Wall was the first club I went to when I was visiting from Nashville in 1975,\u201d Mr. McKinnon said.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe Hole has survived by remaining as much a neighborhood bar as a rock club."}
