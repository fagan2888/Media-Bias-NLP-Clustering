This is Senator Patty Murray, speaking earlier today about the Hobby Lobby case: “Just a few months ago, five men on the Supreme Court decided there should be a group of women across America who are required to ask their boss for permission to access basic health care.” This is completely insane; you really have to see it to believe it:

But is it any crazier than everything else we are hearing from Democrats this election cycle? Bizarre ravings about the Koch brothers and ginned-up racial controversies; what else do the Democrats have? When is the last time you heard any Democrat talk seriously about any public policy issue? Their policies have failed, and they are out of ammo.

So once again, the Democrats are betting on the stupidity of voters. They are gambling that distraction and demagoguery can overcome their awful record as a governing party and their lack of any meaningful solutions to the nation’s problems.

Sadly, that may not be a bad bet. Young America’s Foundation went to George Washington University, in Washington, D.C., to gauge students’ awareness of current events. The remarkable thing about this is that GWU has long been regarded as a haven for political junkies. Still, the results were not encouraging. This video tells the story; statistics below:

Here are the numbers:

–6 out of 30 students recognized this week is the anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks. –4 out of 30 students were able to name one of the American journalists beheaded at the hands of ISIS. –29 out of 30 students were able to identify one or more celebrities involved in the nude photo hacking scandal.

H.L. Mencken once wrote that “No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public.” The Democratic Party has taken his words to heart. With the nation in a deep funk, 2014 could be the acid test for that strategy.
