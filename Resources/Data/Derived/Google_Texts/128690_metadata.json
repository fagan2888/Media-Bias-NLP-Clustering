There is nothing to say that you can\u2019t have a presidential system in a unitary state.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are already some examples in the world today, and also some from the past,\u201d he added. \u201cYou see it when you look at Hitler\u2019s Germany. Later you see the example again in various other counties.\u201d\n\nLater, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s administration rolled back on his statement, claiming it was misunderstood. \u201cErdogan\u2019s \u2018Hitler\u2019s Germany\u2019 metaphor has been distorted by some news sources and has been used in the opposite sense,\u201d it said. \u201cIf the system is abused it may lead to bad management resulting in disasters as in Hitler\u2019s Germany \u2026 The important thing is to pursue fair management that serves the nation,\u201d the statement added, insisting Erdo\u011fan did not mean to speak positively of Hitler.\n\nCritics of the Turkish government, however, have characterized Erdo\u011fan as increasingly authoritarian. His government has clamped down on journalists, the Kurdish minority, and activists, especially from left-wing and pro-Kurdish groups.\n\nAlthough Erdo\u011fan has claimed Turkey has the world\u2019s freest press, the New York Times reported in 2013 that, for two years in a row, Turkey imprisoned more journalists than any other country, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nReporters Without Borders dubbed Turkey the 149th-worst country for press freedoms, out of 180. And, under Erdo\u011fan, Turkey has made more requests for content removal from social media than any other country in the world.\n\nIn December 2014, a 16-year-old Turkish student was arrested at school and thrown in jail for \u201cinsulting\u201d Erdo\u011fan, whom he called the \u201cthieving owner of the illegal palace.\u201d\n\nBefore Turkey\u2019s election in October, police violently shut down the offices of critical media outlets. The offices of Turkish newspapers that have criticized the government or fairly portrayed the Kurds have also been attacked by ultra-nationalists sympathetic to the extreme-right Nationalist Movement Party or Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development Party. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s government did virtually nothing to punish these acts of political terror.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Erdo\u011fan later claimed his statement was misunderstood, but critics say his rule is increasingly authoritarian", "title": "Turkish President Erdo\u011fan cites \u201cHitler\u2019s Germany\u201d as model as he ramps up violent repression of Kurds, journalists", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Erdo\u011fan later claimed his statement was misunderstood, but critics say his rule is increasingly authoritarian", "title": "Turkish President Erdo\u011fan cites \u201cHitler\u2019s Germany\u201d as model as he ramps up violent repression of Kurds, journalists", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/03/turkish_president_erdogan_cites_hitlers_germany_as_model_as_he_ramps_up_violent_repression_of_kurds_journalists/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/recep_erdogan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Erdo\u011fan later claimed his statement was misunderstood, but critics say his rule is increasingly authoritarian", "title": "Turkish President Erdo\u011fan cites \u201cHitler\u2019s Germany\u201d as model as he ramps up violent repression of Kurds, journalists", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/05/recep_erdogan.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ben Norton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: News, Politics NewsRight-wing Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan cited \u201cHitler\u2019s Germany\u201d as an example after which he hopes to model his government.\n\u201cErdogan\u2019s \u2018Hitler\u2019s Germany\u2019 metaphor has been distorted by some news sources and has been used in the opposite sense,\u201d it said.\n\u201cYou see it when you look at Hitler\u2019s Germany.\nAnd, under Erdo\u011fan, Turkey has made more requests for content removal from social media than any other country in the world.\nAsked at a press conference in Turkey whether such a system could maintain the unitary structure of the Turkish state, Erdo\u011fan replied \u201cYes."}
