Then the second screening mammogram will go to an uninsured Shepherd's Hope patient.\n\n\"Screening mammography has been instrumental in decreasing the death rate from breast cancer by 30 percent since 1990,\" said Dr. Robert Posniak, who works at Sand Lake. \"Participating in the 'Get a Mammogram, Give a Mammogram' program can save someone's life.\"\n\nMarni Stalhman, CEO & President of Shepherd\u2019s Hope, said a similar campaign last year resulted in over 100 free mobile mammograms-- a few of which detected cancer.\n\nTo book an appointment, call (407) 363-2772 or visit ShepherdsHope.org or SandLakeImaging.com.
