Bernie Sanders (I-VT).\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Many Democrats assumed Clinton would have an easy walk to the nomination, and the party apparatus got behind her early.\n\nBut now Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the six-term congresswoman from Florida who chairs the Democratic National Committee, has come under fire from liberals for planning so few presidential debates and scheduling three of the first four on weekend evenings \u2013 including last Sunday, on a day dominated by two major NFL playoff games.\n\nSanders and former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley have said the timing of the debates was intentional, to help what was once expected to be an uncontested coronation of Clinton as the party\u2019s standard-bearer.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Gets a Taste of What Could Be a Painful 2016\n\nSanders has changed all of that. Recent polls show Clinton with a slim lead over the self-described democratic socialist in Iowa. Scheduling a town hall event just a week before the caucuses gives the former First Lady another chance to highlight her differences with Sanders and hammer home the case for her candidacy.\n\nClinton\u2019s troubles extend beyond the Hawkeye State. A CNN/WMUR survey released late Tuesday shows Sanders with an astounding 60-33 lead in New Hampshire, which holds the country\u2019s first primary on Feb. 9.\n\nLosses in both states could seriously hamper Clinton\u2019s bid and drag out the Democratic primary.\n\nRelated: Is It Time for Clinton to Start Lowering Expectations in New Hampshire?\n\nAdding another event to the calendar is also a tacit acknowledgement of the enthusiasm gap between Republicans and Democrats, as demonstrated by the debate ratings.\n\nLast week\u2019s GOP debate on Fox Business Network drew 11 million viewers, down from the network-record 13.5 million who watched the network\u2019s first Republican debate two months ago.\n\nThe first two Republican debates last year remain the most-watched: 24 million on Fox News Channel in August and just over 23 million on CNN in September. Those numbers can be contributed in part to curiosity about Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nBy comparison, Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate drew 10.2 million viewers. A debate hosted by ABC on the Saturday before Christmas in December had 7.8 million. Both are considerably off the roughly 15 million viewers who tuned in to the party\u2019s first debate, on a Tuesday night in October, when there were still five contenders.\n\nAs Clinton continues to defend her frontrunner status, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see more events added to the calendar.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Democratic Party appears to be waking up to the fact that its nomination process i", "title": "As Sanders Surges, Dems Finally Realize They Have a Race on Their Hands", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/20/Sanders-Surges-Dems-Finally-Realize-They-Have-Race-Their-Hands", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/bernie_sanders_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/20/Sanders-Surges-Dems-Finally-Realize-They-Have-Race-Their-Hands", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/bernie_sanders_0.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Democratic Party appears to be waking up to the fact that its nomination process i", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Democratic Party appears to be waking up to the fact that its nomination process isn\u2019t going quite as planned.\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Gets a Taste of What Could Be a Painful 2016Sanders has changed all of that.\nBy comparison, Sunday night\u2019s Democratic debate drew 10.2 million viewers.\nLast week\u2019s GOP debate on Fox Business Network drew 11 million viewers, down from the network-record 13.5 million who watched the network\u2019s first Republican debate two months ago.\nRelated: Why Hillary Clinton Has a Tenuous Hold on Black VotersThe surprise prime-time event is belated recognition by the Democratic Party that it has a real race on its hands between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen.
