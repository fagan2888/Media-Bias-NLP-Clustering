Enrollment runs through Feb. 15.\n\nLast year, it took 15 days for the state to reach 11,000 enrollees when the health-law expansion first launched in October 2013.\n\nThe state said another 33,368 applicants have been deemed eligible for Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid program for low-income residents.\n\n\"We are continuing to see tremendous interest,\" said Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California. \"There still is a lot of work to do, though.\"\n\nThe state didn't immediately release figures on renewals of private health plans.\n\nAbout 1.2 million Californians enrolled in the first open enrollment, and they face a Dec. 15 deadline if they want to change coverage for Jan. 1.\n\nExisting policies will be automatically renewed if consumers do nothing. However, exchange officials are urging people to shop around because their monthly premiums may be going up and their network of doctors and hospitals might be changing.\n\nMore than 2.2 million Californians have been added to the Medi-Cal program in 2014. Medi-Cal enrollment is open year round.\n\nTuesday, California regulators issued a report finding that Covered California's two biggest insurers violated state law by significantly overstating the number of doctors available to patients.\n\nThe error rates for Anthem Blue Cross, a unit of WellPoint Inc., and Blue Shield of California both topped 25%, according to the California Department of Managed Health Care.\n\nAnthem and Blue Shield disputed the state's findings and said the agency's survey methods were flawed.\n\nIn another troubling sign for consumers, California's exchange continues to struggle at answering the phone.\n\nIn October, 27% of calls were picked up within 30 seconds. That's far short of the state's 80% goal for customer service.\n\nAnother 31% of callers gave up entirely and abandoned their calls in October, according to state data.\n\nAn exchange spokesman said response times have improved since October, but the state is receiving a heavy call volume. Some callers reported wait times of an hour on Thursday.\n\nSpokesman Dana Howard said consumers should use the Covered California website to find a local insurance agent or certified enrollment counselor to help them in person.\n\n\"We do encourage people to see someone in person,\" Howard said. \"That will be the most effective way for people to enroll.\"\n\nCovered California spent $13.4 million to hire two outside firms to help answer calls and it nearly doubled the number of call-center workers in preparation for open enrollment.\n\nThe exchange said its revamped website was working for the majority of consumers thus far. In the first four days, the coveredca.com site logged 314,000 unique visitors, according to the state.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "California enrolls 11,357 in first 4 days of Obamacare open enrollment", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's insurance exchange said 11,357 new people signed up for Obamacare coverage in the first four days of open enrollment.", "title": "California enrolls 11,357 in first 4 days of Obamacare open enrollment", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-enrollment-california-20141120-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-546e556f/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-enrollment-california-20141120", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, covered california, affordable care act", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82037844", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-11-20", "Description": "California's insurance exchange said 11,357 new people signed up for Obamacare coverage in the first four days of open enrollment.
