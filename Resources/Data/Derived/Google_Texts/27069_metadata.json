Hobby Lobby and Halbig v. Burwell court decisions as something else \u2014 the War on Women, a war on contraception, judicial fiat, and a misreading of the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare statute language \u2014both decisions are major blows to Obamacare.\n\nAll of the posturing, scrambling, and work to mitigate, spin, and overturn these decisions with new laws is nothing more than rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\n\nThe Obamacare ship is going down; it is now just a matter of when.\n\nThe Halbig decision is particularly damning: a slap in the face of a Congress that rushed to get the ACA bill instituted as law, without bothering to read the actual language. Now that language is coming back to bite them, and rightfully so.\n\nThe attorneys who did bother to read, crafted their arguments according to the letter of the law, and won on those merits.\n\nIn 2012, Jonathan Gruber, economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the paid architect of the Obamacare exchanges, not once, but twice laid out on tape that the restriction of subsidies to States with their own exchanges was the operating method to coerce State governors into creating their own exchanges rather than shifting the burden back to the federal government. So there can be no plausible deniability, or \u201cspeak-o\u201d (like a \u201ctypo\u201d) as Gruber excused.\n\nThe Obama administration and the other engineers knew what they had written and they simply expected to get away with it.\n\nSo Americans look on as rats \u2014 the Congressional Democrats who voted in this nightmare \u2014 swim away from the sinking vessel, while they try to distract us from their voting record in the hopes we\u2019ll have forgotten by November 2014.\n\nMeanwhile the steerage passengers \u2014 the individuals who lost their insurance policies, who are laboring under higher premiums, or who are suffering under limited networks and the inability to find a decent doctor\u2014 are drowning among the wreckage.\n\nJulie Appleby of Kaiser Health News reports:\n\n\u201cConsumer groups argue many enrollees were misled. In California, consumers filed class-action lawsuits against some insurers, alleging they were given inaccurate information about their plans\u2019 limitations and about which doctors and hospitals participate in them. \u201cNationally, regulators and insurance agents are inundated with complaints, while lawmakers are considering rules to ensure consumers\u2019 access to doctors. For plans being submitted for sale next year, the federal Department of Health and Human Services said it will more closely scrutinize whether networks are adequate.\u201d\n\nThe DHHS cannot even build an adequate website, and at this point, have more loss than gain in the court cases challenging its mandates. So it\u2019s a long shot to expect they will do anything about making networks adequate. Americans won\u2019t be holding their breath, but will continue to file lawsuits, while those who went without insurance before Obamacare, will continue in that vein, as the system that was supposed to make insurance \u201caffordable and easy\u201d turns out to be anything but. So, the very people that this law was supposed to help\u2014the uninsured, the sick, and the poor\u2014are still treading water, and more than likely will drown before it\u2019s all worked out.\n\nThen there are the first class passengers\u2014the well-off who can afford to pay higher premiums\u2014they are taking the life boats called concierge care.\n\nDr. John C. Goodman, president and CEO of the National Center for Policy Analysis, wrote about this in 2013:\n\n\u201cThose who can afford to get to the head of the line will find a way to do so. For a little less than $2,000 a year, for example, seniors on Medicare can contract with a concierge doctor. These doctors promise prompt access to care and usually talk with their patients by telephone and email. They serve as an advocate for their patients, much as an attorney is an advocate for his client.\u201d\n\nIt is no wonder the Obama administration seeks to malign and punish the rich \u2014 they\u2019re the only ones who would have a fighting chance of escaping this sinking ship relatively unscathed.\n\nThe Obama Administration spent over 600 million on a website that is an insult to any web developer. The bugs and fixes to this supposed site still did not resolve the big picture issues: Healthcare.gov is still wide open for fraud and security breaches, the data that the site spits out to insurers is still inconsistent, and often incorrect.\n\nThe Washington Times reported in June that \u201cAmericans for Tax Reform discovered that site errors on the Obamacare website left 22,000 applications untouched.\u201d\n\nEven today, Healthcare.gov still lacks the \u201cback end\u201d needed to determine how many enrollees actually have coverage and are paying their premiums. So even the numbers given by DHHS (based on surveys, rather than actual verifiable data) is nothing but educated guesses, coupled with smoke and mirrors.\n\nAnd what happens when you need to renew your insurance through the federal exchange? According to the Associated Press the \u201cInsurance exchange customers who opt for convenience by automatically renewing their coverage for 2015 are likely to receive dated and inaccurate financial aid amounts from the government, say industry officials, advocates and other experts.\u201d\n\nSo, if you have a subsidized plan, you may well have to go through the hoops process at Healthcare.gov all over again in order to renew it for 2015 at an affordable price.\n\nThe State exchanges are faring no better, and some \u2014 like Minnesota \u2014 aren\u2019t even up and running.\n\nOregon, Nevada, and Maryland spent millions on their exchanges, then decided to scrap them, offloading their citizens to the federal exchange. This is more wasted taxpayer capital on a supposedly \u201caffordable\u201d system.\n\nFrom The Washington Times: \u201cWriting on The Federalist blog, Phil Kerpen calculates that seven states spent $1.2 billion building faulty and abandoned Obamacare sites. As the implementation of Obamacare continues in fits, starts, burps and hiccups, it has become clear that the program is a black hole, swallowing resources, and is a nightmare for enrollees and an embarrassment for the administration.\u201d\n\nAt this point, even bilge pumps and boards cannot mitigate the damage to the hull of this ship.
