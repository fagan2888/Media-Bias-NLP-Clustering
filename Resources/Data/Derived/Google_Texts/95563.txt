Massive Rule Changes to Affect Your Medicare

Cody Wilson, who created the first fully 3-D printable gun last spring, has landed a quarter-million-dollar book deal with Simon & Schuster.The head of the 3-D-printed gun group, Defense Distributed, signed the deal in December to write a non-fiction book about his efforts to create the digital weapon, Forbes reports.The working title of the book is "Negative Liberty," Wilson told the publication, explaining, "The whole point to me is to add to the hacker mythology and to have a very, very accurate and contentious portrayal of what we think about the current political situation, our attitude and political orientation, a lasting remark.""It won't be a manifesto," he said. "But culturally, I hope to leave a couple of zingers . . . a touchstone for the young, disaffected radical toward his own political and social development, that kind of thing."Wilson, whose blueprints were downloaded 100,000 times in two days after he initially published them online, said his proposal drew mixed responses from publishers."Some think I'm awful, that what I did was terrible, and the others think this is an incredible story that needs to be told," said Wilson, 25.The graduate of the University of Central Arkansas is involved in a legal dispute with the State Department, which demanded that he take the blueprints off the Internet.He is also focusing on the software he helped build, called Dark Wallet, which allows for anonymous transactions using the virtual currency bitcoin, reports The Wall Street Journal."We need an anonymous cash online," Wilson told the Journal, "It's not that I want you to buy drugs. It's just that I think you should have the freedom to do it."Wilson reportedly works from an apartment near the University of Texas at Austin with a group of self-described anti-establishment techies.Meanwhile, anticipating a potential legal battle with the government over publication of the 3-D-printing gun file, he said the book advance could come in handy."At least now if I'm in prison I'll have something to do," he joked to Forbes.
