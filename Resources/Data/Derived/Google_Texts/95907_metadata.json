The suit could blow to smithereens the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nScott Pruitt and some kindred spirits might accelerate the ACA\u2019s collapse by blocking another of the Obama administration\u2019s lawless uses of the Internal Revenue Service. Pruitt was elected Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general by promising to defend states\u2019 prerogatives against federal encroachments. Today he and some litigious people elsewhere are defending a state prerogative that the ACA explicitly created. If they succeed, the ACA\u2019s disintegration will accelerate.\n\nBecause under the ACA, insurance companies cannot refuse coverage because of an individual\u2019s pre-existing condition. Because many people might therefore wait to purchase insurance after they become sick, the ACA requires people to buy insurance. And because many people cannot afford the insurance that satisfies the ACA\u2019s criteria, the ACA mandate makes it necessary to provide subsidies for those people.\n\nThe four words that threaten disaster for the ACA say the subsidies shall be available to persons who purchase health insurance in an exchange \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d But 34 states have chosen not to establish exchanges.\n\nSo the IRS has said, with its breezy indifference to legality, that subsidies shall also be dispensed to those who purchase insurance through federal exchanges the government has established in those 34 states. Pruitt is challenging the IRS in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, and there are similar challenges in Indiana, Virginia and Washington, D.C.\n\nThe IRS says its \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the law is \u201cconsistent with,\u201d and justified by, the \u201cstructure of\u201d the ACA. The IRS means that without its rule, the ACA would be unworkable and that Congress could not have meant to allow this. The ACA\u2019s legislative history, however, demonstrates Congress clearly wanted subsidies available only through state exchanges.\n\nSome have suggested the language limiting subsidies to state-run exchanges is a drafting error. Well.\n\nSome of the ACA\u2019s myriad defects do reflect its slapdash enactment. But the four potentially lethal words were carefully considered and express Congress\u2019 intent.\n\nCongress made subsidies available only through state exchanges as a means of coercing states into setting up exchanges.\n\nIn Senate Finance Committee deliberations, Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., one of the bill\u2019s primary authors, suggested the possibility of conditioning tax credits on state compliance because only by doing so could the federal government induce state cooperation with the ACA. Then the law\u2019s insurance requirements could be imposed on states without running afoul of constitutional law that prevents the federal government from commandeering state governments. The pertinent language.\n\nIf courts disallow the IRS\u2019 \u201cinterpretation\u201d of the law, the ACA will not function as intended in 34 states with 65 percent of the nation\u2019s population. If courts allow the IRS\u2019 demarche, they will validate this:\n\nBy dispensing subsidies through federal exchanges, the IRS will spend tax revenues without congressional authorization. And by enforcing the employer mandate in states that have only federal exchanges, it will collect taxes without congressional authorization.\n\nIf the IRS can do neither, it cannot impose penalties on employers who fail to offer ACA-approved insurance to employees.\n\nIf the IRS can do both, Congress can disband because it has become peripheral to American governance.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Opinion, Columns", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Someone you probably are not familiar with has filed a suit you probably have not heard about concerning a four-word phrase you should know about.
