HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) – Authorities say sand swept off Hilton Head Island beaches by this month’s damaging rains and storm surges will be more than offset by a $20 million beach renewal project already planned for next year.

The Island Packet reports (http://bit.ly/1LDDOVg ) that Hilton Head’s beaches lost about 160,000 cubic yards of sand to the storms. Town director of projects Scott Liggett says that’s about $1.7 million worth.

The storms carved 13-foot-high cliffs out of the dunes on one beach, and entire stretches of dry sand disappeared in some areas. But Liggett says none of the erosion is considered an emergency.

About 2.2 million cubic yards of sand will be pumped onto the island’s major beaches over four months, beginning by February.

Mayor David Bennett says the project’s timing is very fortunate.
