The rest of us are saying, 'Wait a minute, there\u2019s a lot of panic when it comes to the flu, to lice.' As a parent, I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Well there should be a little bit of a justification for worry here.'\"\n\nAccording to Salon.com, Dr. Restrepo stated, \"The viruses behave a little bit different. The flu virus is something that\u2019s contagious through the air, through a droplet, it\u2019s a little bit easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s here!\u201d Hasselbeck jumped in.\n\nIn 2013, Hasselbeck was worried about Obamacare, which provides health care access to people who normally can't afford or be accepted by health insurance plans.\n\n\"It sounds more like Obamascare to me than Obamacare,\" said Hasselbeck, noted MediaMatters.org (video below).\n\nSources: Mediaite.com, Salon.com, MediaMatters.org", "article_metadata": {"theme-version": "1.2.4", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck Upset Over Doctor's Calm Explanation of Ebola (Video)", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/health/conditions/elisabeth-hasselbeck-upset-over-doctors-calm-explanation-ebola-video", "image": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ov-file-archive/piece/3/3/735703.0.elisabethhasselbeck.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Elisabeth Hasselbeck Upset Over Doctor's Calm Explanation of Ebola (Video)"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-01T17:01:24+00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "publish_date": "2014-10-01T17:01:24+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "ov": {"id": 848955}, "theme-color": "#0e0e0e"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf86c\"", "article_summary": "\"It sounds more like Obamascare to me than Obamacare,\" said Hasselbeck, noted MediaMatters.org (video below).\n\u201cYou have a very calm tone,\u201d Hasselbeck stated.\nAs a parent, I\u2019m thinking, \u2018Well there should be a little bit of a justification for worry here.'\"\nThe flu virus is something that\u2019s contagious through the air, through a droplet, it\u2019s a little bit easier.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s here!\u201d Hasselbeck jumped in.\nDr. Restrepo informed the anxious Fox News host that Ebola could only be spread via contact with bodily fluids, noted Mediaite.com (video below)."}
