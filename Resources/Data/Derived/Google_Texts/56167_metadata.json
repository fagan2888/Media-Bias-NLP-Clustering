It's Wednesday evening here in Washington. Here's the latest.\n\nTHE BIG STORY\n\nThe Labor Department is moving forward with plans to regulate retirement investment advisers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe so-called fiduciary rule released Wednesday will require those advisers to act in the best interest of their clients.\n\nDemocrats see the fiduciary rule as a way of cleaning up Wall Street, but Republicans argue it will raise the cost of investment advice for retirees.\n\nThe fight over the fiduciary rule is just beginning.\n\nThe Hill's Peter Schroeder has the story:\n\nThe Obama administration on Wednesday unveiled new rules for retirement investment advisers, turning aside pressure from industry groups to abandon the proposal.\n\nThe regulations, which were issued by the Labor Department, establish requirements that the White House says will save Americans billions of dollars by combating bad behavior on Wall Street.\n\n\"A little over a year ago, the president called for action to crack down on conflicts of interest in retirement advice ... Today, we reached a crucial milestone,\" said Jeff Zients, director of the National Economic Council, in a Tuesday call with reporters.\n\n\"It ensures that retirement savers get investment advice in their best interests so they can grow their nest egg.\"\n\nThe now-finalized rules mark one of the largest regulatory undertakings for the Labor Department under Obama, as the most recent comment period spanned five months, generated 3,000 comment letters and involved over 100 meetings.\n\nUnder the new rules, most investment advisers for retirement plans will have to meet a \"fiduciary\" standard, requiring them to put the interest of their clients ahead of any others. And if they don't, clients would have the ability to file lawsuits against them.\n\nWhite House analysis found that conflicted advice can cost Americans up to $17 billion a year, and can drive down investment returns for middle and working-class Americans by a full percentage point.\n\nWhile the rules may finally be done, the fight over them is only beginning.\n\nGroups in the financial industry could mount legal challenges to the regulatory effort, and some members of Congress are exploring legislative ways to change them.\n\nClick here for the full story: http://bit.ly/1SQG4KD\n\nAlso, Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonCarson rooting for Trump, Sanders debate Clinton ad slams Trump for calling pregnancy 'an inconvenience' Sanders: Networks calling about Trump debate MORE praised the new rules, saying they would keep Wall Street from \"ripping off\" Americans: http://bit.ly/1RPevyX\n\nRepublicans, though, vowed to fight the new rules. http://bit.ly/1UJ4OYS\n\nON TAP FOR THURSDAY\n\nThe Senate Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs Committee will hold a hearing on the two White House nominations to the Securities and Exchange Commission and a nomination to the position of director of the U.S. Mint. http://1.usa.gov/1WcPW4s\n\nThe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will hold a hearing to examine the federal role in keeping water and wastewater infrastructure affordable. http://1.usa.gov/1MSpJG4\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a meeting to mark up three bills including S.2390 to protect whistleblowers at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and consider the nomination of three judges to the U.S. Court of International Trade and one judge to the U.S. District Court of the District of Hawaii. http://1.usa.gov/1TCmxQC\n\nTOMORROW'S REGS TODAY\n\nThe Obama administration will publish 165 new regulations, proposed rules, notices and other administrative actions in Thursday's edition of the Federal Register.\n\n--The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) will issue new safety standards for garage doors.\n\nThe changes update existing rules to ensure that residents don't become trapped under automatic garage doors.\n\nThe rule goes into effect in 30 days. http://bit.ly/208fFLk\n\n--The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) will delay protections for parrots.\n\nThe FWS proposed listing the northern scarlet macaw as an endangered species in July 2012, but is now proposing to list it as a threatened species, which would afford the parrot fewer protections.
