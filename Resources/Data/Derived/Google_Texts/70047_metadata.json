They were usually derailed with one question: \u201cAre they legal?\u201d he\u2019d ask. People might find the stories more interesting if the politician was doing something illegal, he figured.\n\nThat\u2019s the bottom line of today\u2019s Star Tribune investigation into the trip-taking habits of Minnesota 3rd District U.S. Rep. Erik Paulsen. His trips are all legal.\n\nThe public didn\u2019t pick up the tab; various institutions looking for legal influence at the Capitol did.\n\nThere\u2019s another key line in the Star Tribune\u2019s story, however.\n\nPaulsen declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\nHis spokesperson delivered an email statement that answered my former colleague\u2019s question.\n\n\u201cHis recent travel has focused on the Cuban embargo, the AIDS epidemic and health care issues at refugee camps in the Horn of Africa,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cHe has brought one family member a few times, but it\u2019s always in accordance with the House of Representatives ethics rules.\u201d\n\nSometimes perception isn\u2019t everything; sometimes it barely registers a blip, if that. As the latest polls \u2014 and decades\u2019 previous \u2014 have proven, people have a low opinion of Congress. So if they think a congressman is a free-loading, influence-peddling, globe-trotting representative, it\u2019s probably little more than what they\u2019ve come to expect.\n\nBut it would be a nice pat on the voters\u2019 head for a politician to at least step up to the allegation and say \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nIs there information to be gleaned by seeing things firsthand? Probably. But the Star Tribune notes that Paulsen hasn\u2019t signed on nor advocated any legislation on the subjects for which he and his family\u2019s trips were allegedly focused.\n\nPeople in Congress have been doing this for years (DFLer U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison had previously received Star Tribune attention for his trips) and while it has a faint, stale aroma, there\u2019s nothing to prove it\u2019s unethical in the political body that decides for itself what unethical is.\n\nAs for the voters? None of this is illegal. Whose fault is that?\n\nRelated: The corrupting of Congressman Erik Paulsen (City Pages)\n\nHave congressional seat, will travel (MinnPost)\n\nJohn Oliver takes a deep, terrifying look at the role of money in Congress (Vox)", "article_metadata": {"mpr-content-group": "newscut", "mpr-collection": "Politics", "WT.cg_n": "News Blogs", "WT.z_mpr-site": "news", "description": "People in Congress have been doing this for years and while it has a faint, stale aroma, there's nothing to prove it's unethical in the political body that decides for itself what unethical is.", "author": "Bob Collins", "og": {"site_name": "NewsCut", "description": "People in Congress have been doing this for years and while it has a faint, stale aroma, there's nothing to prove it's unethical in the political body that decides for itself what unethical is.", "title": "Free trips legal for MN rep and family, but smell bad", "url": "http://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2016/04/free-trips-for-mn-congressman-and-family-smell-bad-but-are-legal/", "image": "http://publicradio1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/newscut/wp-content/themes/mpr-news-blogs/images/newscut-opengraph.png?v=2", "type": "article"}, "mpr-site": "news", "twitter": {"description": "People in Congress have been doing this for years and while it has a faint, stale aroma, there's nothing to prove it's unethical in the political body that decides for itself what unethical is.", "title": "Free trips legal for MN rep and family, but smell bad", "url": "http://blogs.mprnews.org/newscut/2016/04/free-trips-for-mn-congressman-and-family-smell-bad-but-are-legal/", "image": "http://publicradio1.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/newscut/wp-content/themes/mpr-news-blogs/images/newscut-opengraph.png?v=2", "creator": "@newscut", "site": "@mprnews", "card": "summary"}, "mpr-content-topic": "politics", "WT.cg_s": "NewsCut", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s the bottom line of today\u2019s Star Tribune investigation into the trip-taking habits of Minnesota 3rd District U.S. Rep.
