President Obama’s news conference about the health-care law was filled with analogies and sometimes awkward comparisons: in explaining the struggles with the law's rollout, he talked about iTunes, seat belts and fumbles. Here are nine of the best quotes.

1. "I think it's fair to say that the rollout has been rough so far."

2. "I am not a perfect man and I will not be a perfect president."

3. "The Web site itself is doing a lot of stuff."

4. "I was not informed directly that the Web site would not be working... the way it was supposed to. Had I been informed, I wouldn't be going out saying, 'Boy, this is going to be great.'"

5. "I'm accused of a lot of things, but I don't think I'm stupid enough to go around saying, 'This is going to be like shopping on Amazon or Travelocity' a week before the Web site opens if I thought that it wasn't going to work."

6. "With respect to the pledge I made that if you like your plan you can keep it ... the way I put that forward, unequivocally, ended up not being accurate."

7. "What we're also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy."

8. "That's on me … we fumbled the rollout on this health-care law."

9. "And you know, buying health insurance is never going to be like buying a song on iTunes. You know, it's just a much more complicated transaction."
