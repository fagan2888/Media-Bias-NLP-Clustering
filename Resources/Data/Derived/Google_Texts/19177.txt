Today's Rick Santorum news: With less than a month to go until the 2016 Iowa presidential caucus, 2012 GOP winner Rick Santorum is sharpening his rhetoric against front runner Ted Cruz.

Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, this week released his first TV ad in the state. In it he targets Cruz as unprepared for the presidency and mocks the Texas senator for his reading of "Green Eggs and Ham" from the Senate floor.

On Tuesday, Santorum defended the ad and again went after Cruz.

In an interview with TheBlaze, Santorum noted that Cruz's reading of the book, part of a filibuster in an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, ultimately failed.

"It was a failure. It was a poor strategy that failed," Santorum said. Meanwhile, the Senate in December did vote to repeal Obamacare without Cruz's help, he said.

Santorum was a surprise GOP winner of the Iowa caucus in 2012. In his 2016 campaign, he has put emphasis on the Hawkeye State, campaigning in each of the state's 99 counties.

But with the Feb. 1 caucus less than four weeks away, Santorum, down in the polls, has turned up the rhetoric.

In another appearance Tuesday, he labeled Cruz as an inexperienced grandstander.

"The idea we are going to put in someone with absolutely no experience or has two years of grandstanding in Washington D.C. as the person we want to lead this country against the most serious threat this country has ever faced, that the world has ever faced, the West has ever faced throughout history, I don't think Republicans ultimately are going to do that," Santorum said on Fox News Radio's "Kilmeade and Friends."
