Peter Roskam (R., Ill.), the House Republican chief deputy whip and co-chair of the House Republican Israel Caucus, said the dip in funding proves that the White House\u2019s budget priorities are askew.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the administration\u2019s budget proposes massive cuts to U.S.-Israel missile defense cooperation, while maintaining billions of dollars of wasteful spending for programs including Obamacare, exhibits fundamentally skewed fiscal priorities,\u201d Roskam told the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nIsrael is experiencing an uptick in rocket attacks from the Palestinian territories. The missile defense programs are one of the few lines of defense for Israeli citizens, Roskam said.\n\n\u201cThese cooperative programs save lives, prevent conflict escalation, and are a joint financial and technological venture between the United States and Israel,\u201d Roskam said. \u201cThey are the first line of defense against the thousands of rockets pointed at Israel at any given moment.\u201d\n\nRoskam accused the administration of coddling America\u2019s enemies and abandoning its allies.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s conciliatory foreign policy empowers our greatest enemies, such as Iran and Syria, while his budget agenda simultaneously seeks to curb critical investments in our national security and key allies,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Pentagon is standing by Obama\u2019s budgetary choices, which it says were formed in close collaboration with Israel.\n\n\u201cThroughout the development of these critical missile defense systems, our goal has been to ensure that U.S. investments meet Israel\u2019s security and their production capacity,\u201d Carl Woog, an assistant press secretary at the Pentagon, told the Free Beacon.\n\n\u201cTo that end, the department\u2019s submission was determined in close consultation with Israeli leaders and this submission fully meets their needs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) also expressed outrage, saying that now is not the time to pull back on funding to Israel.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly not the time to step back from our support of Israel and her defense,\u201d RJC executive director Matt Brooks said in a statement. \u201cYet President Obama proposes significantly cutting U.S. funding for joint missile defense projects with Israel at this dangerous time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president continues to claim that he is deeply committed to Israel\u2019s security. But this is the third year in a row that he has proposed massive cuts for these missile defense programs,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cOnce again, his actions on Israel are at odds with his words.\u201d\n\nRep. Doug Lamborn (R., Colo.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, was the first lawmaker to criticize Obama\u2019s budget proposal.\n\n\u201cThis is very disappointing and it is irresponsible to cut funding to a steadfast ally in an extremely volatile region of the world,\u201d Lamborn told the Free Beacon on Wednesday.\n\nThe administration requested $95 million for these programs in fiscal year 2014, leading congressional appropriators to up the amount to $283.7 million. It is expected that lawmakers will take a similar course this year so funding levels can remain at a similar level\n\nIsrael\u2019s missile defense systems such as Iron Dome have helped counter the rising threat from Palestinian terrorists, who have fired scores of rockets at Israeli citizens since the beginning of the year.\n\nIron Dome and the more advanced Arrow system could become more critical to Israeli security in the coming months as Iran seeks to arm terrorists across the Middle East.\n\nIsraeli military personnel intercepted a shipment of Iranian arms on Wednesday and warned that it was just one of many attempts by Tehran to arm the Jewish state\u2019s enemies.\n\n\u201cThese efforts to smuggle weapons in the north and south are continuous,\u201d said Israeli Defense Forces\u2019 Chief of Staff Benny Gantz.\u201cThey demand consistent and far-reaching intelligence, alongside effective operations, which the IDF must carry out occasionally with the appropriate degree of force.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Iran is slated to receive another $550 million in cash assets this week as part of the interim nuclear accord signed last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pentagon defends cuts", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Top lawmakers continued to lash out at the Obama administration on Thursday for proposing to cut joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense programs by nearly $200 million compared to last year\u2019s levels.", "title": "Lawmakers Slam Obama Budget Cuts to Israeli Missile Defense", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/lawmakers-slam-obama-budget-cuts-to-israeli-missile-defense/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/AP708767703496-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Top lawmakers continued to lash out at the Obama administration on Thursday for proposing to cut joi", "creator": "@Kredo0", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/AP708767703496-150x150.jpg", "title": "Lawmakers Slam Obama Budget Cuts to Israeli Missile Defense", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The missile defense programs are one of the few lines of defense for Israeli citizens, Roskam said.\nBut this is the third year in a row that he has proposed massive cuts for these missile defense programs,\u201d Brooks said.\nBY: Follow @Kredo0Top lawmakers continued to lash out at the Obama administration on Thursday for proposing to cut joint U.S.-Israeli missile defense programs by nearly $200 million compared to last year\u2019s levels.\nIron Dome and the more advanced Arrow system could become more critical to Israeli security in the coming months as Iran seeks to arm terrorists across the Middle East.\n\u201cYet President Obama proposes significantly cutting U.S. funding for joint missile defense projects with Israel at this dangerous time.\u201d\u201cThe president continues to claim that he is deeply committed to Israel\u2019s security."}
