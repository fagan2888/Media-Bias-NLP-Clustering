Vonn can pass Moser-Proell Monday in a super-G at Cortina.\n\n\u201cWhen I won my first podium here I never thought I would make it this far in my career,\u201d Vonn said during the post-race press conference. \u201cThat was the first time I thought I could be a contender. Never in a million years would I have believed I could tie the record.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s win didn\u2019t come easily. Snowfall over the past two days and warm temperatures made for tricky race conditions.\n\n\u201cThe snow was really soft and I\u2019m not good when it\u2019s soft,\u201d said Vonn, who started youth racing on a 300-foot hill in Minnesota\u2019s Twin Cities before moving to Vail at age 12 to join Ski Club Vail. \u201cI\u2019m from Minnesota and we used to race on ice. I wasn\u2019t very fast on the top.\u201d\n\nPhotos: Lindsey Vonn\u2019s 62 World Cup victories\n\nEven though the top of the course at Cortina usually plays to her strengths, Vonn was ninth fastest at the first of three intermediate splits. Almost a half-second behind Goergl, Vonn caught her at the third split. Vonn\u2019s top speed exceeded 78 mph and averaged just under 60 mph over the course of a 1.65-mile run.\n\nTwo years ago this month, Vonn seemed on the brink of shattering Moser-Proell\u2019s women\u2019s record with a shot at the all-time record set by Sweden\u2019s Ingemar Stenmark (86). On Jan. 26, 2013, she picked up her sixth win of that season, putting her only three behind Moser-Proell, but 10 days later she blew out her right knee racing super-G at the world championships in Schladming, Austria. She reinjured the knee the following November.\n\nShe would go 23 months with a victory, missing most of the 2013-14 season including the Sochi Olympics. Sunday\u2019s win was her third this season, with previous wins coming in December at Lake Louise, Alberta, and Val d\u2019Isere, France.\n\nNow, the pressure is off.\n\n\u201cNow I feel like from here on out I\u2019m already tied for No. 1 and will continue to win races,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI just want to do my best. Now I\u2019m just focused on doing the best I can.\u201d\n\nIf Vonn doesn\u2019t win Monday, she will have two more chances to break the record before coming home for the world alpine championships in Vail Feb. 2-15. A downhill and super-G are scheduled next weekend in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where Vonn has won four times.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long road. The last two years, with both of my knee injuries, have been tough but I\u2019m back and I\u2019m winning and 62 feels pretty awesome.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lindsey Vonn ties all-time record for women\u2019s World Cup wins", "title": "Lindsey Vonn ties all-time record for women\u2019s World Cup wins", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/18/lindsey-vonn-ties-all-time-record-for-womens-world-cup-wins/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150118_080117_lindsey-vonn-world-cup-record.jpg", "height": 376}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150118_080117_lindsey-vonn-world-cup-record.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-18T07:55:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:09:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alpine skiing"}, "article_summary": "Eleven years to the day after she won her first World Cup podium at age 19 in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, Lindsey Vonn tied Annemarie Moser-Proell\u2019s women\u2019s record for career World Cup wins there on Sunday.\nAt a picturesque setting in Italy\u2019s breathtaking Dolomite Range that is one of her favorite venues, Vonn captured win No.\nTwo years ago this month, Vonn seemed on the brink of shattering Moser-Proell\u2019s women\u2019s record with a shot at the all-time record set by Sweden\u2019s Ingemar Stenmark (86).\nA downhill and super-G are scheduled next weekend in St. Moritz, Switzerland, where Vonn has won four times.\nSunday\u2019s win was her third this season, with previous wins coming in December at Lake Louise, Alberta, and Val d\u2019Isere, France."}
