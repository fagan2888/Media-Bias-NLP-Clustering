Police say two women were killed and another was critically injured in a collision on Northwest Highway, near Jupiter Road, this morning.

Firefighters and police were dispatched to the crash scene about 6:45 a.m., police spokesman Demarquis Black said in an email.

Investigators learned that a white Chevy Impala was traveling eastbound in the 11300 block of Northwest Highway, when it crossed over the median and slammed into a grey Toyota Camry traveling westbound.

The Impala’s two occupants died at the scene. The driver of the Camry was critically injured and taken to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, Black said.

The women have been identified as Aide Garduno and Veronica Moreno, both age 20, by the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s office.

The two cars had major front-end damage. Black said one of the cars flipped after the collision.

Investigators were on the scene for about two hours, surveying the damage and clearing the scene.

Shards of glass littered the sidewalk, and orange marks appeared to illustrate how the crash happened.
