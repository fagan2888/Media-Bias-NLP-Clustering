It was to happen outdoors, in the mountains or a meadow. And yet, there we were on Dec. 20, in the drab bureaucratic lobby of the Salt Lake County Clerk\u2019s office. I was wearing jeans.\n\nTwo hours earlier, I\u2019d been at a white elephant party at our office, and the only thing on my mind was seizing that Awkward Family Photos 2014 calendar, which I snatched from a co-worker in the game\u2019s dying moments. Now, I was vowing to honor my new wife, Nicole, in front of a crush of media, anonymous well-wishers and the mayor. That\u2019s what happens when a federal judge overturns a marriage ban, and you find yourself in a race to wed before sundown. One minute, you\u2019re small-talking the SEO guy over gingerbread; the next, you\u2019re hustling to the county clerk\u2019s office, heart apounding.\n\nWhen it was our turn in front of the mayor, the hectic lobby went blurry. I was dizzy, probably from shock. My eyes held tight to Nik\u2019s warm, playful gaze; we were in a wind tunnel and had found the one still space. Once declared married, we clasped hands and threw up our arms like Olympic gold medalists. I morphed into the happiest person I ever was.\n\nThe Mrs. and I floated along for nearly three weeks like this, bright-eyed and giddy, thrilled that we\u2019d drifted into a wonderful new dimension: one where Utah was the 18th state to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI lived in that dimension for 20 enchanted days. Then, on Wednesday, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert sent a memo to state agencies, ordering that same-sex unions be put \u201con hold\u201d \u2014 breaking our hearts, along with those of more than 1,300 other same-sex couples. On Friday, as I was writing this, news broke that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder would honor the marriages on the federal level until further court action. Right now, it feels a little bit like we got married on a roller coaster that won\u2019t let us off until the Supreme Court pulls the brake.\n\nNicole and I met two and a half years ago. \u201cI found your next girlfriend,\u201d my friend Kate told me over the phone one day. I guffawed, but she read to me a dating site profile, and the writer\u2019s wit, warmth and impeccable grammar skills told me: Here was a rare catch. We fell in love almost instantly.\n\nI moved away to Idaho soon after, for a newspaper job, but we visited every weekend and spent our weeknights FaceTiming until we fell asleep watching each other\u2019s digitized eyes drooping on our smartphone screens. Nik taught me to garden, and when I moved back to Salt Lake that spring, we planted our own. Our place had no air conditioning, so we moved into a tent in the backyard between our pumpkin patch and melons. We lugged our mattress into the tent, running an extension cord from the house to illuminate our hideout. We read books and listened to crickets. Every night felt like a sleepover.\n\nPart of our connection stemmed from our pasts. We both came of age in Utah County, Utah, likely named that because it\u2019s the Utah-iest part of Utah. It\u2019s a place where you assume the person you\u2019re speaking with is Mormon and Republican.\n\nBeing gay wasn\u2019t even a thing, let alone an option, when I was growing up Mormon there in the \u201990s. Even Webster\u2019s couldn\u2019t tell me what on earth a \u201cdyke\u201d was after a bus bully dubbed me \u201csuper dyke\u201d in junior high. I only knew it was something unspeakable and probably true.\n\nI knew I was different \u2014 I shunned makeup, wore oversize JNCOs and had the shoulder-length, parted-in-the-middle hair of a teenage male Metallica fan. But a lesbian? Not a chance. There was something despicably wrong with lesbians. Fornication, including homosexuality \u2014 we learned in church and seminary \u2014 was the second-worst sin anyone could commit after murder. Nik spent her teenage years in the same climate.\n\nOver the years, I managed to figure out what I probably already knew when \u201csuper dyke\u201d was first hurled my way.\n\nMormonism wasn\u2019t holding me back anymore \u2014 I\u2019d given that up in my early 20s after reading too many books about early church history. My personal studies were a trip to the spiritual sausage factory. I learned too much.\n\nPlus, I lived in Salt Lake City now, a land unlike Utah County, home of Provo\u2019s BYU. Here\u2019s what people don\u2019t realize about the Beehive State\u2019s capital: Salt Lake City hasn\u2019t had a Republican mayor since the mid-\u201970s. This town, home of the liberal University of Utah, is ruled by Democrat after Democrat, boasts a big-city arts and music scene and gay rights activists galore.\n\nBolstered by my more liberal surroundings, I finally mustered the nerve to start dating women at 26. Nik started in her teens. I\u2019m grateful every day that neither of us drank the anti-gay Kool-Aid and married a dude.\n\nIn April of last year we got engaged and picked out rings in a vintage jewelry shop. We were a smitten, dewy-eyed couple who planned to spend our lives together. But the thrilling moment when reality shifted \u2014 and our dreams became real \u2014 arrived on a Friday five days before Christmas. We hadn\u2019t seen it coming.\n\nFor once I heard news before Nik. Phoning her, crazy-eyed and giggling, it was as if I were an evolutionary paleontologist calling a longtime colleague, someone who had dug alongside me for months in African dirt under a sadistic fireball of a sun, to cry into her ear that I\u2019d \u2014 no, we\u2019d \u2014found it: the missing link.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As one of the first gay couples wed in Utah, Nik and I have become poster children for love, heartbreak -- and hope", "title": "Our marriage can\u2019t be denied", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As one of the first gay couples wed in Utah, Nik and I have become poster children for love, heartbreak -- and hope", "title": "Our marriage can\u2019t be denied", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/12/our_marriage_cant_be_denied/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/utah_marriage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As one of the first gay couples wed in Utah, Nik and I have become poster children for love, heartbreak -- and hope", "title": "Our marriage can\u2019t be denied", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/utah_marriage.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Natalie Dicou", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Gay Marriage, Lesbians, LGBT, Life stories, Love and Sex, Mormonism, Salt Lake City, Utah", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a07\"", "article_summary": "We both came of age in Utah County, Utah, likely named that because it\u2019s the Utah-iest part of Utah.\nAnd yet, there we were on Dec. 20, in the drab bureaucratic lobby of the Salt Lake County Clerk\u2019s office.\nHere\u2019s what people don\u2019t realize about the Beehive State\u2019s capital: Salt Lake City hasn\u2019t had a Republican mayor since the mid-\u201970s.\nPlus, I lived in Salt Lake City now, a land unlike Utah County, home of Provo\u2019s BYU.\nThat\u2019s what happens when a federal judge overturns a marriage ban, and you find yourself in a race to wed before sundown."}
