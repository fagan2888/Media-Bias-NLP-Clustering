HOUSTON (ChurchMilitant.com) - Nearly two months ago, 46-year-old Christopher Dunn, who had been coughing up dried blood and had an unidentified mass on his pancreas, was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital for treatment. Dunn's doctor made the decision shortly afterwards to take him off life-sustaining treatment, saying further treatment was futile. Dunn is currently on a breathing tube and under heavy sedation.

Dunn's mother challenged the decision, but the hospital's ethics comittee decided in favor of the doctor, and Dunn's attorney, Trey Trainor, sued the hospital in court challenging the decision.

ChurchMilitant.com has received confirmation that the court issued a ruling Thursday in Dunn's favor, ordering that he be kept on life-sustaining treatment.
