(AP) - A Southern California jury awarded $40 million to the parents of a man who was stabbed to death in a TGI Friday\u2019s restaurant.\n\nThe panel found Thursday that the restaurant\u2019s operator was 55 percent responsible for the January 2009 death at a TGI Friday\u2019s in Riverside.\n\nOrlando Jordan, 33, of Riverside, was dating the mother of Michael Castillo, who disapproved. He was stabbed during an argument with Castillo, who entered the restaurant with a friend.\n\nCastillo and Louis Martinez pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon. Castillo was sentenced to three years in state prison, and Martinez was sentenced to four years.\n\nCastillo was 20 at the time of the killing, making him under the legal drinking age. Jordan\u2019s parents, Rey and Carmen Jordan, argued that employees deliberately failed to check Castillo\u2019s identification before serving him and continued to give him alcohol despite his intoxication.\n\n\u201cThis case is about holding corporations responsible for their reckless decisions to value profits over community safety,\u201d Nicholas Rowley, an attorney who represented Jordan\u2019s mother, said in a statement.\n\nCastillo ordered the equivalent of 12 alcohol servings in 30 minutes, Rowley told the Riverside Press-Enterprise (http://bit.ly/1I5M5zC).\n\nThe lawsuit also cited a pattern of assaults at the restaurant and a lack of security cameras.\n\nThe Riverside County Superior Court jury agreed that employees served alcohol to Castillo even though he obviously was drunk. It found New Jersey-based Briad Restaurant Group to be 55 percent responsible for Jordan\u2019s death.\n\nThe two attackers were found to be 45 percent responsible.\n\n\u201cOur heartfelt thoughts and prayers continue for the Jordan family,\u201d Rick Barbrick, Briad\u2019s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement. \u201cAt Friday\u2019s, we remain committed to serving all guests in a safe and responsible manner which is consistent with our mission, high standards and core values.\u201d\n\nThe company did not indicate whether it intended to appeal the jury\u2019s decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Southern California jury awarded $40 million to the parents of a man who was stabbed to death in a TGI Friday's restaurant.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/20/jury-awards-40-million-in-suit-over-tgi-fridays-ki/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A Southern California jury awarded $40 million to the parents of a man who was stabbed to death in a TGI Friday\u2019s restaurant.", "title": "Jury awards $40 million in suit over TGI Friday\u2019s killing"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A Southern California jury awarded $40 million to the parents of a man who was stabbed to death in a TGI Friday's restaurant.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jury awards $40 million in suit over TGI Friday\u2019s killing"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "RIVERSIDE, Calif.
