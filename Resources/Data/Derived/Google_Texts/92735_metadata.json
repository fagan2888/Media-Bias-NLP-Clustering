The development and construction company is building a new 645,800-square-foot medical specialty building on the Stamford Hospital campus in Stamford, Conn., at a cost of $149 million.\n\nWith the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, change is undeniably afoot in healthcare real estate, and it appears to be positive change.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge amount of opportunity in the healthcare system overall and that has to do with not only the potential change coming through the ACA, but pent up demand and the aging of America,\u201d Andrew Quirk, senior vice president & national director for Skanska\u2019s Healthcare Center of Excellence, told Commercial Property Executive. \u201cSo it\u2019s almost like a perfect storm on the real estate side for what\u2019s coming in the system.\u201d\n\nSkanska\u2019s work at Stamford Hospital involves the development of a new 12-story building that will replace a bevy of existing on-site facilities, some of which date back to the early 1900s. It\u2019s the type of activity that healthcare real estate experts expect to see much more of in the coming years. As Lorie Damon, managing director with Cassidy Turley, told CPE, a great segment of the country\u2019s hospitals were built in the \u201850s and \u201860s, and now many are challenged to support new technologies. The result: the building of replacement hospitals. \u201cMore than anything else, the age of those assets may be driving development. In terms of how healthcare reform will impact this, I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell,\u201d Damon added.\n\nWhether it\u2019s to accommodate new medical technologies or to handle an influx of patients due to the aging population or healthcare reform, new hospital buildings are being built. Skanska is an eyewitness. \u201cIn the latter half of last quarter, we started to see a big increase in inquiries for RFQs RFPs, and right out of the gate in the first quarter we are seeing a ton of activity in the marketplace with RFPs, interviews and selections. It\u2019s all really happening now,\u201d Quirk added.\n\nWhat\u2019s also happening now, in many cases, is a general change in project size. Healthcare construction endeavors, Quirk observes, are getting larger. \u201cUp until even last year, a big project was $80 million; now we\u2019re seeing many jobs that are well over $150, $250 million and even bigger,\u201d he said. The total development cost for the Stamford Hospital project is an estimated $450 million. Methodist Hospital in San Antonio announced plans for a $200 million expansion in December of last year. Kaiser Permanente broke ground on a $900 million facility in the Kearny Mesa area of San Diego, Calif., just last month. \u201cThat\u2019s a new thing,\u201d Quirk continued. \u201cAnd I think it just has to do with everyone waiting in the wings for a while and now, not that there\u2019s complete clarity with the ACA and other things that are happening, but I think people are starting to see a little bit of a roadmap on where they need to go and what they need to do.\u201d\n\nOf course, healthcare real estate extends far beyond hospital buildings. Medical office buildings are in high demand and clinics and urgent care facilities are on the rise. And it\u2019s happening across the U.S. \u201cAs healthcare reform continues to impact change to how healthcare is delivered, we are seeing a race to the suburbs by hospital systems to extend the \u2018capturement\u2019 area to reach the newly insured and, based on the patient\u2019s acuity, funnel them into their urban-based systems,\u201d Brad Blankenship, managing director with Cassidy Turley, told CPE. \u201cAlthough some of the larger systems continue to add beds while accomplishing this goal, many are opening stand-alone clinics and surgery centers to compete for these patients. Also, emergency department visits continue to increase and we are seeing new for-profit ER\u2019s built quickly and existing systems retool and expand to meet the volume. Throughput efficiency and patient satisfaction has never been more important in this competitive healthcare environment.\u201d\n\nSkanska is on track to complete construction of the new Stamford Hospital medical building in spring 2016.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "development,cpe-development,cpe-featured,featuredcontent,headlines,cpe-health-care,healthcare", "og": {"url": "https://www.cpexecutive.com/post/skanska-develops-medical-building-in-connecticut-for-149m/", "image": "https://www.cpexecutive.comhttps://media.atre.yardi.com/2/24278/images/Stamford-Hospital.jpg", "description": "Skanska USA is building a new 645,800-square-foot medical specialty building on the Stamford Hospital campus in Stamford, Conn., at a cost of $149 million.", "title": "Skanska Develops Medical Building in Connecticut for $149M"}, "news_keywords": "development,cpe-development,cpe-featured,featuredcontent,headlines,cpe-health-care,healthcare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale = 1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Skanska USA is building a new 645,800-square-foot medical specialty building on the Stamford Hospital campus in Stamford, Conn., at a cost of $149 million."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8ae\"", "article_summary": "Skanska USA is building a new 645,800-square-foot medical specialty building on the Stamford Hospital campus in Stamford, Conn., at a cost of $149 million.\nThe development and construction company is building a new 645,800-square-foot medical specialty building on the Stamford Hospital campus in Stamford, Conn., at a cost of $149 million.\nIt\u2019s the type of activity that healthcare real estate experts expect to see much more of in the coming years.\nThroughput efficiency and patient satisfaction has never been more important in this competitive healthcare environment.\u201dSkanska is on track to complete construction of the new Stamford Hospital medical building in spring 2016.\nWith the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, change is undeniably afoot in healthcare real estate, and it appears to be positive change."}
