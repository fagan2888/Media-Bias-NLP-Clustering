Memorable asides gave hypothetical health care plans designed by Republican congressional leaders new names like \u201cFracking the elderly?\u201d and \u201cWalk-It-Off.gov.\u201d\n\nBut the President cracked up the crowd the most when he said, \u201cYoung people don\u2019t watch real news shows like this one. They watch comedy shows, and I just don\u2019t see the President going on one of those. They\u2019re beneath his dignity,\u201d while the phrase, \u201cbut above his approval rating\u201d flashed across the screen.\n\nAfterwards, Obama sat down with Colbert, and you can read more about that interview here.\n\nMORE: Watch Zach Galifianakis Interview Barack Obama on Between Two Ferns\n\nSign up for THE BRIEF and more view example\n\nRead next: President Obama Gets Personal With Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "President Barack Obama hosts The Word as The Decree on The Colbert Report", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "It's hilarious", "title": "Watch Barack Obama host 'The Word' on 'The Colbert Report'", "url": "http://time.com/3625624/barack-obama-stephen-colbert-report-the-word/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/barack-obama-colbert-report.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/barack-obama-colbert-report.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Watch Barack Obama host 'The Word' on 'The Colbert Report'", "description": "It's hilarious", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "president obama, stephen colbert,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "president obama, stephen colbert,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1db6\"", "article_summary": "MORE: Watch Zach Galifianakis Interview Barack Obama on Between Two FernsSign up for THE BRIEF and more view exampleRead next: President Obama Gets Personal With Stephen Colbert on the Colbert Report\n+ READ ARTICLEPresident Barack Obama got a lot of laughs Monday night when he hosted Stephen Colbert\u2019s popular segment \u201cThe Word\u201d on The Colbert Report.\nAfterwards, Obama sat down with Colbert, and you can read more about that interview here.\nFor example, when he said, \u201cThere are things that people from both parties actually like about Obamacare,\u201d the phrase \u201cEverything but the \u2018Obama'\u201d showed up.\nThey watch comedy shows, and I just don\u2019t see the President going on one of those."}
