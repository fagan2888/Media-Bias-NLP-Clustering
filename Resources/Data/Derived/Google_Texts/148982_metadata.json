For Democrats, that means no delays or changes in Obamacare, no massive cuts in spending. For Republicans, it means no return to pre-sequestration spending levels and, of course, at least cuts in or outright elimination of Obamacare.\n\nThe fringes want their tidbits as well: elimination of federal funding for abortion is one example.\n\nLost in all of this is the simple need to pass a continuing resolution without add-ons and an increase in the debt limit to allow the government to pay its bills.\n\nThe rest can, and should, be argued at another time and in proper legislative procedure.\n\nAmerica\u2019s government today is a process of inaction, delay and stonewalling. Progress is not considered because it is not, under our current system, considered a viable political alternative.\n\nWhat we have instead are two legislative bodies of misfits using misappropriation and misapplication of both power and process to bring matters to a screeching halt and leave our government in constant crisis and misdirection.\n\nThis, sadly, is what happens in system where publicity-seeking, spotlight-grabbing egomaniacs get the attention and dominate the headlines.\n\nA time might have existed when America\u2019s system of government had the envy of other nations of the world but that time has long since passed. Today, we are \u2014 rightfully so \u2014 a laughing stock around the globe \u2014 a nation that cannot function and one controlled by radicals on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner is a drunken, pitiful excuse of a leader in that body but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is no better. He\u2019s a former bag man for casino bosses who can\u2019t make a decision on his own without someone paying him off.\n\nThis could be a vacuum where a strong President could step in and take charge but Barack Obama is neither strong nor Presidential in this mess. His only goal seems to be to protect what little is left of his tattered Presidential record.\n\nWhat remains is an America crying out for a leader to save the day.\n\nIf such a leader exists, he or she won\u2019t be a Democrat or a Republican.\n\nIt will have to be an American \u2014 if any exist in what is left in what once was a great country.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nGoogle\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Capitol Hill Blue", "description": "Two burning questions that occupy the minds of most Americans nowadays are \u201cwhat has happened to our government and what will it take to fix it?\u201d Neither question has an easy answer bec\u2026", "title": "What America needs is an American to lead a nation in distress", "url": "http://www.capitolhillblue.com/node/49602", "image": {"width": 628, "identifier": "http://www.capitolhillblue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413cryinglady.jpg", "height": 356}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-14T09:49:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-15T18:09:35+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.capitolhillblue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/101413cryinglady.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "article_summary": "It will have to be an American \u2014 if any exist in what is left in what once was a great country.\nFor Republicans, it means no return to pre-sequestration spending levels and, of course, at least cuts in or outright elimination of Obamacare.\nThis, sadly, is what happens in system where publicity-seeking, spotlight-grabbing egomaniacs get the attention and dominate the headlines.\nWhat remains is an America crying out for a leader to save the day.\nFor Democrats, that means no delays or changes in Obamacare, no massive cuts in spending."}
