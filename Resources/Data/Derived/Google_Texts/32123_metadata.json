But the most consequential storyline resonates beyond Washington and into the heart of the country, as Americans delivered Republicans firm control of the nation\u2019s state capitals.\n\nRepublicans picked up Democratic-held governorships in traditionally liberal states such as Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois, and gained full power in at least eight state legislatures. The victories gave Republicans a wide palette to impart their agenda.\n\n\u201cStates are where American policy change has been going on \u2026 and Republicans are in a much stronger position to advance their agenda.\u201d\n\nWith President Obama vowing to pursue his agenda over the final two years of his term, Republicans are counting on states to take the lead on policymaking\u2014far away from Capitol Hill gridlock\u2014and actually impact people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt the Republican wave leaves them in the strongest position in the states in close to 100 years, if not more,\u201d said Tim Storey, an elections analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures, in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Washington working together. I guess pigs fly maybe,\u201d he added. \u201cStates are where American policy change has been going on for several years now, and Republicans are in a much stronger position to advance their agenda.\u201d\n\n>>> The Only Chart You Need: Full 2014 Election Results\n\nThe wins increased the ranks of Republican governors to at least 31 and gave the party control of 66 legislative chambers, four more than their previous record in the modern era.\n\nBefore the election, there were 29 Republican governors and 21 Democrats.\n\nOn Tuesday, preliminary results showed Republicans had won control of both the Nevada Assembly and Senate, the Minnesota House, the New Mexico House, the Maine House, the West Virginia House and the New Hampshire House.\n\nIt also gives Republicans total control of 24 states, in which they hold the governor\u2019s mansion and both chambers of the state legislature. Democrats have complete control over six states.\n\nSurprise Wins\n\nSuch GOP dominance was unexpected.\n\nThis year\u2019s climate for governor seats seemed to favor Democrats, as eight Republican governors who won in 2010 were running for re-election in states Obama won twice.\n\nFour of those\u2014Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Maine Gov. Paul LePage, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2014earned another chance in states that have recently trended more liberal.\n\nOther Republican winners included Bruce Rauner in Illinois, a money manager who aims to undo a personal income tax increase supported by incumbent Gov. Pat Quinn; and Larry Hogan of Maryland, another anti-tax businessman who beat Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown.\n\nDemocrats picked up the Pennsylvania governorship. The Alaska race, where independent Bill Walker leads incumbent Republican Gov. Sean Parnell, has not been called yet.\n\nDifferent from the Senate races, Obama and national politics barely figured in the campaigns for governor.\n\n>>> It\u2019s a Wave: Republicans Take US Senate, Build Majority in House, Grab Governorships\n\n\u201cVoters care a lot about competence when it comes to governors.\u201d\n\nPopular issues such as gun control, schools, minimum wage, abortion and health care played into many of the races.\n\nAbove all, voters seemed to be moved most by uncertainty in the economy and governors\u2019 ability\u2014or failure\u2014to improve their state\u2019s fortunes.\n\nGeoffrey Skelley, associate editor of Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University for Virginia Center for Politics, argued as much.\n\n\u201cVoters care a lot about competence when it comes to governors,\u201d Skelley said in response to emailed questions from The Daily Signal. \u201cEven if you\u2019re a Republican in a very red state (like Gov. Sam Brownback in Kansas) or a Democrat in a very blue state (like Gov. Pat Quinn in Illinois), if your performance is fairly poor, it can leave you vulnerable.\u201d\n\n>>> The Daily Signal Interviews Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback\n\nBrownback, who barely beat Democratic challenger Paul Davis, earned new faith in his deeply conservative state after he faced criticism from GOP moderates for aggressive tax cuts that have contributed to a budget shortfall.\n\nAnother conservative, Walker, who is weighing a run for president in 2016, won a race where he did not retreat from his conservative principles. Walker has now emerged victorious three times (including an unsuccessful recall) in a span of four years.\n\n>>> Scott Walker\u2019s Biggest Critic Calls His 3rd Win in 4 Years \u2018Unprecedented\u2019\n\nPower Play, but More Division\n\nThe trend toward one-party control of statehouses has led to new policymaking opportunities, some controversial among voters who are more accustomed to divided government.\n\nOverall, more states will have divided control next year, a function of Democratic losses.\n\nStates that were formerly under complete Democratic control, but now divided, include: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and West Virginia.\n\n>>> Voters in D.C., Oregon, Alaska Just Legalized Recreational Marijuana\n\nStorey believes change is good for democracy.\n\n\u201cThis [division] will result in more compromise and will dampen the Democratic agenda in those states,\u201d he said.\n\nPotential Platform\n\nStorey said any Republican state-level agenda would likely include conservative mainstays such as tax cuts, job creation and plenty of pushback on Obamacare, including undercutting Medicaid expansion.\n\nHigh-profile conservatives laid out a similar vision in a press conference Wednesday at the National Press Club in Washington.\n\nKen Blackwell, a former mayor of Cincinnati and Ohio secretary of state, attributed state-level upheaval to \u201ca need to get the economy moving again.\u201d\n\nHe said governors\u2019 decisions would have broader implications for the future of the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cGovernors are solving problems on a day-to-day business,\u201d Blackwell told The Daily Signal after the press conference. \u201cI am among a group who believes the next [2016 GOP presidential] candidate will come from the governors\u2019 ranks. Hopefully, they know it\u2019s in their interest to speak up and act on issues that matter to conservatives.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most consequential storyline of Election 2014 resonates into the heart of the country, as Americans delivered Republicans control of state capitals.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The most consequential storyline of Election 2014 resonates into the heart of the country, as Americans delivered Republicans control of state capitals.", "title": "Republicans Seize Control of State Capitals", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/upiphotostwo312765.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-05T22:44:33+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1siaoyT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The most consequential storyline of Election 2014 resonates into the heart of the country, as Americans delivered Republicans control of state capitals.", "title": "Republicans Seize Control of State Capitals", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/upiphotostwo312765.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2014-11-06T03:01:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T22:44:33+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "midterms, election 2014, governor\u2019s races, Massachusetts, Maryland, Illinois, Rick Scott, Scott Walker, Rick Snyder, Sam Brownback"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb08\"", "article_summary": "But the most consequential storyline resonates beyond Washington and into the heart of the country, as Americans delivered Republicans firm control of the nation\u2019s state capitals.\nIt also gives Republicans total control of 24 states, in which they hold the governor\u2019s mansion and both chambers of the state legislature.\nBefore the election, there were 29 Republican governors and 21 Democrats.\nRepublicans picked up Democratic-held governorships in traditionally liberal states such as Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois, and gained full power in at least eight state legislatures.\nOn Tuesday, preliminary results showed Republicans had won control of both the Nevada Assembly and Senate, the Minnesota House, the New Mexico House, the Maine House, the West Virginia House and the New Hampshire House."}
