The deal also avoids large premium increases for certain Medicare beneficiaries in 2016 and ensures that the Social Security Disability Insurance fund doesn\u2019t go bankrupt.\n\nThis is all expensive. But it does all this while not raising taxes.\n\nHow does that work, exactly?\n\nThe government\u2019s accounting is as much art as science; many of the offsets are nothing more than promises of savings in the future. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the deal will raise an additional $29.8 billion and cut spending by $45.9 billion over the next 10 years. Here\u2019s how:\n\nMore Medicare cuts in 2025 \u2014 $14 billion\n\nOriginally, the 2011 \u201csequestration\u201d deal saved future money by cutting Medicare repayments to doctors until the 2021 fiscal year. The Murray-Ryan budget deal further extended those until 2023 and a bill to avoid a cut to military pensions extended them to 2024. This new deal extends them yet another year until 2025, while making a few changes to the repayment schedules in 2023 and 2024.\n\nPension changes \u2014 $11.6 billion\n\nThe budget deal makes a number of changes to pensions, including changing the annual premiums paid by the plan sponsors for single employer pension plans to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Among other changes, fixed premiums would rise from $64 per person right now to $68 in 2017, $73 in 2018 and $78 in 2019. That\u2019s not exactly money in the bank now, but it counts in budget terms.\n\nTax compliance \u2014 $11 billion\n\nThe agreement would make two changes to tax provisions for large partnerships including hedge funds and private equity firms. The first would make it easier for the Internal Revenue Service to audit partnerships so that they pay their full tax obligations, raising $9 billion. The second would clarify rules regarding partnership interests that are created through gifts\u2014a technical change that brings in another $2 billion.\n\nNon-Obamacare health care changes \u2014 $10.5 billion\n\nWithout Congressional action, Medicare Part B monthly premiums are projected to increase by nearly a third for many beneficiaries starting next year. The budget deal sets a new Part B premium for those beneficiaries that avoids the huge hike. To pay for the change, the beneficiaries would pay an additional $3 per month in premiums until it\u2019s repaid. It would also force generic drug companies to rebate money to Medicaid if the price of a drug grows faster than inflation. In total, the changes would raise more than $10 billion.\n\nObamacare reform \u2014 $8 billion\n\nThe proposal eliminates a rule requiring all employers with more than 200 employees to automatically enroll their workers in a health plan. Behavioral economists liked this idea\u2014it changed the \u201cdefault choice\u201d for employees, and would have ensured more of them enrolled. But critics, mainly large employers, protested that the provision would confuse workers and restrict their freedom. CBO expects that the government will collect $8 billion more after this change, since tax-exempt health care benefits will instead flow to workers in the form of higher wages, which are now taxed.\n\nSelling oil reserves \u2014 $5.1 billion\n\nThe bill directs the government to sell 58 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Selling our oil, while misguided according to many energy experts, is not inherently a gimmick. But in this case it\u2019s not likely to yield anywhere near what Congress thinks. For technical reasons the Congressional Budget Office estimates a sale price of $85-90 per barrel, laughably unrealistic given that oil is currently less than $50 per barrel. The difference is a form of phantom revenue that helps get the budget through, but will increase the deficit if it doesn\u2019t materialize.\n\nSocial Security reforms \u2014 $4.3 billion\n\nSocial Security consists of two funds: one, the Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) fund, pays out benefits to older Americans, and the other, the Disability Insurance (DI) fund, pays out money to Americans who are unable to work due to a disability. The DI fund was set to run out of money next year. When this has happened in the past, Congress has transferred money from the OASI fund to the DI fund\u2014in fact, they\u2019ve made such transfers 11 times. But conservatives objected making such transfers this time around.\n\nThe budget deal reallocates a higher percentage of payroll taxes in 2016-2018 to the DI fund, boosting its funding and enabling it pay benefits until 2022. To please conservatives, it also includes a number of measures to make it harder for Americans to qualify for disability insurance and to crack down on fraud. It now requires applicants to receive a medical exam before qualifying for benefits, a rule in 30 states right now. It would also strengthen penalties for Social Security fraud, among other reforms. In all, the changes would cut spending by more than $4 billion.\n\nSelling spectrum \u2014 $4.4 billion\n\nThe bill directs the FCC to auction of 30 megahertz of spectrum before July 1, 2024. Auctioning off airwaves has the potential to put billions of dollars in the government\u2019s coffers. But as POLITICO\u2019s Kate Tummarello reported, CBO is drastically undervaluing the potential profits from selling the spectrum, according to lawmakers. That has restricted Congress\u2019 ability to use such sales as a payfor but it found its way into the budget deal anyways.\n\nJudiciary changes \u2014 $3.5 billion\n\nAll government agencies must adjust their civil monetary penalties to take into account inflation and continue updating them annually. It also rescinds funding for the Crime Victims Fund ($1.5 billion) and the Assets Forfeiture Fund ($746 million).\n\nCrop insurance \u2014 $3 billion\n\nThe bill makes two changes to the federal crop insurance program. First, it requires that the standard reinsurance agreement, a deal that establishes the terms under which the government provides subsidies and reinsurance to an insurance company, must be renegotiated by the end of next year. Second, it caps the overall rate of return for insurance providers at 8.9 percent. According to an official summary of the deal, the \u201crate of return [currently] is approximately 14.5 percent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Agenda", "description": "A guide to the funding schemes in yesterday\u2019s budget deal.<br />", "title": "So we have a budget.
