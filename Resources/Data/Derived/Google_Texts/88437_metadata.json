While traditional disease management programs only identify and attempt to manage roughly five chronic conditions, Viverae sets a new industry standard covering 22 conditions, including asthma, obesity, and sleep apnea.\n\nAbout half of all American adults suffer from at least one chronic disease and roughly 25 percent live with multiple chronic conditions, punctuating the need for wide-ranging disease management. The most common chronic conditions cost the U.S. economy more than $1 trillion annually including treatment cost and employer loss in productivity. Seventy-five percent of U.S. healthcare spending goes toward treating chronic illnesses. Expertly executed disease management programs allow employers to focus on high-risk, high-cost individuals through support from highly skilled clinical staff and registered nurses and dietitians.\n\nAs the company analyzed the major contributors to chronic conditions, it incontestably knew that there are initial chronic conditions that people live with for extensive periods before developing more severe chronic conditions\u2014for example, hypertension is a major contributor to congestive heart failure. Viverae's approach to incorporating primary chronic conditions into its own disease management program enables the timely detection and prevention of at-risk members.\n\n\"Employers who fail to offer disease or chronic condition management as part of their comprehensive wellness program are missing the biggest opportunity to help employees who need it the most,\" said Dr. Jeff Brizzolara, chief clinical officer at Viverae. \"By identifying employees with primary chronic conditions before they develop a secondary chronic condition, we know we will have a greater impact on reducing the cost of health care expenditures, increasing productivity, and improving the quality of life of our members.\"\n\nFocusing on prevention and condition management with personalized, evidence-based care plans supports Viverae's approach to keep members engaged with their health through a roadmap that helps close gaps in care and manage their conditions. Members will work with their clinicians to actively manage their conditions.\n\nViverae is best known for its expertise in workplace wellness with over 350 clients and nearly one million members in a variety of industries across the U.S. Its wellness programs are designed to create a culture of health and well-being within employee populations while managing healthcare costs.\n\nAbout Viverae\n\nDallas-based Viverae is a total population health management provider and an industry thought leader.
