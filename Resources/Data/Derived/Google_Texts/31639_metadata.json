While the country keeps no official statistics on acid attacks, there are regular reports in the media of attackers targeting victims to disfigure or blind them, often because of spurned sexual advances.\n\nThe 41 photos show 22-year-old Rupa and four friends laughing and striking playful poses while wearing some of her fashion designs.\n\n\u201cI told them to be natural. I didn\u2019t do any makeup or editing. I told them, you look beautiful and you have to be the way you are,\u201d said the photographer, Rahul Saharan, who volunteers with the Stop Acid Attacks charity and is working on a documentary about acid victims. \u201cThey are very confident, so it was not too hard for me.\u201d\n\nThe photos have been shared widely since being posted Aug. 8 on the Facebook page run by the group, and have also been picked up by TV stations and newspapers.\n\nThe joy and confidence the five women display defy the horrific stories they tell.\n\nRupa\u2019s face was doused with acid when she was 15 years old by a stepmother unwilling to pay her marriage expenses. The wedding was called off. The photo shoot has brought in funding that will enable her dream of opening a boutique to come true.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Acid victims\u2019 photo shoot draws attention in India", "title": "Acid victims\u2019 photo shoot draws attention in India", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Acid victims\u2019 photo shoot draws attention in India", "title": "Acid victims\u2019 photo shoot draws attention in India", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/02/acid_victims_photo_shoot_draws_attention_in_india/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/india-acid-attacks-photo-gallery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Acid victims\u2019 photo shoot draws attention in India", "title": "Acid victims\u2019 photo shoot draws attention in India", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/india-acid-attacks-photo-gallery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba52\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsNEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 A fashion photo shoot featuring five victims of acid attacks is drawing wide attention in India.\nWhile the country keeps no official statistics on acid attacks, there are regular reports in the media of attackers targeting victims to disfigure or blind them, often because of spurned sexual advances.\nI told them, you look beautiful and you have to be the way you are,\u201d said the photographer, Rahul Saharan, who volunteers with the Stop Acid Attacks charity and is working on a documentary about acid victims.\nThe photo shoot has brought in funding that will enable her dream of opening a boutique to come true.\nRupa\u2019s face was doused with acid when she was 15 years old by a stepmother unwilling to pay her marriage expenses."}
