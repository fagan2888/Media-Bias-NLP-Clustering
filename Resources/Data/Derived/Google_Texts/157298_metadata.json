He runs both Homebase Properties, a real estate management company, and ViaCare Therapy Services, which serves home health patients.\n\n\u201cI believe our state is at an opportune time for economic growth and prosperity,\u201d Goodlin said in a news release. \u201cWe can encourage job creation and fiscal responsibility by reworking our tax code, ending excessive regulations and stopping the government programs that discourage people from working.\u201d\n\nGoodlin, who is a deacon and treasurer for his church in Alma, says his faith taught him the importance of protecting traditional values.

As state representative, I will fight for real solutions that keeps government out of our everyday lives.\u201d\n\nGoodlin and his wife of 18 years, Janice, raise their six sons and one daughter in Rudy where they all can enjoy the benefits of country living, which include trap shooting, pond fishing and free-range chickens.\n\nHe earned a degree in industrial engineering from Pennsylvania State University and a master\u2019s degree in business administration from the College of William and Mary.\n\nPrior to his work in health care, he spent 13 years in the automotive manufacturing industry with two Fortune 100 companies.\n\nMembers of the Arkansas General Assembly earn $39,400 annually.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rudy resident Derek Goodlin announced Friday he will seek election to the Arkansas House of Representatives.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Times Record Staff", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "Rudy resident Derek Goodlin announced Friday he will seek election to the Arkansas House of Representatives.", "title": "Rudy Man Announces Bid For Arkansas House Seat", "url": "http://swtimes.com/news/rudy-man-announces-bid-arkansas-house-seat", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_DerekGoodlin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/news/rudy-man-announces-bid-arkansas-house-seat", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_DerekGoodlin.jpg"}, "title": "Rudy Man Announces Bid For Arkansas House Seat", "description": "Rudy resident Derek Goodlin announced Friday he will seek election to the Arkansas House of Representatives.", "creator": "@timesrecord"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1876554", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1876554", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "News,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T05:05:56-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "Rudy resident Derek Goodlin announced Friday he will seek election to the Arkansas House of Representatives.\nHaving been certified by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, he is the volunteer head coach of the Minutemen Youth Trap Shooting Team.\nThe seat is occupied by Rep.
