A previous study completed by the Forest Service and Davey Institute found that trees in New York City in particular saved about eight lives per year, due to their ability to strain pollutants from the atmosphere. In the most recent study, the researchers found that though trees accounted for only a one percent improvement in air quality, this was significant enough to impact human health.\n\n\u201cWith more than 80 percent of Americans living in urban areas, this research underscores how truly essential urban forests are to people across the nation,\u201d said Michael Rains, director of the Forest Service\u2019s Northern Research Station and the Forest Products Laboratory, in a press release. \u201cInformation and tools developed by Forest Service research are contributing to communities valuing and managing the 138 million acres of trees and forests that grace the nation\u2019s cities, towns, and communities.\"\n\nTrees can make cities healthier. Air pollution can have a negative effect on your overall health, specifically with diseases like asthma, pulmonary and cardiac disorders, as well as vascular and neurological problems.\n\nSo while big cities might be centers of opportunities and resources, they also rely significantly on the number of trees and parks present, so don\u2019t take that green for granted. \u201cIn terms of impacts on human health, trees in urban areas are substantially more important than rural trees due to their proximity to people,\u201d said Dave Nowak, an author of the 2013 study about urban trees\u2019 benefits, in the press release. \u201cWe found that in general, the greater the tree cover, the greater the pollution removal, and the greater the removal and population density, the greater the value of human health benefits.\u201d\n\nSource: Nowak D, Hirabayashi S, Bodine A, Greenfield E.
