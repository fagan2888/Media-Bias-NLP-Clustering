Asked about the likelihood he will run for president in 2016, Dr. Carson said: \u201cI would say we are definitely a step or two closer than we were a year ago.\u201d\u2026 \u201cObviously we are very interested in what happens in November,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if the people also continue to show strong desire for me to run, obviously that would be an important factor too.\u201d\n\nHe hinted last year at one point that he was more interested in television than in running for office, which made me think if he did jump in it would be a Huckabee-an ploy to raise his name recognition to the point where Fox News might offer him his own show. But he\u2019s already on Fox\u2019s radar; they made him a contributor last fall. Even if Fox refused his request for a show, he could always try Glenn Beck\u2019s network or go the Palin route and develop his own pay TV channel online. There\u2019s an audience out there for it: Thanks to an aggressive direct mailing campaign, the \u201cDraft Ben Carson Committee\u201d actually outraised \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d in the first quarter of this year.\n\nSo, yeah, maybe he\u2019s talked himself into taking the plunge. But, er, why? The clearer it is that both Rand Paul and Ted Cruz are running, and it\u2019s become pretty clear lately, the less room there is for Carson to make a splash in Iowa. What\u2019s his niche? He\u2019ll run as the outsider who\u2019s going to shake up D.C., but so will Paul and Cruz \u2014 Rand is the guy who\u2019s broken from the GOP pack on foreign policy and mandatory minimum sentences and Cruz is the guy who\u2019s giving Republican leaders fits by demanding that they take a more conservative line on key bills. Even something like ObamaCare, which Carson could attack as a renowned surgeon, isn\u2019t an easy winner for him. Cruz, after all, was willing to go so far as to shut down the government in the name of stopping O-Care before it launched. I\u2019ve said it before but it\u2019s worth repeating: Carson\u2019s better off running as an independent. Then he can bypass the primaries and the flak he\u2019ll take from conservatives over his position on guns while setting himself up as a pox-on-both-their-houses protest candidate for disaffected independents. He won\u2019t win, but maybe he can land a spot at the debates in October. And if he\u2019s out there, looming as a Perot-type in the general election, Republicans will have to think carefully about nominating someone who\u2019s too RINO-y; if they end up choosing Christie, tea partiers could defect to Carson and then we end up with President Hillary. So, on second thought, maybe this isn\u2019t great news for establishment Republicans.\n\nHere he is talking recently with Newsmax. Skip to 10:15 for the \u201care you running?\u201d exchange. Exit question: He says the outcome of the elections in November will affect his decision whether to run. Er, why? If the GOP retakes the Senate, their time in the majority is likely to be short. And if the GOP doesn\u2019t retake the Senate, all the more reason to elect a Republican president in 2016. You\u2019ll want that veto pen in the White House in case something weird happens and Democrats win back the House.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cI would say we are definitely a step or two closer than we were a year ago.\u201d", "title": "Ben Carson authorizes new PAC, names would-be campaign manager for 2016", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/01/ben-carson-authorizes-new-pac-names-would-be-campaign-manager-for-2016/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "2016, Ben Carson, campaign, manager, President, super pac,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-01T18:41:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-01T17:17:39+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1658\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNow is the time to start all of the appropriate exploration and investigation, and put down the structure that is necessary,\u201d Dr. Carson said in a phone interview.\nSo, yeah, maybe he\u2019s talked himself into taking the plunge.\nAnd if the GOP doesn\u2019t retake the Senate, all the more reason to elect a Republican president in 2016.\nYou\u2019ll want that veto pen in the White House in case something weird happens and Democrats win back the House.\nEven something like ObamaCare, which Carson could attack as a renowned surgeon, isn\u2019t an easy winner for him."}
