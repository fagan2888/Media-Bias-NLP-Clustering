That's what we find ourselves always doing.\"\n\nImam Dabour's community released a statement earlier this week condemning the shooting and any terrorist attack - whether in the name of Islam or otherwise.\n\n\"We are normal, American people who live and share the same values and same thing any other normal human being and we don't have to keep repeating that every time something happens.\"\n\nPart of the statement said:\n\n\"Local Muslims of Bay County are saddened by the tragic, heinous crime in California yesterday which left 14 innocent people dead. We condemn in the strongest language any terrorist attack, whether in the name of Islam or any other ideology. Anyone who commits such atrocities violates not only the law, but also the teachings of Quran and Prophet Muhammad.\"\n\n\"We have crazy people, just like every other group. We have people who carry certain ideas,\" Imam Dabour said. \"There are close to two billion Muslims who the majority of them are peaceful people, normal people, just like everybody else.\"\n\nDoctor Hashem Mubarak is a spokesperson for the society and is a well known local cardiologist. He said the shootings sadden him and his community, as does the bias he said stems from misinformation and myths about the faith. He cited another recent deadly shooting at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado, in which he said the shooter's religious affiliations were not at closely scrutinized.\n\n\"It gets unfortunately emphasized about the religion more than others,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he hopes his fellow Muslim Americans will be more vocal in their condemnation of violence and terror in the name of Islam. He believes many Muslim Americans may be shy or intimidated to speak but, but said it is the wrong way to enforce unity.\n\n\"I want to encourage the Muslims actually, Muslim Americans to be more active, more visible, more interactive, speak up and make sure that our fellow Americans know that we are against terrorism,\" Mubarak said. \"We are against hijacking our religion in the name of wrong political agenda.\"\n\nMubarak and Imam Dabour also invite people who are curious to lean more about the faith to reach out to them to ask questions.\n\n\"We will be happy to have you for coffee or tea or some refreshment, for baklava. We need to understand each other,\" he said. \"People need to know who we are and what we represent and what the real Muslim religion and message is all about.\"\n\nMubarak said the society hosts Open Houses and other events that are open to the community. Below is the full copy of the society's recent press release.\n\n---\n\n\"Bay County Muslims Strongly Condemn San Bernardino Shooting.\n\nLocal Muslims of Bay County are saddened by the tragic, heinous crime in California yesterday which left 14 innocent people dead. We condemn in the strongest language any terrorist attack, whether in the name of Islam or any other ideology. Anyone who commits such atrocities violates not only the law, but also the teachings of Quran and Prophet Muhammad.\n\nWe encourage our fellow Americans to reach out to the Muslim community with any questions they may have in an effort to dispel any misunderstandings ensued by such sickening acts of brutality. Muslims of Bay County and all Muslims practicing true Islam stand hand-in-hand with fellow Americans against acts of terrorism and violence.\n\nBay County has been home to Muslim professionals and families for over 40 years. We hope tragic incidents such as these will not inhibit tolerance and respect for one another.\"\n\n- END -", "article_metadata": {"description": "Communities across the country are condemning the recent deadly shootings in San Bernardino, California, and Bay County is no exception.
