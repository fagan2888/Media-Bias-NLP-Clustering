Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Redlands, was one of four Democrats and 43 first-year representatives to sign a letter to House Speaker John Boehner this week urging him to repeal a tax on medical devices tied to the Affordable Care Act.

The letter maintains that the 2.3 percent tax on pacemakers, artificial joints and similar devices hurts the medical device industry and “puts the discovery of new breakthrough medical technologies at risk.”

“As freshman members, we made a promise to our constituents to usher in a new era of cooperation in order to restore faith in our government institutions,” the letter read.

“Repealing the medical device tax is too important to our constituents and small businesses not to act immediately, and proves that we can come together with solutions.”

Medical Device Tax Letter

Aguilar was the only Inland congressional representative to sign the letter to Boehner, R-Ohio.

His district includes a number of medical device manufacturers, according to spokeswoman Sarah Weinstein. Aguilar represents California’s 31st Congressional District, which includes Redlands, Loma Linda, Colton, Grand Terrace, Rancho Cucamonga and the city of San Bernardino.

Aguilar, a former Redlands mayor, won a competitive election last year with the help of out-of-district donors and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Since taking office in January, he has held a rally in support of President Barack Obama’s actions on immigration and raised the prospect of professional sanctions against the California lawyer behind a proposed ballot measure that would allow gay people to be killed.

He already faces a re-election challenger in Republican Paul Chabot, who lost to Aguilar in November.
