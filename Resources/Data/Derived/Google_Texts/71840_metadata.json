She started teaching yoga in Seattle 23 years ago. Since then, she\u2019s run her own studio, trained hundreds of teachers, posed on the cover of books by the anatomy guru Judith Lasater, and modeled for the catalogue of the yoga brand Hugger Mugger. \u201cI\u2019ve invested my life in this,\u201d she says.\n\nLate last year, however, she stopped teaching and took a job selling women\u2019s clothing in a department store at the mall. Getting by as a yoga teacher has never been easy, but people in the industry say that, in recent years, it\u2019s gotten harder than it\u2019s been in decades. \u201cIt\u2019s a grueling line of work, and you\u2019re not allowed to show the effects of it because of the nature of your work,\u201d renowned teacher Leslie Kaminoff, co-author of the seminal reference book Yoga Anatomy, says of the instructors in his orbit. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough way to make a living.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as in so many other fields, yoga in America is increasingly a superstar economy, with a few lucrative positions at the very top, many struggling aspirants down below, and a hollowed-out middle where people like Elliott used to reside. \u201cMe and my strata have worked really hard for a long time. We laid the groundwork,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we\u2019re being obliterated.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, it might seem strange that teachers are under so much pressure, because the business of yoga keeps getting bigger. In 2012, the market-research organization Ibis World identified yoga and Pilates studios as the fourth-fastest growing industry in the country, behind generic pharmaceuticals, solar-panel manufacturing, and for-profit universities. A recent survey commissioned by the Yoga Alliance, a nonprofit representing teachers and studios, found that 8 percent of adults currently do yoga. According to Yoga Journal, students spend $2.5 billion a year on yoga instruction.\n\nYet even as more and more people are doing yoga, the business model of the independent yoga studio has started breaking down, particularly in expensive cities like New York, Seattle, and San Francisco. While boutique fitness studios like SoulCycle cost upwards of $30 per session, prices for yoga classes have remained closer to $20. There\u2019s too much competition to charge more. According to Yoga Alliance spokesperson Andrew Tanner, there were 818 registered yoga schools in the U.S. in 2008. By 2012, the number grew to 2,500, and today there are 3,900.\n\nMany students don\u2019t pay anywhere near full price, because they buy packages from online discounters like Groupon or ClassPass. Studios participate in the hopes of attracting new students. According to Alison West, director of the Yoga Union studio in the Flatiron, they end up earning \u201cabout 25 cents on the dollar. It barely covers the cost of paying a teacher. Some studios, unethically, don\u2019t pay teachers for promotional students. On the whole, it\u2019s just a really bad idea, and everybody is doing it. It\u2019s turning students into yoga tourists; as long as you have your promotion, you go to wherever it\u2019s cheap.\u201d\n\nBecause there\u2019s so little profit in group classes, studios have to rely on teacher-training courses to make money. These are usually 200-hour intensives for both aspiring teachers and students who want to take their practice to the next level, costing several thousand dollars. (Many studios hire from among their own graduates. Kaminoff describes it this way: \u201cYou\u2019re going to pay us thousands of dollars, and if you\u2019re really good, what you get to do is get an entry-level position in the shitty time slot that nobody else wants to teach in.\u201d)\n\nAll these trainings have generated a huge oversupply of would-be instructors. \u201cThere\u2019s been a massive growth in the number of yoga teachers since 2008,\u201d says Tanner. \u201cMore and more teachers are being bred, of not necessarily good quality,\u201d adds West. \u201cThey\u2019re all going out there and saturating the market. It\u2019s the devaluation of yoga on all fronts.\u201d Pay rates for these teachers have, in turn, stayed stagnant since 2007, Tanner says. In New York, some studios pay $50 for a 90-minute class. Others pay $4 per student.\n\nTo make a living, teachers rush from studio to studio, leading as many as 20 classes a week, a system that might sound familiar to poverty-stricken adjunct professors. Recently, a teacher at my own studio, a tomboyish, heavily tattooed 26-year-old who goes by the name Be Shakti, came to class on crutches. She had a hip injury, which she got training for a Spartan Race, a Reebok-sponsored extreme obstacle course. Her doctor told her not to put any weight on it for six weeks. \u201cI subbed out a couple classes, but I have to keep paying bills and rent, and then paying medical bills and for physical therapy and whatnot,\u201d she says.\n\nOrdinarily, Shakti teaches seven days a week. Her schedule includes 14 regular weekly group classes, for which she earns $50 each. She often substitutes for other teachers, so some weeks she teaches as many as 20 classes. Four times a week, she instructs private clients as well. She has Obamacare, but no disability or liability insurance. She loves what she does for a living, but it\u2019s precarious and draining. \u201cI think burnout is something where, if you are teaching full-time, it\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s part of it,\u201d she says.\n\nShakti says the burnout always ebbs, and she regains her enthusiasm. Then again, she\u2019s young. For older teachers, the relentless pace of a studio-based career is harder to sustain. Sadie Nardini, 43, started teaching 20 years ago. Until five years ago, she was teaching 15 classes a week in New York. \u201cEvery week I was exhausted and every week I wanted to quit,\u201d she says. \u201cI was getting sick. I wasn\u2019t nourishing myself properly because I had rent to pay and it was scary to know that if anything happened to me I had no savings. I didn\u2019t take a vacation for a decade. My relationships suffered. I would get home and be just dead. I had a long-term relationship break up because there was no energy left for him, and it wasn\u2019t just me. I saw most of my yoga teacher friends doing the exact same thing.\u201d\n\nNardini\u2019s story, however, takes a very different turn than Elliott\u2019s. For her, the difficult years grinding out a living in studios are just a prelude, the before part of the before-and-after story she tells about the career salvation she found on the internet. \u201cIf teachers aren\u2019t online, they miss out on the income potential of the vast majority of people wanting to learn from them and buy things from them,\u201d Nardini says. \u201cIt\u2019s win-win for everybody. They learn yoga. You make money.\u201d Last year, she says, she earned $275,000. She offers an online course, called a \u201cLIVE YOUR DREAM MASTER SESSION,\u201d for yoga teachers who hope to follow in her footsteps. Instructors may not be able to check alignment or give adjustments online, but Nardini emphasizes how many more people they can reach: \u201cSomeone in Afghanistan just wrote me, saying, \u2018We have no yoga studios or teachers here, thank you so much for being my teacher.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs with everything, success is all about branding. Teachers who want to thrive in the current landscape, says Nardini, need to be \u201cclear on their personal brand of yoga. I call that the core message.\u201d She bills herself as a sort of punk-rock wellness coach. \u201cMy thing \u2014 I\u2019m a musician also \u2014 is rock who you are,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very empowering, core-strength Vinyasa yoga. It\u2019s all about empowerment and courage and being fierce and rock-and-roll mudra. I\u2019m not all flowers and unicorns. I\u2019m wine and steak, that\u2019s my tribe.\u201d Recent photos show her in a bleach-blonde faux-hawk, and her website describes her as a \u201cfull-spectrum transformation advocate: a renowned empowerment speaker, yoga and anatomy expert and Healthy Hedonism lifestyle leader.\u201d\n\nNardini\u2019s income comes primarily from online yoga classes, sold through the website PowHow.com, as well as longer, multipart courses and at-home teacher trainings that she sells through Udemy.com. (\u201cUdemy is baller,\u201d she says.) She has over 110,000 likes on her Facebook page (though only around 8,300 Instagram followers). Two or three times a month, she travels to teach at festivals or do in-person trainings. \u201cI spend the rest of the week, Monday through Friday, in a caf\u00e9 or a bar, working on my visions and my online community,\u201d she says.\n\nThis, increasingly, is what a successful American yoga teacher looks like. \u201cYoga became an industry by merging with the fitness industry,\u201d says Kaminoff. \u201cNow it\u2019s merging with celebrity culture.\u201d\n\nAs in any superstar economy, the rewards are concentrated at the top. Five years ago Ava Taylor, a veteran of Lululemon, founded YAMA Talent, a talent agency for yoga teachers. (She represents both Kaminoff and Nardini.) \u201cWhat some of our teachers do, and how they live, is phenomenal,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re rock stars. They travel around the world if they choose to. It\u2019s entirely possible to be in a different city almost every weekend teaching yoga. Being on big stages. Have wonderful endorsements and opportunities. Have the car service pick you up at the airport and take you to the hotel. There\u2019s this incredible possibility now, where teachers can make multiple six-figure incomes teaching yoga.\u201d\n\nSome can, but not many. The new yoga ecosystem values social-media savvy over the types of skills longtime teachers have honed \u2014 hence all the gorgeous yogis and yoginis contorting themselves into astonishing poses on Instagram. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely seen the phenomenon of Insta-celebrity, and they\u2019re getting real deals,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cOnce teachers can get their following up to a certain size, their business reality really, really changes.\u201d\n\nThis may not have anything to do with their teaching skills. \u201cA pretty picture doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a great teacher, but it doesn't have to,\u201d says Taylor. That\u2019s because a big part of the business of yoga these days is entertainment, not instruction. \u201cYoga now is where the Food Network was 15 or 20 years ago,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s both, \u2018Let me teach you how to cook,\u2019 and, \u2018Watch me cook.\u2019\u201d\n\nElliott doesn\u2019t really want people to watch her cook. \u201cIt kind of crushes me that you can make a name on Instagram without actually teaching,\u201d she says. She is trying to look upon the radical shifts in the yoga market with equanimity. But that doesn't mean she wants to be part of them. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I want to reach the Instagram market,\u201d she says. Instead, she is following the advice of innumerable yogis before her: Just let go.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Yoga is a growing industry, but it's getting harder to make a living.", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "The Cut", "description": "Yoga is a growing industry, but it's getting harder to make a living.", "title": "The Brutal Economics of Being a Yoga Teacher", "url": "http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/10/brutal-economics-of-being-a-yoga-teacher.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2015/10/07/07-yoga-hustle.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheCut", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2015/10/07/07-yoga-hustle.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "description": "Yoga is a growing industry, but it's getting harder to make a living.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Brutal Economics of Being a Yoga Teacher"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/thecut/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "The Cut", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "yoga, fitness, money making, rethink your side hustle, careers, stretching", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Cut", "tag": "yoga,fitness,money making,rethink your side hustle,careers,stretching", "published_time": "2015-10-08T12:30:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, yoga, fitness, money making, rethink your side hustle, careers, stretching", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "I saw most of my yoga teacher friends doing the exact same thing.\u201dNardini\u2019s story, however, takes a very different turn than Elliott\u2019s.\nGetting by as a yoga teacher has never been easy, but people in the industry say that, in recent years, it\u2019s gotten harder than it\u2019s been in decades.\nThis, increasingly, is what a successful American yoga teacher looks like.\nFive years ago Ava Taylor, a veteran of Lululemon, founded YAMA Talent, a talent agency for yoga teachers.\nShe offers an online course, called a \u201cLIVE YOUR DREAM MASTER SESSION,\u201d for yoga teachers who hope to follow in her footsteps."}
