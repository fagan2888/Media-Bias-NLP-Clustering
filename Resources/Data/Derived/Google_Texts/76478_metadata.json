Its seeds and fibers can be used in cosmetics, soaps, oils, foods, textiles and even building materials. The plant is still grown in Canada, where it frequently earns more per acre than wheat.\n\nHemp contains virtually no THC, the ingredient in marijuana that makes people high, but the two plants look just alike. In outlawing the cultivation of marijuana, it made sense to restrict hemp growing as well because it was too easy for someone to slip pot plants into a hemp field.\n\nBut with the legalization of recreational pot in Colorado, and the federal government\u2019s statement that it would essentially not bust the marijuana industry, you might assume there\u2019d now be no problem growing hemp, pot\u2019s non- intoxicating cousin.\n\nYet in the United States, even in pot-friendly Colorado, federal law is still in the way.\n\nFederal law bans the sale of non-sterile hemp seeds, making it pretty hard to start a hemp farm. Other laws prevent farmers from getting government-backed crop insurance, and there are still forfeiture laws on the books that could result in a farmer losing his or her land for growing hemp.\n\nDespite these obstacles, some farmers, like Ryan Loflin in Baca County, are trying to cultivate the plant. Loflin this year grew one of the first commercial-sized crops of hemp in America in decades and said he\u2019s still turning away buyers who want his plants.\n\nMeanwhile, the owner of a San Diego-based company says he can\u2019t build a hemp-seed oil processing plant in the San Luis Valley until farmers have assurance they can get starter seeds.\n\nIn fact, 10 states now have industrial hemp laws that conflict with federal drug laws, including states as far apart in temperament as California and Kentucky.\n\nFarmers in all these states will continue to find it difficult to grow hemp \u2014 and create badly needed jobs \u2014 if the federal government does not make it clear, in writing, that hemp is a legal crop.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Clarify laws on growing hemp", "title": "Clarify laws on growing hemp", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/08/clarify-laws-on-growing-hemp/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131108__20131111_A23_OP11E_HEMPp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131108__20131111_A23_OP11E_HEMPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-08T17:22:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T12:58:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf781\"", "article_summary": "In fact, 10 states now have industrial hemp laws that conflict with federal drug laws, including states as far apart in temperament as California and Kentucky.\nFederal law bans the sale of non-sterile hemp seeds, making it pretty hard to start a hemp farm.\nOther laws prevent farmers from getting government-backed crop insurance, and there are still forfeiture laws on the books that could result in a farmer losing his or her land for growing hemp.\nIn outlawing the cultivation of marijuana, it made sense to restrict hemp growing as well because it was too easy for someone to slip pot plants into a hemp field.\nAmendment 64, in addition to legalizing the use and sale of recreational marijuana, also authorized the growing of hemp \u2014 at least in theory."}
