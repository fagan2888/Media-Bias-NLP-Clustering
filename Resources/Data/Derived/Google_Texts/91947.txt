I don’t know if Saturday Night Live was in top form with topical sketches this week, or they just had even more material to work with than usual. With an exceptionally high number of political boondoggles for a non-election year, the show gave everyone something to cheer for (and against).

The cold open presented Bobby Moynihan as embattled Toronto mayor Rob Ford, who admitted this week to smoking crack cocaine, after denying it for months, and before committing even more PR disasters. SNL responded with a sketch that expressed Ford’s seemingly endless and constant capacity to talk out both sides of his mouth, while appearing red-faced, sweaty, and inebriated. The sketch even squeezed in a scathing knock on 60 Minutes, the US news program that had to retract a high profile story on Benghazi recently:

Taking aim at US politicians, SNL made a fake commercial for “Paxil: Second Term strength,” an anti-depressant for US commander-in-chiefs suffering a second term slump. The spot shows President Obama (Jay Pharaoh) popping pills to a long list of administration headaches, and then just chugging the bottle at the mention of the Obamacare website.

OK, one pet peeve: the now-cliched line about something “not being covered by Obamacare.” It’s somewhat misleading. Obamacare regulates some “essential” services that private insurers have to cover, but it doesn’t cover things itself. Some entertainers aren’t above this pandering and lazy humor, but SNL should be.

Speaking of pandering, weekly host Lady Gaga brilliantly addressed the topic in a musical number opening act. The musician showed her vocal abilities as well as a sense of humor with a song about how much she loves applause, whether it is well-earned or not.
