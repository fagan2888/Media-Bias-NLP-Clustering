Most Texans in the House support the bill, calling it good for consumers and for innovation.\n\nIn Austin, state officials say the change wouldn\u2019t be a budget buster. Internet levies account for a fraction of the state\u2019s $25.9 billion annual sales tax revenue. But banning the taxes could block Texas and its cities from big revenue streams in the future as broadband becomes more widespread.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re concerned,\u201d said Brett Wilkinson, the city of Dallas\u2019 managing director of intergovernmental services. \u201cAny revenue hit to us has an impact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fight that doesn\u2019t fall neatly along party lines and, in some cases, has pitted federal lawmakers against local and state governments.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this is Washington, D.C., telling states what they can and cannot tax,\u201d said David Quam, a deputy director at the National Governors Association.\n\nFederal law has blocked most states from collecting taxes on Internet access since 1998. The ban expires Nov. 1.\n\nWhen it adopted the politically popular ban, Congress exempted a handful of states \u2014 including Texas \u2014 that were already collecting such taxes. Currently, seven states have the fees.\n\nWith midterm elections looming, Congress is expected to extend the ban, at least in the short term.\n\nIt\u2019s less certain whether Texas and the other states would be affected. A Senate bill would continue the ban but also Texas\u2019 exemption.\n\nThe issue is separate from taxing online shopping purchases, though some senators \u2014 and their allies among brick-and-mortar retailers \u2014 want to link the debates.\n\nOn Internet access charges of more than $25 a month, Texas collects a 6.25 percent sales tax. Local sales tax can add 2 percent more. The state comptroller\u2019s office estimates an average Internet bill in Texas is $60.\n\nSo Texans typically pay $2 to $3 per month in tax. Statewide, that adds up.\n\nIn fiscal 2013, Texas collected $280 million from the fees, according to the comptroller. Cities and other jurisdictions took in a combined $78 million.\n\nThe seven states with an Internet access tax collect more than $500 million per year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, so Texas is by far the biggest single recipient.\n\nLocal government officials and advocates say they have less budget flexibility than the state, so the lost revenue could cut into cities\u2019 abilities to provide basic services, such as funding for police and parks.\n\nDallas stands to lose roughly $2.4 million, according to estimates based on U.S. census figures.\n\nWilkinson said that total is significant, even compared with the $269 million Dallas expects to collect from its sales tax next fiscal year.\n\nAt the state level, Chris Bryan, a spokesman for the comptroller, said the agency is watching the issue closely.\n\nLaws surrounding the tax date to the early stages of the Internet. Congress passed the first moratorium on Internet access taxes in 1998 to prop up the new industry and renewed it three times.\n\nIf Congress permanently banned the taxes, experts say, cities would have a hard time replacing the revenue. Raising property tax rates would be unpopular, and some cities have already hit the state-set limit.\n\n\u201cCities would have to cut spending if they had such a big hit,\u201d said Bennett Sandlin, executive director of the Texas Municipal League.\n\nState officials are less worried. Tax collections are surpassing Comptroller Susan Combs' projections, and the Legislature expects a surplus when it sets the next two-year budget next year.\n\n\u201cThe loss of this revenue would not have a dramatic impact,\u201d said state Rep. John Otto, R-Dayton, vice chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nIn the U.S. House, the bill to ban Internet access taxes passed with a voice vote, meaning the votes of individual lawmakers weren\u2019t recorded.\n\nThe list of co-sponsors includes 21 Texans, including 18 of the state\u2019s 24 Republicans, and three of 12 Democrats.\n\nReps. Joe Barton, R-Arlington, and Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, have raised concerns over the effect on Texas.\n\n\u201cWhy are we barring our states from doing their good due diligence, providing resources \u2014 needed resources \u2014 for schools and infrastructure and health care?\u201d Jackson Lee said.\n\nBarton, an original co-sponsor of the bill, said it could hurt his district\u2019s biggest city, Arlington, which collects about $1 million yearly from the fees.\n\nBackers of the ban say they want to help consumers.\n\n\u201cThe current moratorium protects working families who rely on affordable Internet access,\u201d Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, said through an aide.\n\nIn the Senate, lawmakers are pursuing a different strategy.\n\nA bipartisan group is trying to pair Internet access taxes with another issue: collecting sales taxes from out-of-state retailers.\n\nCurrently, states can only draw those taxes from sellers with a physical presence within their borders.\n\n\u201cYou have the government basically picking winners and losers by preventing states from requiring remote sellers to collect the tax,\u201d said Craig Johnson, executive director of the Streamlined Sales Tax Governing Board.\n\nIn 2012, the loophole cost states more than $23 billion, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nMany cities, including Dallas, want to collect taxes from out-of-state retailers. A bill to allow that, known as the Marketplace Fairness Act, passed the Senate last year but faces resistance in the U.S. House.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz voted against the legislation; Sen. John Cornyn missed the vote but said afterward he would have voted no.\n\nSince 2011, Dallas has spent $440,000 lobbying for the Marketplace Fairness Act and other federal issues, Senate records show.\n\nOpponents say the proposal would burden small businesses with a new tax collection process; supporters scoff at that complaint, noting that most retailers collect taxes of some sort.\n\nThe Senate bill would ban Internet access taxes for 10 more years. It would also let states like Texas continue collecting the taxes.\n\nCornyn hasn\u2019t committed one way or the other on the legislation, spokesman Elliot Grimm said.\n\nCruz supports a permanent ban on Internet access taxes. But he opposes combining it with the online sales tax bill, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said.\n\nSome city officials say it makes sense to quickly tackle the sales tax issue, especially as more sales move online.\n\n\u201cIf you do not provide for taxation of remote sellers, it will produce tremendous inequities,\u201d said Bob Scott, chief financial officer for Carrollton.\n\nFollow Kimberly Railey on\n\nTwitter at @kimberlyrailey.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If Congress passes a bill to ban practice, cities would feel a bigger bite in their budget than the state would.", "og": {"description": "If Congress passes a bill to ban practice, cities would feel a bigger bite in their budget than the state would.", "title": "Texas, 6 other states may lose ability to tax Internet access", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140824-texas-6-other-states-may-lose-ability-to-tax-internet-access.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-25T06:45:47Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-25T04:06:30Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Texas, 6 other states may lose ability to tax Internet access\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/metro/20140824-texas-6-other-states-may-lose-ability-to-tax-internet-access.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1878254\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-25T04:06:30Z\", \"section\": \"Metro\", \"author\": \"KIMBERLY RAILEY\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-25T04:06:30Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "A bipartisan group is trying to pair Internet access taxes with another issue: collecting sales taxes from out-of-state retailers.\nOn Internet access charges of more than $25 a month, Texas collects a 6.25 percent sales tax.\nCongress passed the first moratorium on Internet access taxes in 1998 to prop up the new industry and renewed it three times.\n\u201cThe current moratorium protects working families who rely on affordable Internet access,\u201d Rep.
