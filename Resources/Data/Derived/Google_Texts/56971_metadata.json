Another source reported that \u201cFord stopped people from sharing their stories, which is key to a successful rehab experience. Other residents felt intimidated. They felt he was a bully. He was always saying he did not belong there.\u201d\n\nUpon returning to office last month, Ford vowed to make himself the \u201cbest person I can be,\u201d he said at a press conference. \u201cFor my family, for the people of Toronto, and with your support, I am also resolved to work harder than ever for the taxpayers of this great city.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his rehab stay, Ford claimed it was like being at a childhood camp: \u201cI feel great, he told the Toronto Sun. \u201cRehab is amazing. It reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I went to as a kid.\u201d And at the end of it, he claimed rehab helped him solve his problems: \u201cI went and got professional, professional help at GreeneStone,\u201d Ford told Newstalk 1010. \u201cI believe it\u2019s the best one in the world. And they taught me exactly the problem it was with me.\u201d\n\nBut the staff at GreeneStone disagree. In group settings, where patients were encouraged to share their stories and support one another, Ford would reportedly abuse other patients, shout at them, refuse to listen, and swear profusely. After two months, he was removed from the therapy group and scheduled to have one-one-one therapy with a private counselor. In addition, a fellow patient in rehab, LeeAnne McRobb, was kicked out for misbehavior and was later arrested for drunk driving in Ford\u2019s Cadillac Escalade \u2014 which the mayor had let her borrow.\n\nHowever, Shawn Leon, president of GreeneStone Healthcare, did not answer any questions about Ford. \u201cWith regards to Mayor Ford\u2019s conduct and how it affected other residents at GreeneStone we simply cannot comment,\u201d he told The Star. \u201cWe take patient care and confidentiality very seriously, and as such, cannot comment on our patients or their treatment.\u201d He did mention, however, that \u201csome individuals are not necessarily group ready.\u201d Though Ford is running for re-election, it has yet to be seen if he'll be voted back into office.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "alcoholism, rob ford", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Now back in office after his stint in rehab, reports are surfacing about Ford\u2019s misconduct with other residents and potential drug use while in therapy.", "title": "Toronto Mayor Rob Ford Fought Residents, Possibly Used Drugs In Rehab", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-caused-trouble-rehab-fought-other-residents-and-possibly-used-drugs-292290", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/rob-ford-mayor-toronto.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Now back in office after his stint in rehab, reports are surfacing about Ford\u2019s misconduct with other residents and potential drug use while in therapy.", "title": "Toronto Mayor Rob Ford Fought Residents, Possibly Used Drugs In Rehab", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/toronto-mayor-rob-ford-caused-trouble-rehab-fought-other-residents-and-possibly-used-drugs-292290", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/rob-ford-mayor-toronto.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/09/rob-ford-mayor-toronto.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-07-09T18:24:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T18:43:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Now back in office after his stint in rehab, reports are surfacing about Ford\u2019s misconduct with other residents and potential drug use while in therapy."}, "article_summary": "\u201cFord broke things, got into fights with other residents,\u201d one source told the Toronto Star.\nNow that he's out of rehab, Rob Ford plans on running for mayor again; however, reports of his misconduct in rehab have recently been surfacing.\n\u201cWith regards to Mayor Ford\u2019s conduct and how it affected other residents at GreeneStone we simply cannot comment,\u201d he told The Star.\nAnother source reported that \u201cFord stopped people from sharing their stories, which is key to a successful rehab experience.\nAccording to patients and the staff at GreeneStone Residential Addiction Treatment Facility in Canada, Ford was \u201cdisruptive\u201d during his stay, and he may have been continuing to abuse both alcohol and drugs, the Toronto Star reported."}
