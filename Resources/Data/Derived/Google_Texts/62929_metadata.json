Marco Rubio went too far in claiming that Hillary Clinton \u201cwants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court.\u201d An Iowa resident suggested such an appointment to Clinton, and she said she\u2019d take it \u201cunder advisement.\u201d\n\nRubio also said that the White House \u201cstill refuses to acknowledge\u201d that the shooting of a Philadelphia police officer on Jan. 7 \u201chad anything to do with terror.\u201d But a White House spokesman said that terrorism may have been the motivation and that the Philadelphia Police Department would make that determination.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush exaggerated in saying that then-Sen. Obama killed the comprehensive immigration bill in 2007 that had the support of President George W. Bush.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich credited the Medicaid expansion with a reduction in the prison recidivism rate in Ohio. But the rate isn\u2019t as low as he claimed, and the latest figures are on inmates released well before the expansion.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz claimed an amendment he offered to the 2013 immigration bill \u201cdidn\u2019t say a word about legalization.\u201d That\u2019s technically true, but the effect of the amendment would have been to allow legalization of those in the country illegally.\n\nRubio claimed that when he opposed a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d when running for the Senate in 2010, it was due to legislation to provide \u201calmost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.\u201d But a 2010 Senate bill provided the same types of obstacles as the bill Rubio later backed as a senator.\n\nCruz claimed that \u201cmillions\u201d had lost jobs and been forced into part-time work because of the Affordable Care Act. But the economy has added millions of jobs since the employer mandate, and fewer people are working part-time for economic reasons.\n\nKasich boasted of 400,000 jobs gained in the state under his governorship. But the rate of growth is below the national average.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe seventh debate among the Republican presidential contenders \u2014 and last before the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses \u2014 featured seven of the top candidates on the main stage: retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul. Businessman Donald Trump did not attend the debate, which was hosted by Fox News and Google and held in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nObama, a Supreme Court Justice?\n\nRubio went too far in claiming that Clinton \u201cwants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America.\u201d Clinton only said that she would take an Iowa resident\u2019s appointment suggestion \u201cunder advisement.\u201d\n\nRubio: She wants to put Barack Obama on the Supreme Court of the United States of America. She said that here in Iowa just two days ago. That would be a disaster for this country.\n\nRubio was referring to a comment that Clinton made Tuesday in response to a voter question during a campaign rally in Decorah, Iowa. Here is the question and her response (around the 7:40 mark) courtesy of Live Satellite News:\n\nQuestioner, Jan. 26: The next president will probably appoint several members of the Supreme Court. Will you consider appointing Obama? Clinton: Wow! What a great idea! \u2026 He may have a few other things to do. \u2026 I would certainly take [your suggestion] under advisement. I mean, he\u2019s brilliant and he can set forth an argument, and he was a law professor, so he\u2019s got all the credentials. Now, we do have to get a Democratic Senate to get him confirmed.\n\nActually, in 2014, the New Yorker asked Obama whether he would consider serving as a judge after his presidency. It reported that Obama \u201csounded tempted,\u201d but responded: \u201cI don\u2019t think I have the temperament to sit in a chamber and write opinions. \u2026 I think being a Justice is a little bit too monastic for me. Particularly after having spent six years and what will be eight years in this bubble, I think I need to get outside a little bit more.\u201d\n\nObama may have changed his mind since then. However, it is clear that while Clinton responded positively to the suggestion to put him on the Supreme Court, Rubio exaggerates by saying that she \u201cwants\u201d to do so.\n\nTerrorism and the Philadelphia Shooting\n\nRubio said that the White House \u201cstill refuses to acknowledge\u201d that Edward Archer\u2019s shooting of a Philadelphia police officer on Jan. 7 \u201chad anything to do with terror.\u201d That\u2019s not exactly right. A spokesman for the White House has said that terrorism may have been the motivation for the shooting, but that the Philadelphia Police Department would ultimately make that determination.\n\nRubio: Megyn, that\u2019s the problem. Radical Muslims and radical Islam is not just hate talk. It\u2019s hate action. They blow people up. Look what they did in San Bernardino. Look at the attack they inspired in Philadelphia, that the White House still refuses to link to terror, where a guy basically shot a police officer three times. He told the police, \u201cI did it because I was inspired by ISIS,\u201d and to this day, the White House still refuses to acknowledge it had anything to do with terror.\n\nRubio was referring to the Jan. 7 shooting of Philadelphia police officer Jesse Hartnett by Archer, who reportedly told Philadelphia police that he shot Hartnett \u201cin the name of Islam\u201d and that he had pledged allegiance to terrorist group ISIS, or the Islamic State.\n\nDuring his White House press briefing on Jan. 11, Press Secretary Josh Earnest, in response to a question about Archer\u2019s reported confession, said that \u201cwe\u2019re all wondering right now\u201d if the shooting was an act of terrorism based on reports of Archer\u2019s stated motivations. But Earnest said that the Philadelphia Police Department had not come to that conclusion.\n\nQuestioner: First, a quick follow-up to something on Friday, the attempted assassination of the police officer in Philadelphia. Does the White House consider that a terrorist attack? Earnest: Jon, this is something that is still being investigated by the Philadelphia Police Department and they have not concluded that it actually is an act of terrorism. But given some of the circumstances of the event, obviously that is something that we\u2019re all wondering right now. And I\u2019m confident that as the Philadelphia Police Department investigates the shooting of one of their own this is something they will consider \u2014 that\u2019s specifically the motivation of the individual who carried out this heinous act of violence.\n\nWhen another reporter asked Earnest a follow-up question about it, he said that the shooting \u201ccould be an act of terrorism\u201d and that investigators were still \u201ctrying to understand what may have motivated this individual to carry out this deplorable act of violence.\u201d\n\nEarnest: Well, Kevin, obviously those reports lead us to worry that this could be an act of terrorism. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s part of the ongoing investigation that\u2019s being led by the Philadelphia Police Department right now. The FBI has been supporting that investigation and there obviously is keen interest in trying to understand what may have motivated this individual to carry out this deplorable act of violence. And it is relevant whether or not this individual was motivated by demons inside of his own mind, or by demons that he encountered through social media.\n\nEarnest suggested that Archer may have been \u201cmotivated by demons inside of his own mind,\u201d which could be based on reports that Archer\u2019s mother, Valerie Holiday, said that her son was suspicious of the police and had been \u201chearing voices in his head\u201d and \u201ctalking to himself.\u201d\n\nThe FBI has been investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism, but has not concluded that it was such. According to an Associated Press report, the FBI has at least ruled out that Archer was part of an organized terror cell.\n\nMedicaid and Recidivism in Ohio\n\nKasich takes credit for using Medicaid expansion funds to help reduce the state\u2019s prison recidivism to \u201cless than 20 percent.\u201d It\u2019s actually 27.5 percent \u2014 much lower than the national average, but it is not less than 20 percent.\n\nAlso, the rate has been in a steady decline since 2000 \u2014 long before Kasich took office in January 2011.\n\nKasich made his remarks when he was asked about his decision to bypass the Legislature and accept federal funding to expand Medicaid in his state under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKasich: It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill. Because I don\u2019t think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they\u2019re not in an in-and-out-of-the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don\u2019t live in emergency rooms. How has it worked? Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent. That\u2019s basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.\n\nThe Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Correction defines recidivism \u201cas the first return to a DRC institution within 3 years of release.\u201d\n\nThe three-year recidivism rate was 39 percent for inmates released in 2000 and has been falling ever since, reaching a low of 27.1 percent for inmates released in 2010, according to a 2014 state corrections department report.\n\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer, in a March 2014 story, trumpeted the new low rate, saying it is \u201cmuch lower\u201d than the national average.\n\nCleveland Plain Dealer, March 6, 2014: The state prison system said Wednesday that Ohio\u2019s recidivism rate is 27.1 percent for inmates released in 2010. That is better than the previous rate of 28.7 percent. It also is much lower than the national average of about 40 percent. The recidivism rate \u2014 or the rate at which inmates return to prison over a span of three years \u2014 has been in a downward spiral since 2000, when the rate was 39 percent in Ohio, according to prison records. The recent report marks the lowest rate in years.\n\nThat 27.1 percent figure is listed in the department\u2019s annual report for fiscal year 2014. But the most recent annual report for fiscal 2015 says the three-year rate for inmates released in 2011 was 27.5 percent \u2014 up slightly from the previous year.\n\nSo, the state\u2019s rate is relatively low. Is Kasich\u2019s decision to accept Medicaid the reason?\n\nWell, the most recent three-year recidivism rate published in the fiscal 2015 report is based on inmates who were released in 2011. The Medicaid expansion did not start in Ohio until 2014.\n\nBush: Obama\u2019s \u2018Poison Pill\u2019 Amendments\n\nBush accused Obama of killing the comprehensive immigration bill that had the support of President George W. Bush, but failed to pass the Senate in 2007. But, as we have written before, that gives Obama too much blame or credit, depending on your point of view.\n\nBush: I have supported a consensus approach to solving this problem wherever it came up. and in 2007 it almost passed when my brother was president of the United States. A bipartisan approach got close. Barack Obama actually had the poison pill to stop it then.\n\nWe wrote about this \u201cpoison pill\u201d claim when it was made in 2010 by Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, and in 2008, when it was made by Sen. John McCain, a supporter of the 2007 bill who was the 2008 Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe claim rests on five amendments that Obama supported and one that he sponsored, as the McCain campaign outlined in a press release during the 2008 presidential campaign. Only two of those measures passed:\n\nAn amendment by Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman that reduced the annual visa quota for guest workers from 400,000 to 200,000. That passed easily, 74-24.\n\nAn amendment sponsored by Democratic Sen. Byron Dorgan and sponsored by labor unions that would have ended the temporary worker program after five years. That was more controversial and passed 49-48, meaning it would not have passed without Obama\u2019s vote.\n\nGillespie cited the Dorgan amendment as the \u201cpoison pill\u201d that killed the immigration bill. A day later, the immigration bill \u2014 with the Dorgan amendment \u2014 gained only 34 votes of the 60 votes it needed to end debate on the bill and bring it up for a vote.\n\nNo Republican voted for the cloture motion that would have cleared the bill for a final vote. One of them, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, called the Dorgan amendment a \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\n\nSenate Democratic leadership tried one last time to end the Republican-led filibuster, but the bill fell short by 14 votes on June 28, 2007 \u2014 which was welcome news to groups on the left (AFL-CIO) and right (the Heritage Foundation) that opposed it.\n\nWho was to blame \u2014 or deserves credit \u2014 for the defeat? That\u2019s hard to say.\n\nAfter the bill\u2019s defeat, not even McCain blamed any one person for it. He blamed his own party for its strong opposition.\n\n\u201cA lot of the Republican base was passionate about the issue, and they made their influence felt,\u201d McCain told Congressional Quarterly in a June 29, 2007, story for the New York Times.\n\nAt the time, the Washington Times gave credit to three Republicans in particular for leading opposition to the bill: Sens. Tom Coburn, Jim DeMint and David Vitter.\n\nThe reality may be more complicated than that. The Washington Post wrote that the bill failed because it \u201cwas reviled by foes of illegal immigration, opposed by most labor unions and unloved by immigration advocates.\u201d\n\nIn any event, it\u2019s an exaggeration to say that Obama killed the bill.\n\nCruz\u2019s Legalization Amendment\n\nPressed about an amendment he offered in 2013 to the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d Senate immigration bill, Cruz claimed it said nothing about offering legalized status to immigrants living in the country illegally.\n\nThat\u2019s true, but Cruz is being misleading about the effect of his amendment. It would have allowed legalization, a point he made very clear at the time.\n\n\u201cYou know, the amendment you\u2019re talking about is one sentence \u2014 it\u2019s 38 words,\u201d Cruz said during the debate. \u201cAnyone can go online at tedcruz.org and read exactly what it said. In those 38 words, it said anyone here illegally is permanently ineligible for citizenship. It didn\u2019t say a word about legalization.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the 38-word text of Cruz\u2019s amendment: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, no person who is or has previously been willfully present in the United States while not in lawful status under the Immigration and Nationality Act shall be eligible for United States citizenship.\u201d\n\nTechnically, there\u2019s nothing in that language that mentions anything about legalization. But that was the effect of it. That\u2019s because while Cruz\u2019s amendment would have stripped out a proposal in S. 744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act, that provided a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d for those currently in the country illegally \u2014 which Cruz derided as \u201camnesty\u201d \u2014 his amendment purposefully left intact the bill\u2019s provisions to provide legal status for them.\n\nCruz made that all perfectly clear when he introduced the amendment.\n\nCruz, May 21, 2013: They would still be eligible for legal status and indeed, under the terms of the bill, they would be eligible for LPR [lawful permanent resident] status as well so that they are out of the shadows, which the proponents of this bill repeatedly point to as their principal objective, to provide a legal status for those who are here illegally to be out of the shadows. This amendment would allow that to happen, but what it would do is remove the pathway to citizenship so that there are real consequences that respect the rule of law and that treat legal immigrants with the fairness and respect they deserve.\n\nCruz went on to say that if his amendment were adopted, it would result in a bill that \u201cdoes not unfairly treat legal immigrants by removing a path to citizenship but allowing as this legislation does a legal status for those who are here illegally.\u201d\n\nDuring the December debate, Cruz said unequivocally, \u201cI have never supported legalization, and I do not intend to support legalization.\u201d In two debates, Rubio countered that if that\u2019s true, Cruz has flipped his position since 2013.\n\nBut as we wrote after the December debate, and again in January when Rubio raised the issue during another debate, Cruz now claims that his amendment was a bluff. Cruz\u2019s campaign told us the intent of the amendment was to expose that the real motivations of the bill\u2019s supporters were to provide a path to citizenship. His campaign said supporters claimed the bill\u2019s aim was to allow 11 million immigrants in the country illegally to come out of the shadows, so by offering a legalization option \u2014 which Cruz knew would fail \u2014 it would show that the actual intent of the bill\u2019s supporters was to provide citizenship to those immigrants so they could become future voters. We reviewed this issue in detail in our Dec. 16 story, \u201cDid Cruz Support Legalization?\u201d\n\nWe noted that Cruz made numerous statements at the time in support of his amendment, but that ultimately it is up to readers to decide if Cruz once supported legalization as a political compromise, and now disavows it, or if he was merely employing a legislative ploy to expose the motivations of his opponents. Whatever one concludes about that, the fact is that the amendment Cruz proposed would have permitted a path to legalization.\n\nRubio\u2019s Immigration Change\n\nRubio claimed that when he opposed a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d when running for the Senate in 2010, it was in the context of a Senate effort to provide \u201calmost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.\u201d But a 2010 Senate bill, which died in committee, provided the same types of obstacles as the bill Rubio later backed as a senator.\n\nIn fact, previous bills \u2014 a 2007 Senate immigration bill and a 2005 bill introduced by Sen. John McCain, a bill Rubio specifically said he opposed in 2010 \u2014 proposed a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d that included fines, payment of back taxes, probationary status, criminal background checks and proof of employment. Those measures are similar to those in the \u201cgang of eight\u201d immigration bill Rubio cosponsored in 2013.\n\nIn the debate, Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly played clips of Rubio speaking against \u201camnesty\u201d or a \u201cpath to citizenship\u201d while he was running for the Senate in 2010. One clip, from an Oct. 24, 2010, debate, showed Rubio saying: \u201cFirst of all, earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty. It\u2019s what they call it. And, the reality of it is this \u2026 it is unfair to the people that have legally entered this country to create an alternative for individuals who entered illegally, and knowingly did so.\u201d\n\nKelly asked Rubio about his apparent switch in positions: \u201cWithin two years of getting elected you were cosponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty,\u201d she asked. \u201cHaven\u2019t you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?\u201d\n\nRubio responded that he doesn\u2019t support \u201cblanket amnesty,\u201d but Kelly pointed out that \u201cyou said earned path to citizenship is basically code for amnesty.\u201d Rubio responded to that: \u201cIt absolutely has been, and at the time in the context of that was in 2009, and 2010, where the last effort for legalization was an effort done in the Senate. It was an effort led by several people that provided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.\u201d\n\nRubio has made this argument before when questioned on his change of position from when he was a candidate for Senate, and took a harder line on immigration than his opponent, then-Gov. Charlie Crist. We looked at this issue in 2013 and found that he had indeed changed his position from 2010.\n\nWhile campaigning for the Senate seat, Rubio also said that those in the country illegally should be required to return home and apply for citizenship \u2014 not be allowed to stay in the U.S. and pursue a path to citizenship. But the Senate bill he backed, S. 744 \u201cBorder Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act,\u201d would have allowed immigrants in the country illegally to eventually gain citizenship without returning to their home countries first.\n\nThe Senate bill he cosponsored would have required that several border security measures be achieved before those in the country illegally could begin to gain legal status. They would then need to \u201csubmit to and pass background checks, be fingerprinted, pay $2,000 in fines, pay taxes, prove gainful employment, prove they\u2019ve had a physical presence in the U.S. since before 2012 and [go] to the back of the line, among other criteria,\u201d according to a summary of the bill posted on Rubio\u2019s Senate website.\n\nRubio said that the last effort in the Senate in 2009/2010 \u201cprovided almost an instant path with very little obstacles moving forward.\u201d But a 2010 Senate bill, introduced by Sen. Robert Menendez, another member of the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d also delayed legalization procedures until border security measures were implemented, and it required immigrants in the U.S. illegally to register with the government, undergo background and security checks, pay fees and back taxes. The bill died in committee.\n\nIn his 2010 Senate race, however, Rubio specifically mentioned McCain\u2019s 2005 bill, saying of his opponent Crist, \u201cHe would have voted for the McCain plan. I think that plan is wrong, and the reason why I think it\u2019s wrong is that if you grant amnesty, as the governor proposes that we do, in any form, whether it\u2019s back of the line or so forth, you will destroy any chance we will ever have of having a legal immigration system that works here in America.\u201d\n\nThe 2005 bill was the basis of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611), which was cosponsored by McCain. The legalization provisions required that those in the country illegally \u201cwould have had to establish employment for at least three years during the April 5, 2001-April 5, 2006, period and for at least six years after enactment, and would have had to establish payment of income taxes during that required employment period\u201d to be granted lawful permanent residency status.\n\nCruz\u2019s \u2018Job Killer\u2019 Claim\n\nCruz repeated an increasingly shopworn GOP claim that the Affordable Care Act has forced \u201cmillions\u201d into unemployment and part-time work.\n\nCruz: It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.\n\nThe facts are otherwise, as we\u2019ve noted in 2011, 2012 and 2013. And the latest jobs statistics make it even more clear that what Cruz said is a partisan falsehood, no matter how many times it is repeated.\n\nThe fact is, the law hasn\u2019t prevented the economy from adding millions of jobs, month after month. Furthermore, fewer people are being forced to work part-time, not more.\n\nIt\u2019s true, as we\u2019ve said, that independent, nonpartisan experts projected some negative effect on employment. That\u2019s because some small employers may resist hiring new workers, or may cut back the hours of some current employees, to keep their total, full-time payroll under 50 \u2014 which is the point at which the law requires them to provide insurance to their workers or pay a penalty.\n\nBut the experts characterized the negative effect as \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cminimal,\u201d and one estimate put the total job loss at 150,000 to 300,000 \u2014 all of them low- or minimum-wage jobs \u2014 and far short of the \u201cmillions\u201d claimed by Cruz.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s employer mandate went into effect Jan. 1 last year, after being delayed for a year. Since then, the economy has added more than 2.4 million new jobs.\n\nAnd during the same period, the number of people forced to work part-time for economic reasons (because full-time work wasn\u2019t available, or because an employer cut back hours) has gone down \u2014 by 762,000.\n\nAs for Cruz\u2019s claim that Americans \u201chave lost their health insurance\u201d because of Obamacare, the fact is that millions have gained coverage. The most recent quarterly report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that during the first six months of 2015, about 28.5 million people of all ages reported being without coverage at the time they were interviewed. That\u2019s a reduction of 16.3 million uninsured since 2013, the year before the main provisions of the ACA took effect. (See Table 1.1a of the CDC\u2019s previous report for historical annual figures.)\n\nAs Cruz himself said in another context during the debate, \u201cFacts are stubborn things.\u201d And with that we heartily agree \u2014 no matter how many times Cruz misstates them.\n\nKasich\u2019s Jobs Boast\n\nKasich boasted that \u201cwe just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor.\u201d That\u2019s pretty close, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, which show Ohio gained 383,500 jobs between January 2011, the month Kasich took office, and December 2015, the latest figures available.\n\nThat may sound like a lot of jobs, but it reflects a growth rate of 7.6 percent. That lags behind the national growth rate of 9.5 percent over the same period. Compared with its neighbors, Ohio\u2019s growth rate was better than West Virginia\u2019s (0.4 percent) and Pennsylvania\u2019s (3.4 percent), but worse than Indiana\u2019s (8.8 percent), Michigan\u2019s (10 percent) and Kentucky\u2019s (8.6 percent).\n\nUpdate, Jan. 29: The Kasich campaign told us he was referring only to private sector job growth, though he didn\u2019t say so in the debate. By that measure, Ohio has gained 400,700 jobs. Still, Ohio\u2019s private sector job growth rate of 9.3 percent during Kasich\u2019s tenure lags behind the national private sector growth rate of 11.7 percent.\n\nAs for the unemployment rate, Ohio\u2019s has mostly tracked the national trend, though Ohio\u2019s rate of 9.2 percent in January 2011 was slightly above the national average of 9.1 percent. And at 4.7 percent in December, it was slightly below the national average of 5 percent.\n\nWe generally caution readers to be wary of governors citing employment gains or losses without considering the prevailing national trends. For example, in August, when New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie touted the creation of 192,000 private-sector jobs during his time as governor, we noted that the job growth rate in New Jersey was less than half the national average and at the time, the growth rate ranked the state 44th out of 50 states.\n\nIt is also very difficult to compare governors who served during different times, when the national economic climate may have been very different. The Washington Post compiled a nifty analysis measuring the performance of the governors running for president on a slew of economic indicators, and attempting to account for some of the different economic conditions at the time.\n\nCorrection, Feb. 18: We gave the wrong party affiliation for former Sen. Jeff Bingaman in the original version of this story. He is a Democrat.
