Charles Krauthammer predicted Wednesday on "Special Report with Bret Baier" that "all hell's going to break loose" if the administration can't fix the problems with the Healthcare.gov website by mid-March.

"Right now the insurers are guessing at the subsidy, so all of this is on the honor system and it can be wildly off," Krauthammer, a syndicated columnist and Fox News contributor said. "If they undershoot, the insurers are going to go bust. If they overshoot, the government is going to be stuck with a huge bill."

Krauthammer said it is clear "no one knows what's going on" as communication between the administration and insurance companies suffers due to the faulty ObamaCare sign-up website.

"You've got a train wreck coming," he said. "I think it's going to come out slowly, it's not all going to happen in one day, but I think they're in deep trouble and the deadline is mid-March. If they don't have this in place in mid-March, then there's going to be- all hell's going to break loose on this."
