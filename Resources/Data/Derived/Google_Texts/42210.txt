Rapid City, SD

About 350 airmen from Ellsworth Air Force Base are heading to Afghanistan for another round of deployment.



The group from the 28th Bomb Wing replaces 350 airmen of the 7th Bomb Wing based at Dyess Air Force Base, which is Ellsworth's sister base in Texas.



Lt. Col. Seth Graham, commander of the 34th Bomb Squadron, says that the group includes airmen who have been in the Air Force for a matter of months and others who have been deployed up to eight times.



The airmen fly B-1 bombers that are used to attack targets at the request of U.S. troops on the ground.
