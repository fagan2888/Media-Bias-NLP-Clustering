The goal is for changes in the patient\u2019s condition to be spotted earlier and addressed sooner, particularly for conditions such as pneumonia, COPD and heart disease.

Decisive Health is focusing on a handful of conditions.

Its platform compares each person\u2019s performance to their peers and identifies areas where each physician needs to improve.

The platform can also be used to recruit and contact study participants.

It sees its approach as a cheap way to best address the soaring population of Baby Boomers of retirement age and the increased demand for long-term caregivers for seniors with chronic conditions. Its app for caregivers, PulseBeat, aggregates data from these wearable devices and biosensors and transmits the data to them. The app can send texts and email alerts on the caregiver-facing website. Founded by Dr. Omar Metwally and Youssif Abdulhamid.\n\nRubiconMD: This healthcare startup thinks too many people are being referred to specialists needlessly. It wants to establish a more effective way of communicating between primary care physicians and specialists, presumably.
