Colorado\u2019s all-star shortstop was given a built-in day off for Sunday\u2019s Chicago Cubs-Rockies rubber game at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cLooking at the big picture, I targeted this day for Tulo. It just makes sense,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nTulowitzki is coming back from surgery to repair a hip labrum that ended his 2014 season after just 91 games. He rebounded ahead of schedule in spring training and is playing at 100 percent, he said.\n\nBut Weiss wants to angle Tulowitzki toward the big picture, trying to maximize his output over the full season.\n\n\u201cA lot of his off days are going to be built into the schedule,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cDay game after a night game \u2014 that\u2019s one scenario. This was a day I targeted for him.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki, though, was needed in the ninth inning. He pinch hit in the pitcher\u2019s spot and struck out against Chicago\u2019s Hector Rondon.\n\nTulowitzki will probably be back in the lineup Monday for a day game at San Francisco.\n\nOberg\u2019s chance. Scott Oberg, a 15th-round draft pick by the Rockies in 2012, made a surprising spring surge toward breaking camp on the big-league roster.\n\nHe missed out on opening day. But he\u2019ll quickly get a chance. Oberg was called up to replace John Axford, who went on family leave to care for his son.\n\n\u201cGreat makeup with this kid,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cPlus stuff. Mid-90s with a good breaking ball. Great competitor. A lot of poise.\u201d\n\nOberg was edged by Brooks Brown and Rafael Betancourt for the final spots in the bullpen out of spring.\n\nMcKenry starts at catcher. Michael McKenry started behind the plate for the first time this season in place of Nick Hundley. Weiss had planned to play him earlier, but Hundley was on a roll.\n\n\u201cThings had gone so well, I didn\u2019t want to disrupt anything,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cMac will play more than once a week.\u201d Nick Groke, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Troy Tulowitzki misses a start as first rest day of season", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Troy Tulowitzki misses a start as first rest day of season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/12/rockies-troy-tulowitzki-misses-a-start-as-first-rest-day-of-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150412_094432_troy-tulowitzki-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150412_094432_troy-tulowitzki-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-12T21:46:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T10:12:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDay game after a night game \u2014 that\u2019s one scenario.\n\u201cA lot of his off days are going to be built into the schedule,\u201d Weiss said.\nTulowitzki will probably be back in the lineup Monday for a day game at San Francisco.\nTroy Tulowitzki entered Sunday on a hitting tear to start the season, sporting a .409 average with six doubles in five games.\nBut Weiss wants to angle Tulowitzki toward the big picture, trying to maximize his output over the full season."}
