It is scheduled to face a third and final reading next week before heading to the House, where it faces significant opposition in the Democrat-controlled chamber.\n\nHouse Speaker Dickey Lee Hullinghorst, D-Boulder, declined to speak about the bill Friday but told reporters in January that she had serious reservations about it.\n\nSenate Republicans on Friday lauded the measure, which would make mediation or arbitration the preferred method of dispute resolution in construction-defects cases while barring homeowner associations from changing the project\u2019s declarations to open up the possibility of a lawsuit. It also would require that a majority of all homeowners in a condo or homeowners association approve legal action before it is taken.\n\nProponents have touted the bill as a necessary step toward helping people, especially young families, afford a home in one of the nation\u2019s tightest housing markets.\n\nCurrent law, they say, makes it too easy for homeowners to sue over construction problems, like sinking foundations or interior mold, driving up insurance and other costs for builders. That in turn, they say, has dried up the condo market, which claims nowhere near the share of housing starts in Colorado as it did a decade ago.\n\nSen. Tim Neville, R-Littleton, ticked off a lengthy list of cities and counties in the metro area where no condo projects are underway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence here folks \u2014 the costs are prohibitive,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill would help reverse that trend, Neville said.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Jessie Ulibarri, who co-sponsored the bill, said the housing supply has become so tight that a rental unit next to a refinery in Commerce City listed on Craigslist at $1,400 a month.\n\nSenate Bill 177, he said, will act as a \u201cpressure valve\u201d helping reduce the upward push on rental rates and home prices.\n\nBut most other Democrats weren\u2019t buying the affordable-housing assertion. Sen. Rollie Heath, who represents a district covering Boulder, said the bill effectively shifts the risk of faulty construction from the builder to the homeowner \u2014 or to \u201cthose who are least able to afford it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the bill is about getting people into their first house,\u201d Heath said. \u201cAs an affordable-housing bill, I have to say, this bill does not get us there.\u201d\n\nSen. Linda Newell, D-Littleton, said she thought highly of mediation as a dispute resolution method but objected to Senate Bill 177\u2019s provision that homeowners can\u2019t change their condo declarations, which are typically written by builders at the time of construction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable,\u201d she said.\n\nTodd Weiss, who lives in a Douglas County condo that was beset with defects, condemned the bill as one that would strip from homeowners any \u201ccredible recourse\u201d to get builders to fix their mistakes.\n\n\u201cWe had to quickly mobilize to have the residents in our community change our builder-written governing declarations before we could move forward with holding the builder responsible for the expensive construction defects they left us with when we bought our homes,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or twitter.com/abuvthefold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Construction-defects bill gets green light in Colorado Senate", "title": "Construction-defects bill gets green light in Colorado Senate", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/10/construction-defects-bill-gets-green-light-in-colorado-senate/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150211__senatejpgp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150211__senatejpgp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-10T15:28:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T06:25:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Senate passed the measure, Senate Bill 177, on a voice vote with Republicans in the majority.\nSenate Bill 177, he said, will act as a \u201cpressure valve\u201d helping reduce the upward push on rental rates and home prices.\nThe Colorado Senate on Friday gave preliminary approval to a bill that makes changes to Colorado\u2019s controversial construction-defects law \u2014 changes that proponents say will reinvigorate the moribund condominium construction market.\nIt also would require that a majority of all homeowners in a condo or homeowners association approve legal action before it is taken.\nHouse Speaker Dickey Lee Hullinghorst, D-Boulder, declined to speak about the bill Friday but told reporters in January that she had serious reservations about it."}
