Billups has not yet announced his retirement as a player. He has indicated in the past he would like to be an NBA executive once his playing days are over.\n\nBillups, however, still might have options on the court.\n\nHe\u2019s an unrestricted free agent, and with the LeBron James decision out of the way, players will start signing quickly across the league. Once that signing flurry is over, Billups should have a much clearer indication of teams that might be interested in adding a veteran leader such as himself. So, playing one more season isn\u2019t out of the question.\n\nFor a team to sign him he\u2019ll have to prove he\u2019s healthy. Billups has missed the majority of each of the past three seasons with various injuries. He\u2019s said in numerous interviews that he\u2019s got nothing left to prove on the court, but wouldn\u2019t mind attaching himself to a winning team for one more title run. And, he\u2019d like to leave the NBA on his own terms.\n\nWhenever he\u2019s done as a player, he\u2019s expected to transition right into his next career as an executive.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chauncey Billups visits Nuggets executives as he ponders next career move", "title": "Chauncey Billups visits Nuggets executives as he ponders next career move", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/11/chauncey-billups-visits-nuggets-executives-as-he-ponders-next-career-move/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140418__chauncey-billups-nuggets-041814p1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140418__chauncey-billups-nuggets-041814p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-11T15:01:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:38:04+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Whenever he\u2019s done as a player, he\u2019s expected to transition right into his next career as an executive.\nWith his next career move up in the air, former Nuggets guard Chauncey Billups recently visited Nuggets president Josh Kroenke and general manager Tim Connelly at the Pepsi Center.\nFor a team to sign him he\u2019ll have to prove he\u2019s healthy.\nHe has indicated in the past he would like to be an NBA executive once his playing days are over.\nWith Billups\u2019 recent release from the Detroit Pistons and a 17-year playing career winding down, it would not be a surprise if the Nuggets broached the subject of him joining the team\u2019s front office at some point in the future."}
