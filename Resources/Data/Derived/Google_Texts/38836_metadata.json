Perez said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job, and it will be your job, to make sure that people get a fair shake. That is why I am so excited to see so many public health and law students in the room today. There is work to be done.\u201d\n\nSara Rosenbaum, founding chair of the Milken Institute SPH Department of Health Policy, organized the visit. Dr. Rosenbaum previously had worked with Mr. Perez when he headed the Office for Civil Rights within the United States Department of Health and Human Services and made community integration for Medicaid beneficiaries with disabilities a top civil rights priority in the wake of a landmark United States Supreme Court decision.\n\nMr. Perez\u2019s address to students touched on the success and future of the ACA, the need for a new \u201csocial compact\u201d between employers and their workers and a call to graduates to tackle issues of equality and access to healthcare.\n\nThe legacy of the ACA\n\nAccording to Mr. Perez, a partisan-backed marketing campaign has worked to cast the ACA as a \u201cjob killer\u201d that infringes on the private health care insurance industry, but in reality the bill has created 14.5 million jobs.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t understand why so many folks want to make it so hard for people to get healthy and become taxpayers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Secretary said that the \u201cuntold story\u201d of the ACA, includes decreasing health care costs and coverage for at-risk populations, including African Americans, Latinos and low-income Americans.\n\nFor example, Mr. Perez told the story of Ward, a man suffering with hepatitis B. Ward\u2019s condition went untreated because his employer didn\u2019t provide healthcare and he couldn\u2019t afford independent coverage. Subsequently, he lost his job.\n\nOn March 1, 2015, Ward signed up for the ACA health exchange at a rate of $45 per month and by March 15, he had received a liver transplant.\n\n\u201cAs more and more people get coverage, the ACA will no longer be an abstract construct,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be an undeniable record that more people are receiving the care they need.\u201d\n\nHowever, the bill is not without its flaws, he stated, noting that it will be important to revisit the ACA and address areas that need improvement.\n\n\u201cI remember working on a hate crimes bill in 1996, and it was much less complicated, but even with that bill we had to go back and change a few things to make them more clear,\u201d Mr. Perez said. \u201cWe need to do the same with the ACA.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018social compact 2.0\u2019\n\nMr. Perez called the ACA the \u201cgreatest addition to the social compact since Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d He explained the \u201csocial compact 2.0\u201d as an insurance of equal protections and care for workers in a flexible economy.\n\nFor example, he cited the booming \u201csharing economy,\u201d dominated by high growth startups such as Uber Inc. as proof that workers are trending toward more flexible work schedules. He added that recent cases in which customers with disabilities were denied access to Uber\u2019s services, show that these companies need to practice \u201cinclusive innovation.\u201d\n\n\u201cInnovation that excludes people is problematic, and I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m ready to call it innovation until they can make it work for everyone: their workers and every customer, including those with disabilities,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Perez added that equality is needed across the board for workers in terms of equal access and protection under the law, which requires action at every level of government.\n\nFor example, he said, the question of raising the minimum wage should not be a question. Since 1938 every U.S. president except two\u2014Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan\u2014has raised the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cYou try living a week on seven and a quarter per hour and trying to feed your family,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nA call to graduates\n\nMr. Perez closed by challenging graduates to use their skills to help those who need it, no matter how long it takes.\n\nHe recounted a 2014 announcement of a law mandating a reduction in coal miners\u2019 exposure to coal dust. He said that the rule was first proposed in 2010 but seeded by the work of famed Labor Secretary Frances Perkins\u2014whom he referred to as the \u201cgold standard of labor secretaries.\u201d Ms. Perkins was the first woman appointed to a presidential cabinet and a key advisor to the president during the Great Depression.\n\n\u201cIt was a long time coming,\u201d Perez said. \u201cBut what I remember about that day was the clicking sound of the oxygen tanks of coal miners in the audience who had suffered from exposure. I challenge you all to measure your success by your ability to help others.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "George washington university, gwu, gw, gw university, george washington, dc universities, dc colleges, education, higher education", "MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "article_summary": "By Brittney DunkinsLabor Secretary Tom Perez offered a bright jobs outlook earlier this month to George Washington University students at the Milken Institute School of Public Health.\nThat is why I am so excited to see so many public health and law students in the room today.\nThe Secretary said that the \u201cuntold story\u201d of the ACA, includes decreasing health care costs and coverage for at-risk populations, including African Americans, Latinos and low-income Americans.\nThere is work to be done.\u201dSara Rosenbaum, founding chair of the Milken Institute SPH Department of Health Policy, organized the visit.\nOn March 1, 2015, Ward signed up for the ACA health exchange at a rate of $45 per month and by March 15, he had received a liver transplant."}
