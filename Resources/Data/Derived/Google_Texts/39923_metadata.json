Identifying and getting information about advisors is difficult.\n\n\u201cThere is no one place Americans overseas can look. There is word of mouth, some of the American Embassies maintain lists and that\u2019s about it. The ACA Tax Preparer Directory fills this void and gives Americans the resources they need to stay tax compliant,\u2019 said Marylouise Serrato, ACA executive director.\n\nThe ACA Directory explains to taxpayers who can be a tax return preparer and the rules that apply. It lists 1,700 preparers and is free.\n\nFigures show that the number of Americans living abroad increased from 70,000 in 1966 to between three million and four million in 1996 and more than seven million today, according to several estimates.\n\nThere are many reasons Americans have moved, including the globalization of the economy and increased cross-border migration generally, yet the US is the only developed country in the world that requires citizens who live abroad to file tax returns.\n\nThe FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Report) requires holders of foreign financial accounts to report detailed information about all such accounts each year. It can take many days to obtain and compile the information and then prepare the form.\n\nThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2010 has made it even more complex. FATCA compliance costs for foreign banks are so high that many banks have closed the accounts of Americans living abroad.\n\nIt is estimated that around 3,000 US expats have given up their citizenship due to the tax system. Prior to the changes, it was only a few hundred a year.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "america,american expats,income taxes,policy changes,united states,expat banking and finance", "robots": "noodp, noydir", "description": "The 2015 tax filing season for US citizens may be one of the most complex ever and expats are being urged to plan ahead."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5bff\"", "article_summary": "The ACA Directory explains to taxpayers who can be a tax return preparer and the rules that apply.\nThe American Citizens Abroad group has launched a Tax Return Preparer Directory specifically aimed at helping Americans living overseas navigate the complicated system and ensure tax compliance.\nAmericans abroad need a comprehensive, reliable source for finding return preparers and similar professional advisors.\nFATCA compliance costs for foreign banks are so high that many banks have closed the accounts of Americans living abroad.\nFor them, filing a tax return has been made more complicated by increased IRS and Department of Justice enforcement activities and the implementation of FATCA by foreign financial institutions around the world."}
