His comments that gun violence was a public health concern raised the ire of the gun lobby and conservative lawmakers despite the fact that every major medical association \u2014 and several former Surgeons General under Republican presidents \u2014 shared the same view.\n\nTodd questioned the wisdom of giving the NRA any kind of influence over the country\u2019s top public health position, but Blunt rejected the notion that the NRA played any role in Murthy\u2019s confirmation. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s why, you\u2019d have to ask Senator Reid why he hasn\u2019t move that to the top of his list to be confirmed.\u201d\n\nAfter the NRA began publicly opposing Murthy\u2019s nomination, several of Blunt\u2019s Republican colleagues including Rand Paul, John Cornyn and John Barrasso said they too would move to block Murthy\u2019s nomination, and Paul placed a hold on the nomination.\n\nLawmakers and health experts have expressed concern over the lack of a Surgeon General to craft a unified response to the ebola diagnoses, leading to confusion that has helped fuel public fear of the virus, fear that is largely unfounded.\n\nBlunt told Todd that he thinks we need a surgeon general. But asked if he would vote for Murthy\u2019s confirmation, Blunt again refused to answer the question and blamed the administration.\n\n\u201cUntil this came up, frankly I\u2019ve heard very little discussion about the Surgeon General,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "He dismissed questions about whether the NRA should have been given any influence over top public health position.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "He dismissed questions about whether the NRA should have been given any influence over top public health position.", "title": "After Blocking Surgeon General Nominee, Republican Blames Obama For Surgeon General Vacancy", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/19/3581649/republican-blames-obama-for-surgeon-general-vacancy-after-republicans-blocked-surgeon-general-nominee/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP366810605879.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He dismissed questions about whether the NRA should have been given any influence over top public health position.", "title": "After Blocking Surgeon General Nominee, Republican Blames Obama For Surgeon General Vacancy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP366810605879-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@AdamReports", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP366810605879.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP366810605879.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-19T12:55:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee1f\"", "article_summary": "Health After Blocking Surgeon General Nominee, Republican Blames Obama For Surgeon General Vacancy CREDIT: APIt has been nearly a year since Vivek Murthy was nominated by President Obama to serve as the next Surgeon General, but thanks in large part to the gun lobby and their Republican allies in the Senate, there has yet to be any movement on his confirmation.\n\u201cUntil this came up, frankly I\u2019ve heard very little discussion about the Surgeon General,\u201d he said.\nBlunt told Todd that he thinks we need a surgeon general.\nBut asked if he would vote for Murthy\u2019s confirmation, Blunt again refused to answer the question and blamed the administration.\nEarlier this year, the NRA launched a campaign to derail Murthy\u2019s nomination because he voiced support for expanding background checks for gun purchases."}
