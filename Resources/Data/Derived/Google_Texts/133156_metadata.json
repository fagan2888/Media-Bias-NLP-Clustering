She answered, \u201cI would say several things. First, China has made a bargain with their people. Their people have accepted a repressive, totalitarian regime in exchange for economic growth, and so China\u2019s ability to keep growing is at the core of their power. I would say first that we are going to be more aggressive in helping our allies in that region push back against new Chinese aggression, whether those allies are Australia, or Japan, or the Philippines. I would be conducting actually now, at a moment when China\u2019s economy is wavering a bit, I would be conducting more flyovers on the South China Sea. We cannot permit China to control a trade route through which passes $5 trillion worth of goods and services every year. And finally, I would say that Chinese cyberattacks are an act of aggression on the United States, and they must stop. It is also true that our government has to be more competent about detecting and repelling those attacks.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carly Fiorina said under her the US would be \"more aggressive in helping our allies in that region push back against new Chinese aggression\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Carly Fiorina said under her the US would be \"more aggressive in helping our allies in that region push back against new Chinese aggression\"", "title": "Fiorina: I Would Be 'More Aggressive' In Helping Allies Push Back Against China - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Fiorina-812-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/12/fiorina-i-would-be-more-aggressive-in-helping-allies-push-back-against-china/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carly Fiorina said under her the US would be \"more aggressive in helping our allies in that region push back against new Chinese aggression\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Fiorina-812-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Fiorina: I Would Be 'More Aggressive' In Helping Allies Push Back Against China - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Carly Fiorina, China, South China Sea,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Fiorina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "South China Sea", "published_time": "2015-08-12T07:10:10-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I would say first that we are going to be more aggressive in helping our allies in that region push back against new Chinese aggression, whether those allies are Australia, or Japan, or the Philippines.\nWe cannot permit China to control a trade route through which passes $5 trillion worth of goods and services every year.\nAnd finally, I would say that Chinese cyberattacks are an act of aggression on the United States, and they must stop.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina said if she became president the US would be \u201d more aggressive in helping our allies in that region push back against new Chinese aggression\u201d on Wednesday\u2019s broadcast of \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFiorina was asked what she would say to China\u2019s president when he visits the White House.\nI would be conducting actually now, at a moment when China\u2019s economy is wavering a bit, I would be conducting more flyovers on the South China Sea."}
