Watch out. The penalty you'll end up paying on your tax return is going up. Dramatically.\n\nUnder health reform, if you lack minimal essential coverage (such as an employer plan) and you don't qualify for one of nine exemptions, you need to get health insurance. Otherwise, you face an annual penalty that the feds call the \"individual shared responsibility payment.\"\n\nMany have seized upon the introductory penalty for singles \u2014 it was only $95 for all of 2014 \u2014 as reason to forgo coverage that will cost much more.\n\nBut it's not that simple, as Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center has pointed out, for a number of reasons.\n\nYour penalty in 2015 will be $325, possibly more. That's a 242 percent increase.\n\nIn fact, if you're single and make more than $26,550 this year, you'll owe more. And in future years, you'll owe considerably more, depending on your income.\n\nWhy? The Affordable Care Act says those who refuse coverage must pay either a flat fee for each uncovered family member or a percentage of excess income, whichever's higher. That's the key \u2014 whichever amount is greater determines the fee you pay.\n\nThe flat fees are deceivingly low. For 2015, it's $325 per adult dependent and $163 per child. This flat fee, regardless of household size, can't be more than $975 per household.\n\n\"Except it can,\" Williams writes.\n\nThat's right. The flat-fee cap means nothing if you've got what the government calls \"excess income.\"\n\nWhat's \"excess income\"?\n\nExcess income is the amount of your household's modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) that exceeds the filing threshold \u2014 the point at which you're required to file a tax return.\n\nFor a single taxpayer in 2015, that filing threshold is $10,300. For a married couple, it's $20,600.\n\nNow, what's your MAGI, in this case? It's basically your adjusted gross income (the last figure at the bottom of the front page of Form 1040 or Line 4 on Form 1040EZ) plus any tax-exempt interest, foreign income and all the MAGI of the dependents you claim.\n\nIf you don't have any tax-exempt muni bonds (Line 8b, Form 1040), untaxed Social Security income (Line 20a minus 20b on Form 1040 EZ) or foreign earnings (Form 2555), you can safely assume your MAGI is your AGI.\n\nRepeat after me: Your Maggie is usually your Aggie, unless you have muni bond income or earnings from abroad.\n\nPause a moment to be mindful and breathe. Allow resentment against the tax code to drift out of your body.\n\nOnce you've figured your excess income amount, you multiply it by an income percentage set by the law. In 2015, that amount is 2 percent. Next year, it will be 2.5 percent.\n\nDo the math and you'll see that any single person under age 65 making more than $26,550 this year will likely owe more than $325. Any couple making more than $53,100 will likely owe more than $650.\n\nFor example, a single person with a MAGI of $40,000 and no dependents will owe a penalty of $594, according to the IRS' online calculator.\n\nIs the penalty capped?\n\nYes, at the cost of the premium for the national average bronze plan. In 2015, that's $2,484 per year per uncovered family member. The maximum penalty is $12,420 per year for a family of five or more uncovered dependents. A single adult would have to make $134,500 to reach that cap. A couple would have to make $269,000.\n\nCan it be reduced?\n\nYes. The penalty is pro-rated if you got insurance part of the year. If you were uninsured for five months out of the year, then your $594 penalty would be five-twelfths of that, or about $247.50.\n\nAlso, you likely won't pay a penalty if you were uninsured for less than three months. And if you can't find health insurance that costs less than 8 percent of your income, you'll probably be exempt from the penalty.\n\nWill the penalty change?\n\nThe penalty will go up substantially again in 2016. The flat fee hits $695 per adult dependent, $347.50 per child, with a household cap of $2,085. After that, the Internal Revenue Service will adjust the flat penalties each year for increases in cost of living.\n\nThe excess income penalty also increases. In 2015, it goes up to 2 percent of income above the filing threshold. In 2016 it'll be 2.5 percent.\n\nSo next year the person earning $40,000 could owe about $736, according to the Tax Policy Center's online calculator.\n\nA couple making $120,000 in 2014 might have paid a penalty of only $997 in 2014. But they'll pay around $1,988 this year and around $2,475 in 2016.\n\nThis is still lower than $5,000, which is about annual premium for the national average bronze health plan for a two-person family. But at least you're getting insurance for that.\n\nSo, if you think the penalty for not getting insurance is only $95, think again. And brace for a higher penalty next year.\n\nIs there a calculator I can use?\n\nThe IRS now has an online calculator at ww.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/estimator/isrp/\n\nWilliams' Tax Policy Center also offers a calculator at http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/acacalculator.cfm\n\n***\n\nBrent Hunsberger is an investment adviser representative and certified financial planner in Portland.
