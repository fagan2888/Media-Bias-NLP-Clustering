In fact, the need for Republicans to keep control of Congress may be an obstacle the party\u2019s presidential nominee cannot overcome. Former Republican House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has complained that his party has been very unrealistic in its expectations of what it could accomplish, legislatively, with just control of Congress, given the president\u2019s veto power. Overriding a veto would require a larger majority than Republicans have in either the House of Representatives or Senate, even without the filibuster. Latest from Politics White People vs. White Privilege For the past five years, the Republicans\u2019 strategy appears to have been to back the president into a corner when must-pass legislation comes up. They have repeatedly threatened to default on the national debt and shut down the entire government to get their way. But even many Republicans in Congress have balked at such nuclear options, and anyway it hasn\u2019t worked: They have failed to achieve cherished Republican goals, such as repealing the Affordable Care Act. Nevertheless, control of Congress is extremely valuable to certain Republican constituencies even without the White House. The ideologically committed are satisfied that a Republican Congress at least keeps President Obama from doing further harm to the country and that incremental progress has been achieved in some areas, such as reducing the federal budget deficit. Moreover, lobbyists are often successful in getting their way on appropriations bills, where the composition of spending is as important as the amount. Indeed, from the point of view of most lobbyists, control of Congress is far more valuable than control of the White House.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t always the case. Before the Budget Act of 1974, the administration\u2019s hand was much stronger and getting a spending priority into the president\u2019s budget was essential to enactment. The president also had de facto line-item veto power by being able to \u201cimpound\u201d spending he didn\u2019t support. Since that time, power over the budget has gradually shifted from the White House to Congress. Given that Republicans have very little they want government to do, many are quite content with gridlock. Others have na\u00efve expectations about retaking the White House. I have heard any number of high-ranking Republicans say that neither party can hold the presidency for more than eight years; therefore, the GOP is virtually a lock to retake the White House next year. Moreover, few Republicans respect likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton as a candidate, and many think she will be easy to beat on issues like Benghazi. Republican members of Congress also know too well that any hint of cooperation with Democrats can whip the party\u2019s conservative base into a frenzy that it can deny the party\u2019s nomination to even its most senior members, such as Cantor. The belief that he was not strong enough in pressing the Republican agenda also led to the recent resignation of John Boehner. But there are some things only a president can do. Only the president can nominate federal judges and members of the Supreme Court. The Senate may fail to confirm them, but in the end, senators may only select from among the president\u2019s choices. And the president\u2019s power in foreign affairs and national security is overwhelming. As time goes by, the pressure to control the White House becomes critical, and parties historically have been willing to do what had to be done to achieve it, even if it meant nominating a candidate frowned on by much of the party\u2019s base. This is true in both parties. In 1952, Republicans supported Dwight Eisenhower in large part simply because he was known to be highly electable, even though much of the base would have preferred Ohio Senator Robert Taft. In 1968, they again held their noses and supported Richard Nixon because of his perceived electability after the base\u2019s ideal candidate, Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, crashed and burned in 1964. In 1992, Democrats got behind Bill Clinton for the same reason despite misgivings about his ethics and lack of commitment to traditional liberalism.\n\nBecause the president represents the entire country, whereas members of Congress represent only particular states or discrete districts, the president will necessarily have a broader perspective than those of his party in Congress. Voters tend to be hostile to do-nothing presidents and reward those who get things done. But Republican primary voters may prefer a do-nothing representative who votes no on virtually everything. Thus, there is inherent institutional conflict between Republican presidents and members of their party in Congress. This is less the case for Democrats. Even the most extreme, unelectable candidates can remain competitive long past the point where they would have been forced out in the past. As a congressional staff member during the Reagan administration, I saw on a day-to-day basis the tension between the White House and congressional Republicans, who were often frustrated by Reagan\u2019s willingness to compromise and support measures contrary to conservative dogma, such as raising taxes or giving amnesty to illegal aliens. But White House lobbying, favors, and presidential leadership usually overcame their resistance. Such institutional conflict between the president and Congress was baked in the cake by the Founding Fathers, who explicitly rejected a parliamentary system. But sometimes it creates perverse incentives for members of Congress when continued party control of that body conflicts with what their presidential nominee must do to get elected. I have never seen a member of Congress actively sabotage his party\u2019s nominee, but I have seen many who avoided association with him lest they alienate their core constituency: primary voters. For some years, various trends have diluted the ability of parties to exercise control and unify candidates from the top down. So-called super PACs, often backed by billionaires, mean that parties cannot do today what they used to do in the past and cut off money to those who refuse to be team players. Meanwhile the disintegration of the mainstream media and rise of alternative communications means that even the most extreme, unelectable candidates can remain competitive long past the point where they would have been forced out in the past.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP leaders must face down their primary voters before their party can capture the presidency\u2014and show little appetite for the task.", "author": "Bruce Bartlett", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "GOP leaders must face down their primary voters before their party can capture the presidency\u2014and show little appetite for the task.", "title": "Are Congressional Republicans Ready to Retake the White House?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/12/AP_603776782435/facebook.jpg?1450190642", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/are-congressional-republicans-ready-to-retake-the-white-house/420507/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, from the point of view of most lobbyists, control of Congress is far more valuable than control of the White House.\nSince that time, power over the budget has gradually shifted from the White House to Congress.\nIn fact, the need for Republicans to keep control of Congress may be an obstacle the party\u2019s presidential nominee cannot overcome.\nNevertheless, control of Congress is extremely valuable to certain Republican constituencies even without the White House.\nBut White House lobbying, favors, and presidential leadership usually overcame their resistance."}
