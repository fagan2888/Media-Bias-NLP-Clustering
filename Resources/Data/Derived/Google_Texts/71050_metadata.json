It\u2019s time for real solutions.\u201d\n\nThe rains caused a 60-foot section of the wall to fall over after floodwaters backed up on one side, he said.\n\nAfter previous flooding, authorities cut holes in a number of places in the border fence in Arizona. But the gates in Nogales were apparently closed during the recent storm.\n\nAuthorities have also regularly had to defend against smugglers who have found ways to circumvent or defeat the fences \u2014 including building ramps over it, tunneling under it or, in the case of this weekend, cutting a hole in it.\n\nThe Nogales International reported that when built, the 2.8-mile section of fencing through town was supposed to be tougher to cut through than the previous version, taking 15 minutes for each tube.\n\n\u201cBy that math, if the person who cut the fence on Saturday were acting alone, the 16 total cuts would have taken about four hours to complete,\u201d the paper reported.\n\nThe border fence has been controversial for years. President Obama\u2019s 2006 vote in favor of it caused deep friction with immigrant-rights advocates, and opponents argued it was easily circumvented, and amounted to a waste of money.\n\nAbout 350 miles of the border have full fencing, and senators included money for an additional 350 miles of fencing in their broad immigration bill, which cleared that chamber last year but which has stalled in the House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A rainstorm knocked over part of the border fence in Arizona this weekend, even as smugglers were cutting their way through another part of the fence less than a few miles away \u2014 leaving a hole big enough to drive a vehicle through, according to the Nogales International.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A rainstorm knocked over part of the border fence in Arizona this weekend, even as smugglers were cutting their way through another part of the fence less than a few miles away \u2014 leaving a hole big enough to drive a vehicle through, according to the Nogales International.", "title": "Smugglers, rainstorm combine to poke holes in border fence", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/28/smugglers-rainstorm-combine-poke-holes-border-fenc/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/28/6d8839ab72ce351d5b0f6a706700b9bd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/28/6d8839ab72ce351d5b0f6a706700b9bd.jpg", "title": "Smugglers, rainstorm combine to poke holes in border fence", "description": "A rainstorm knocked over part of the border fence in Arizona this weekend, even as smugglers were cutting their way through another part of the fence less than a few miles away \u2014 leaving a hole big en", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3aa8\"", "article_summary": "After previous flooding, authorities cut holes in a number of places in the border fence in Arizona.\nThe border fence has been controversial for years.\n\u201cBorder walls obviously aren\u2019t working,\u201d said Dan Millis, borderlands program coordinator for the Grand Canyon Chapter of the Sierra Club.\nA rainstorm knocked over part of the border fence in Arizona this weekend, even as smugglers were cutting their way through another part of the fence less than a few miles away \u2014 leaving a hole big enough to drive a vehicle through, according to the Nogales International.\n\u201cBy that math, if the person who cut the fence on Saturday were acting alone, the 16 total cuts would have taken about four hours to complete,\u201d the paper reported."}
