Northglenn-based Pulse Beverage Corp, which produces Natural Cabana Lemonades, Limeades and Coconut Waters, announced Wednesday that it is expanding into Mexico.

The announcement comes on the heels of an announcement Saturday in which Pulse Beverage said it is partnering with Smashburger to provide Pulse’s Natural Cabana Lemonade at all U.S. Smashburgers.

Pulse said that based on the success of its Natural Cabana Coconut Water in the United States, and the lack of premium, reasonably priced coconut water in Mexico, it will be offering its Natural Cabana Coconut Water in both natural and pineapple varieties in Mexico.

In the announcement Saturday, Pulse said that because of the collaboration with Smashburger, Smashburger will be one of Pulse’s top food service accounts.

The Natural Cabana Lemonade will be delivered to the 265 Smashburger locations through SYSCO and The Sygma Network.

As far as Mexico, Pulse said its expansion there will be headed by Carlos Villarreal and his team, known as Borrega Consulting Inc. Borrega is a San Diego-based international business development consulting and brokerage firm with experience in Latin American business development.

Pulse said it will aggressively seek accounts in Mexico with Wal-Mart, Costco and Soriana and convenience stores such as OXXO and 7-Eleven.

In the past couple of years, Pulse has been aggressively expanding.

In June 2013, the company announced that its Natural Cabana Lemonade would be carried in Sprouts Farmers Market, a chain of nearly 150 stores with locations in seven states.

And in April 2012, it announced that it had begun production of Cabana 100 percent Natural Lemonade at its Eastern based co-packer, Castle Co-Packers, near Pittsburgh.

Pulse was formed to develop and market into niche segments of the beverage industry and markets non-alcoholic water-based drinks that it says are health for consumers.
