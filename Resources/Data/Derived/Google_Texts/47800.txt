Media Matters! is the story of truth titans David Brock and Eric Boehlert, the big boys at Media Matters for America. Theyâ€™re not happy with the right-wing New York Times and its mean, immoral coverage of Hillary Clinton, who has never done anything wrong. They have dedicated their lives to exposing this conspiracy. The dialogue in these comics consist (almost) entirely of direct quotes from the heroes themselves. For more comics, see here.
