Injuries remain a 100 percent certainty in the NFL. Who and when often determines a team\u2019s success. Denver enters Sunday\u2019s game with history working in their favor, yet concern exists.\n\nWhy?\n\nPeyton Manning is 39 in case you haven\u2019t noticed. He grinded through this week with a sore right foot and, as of Saturday, a rib injury. He will start. The challenge will be to finish. Emmanuel Sanders warmed up multiple times on Sunday, testing his sprained left ankle with short pass patterns, trying to impress the coaches enough to be active. It worked. He will play, but it bears watching how effective he can be. The Broncos might need receiver Bennie Fowler and the crew of tight ends to come through.\n\nThe Broncos already are without edge rusher DeMarcus Ware, who told me on Friday he\u2019s suffering from a structural issue in his back. He is likely to miss next Sunday\u2019s game at Chicago as well, though he hasn\u2019t ruled out playing. Pro Bowl cornerback Aqib Talib is out, suspended for one game for an eye gouge in the closing moments of the season\u2019s first loss at Indianapolis.\n\nAnd on to the keys to the game:\n\nTrust the defense\n\nThe Broncos defense played poorly last Sunday. They hit quarterback Andrew Luck 11 times, but produced only one sack. The Chiefs line is porous. The Chiefs are among the league\u2019s worst in sacks per pass attempt. Translation: the Broncos need Von Miller to get hot and for Shaquil Barrett and Shane Ray, even in limited snaps, to step up. Covering tight end Travis Kelce is the key. The Broncos have allowed only one touchdown to a receiver this season.\n\nHelp Manning make history\n\nManning needs three passing yards and a win to pass Brett Favre on both all-time lists. He will be appropriately honored when he breaks the former mark, with the game stopped for a minute as a video tribute airs. Manning owns the Chiefs. He\u2019s won nine straight against the Chiefs, the most by an opposing quarterback against them. Since joining Denver, Manning is 7-0 with 19 touchdown passes and four interceptions. For the trend to continue, he must rely on a Demaryius Thomas, his multiple tight ends and a better running game.\n\nStart fast\n\nThe Broncos have scored 19 first quarter points, third worst in the NFL. They have scored one first quarter touchdown. If they can find momentum, it bodes well. The Broncos have yet to lose a home game under Manning when leading at halftime.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Aqib Talib,DeMarcus Ware,Emmanuel Sanders,Peyton Manning,Vernon Davis", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Peyton Manning limps toward history as he deals with foot and rib injury.
