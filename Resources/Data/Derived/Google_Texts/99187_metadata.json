Scott Walker last week as he announced a plan to spend about $250 million in public money on a new arena for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks. The plan is the culmination of significant back and forth between the team's owners, Walker and the Republican-controlled Wisconsin legislature, who have all been wrangling for months over whether and how to finance a new home for a Bucks franchise that was supposedly ready to leave town if a deal didn't come together.\n\nWalker has staunchly defended the plan \u2013 the public cost of which some analysts peg as high as $320 million once interest and other payments are taken into account \u2013 telling ABC News' Jonathan Karl over the weekend, \"It's a good deal.\" Walker claimed the state would lose hundreds of millions of dollars \"if we did nothing, if we said, 'go on, move somewhere else.'\" The other 50 percent of the arena's funding will come from private sources, and the team has promised to cover any cost overruns.\n\nLiberals, predictably, criticized the proposal, particularly since it coincides with a Walker-spearheaded plan to cut $250 million from Wisconsin's public university budget. But Walker has been a target for the left since coming into office (for good reason, considering his intent on destroying its political influence). The difference this time is that he's also facing significant opposition from the right, where up until now he has been touted as one of, if not the most, desirable Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential race.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Economy]\n\nWalker's problems begin in the state legislature, as it's unclear whether there are sufficient votes to approve the arena money. \"I don't really have a handle yet on where the support is,\" said Wisconsin Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald last week. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, also a Republican, admitted in an interview that there will be a political price for lawmakers who support the deal.\n\nOther legislators haven't been quite so tepid in their criticism. \"I'm not a believer in government supporting sports arenas for millionaire players and billionaire owners,\" said state Republican Rep. David Murphy. \"This is a deal that needs to be vetted very well.\" Walker may have to plead with Democrats for votes if he's determined to get the plan through as is.\n\nA man with a plan. (Morry Gash/AP)\n\nBut it's among conservative interest groups and commentators where the most stringent opposition has arisen. Hot Air's Jazz Shaw called Walker's move \"one of the more curious choices in the history of presidential politics.\" The Cato Institute's David Boaz said Walker's arena stance means he \"shouldn't be anywhere near the federal Treasury.\" And David Fladeboe, Wisconsin state director of Americans for Prosperity, said in a statement, \"Government shouldn't be in the business of financing private sports stadiums. The current deal is based on fuzzy math, complicated accounting and millions of taxpayer dollars. \u2026 This proposal needs to be rejected and the people of Wisconsin need to be protected.\"\n\nThe last statement is the most interesting due to the group's connection to the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, right-wing activists who have pledged to spend nearly $900 million on the 2016 elections. They have been huge fans of Walker up to this point, spending big via their political networks and political action committee to support his campaign in 2010, and to back him during both his high-profile fight with public sector unions in 2011 and his ensuing recall election in 2012.\n\n\"He's an impressive guy and he's very courageous,\" David Koch has said of Walker. Earlier this year, he also hinted that Walker is the brothers' favored candidate in 2016.\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the 2016 Presidential Elections]\n\nWalker became a conservative darling and Koch favorite thanks to his big victory over Wisconsin's labor unions, which generated large protests in the Wisconsin capital to no avail, as well as his inclination toward large cuts in government spending. But that's not all: He has rejected money to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, signed a law turning Wisconsin into a so-called \"right to work\" state and has done his best to undermine a clean energy agenda.\n\nRachel Brody for USNWR\n\nThese accomplishments \u2013 which, love them or hate them, are many and significant \u2013 have put him at or near the top of a lot of 2016 polling, even without his officially declaring for the race. The Cook Political Report says that he is the current Republican frontrunner. Politico recently called him \" the man to beat\" in the important caucus state of Iowa.\n\nWhile today's poll numbers don't say much about who the nominee will ultimately be, they do matter in terms of fundraising and media coverage during the so-called \"invisible primary,\" the period before the official nomination battle begins during which candidates compete for money and endorsements. Among donors and key players, no candidate except for perhaps former Texas Gov. Rick Perry has as compelling a story to tell when it comes to substantive conservative governance as Walker, giving him a leg up with the conservative activists and donors who are key at this stage.\n\nSpending hundreds of millions of dollars in public money to help build an arena for a team owned by extremely wealthy hedge fund managers, though, doesn't fit with that pattern, and reeks of the sort of \"cronyism\" the tea party right claims to disdain. And if history is any guide, the deal will indeed turn out to be a bad one for Wisconsin, but a good one for the well-heeled men who own the Bucks.\n\nThe preponderance of economic research on the matter shows that sports arenas do not provide a good return on investment for taxpayers in terms of job creation, income or economic development; they certainly don't come close to producing the $3 return per $1 spent that Walker is touting.\n\n[SEE: Republican Party Cartoons]\n\nAs economists Victor Matheson and Robert Baade, two of the foremost experts on sports economics, have written, \"Evidence of significant direct economic benefits from sporting events, franchises, and stadiums is lacking \u2026 Voters and public officials should not be deluded by over-optimistic predictions of a financial windfall.\" When it comes to the NBA in particular, economists Dennis Coates and Brad Humphreys found that \"the departure of professional basketball from cities had no impact on their economies in the following years.\" Sports stadiums and events have been shown to make people happier, yes, but that happiness has a real price; every dollar spent on a stadium is a dollar that can't be spent providing other services to the population.\n\nThere's no reason to think an arena for the Bucks would be any different, notwithstanding Walker's claims to the contrary. In his case, the arena is also unlikely to be a good investment of political capital if he has to twist arms to get it passed over strident opposition from his own party.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "opinion/articles", "keyword": "The Report [News]", "title": "Scott Walker's NBA Arena Is a Problem for 2016", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Walker's plan to use public money on an NBA arena has earned him some unfamiliar enmity from the right.", "title": "Scott Walker's 2016 Air Ball", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/06/11/scott-walkers-nba-arena-is-a-problem-for-2016", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1d/cc/fb2ff9874e659091e308b1347238/150611reportgarofalo-editorial.garofalo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Walker's plan to use public money on an NBA arena has earned him some unfamiliar enmity from the right.", "card": "summary", "title": "Scott Walker's NBA Arena Is a Problem for 2016"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "thereport", "date_published": "June 11, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Pat Garofalo,picks,Walker, Scott,Wisconsin,2016 presidential election,Republican Party,primaries,sports,economy,economic growth,economics,The Report [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Walker's plan to use public money on an NBA arena has earned him some unfamiliar enmity from the right."}, "article_summary": "\"I don't really have a handle yet on where the support is,\" said Wisconsin Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald last week.\n\"I'm not a believer in government supporting sports arenas for millionaire players and billionaire owners,\" said state Republican Rep.
