Some of these changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act), the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and other legislation. These changes are applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014 , unless otherwise specified in this final rule. We also are updating the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014 .\n\nWe also are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implementing certain statutory changes to the LTCH PPS under the Affordable Care Act and the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. In addition, we discuss our proposals on the interruption of stay policy for LTCHs and on retiring the \"5 percent\" payment adjustment for co-located LTCHs. While many of the statutory mandates of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act apply to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014 , others will not begin to apply until 2016 and beyond.\n\nIn addition, we are making a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are establishing new requirements or revising requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs) that are participating in Medicare .\n\nWe are updating policies relating to the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. In addition, we are making technical corrections to the regulations governing provider administrative appeals and judicial review; updating the reasonable compensation equivalent (RCE) limits, and revising the methodology for determining such limits, for services furnished by physicians to certain teaching hospitals and hospitals excluded from the IPPS; making regulatory revisions to broaden the specified uses of Medicare Advantage (MA) risk adjustment data and to specify the conditions for release of such risk adjustment data to entities outside of CMS; and making changes to the enforcement procedures for organ transplant centers.\n\nWe are aligning the reporting and submission timelines for clinical quality measures for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) with the reporting and submission timelines for the Hospital IQR Program. In addition, we provide guidance and clarification of certain policies for eligible hospitals and CAHs such as our policy for reporting zero denominators on clinical quality measures and our policy for case threshold exemptions.\n\nIn this document, we are finalizing two interim final rules with comment period relating to criteria for disproportionate share hospital uncompensated care payments and extensions of temporary changes to the payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals and of the Medicare-Dependent, Small Rural Hospital (MDH) Program.\n\nDATES: Effective Date: These final rules are effective on October 1, 2014 .\n\nApplicability Dates: The amendments to 42 CFR 405.1811 and 405.1835 are applicable to appeals based on untimely contractor determinations that are pending or were filed on or after August 21, 2008 , subject to the rules of administrative finality and reopening at 42 CFR 405.1807 and 405.1885. The provisions discussed in section IV.I.4.c. of the preamble of this final rule are applicable on or after July 1, 2015 ; and the provisions discussed in section IV.I.5.a. of the preamble of this final rule are applicable on or after January 1, 2015 .\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, CONTACT:\n\nIng-Jye Cheng , (410) 786-4548 and Donald Thompson , (410) 786-4487, Operating Prospective Payment, MS-DRGs, Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAC), Wage Index, New Medical Service and Technology Add-On Payments, Hospital Geographic Reclassifications, Graduate Medical Education, Capital Prospective Payment, Excluded Hospitals, and Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) Issues.\n\nMichele Hudson , (410) 786-4487, and Judith Richter , (410) 786-2590, Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and MS-LTC-DRG Relative Weights Issues.\n\nSiddhartha Mazumdar , (410) 786-6673, Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program Issues.\n\nJames Poyer , (410) 786-2261, Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting and Hospital Value-Based Purchasing-- Program Administration , Validation, and Reconsideration Issues.\n\nPierre Yong , (410) 786-8896, Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting--Measures Issues Except Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Issues; and Readmission Measures for Hospitals Issues.\n\nElizabeth Goldstein , (410) 786-6665, Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting--Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems Measures Issues.\n\nMary Pratt , (410) 786-6867, LTCH Quality Data Reporting Issues.\n\nKim Spalding Bush , (410) 786-3232, Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Efficiency Measures Issues.\n\nJames Poyer , (410) 786-2261, PPS-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting Issues.\n\nKellie Shannon , (410) 786-0416, Administrative Appeals by Providers and Judicial Review Issues.\n\nAmelia Citerone , (410) 786-3901, and Robert Kuhl (410) 786-4597, Reasonable Compensation Equivalent (RCE) Limits for Physician Services Provided in Providers.\n\nAnne Calinger , (410) 786-3396, and Jennifer Harlow , (410) 786-4549, Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Data Issues.\n\nThomas Hamilton , (410) 786-6763, Organ Transplant Center Issues.\n\nJennifer Phillips , (410) 786-1023, 2-Midnight Rule Benchmark Issues.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This Federal Register document is also available from the Federal Register online database through Federal Digital System (FDsys), a service of the U.S. Government Printing Office .
