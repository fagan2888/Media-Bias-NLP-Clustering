Qatar’s energy minister said international oil prices have finally bottomed out and will recover next year.

Mohammed Al-Sada told Bloomberg News that crude oil supply in countries outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has dropped significantly this year, and will probably stay very low.

Al-Sada predicted that OPEC will produce 30.5 million barrels of oil per day on average next year, a slight increase over the 29.3 million he expects this year.

The current extraordinarily low oil prices “caused oil companies to reduce their capital expenditure by almost 20 percent this year from $650 billion in 2014,” he told Bloomberg.

“This trend of reducing investment in the oil industry could result in production shortfalls down the line.”

Oil prices in the international Brent crude benchmark have fallen by nearly half over the last year, and are now just above $50 a barrel.
