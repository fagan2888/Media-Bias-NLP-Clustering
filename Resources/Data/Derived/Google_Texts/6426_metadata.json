They forgot that he educated their kids, gave them healthcare, totally transformed the society.\"\n\nThe moderator gave Sanders an opportunity to disavow his past praise for Castro, but the Vermont senator declined to do so.\n\n\"What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong to try to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government,\" Sanders said.\n\nAsked whether he regretted praising Castro, Sanders, a self-termed democratic socialist, avoided the question and reiterated that the key question was whether or not the United States should be pushing for regime change in foreign countries.\n\n\"Cuba is, of course, an authoritarian, undemocratic country and I hope very much, as soon as possible, it becomes a democratic country,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"But on the other hand it would be wrong not to state that in Cuba they have made some good advances in healthcare, they are sending doctors all over the world.\n\n\"They have made some progress in education.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Clinton slammed Sanders for a 1985 interview in which he praised Fidel Castro.", "description": "Clinton slammed Sanders for a 1985 interview in which he praised Fidel Castro.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Clinton slammed Sanders for a 1985 interview in which he praised Fidel Castro.", "title": "Sanders defends past praise of Fidel Castro", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/272485-sanders-defends-past-praise-of-fidel-castro", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/sandersclintonsplit.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-10T07:22:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-10T07:22-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/272485-sanders-defends-past-praise-of-fidel-castro", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-09T23:15-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Evelyn Rupert", "author": "Jonathan Swan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-09T23:15:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-10T07:22:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/272485-sanders-defends-past-praise-of-fidel-castro", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Clinton slammed Sanders for a 1985 interview in which he praised Fidel Castro.", "card": "summary", "title": "Sanders defends past praise of Fidel Castro"}, "dcterms.title": "Sanders defends past praise of Fidel Castro"}, "article_summary": "The moderator gave Sanders an opportunity to disavow his past praise for Castro, but the Vermont senator declined to do so.\nClinton's remarks followed the debate moderators screening a 1985 video \u2013 first reported by Buzzfeed \u2013 of Sanders praising Castro.\n\"Everybody was totally convinced that Castro was the worst guy in the world,\" Sanders says in the archival video.\n\"What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong to try to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government,\" Sanders said.\nAsked whether he regretted praising Castro, Sanders, a self-termed democratic socialist, avoided the question and reiterated that the key question was whether or not the United States should be pushing for regime change in foreign countries."}
