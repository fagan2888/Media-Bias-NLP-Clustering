An Aurora man has been sentenced to 24 years in prison for being a pimp, including forcing a teen to have sex with nine men over the course of five days.

Carlos Lebron Stegall, 41, pleaded guilty in June to pimping and second-degree assault for causing serious injuries to a woman he pimped in 2012, according to a news release Thursday from the Arapahoe County District Attorney’s Office.

One of Stegall’s victims, a 17-year-old, was prostituted between Oct. 29 and Nov. 4, 2013 at a Motel 6 near the intersection of East Iliff Avenue and South Abilene Street, the news release said. The 17-year-old was paid for sex by nine johns.

An associate of Stegall’s had found the teenager on a website, the news release said. The girl’s father found sexualized pictures of her on her cell phone and called Aurora police.

The girl eventually told her father she had been forced into prostitution.

The nine johns who had sex with the 17-year-old face felony charges of patronizing and engaging in child prostitution.

The case was investigated by the Aurora Police Department and the Denver FBI’s Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force. Deputy District Attorney Anne Kelly prosecuted the case.
