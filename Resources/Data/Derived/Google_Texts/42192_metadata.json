S. Burke said in a news release.\n\nThe research team broke down overdose deaths in Pennsylvania from 1979 to 2014 by sex, age and race using the Mortality and Population Data System, a repository of detailed death data from the National Center for Health Statistics housed at Pitt Public Health.\n\n\"Pitt Public Health has the most comprehensive mortality database in the nation, which can be easily cross-referenced with U.S. Census data to shed light on myriad public health issues,\" Burke explained.\n\nAmong the team's report:\n\n\u2022 Pennsylvania ranks in the top 20 states for overdose mortality.\n\n\u2022 Overdose deaths were concentrated in southwestern Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia are and northeast Pennsylvania near Scranton.\n\n\u2022 35-to-44-year-olds had the greatest increase in overdose deaths rates, growing almost 22-fold since 1979, but 25-to-34-year-olds may be overtaking them, with the highest death rate in 2014 \u2014 40 deaths for every 100,000 people.\n\n\u2022 Accidental overdose rates are higher in men than in women, though women saw a more dramatic increase in recent years.\n\nCompounding matters, most women who enter substance abuse treatment programs also are responsible for children and tend to be more reliant on public insurance, the authors noted.\n\n\"Our county-level findings provide possible avenues for targeting interventions to areas and people with the highest drug overdose mortality,\" said co-author Jeanine M. Buchanich, deputy director of Pitt Public Health's Center for Occupational Biostatistics and Epidemiology. \"It also points to issues on the horizon that public health officials could prepare for \u2014 such as overdoses in younger age groups and rapid overdose increases in areas centered on smaller cities with fewer resources.\"\n\nThe overdose epidemic is already being felt in the Lehigh Valley.\n\nSo many people died of drug overdoses last year that Lehigh County Coroner Scott Grim had to request extra money to pay for all the autopsies. By the end of September, the coroner's office had performed 84 autopsies on overdose victims \u2014 the same number performed in all of the previous year. The dead ranged in age from 15 to 64.\n\nNorthampton County experienced an even greater surge in fatal drug overdoses, according to Coroner Zachary Lysek: 44 in the first three quarters of last year, 50 percent more than was recorded in all of the previous year. Fifteen were directly attributable to heroin; it's unclear how many others involved prescription opiates.\n\nNon-fatal overdoses are also a growing concern, according to a report published by the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council in January. It found hospitalizations for pain medication overdoses had quadrupled in the Lehigh Valley over the decade and a half ending in 2014, and that heroin overdose hospitalizations more than doubled.\n\nThe trend lines for Lehigh, Northampton, Berks, Schuylkill and Carbon counties mirrored those of Pennsylvania, where the biggest surge in overdose hospitalizations occurred in the vast rural parts of the state.\n\n\"These statewide and regional hospitalization findings stress the alarming impact this current drug problem is having on communities across the commonwealth,\" said Joe Martin, PHC4's executive director. \"Whether urban or rural, this issue is an equal opportunity offender.\"\n\nAs the devastation has mounted, public officials have grappled for ways to respond.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell announced the allocation of $1.8 million to expand substance abuse services at five health centers in Pennsylvania \u2014 though none is in the Lehigh Valley. The award is part of $94 million in Affordable Care Act funding for 271 health centers in 45 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\n\n\"The opioid epidemic is one of the most pressing public health issues in the United States today,\" Burwell said in a news release. \"Expanding access to medication-assisted treatment and integrating these services in health centers bolsters nationwide efforts to curb opioid misuse and abuse, supports approximately 124,000 new patients accessing substance use treatment for recovery and helps save lives.\"\n\nIn December, officers from 15 Lehigh County police departments were equipped with naloxone, an opiate antidote that can almost magically reverse heroin overdoses.\n\nThe naloxone program, funded by $17,000 from insurer Capital BlueCross and the Dorothy Rider Pool Health Care Trust and administered by the Lehigh County district attorney's office, provides each officer with a small kit that includes rubber gloves and two nasal atomizers. Naloxone is administered through the nose.\n\nAct 139, signed into law by Gov. Tom Corbett in 2014, gave first responders the green light to use naloxone. The act also allowed family members and friends of opiate addicts to buy naloxone, but only after securing a prescription from a doctor.\n\nTaking Act 139 a step further in October, Pennsylvania Physician General Rachel Levine, with Gov. Tom Wolf at her side, signed a statewide standing order for naloxone. Essentially, the standing order is a prescription that anyone can use to buy naloxone at any pharmacy that stocks it.\n\nskennedy@mcall.com\n\n610-820-6130", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "New University of Pittsburgh study shows Pennsylvania ranks in top 20 for overdose deaths", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "Pennsylvania has seen a 14-fold increase in drug overdose deaths over the last 35 years, with the death rate of relatively young white women climbing fastest, a new study has found.", "title": "New University of Pittsburgh study shows Pennsylvania ranks in top 20 for overdose deaths", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/local/mc-pa-drug-overdoses-surge-20160310-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56e1ecc7/turbine/mc-pa-drug-overdoses-surge-20160310", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp06.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Pennsylvania, Drug, heroin, overdose, deaths, University of Pittsburgh study", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/86176879", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-03-11", "Description": "Pennsylvania has seen a 14-fold increase in drug overdose deaths over last 35 years", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Pennsylvania, Drug, heroin, overdose, deaths, University of Pittsburgh study"}, "article_summary": "\"Pitt Public Health has the most comprehensive mortality database in the nation, which can be easily cross-referenced with U.S. Census data to shed light on myriad public health issues,\" Burke explained.\n\u2022 Overdose deaths were concentrated in southwestern Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia are and northeast Pennsylvania near Scranton.\nPennsylvania has seen a 14-fold increase in drug overdose deaths over the last 35 years, with the death rate of relatively young white women climbing fastest, a new study has found.\n\u2022 35-to-44-year-olds had the greatest increase in overdose deaths rates, growing almost 22-fold since 1979, but 25-to-34-year-olds may be overtaking them, with the highest death rate in 2014 \u2014 40 deaths for every 100,000 people.\n\"The opioid epidemic is one of the most pressing public health issues in the United States today,\" Burwell said in a news release."}
