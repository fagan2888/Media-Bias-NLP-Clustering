This is a land of opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t taken advantage of the great resources we have, and the resources are not provided by the government.\u201d\n\nThe 4th Congressional District of New York includes the communities of Baldwin, Bellmore, East Meadow, the Five Towns, Lynbrook, Floral Park, Franklin Square, Garden City, Hempstead, Long Beach, Malverne, Merrick, Mineola, Carle Place, New Hyde Park, Oceanside, Rockville Centre, Roosevelt, Uniondale, West Hempstead and Westbury.\n\nIn her victory speech at Pier 95 restaurant in Freeport, Rice said she would prioritize efforts to make college more affordable and raise the minimum wage while in Washington, while also working toward immigration reform and legislation to combat gun violence.\n\n\u201cThe problem is the American dream is too far out of reach for too many people,\u201d she said. \u201cOur national economic recovery is leaving too many people behind.\u201d\n\nAbrahams, 39, who arrived at his watch party at Murphy\u2019s Pub and Grill in Mineola around midnight, said he had congratulated Rice on her campaign but did not concede the election Tuesday night, saying he had not yet received precinct results in Freeport or from 1,327 absentee ballots.\n\n\u201cI will take the opportunity to take a look at what\u2019s left in that universe, but we\u2019re not going to drag this out,\u201d Abrahams said on Tuesday night. \u201cWhat bodes well for the 4th Congressional District is that the seat remains Democratic.\u201d\n\nAt press time, all 651 precincts within the district had been reported to the county Board of Elections, but Abrahams\u2019 campaign had not yet issued a statement conceding the race.\n\nThe Associated Press had declared Rice the Democratic winner around 10 p.m. Tuesday, but her campaign did not call the election until an hour later when precinct results were made public through the county Board of Elections.\n\nRice thanked supporters and her family for their support during her campaign, as well as McCarthy, who endorsed the district attorney in January upon her announcement to seek the nomination.\n\nMcCarthy, 70, was first elected in 1996 on the heels of a 1993 shooting on a Long Island Railroad car at the Merillon Avenue station in Garden City in which her husband was killed and son was seriously injured.\n\nSeveral other state politicians and high-profile labor unions and charitable organizations also endorsed their support of Rice\u2019s campaign, as has the state Democratic Committee chaired by Rep. Steve Israel (D-Dix Hills).\n\nUpon announcing her candidacy, Rice resigned as co-chair of the Moreland Commission, a state panel that investigates public corruption.\n\nWeeks before Rice\u2019s announcement, McCarthy said she would retire at the conclusion of her ninth term in office. In February, she returned to Washington after undergoing chemotherapy treatment for lung cancer.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been an incredible friend and mentor and I would be proud to follow her footsteps in Washington,\u201d Rice said Tuesday.\n\nBlakeman, who served as the Legislature\u2019s presiding officer from 1996-99, received the endorsements of the county Republican, Conservative and Independence parties, while Scaturro, 41, emphasized his standing outside the formal GOP structure during his campaign.\n\nEfforts to reach Scaturro following the primary on Wednesday morning were unavailing.\n\nIn 2012, Scaturro narrowly beat Republican candidate Francis Becker, among primary voters on the Conservative line. McCarthy defeated Becker and Scaturro in the general election.\n\nBlakeman said he is running for Congress because \u201cthis is the first generation of Americans that is slated to do worse than their parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of us have a story to tell. All of us are here because of our parents and grandparents,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is everybody came to America because this is the land of opportunity. Our parents and grandparents came here to find a better life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Island Now", "description": "Democrat Kathleen Rice and Republican Bruce Blakeman each won their party\u2019s primary election on Tuesday for New York\u2019s 4th Congressional District and will square off in November to determine who will succeed the retiring Carolyn McCarthy in Washington.", "title": "Blakeman, Rice to face off in 4th CD", "url": "http://www.theislandnow.com/great_neck/blakeman-rice-to-face-off-in-th-cd/article_d72626ba-fd43-11e3-b72a-001a4bcf887a.html", "image": {"width": 310, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theislandnow.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/d0/fd0478a0-fd43-11e3-a590-001a4bcf887a/53ac3833c80f2.preview-300.jpg?resize=310%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Democrat Kathleen Rice and Republican Bruce Blakeman each won their party\u2019s primary election on Tuesday for New York\u2019s 4th Congressional District and will square off in November to determine who will succeed the retiring Carolyn McCarthy in Washington.", "fb": {"app_id": 120652047989708}, "keywords": "great_neck,manhasset,new_hyde_park,news,roslyn,williston_park,politics,spotlight,featured,top_story", "google-site-verification": "x4ON_uR3yDZ329jzk7oRS_pu9p8Xx4e80rSusrZUjJs", "news_keywords": "great_neck,manhasset,new_hyde_park,news,roslyn,williston_park,politics,spotlight,featured,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ef6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cShe\u2019s been an incredible friend and mentor and I would be proud to follow her footsteps in Washington,\u201d Rice said Tuesday.\nUpon announcing her candidacy, Rice resigned as co-chair of the Moreland Commission, a state panel that investigates public corruption.\nDemocrat Kathleen Rice and Republican Bruce Blakeman each won their party\u2019s primary election on Tuesday for New York\u2019s 4th Congressional District and will square off in November to determine who will succeed the retiring Carolyn McCarthy in Washington.\n\u201cI think we had the right message and we had the right team and people who believed in me as a candidate,\u201d Blakeman said.\nRice, the Nassau County district attorney, defeated Nassau County Minority Leader Kevan Abrahams (D-Freeport) 6,874-5,350, while Blakeman, the county Legislature\u2019s former presiding officer, defeated New Hyde Park attorney Frank Scaturro, 8,461-4,404, according to unofficial results from the Nassau County Board of Elections."}
