Granite Bay’s own Joe Diaz — a senior this year — will compete in the World Climbing Championships in Arco, Italy on August 28th as part of the climbing crew on the U.S. National Team.

After seven years of rigorous training and many attempts at the coveted goal of qualifying for the USAC ABS National Youth Finals, Diaz surpassed his hopes and dreams.

Competing by himself, but in the name of his fellow competitors at Team Granite Arch, the Granite Bay senior not only pushed through qualifying, and semifinal rounds but outdistanced his opponents on the final day. When the smoke cleared, Diaz stood on the silver medal podium level with a surprised grin on his normally serious face. Diaz, who has competed in Junior and Open USA Climbing (USAC) competitions since 2008, earned second place at the USAC American Bouldering Series National Championships in Madison, Wisconsin in mid-February.

A climber from an early age, Diaz started his climbing career at 10-years-old by scaling a 60-foot redwood tree on his parents' property. He also took first place at the 2014 Touchstone Climbing Series with a win in both the overall and the ropes competitions.

Be on the lookout for more from Diaz and Team Granite Arch as he preps for his journey to Italy.
