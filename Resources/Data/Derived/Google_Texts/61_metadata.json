Pro-choice. Pro-gay marriage. Catholic.\n\nFor this odd cocktail of beliefs, I\u2019ve often called myself a \u201cbad Catholic.\u201d I\u2019ve sat uncomfortably in a no man\u2019s land between the sometimes discriminatory and tone-deaf doctrine of the church, and the faith that I cherish.\n\nBut the wonderfully bull-headed feminist activist American nuns and central characters of the new documentary Radical Grace have little time for shame. Their decades-long struggle to drag the Catholic Church into modernity is an act, in the words of Sister Christine Schenk, of \u201cradical faithfulness.\u201d\n\nThe documentary, which had its world premiere at Hot Docs in Toronto on Tuesday, is a funny, fast-paced window into the battle between U.S. nuns and conservative elements of the Catholic Church over the past four years.\n\nThe nuns\u2019 aggressive politicking in support of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 which covered family planning \u2014 has drawn the ire of U.S. bishops. In 2012, the Vatican condemned the nuns for \u201cradical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith.\u201d (If women\u2019s equality is \u201cradical,\u201d Schenk quips in the film, \u201cguilty as charged.\u201d)\n\nThe film asks how these women can stay in a faith that demeans their work and questions their spirituality. For that matter, how can I?\n\nBut we are far from alone. In the U.S., 60 per cent of Catholics support gay marriage, according to Pew Research polling from 2014. A 2013 Ipsos Reid survey found three-quarters of Canadian Catholics agree women should be ordained as priests, and even more said priests should be able to marry.\n\nThe late Sister Jean Hughes, an affable woman who worked with ex-convicts, wonders in the film if she\u2019s \u201cpropping up an organization that doesn\u2019t believe that same things I do.\u201d\n\nOr maybe, as U.S. Bishop Thomas Paprocki, appointed by the Vatican to oversee the U.S. nuns, states in misogynistic arrogance, \u201cThe question is: Are you still religious? Are you still nuns?\u201d\n\nI put that question to Schenk, but she countered: \u201cWho is drawing the lines?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many Catholics grew up handing over their own moral conscience decision-making to whatever the Father said,\u201d she told me. \u201cThat kept them infantile in their faith.\u201d\n\nEven progressive Pope Francis \u2014 champion of the poor and a more open church \u2014 rejects women\u2019s ordination.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t get it with women, still,\u201d Shenk said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Toronto, Winnipeg, Halifax, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Ottawa, Catholic Church, views", "application-name": "metronews.ca", "p": {"domain_verify": "81d199f7387bc50974c9e161d71512bb"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.metronews.ca/views/2015/04/29/radical-grace-reconciling-the-radical-feminist-with-the-catholic-inside-me.html", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.metronews.ca/etc/designs/thestar/images/apple-touch.png", "site_name": "metronews.ca", "title": "Radical Grace: Reconciling the feminist with the Catholic inside me | Metro News"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "metronews.ca", "baseDomain": "http://www.metronews.ca/", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.metronews.ca/views/2015/04/29/radical-grace-reconciling-the-radical-feminist-with-the-catholic-inside-me.html", "storyId": "4b01d243-139d-4255-99be-4337dce88e86", "keywords": "Toronto, Winnipeg, Halifax, Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Ottawa, Catholic Church, views", "pagetype": "article", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/metrocanada", "section": "Views", "modified": "2015-04-29T21:01:37-04:00", "published": "2015-04-29T21:01:37-04:00"}, "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#0066a4", "viewport": "width=1260"}, "article_summary": "But the wonderfully bull-headed feminist activist American nuns and central characters of the new documentary Radical Grace have little time for shame.\nIn 2012, the Vatican condemned the nuns for \u201cradical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith.\u201d (If women\u2019s equality is \u201cradical,\u201d Schenk quips in the film, \u201cguilty as charged.\u201d)The film asks how these women can stay in a faith that demeans their work and questions their spirituality.\n\u201cThat kept them infantile in their faith.\u201dEven progressive Pope Francis \u2014 champion of the poor and a more open church \u2014 rejects women\u2019s ordination.\nIn the U.S., 60 per cent of Catholics support gay marriage, according to Pew Research polling from 2014.\nA 2013 Ipsos Reid survey found three-quarters of Canadian Catholics agree women should be ordained as priests, and even more said priests should be able to marry."}
