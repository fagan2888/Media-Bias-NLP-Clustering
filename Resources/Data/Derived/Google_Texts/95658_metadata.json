The critical question is: What policy designs are needed to ensure the most expansive, inclusive and secure means of access for voters?\n\nHere are three major factors that stakeholders must address:\n\n1. \u201cAutomatic\u201d Voter Registration by Name, But Not by Function\n\nA truly and fully automatic voter registration system occurs when information already provided to government is used to verify and register eligible voters, without making individuals self\u2011register or affirm their eligibility. Instead, individuals have the opportunity to decline registration after the eligibility process is complete.\n\nOregon\u2019s \u201cNew Motor Voter\u201d system operates in this fashion. Eligible unregistered voters found through the state\u2019s DMV databases are notified by mail that they will be added to the voter rolls unless they decline by returning a postcard to the state\u2019s election authorities. This model is arguably more inclusive; Oregon added over 10,000 new voters through its first seven weeks, while only 7% of people notified through mail opted out.\n\nBy contrast, many state bills offer voter modernization\u2014upgrades to elections systems to allow electronic transfer of voter eligibility information\u2014but stop short of being truly automatic. Before being added to the voter rolls, individuals must affirm their eligibility and/or formally answer whether or not they would like to be registered\u2014even though government agencies can perform both tasks themselves. These are automated voter registration systems. While automated processes are necessary to adopt as building blocks to full AVR, they shouldn\u2019t be conflated with an actual AVR system.\n\nRegardless of the system adopted, all but six states must comply with voter registration requirements mandated by the 1993 National Voter Registration Act (NVRA). Either system can be implemented without compromising NVRA compliance mandates.\n\n2. Public Agencies as AVR Source Agencies\n\nStrong AVR systems must connect elections systems with the electronic systems of other governmental and public agencies\u2014called \u201csource agencies\u201d\u2014to seamlessly interact and share accurate voter data. Information provided by these agencies is vital to confirming voter eligibility before electronic transfer of any individual into an elections database.\n\nThe majority of current AVR bills include motor vehicles offices as the sole source agency. This is problematic because it ensures the perpetuation of current voter registration gaps. For example, African Americans and Latinos possess driver\u2019s licenses or other DMV\u2011issued identifications in much lower proportions versus their white counterparts. Some state bills reflect lawmakers\u2019 concerns about agencies\u2019 lack of technical capacities required to electronically transfer information and thus prioritize technological upgrades and automated voter registration processes.\n\nInclusive and universal AVR must include a broad range of source agencies. Public assistance agencies (including Health Benefit Exchanges created by Obamacare) and disability offices\u2014agencies and offices that mandate voter registration services through the NVRA, public universities and Department of Corrections are among a number of agencies that should be included. Less conventional state-specific databases that already contain AVR\u2011relevant information should also be considered. Alaska\u2019s AVR ballot initiative, for example, features the state\u2019s database for oil revenue dividends as the primary source agency.\n\nMany state bills reflect concerns about many public agencies\u2019 lack of technical capacities required to electronically transfer information and thus prioritize making the proper upgrades. These improvements should serve as building blocks for full AVR rather than as a final step.\n\n3. Protections for Inadvertent Registrants\n\nAdministrative errors within AVR systems could result in the accidental registration of ineligible voters. Non-citizens particularly face dire consequences. Under current law in which individuals must make a proactive effort to register to vote, a non\u2011citizen who registers to vote can be deported with no chance of ever returning to the United States.\n\nAs a result, it's crucial that AVR statutes contain legal protections for ineligible voters who are inadvertently registered. This requires at least three things:\n\nStates must have complete confidence in the information within the source databases included; States must hold sole responsibility for confirming voter eligibility; and Statutes must contain specific legislative language, known as \u201cSafe Harbor\u201d language, that states that ineligible individuals who get inadvertently registered have not made improper claims of citizenship or voter eligibility.\n\nUnder these provisions, in the event of an inadvertent registration, the ineligible voter has made no statements and/or signed no documents that assert a claim of citizenship\u2014if the individual inadvertently becomes registered, it was as a result of action by the state, not the individual. This shifts the legal responsibility of registration from the individual to the state, drastically reducing one of the biggest concerns to implementing the most inclusive AVR system possible.\n\nBecause of AVR\u2019s tremendous potential to transform how voting operates, now is the time to set precedents that most expansively and safely bring new people into the process. We have a golden opportunity to increase the size and quality of our electorate. Policymakers and advocates should take full advantage of this moment and get it right; our democracy needs it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Demos", "description": "Automatic Voter Registration (AVR)\u2014meaning voter registration that occurs without a proactive effort by individual citizens\u2014has caught fire following Oregon\u2019s enactment of the first model last year wi", "title": "How to Create the Best Automatic Voter Registration System", "url": "http://www.demos.org/blog/4/28/16/how-create-best-automatic-voter-registration-system", "image": "/sites/all/themes/custom/demos_zen/logo.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"admins": 443404479084843}, "description": "Automatic Voter Registration (AVR)\u2014meaning voter registration that occurs without a proactive effort by individual citizens\u2014has caught fire following Oregon\u2019s enactment of the first model last year with state legislatures in over half the country carry bills currently."}, "article_summary": "Regardless of the system adopted, all but six states must comply with voter registration requirements mandated by the 1993 National Voter Registration Act (NVRA).\n\u201cAutomatic\u201d Voter Registration by Name, But Not by FunctionA truly and fully automatic voter registration system occurs when information already provided to government is used to verify and register eligible voters, without making individuals self\u2011register or affirm their eligibility.\nAutomatic Voter Registration (AVR)\u2014meaning voter registration that occurs without a proactive effort by individual citizens\u2014has caught fire following Oregon\u2019s enactment of the first model last year with state legislatures in over half the country carry bills currently.\nThese are automated voter registration systems.\nBy contrast, many state bills offer voter modernization\u2014upgrades to elections systems to allow electronic transfer of voter eligibility information\u2014but stop short of being truly automatic."}
