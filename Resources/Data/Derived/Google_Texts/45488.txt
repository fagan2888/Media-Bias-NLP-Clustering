Now that the shoe is on the other foot, some Democrats are changing their tune about the optics of presidential vacations.

Former president George W. Bush was attacked harshly by Democrats throughout his eight year presidency for taking vacations on the family ranch. Even now, Bush’s 381 vacation days are given as a reason that conservatives should not discuss the bad optics of President Barack Obama vacationing on the luxe Martha’s Vineyard while global crises continue to erupt.

Obama has taken 20 vacations lasting 2 to 15 days since taking office, totaling up to 129 days on vacation. Obama has also played 192 rounds of golf during his presidency.

David Axelrod, one of the men behind Obama’s two presidential campaigns, told the New York Daily News News that his fellow Democrats were in the wrong for their past criticisms and should possibly even demand presidential vacations.

“We used to pillory George Bush for going to his ranch and we were wrong,” he said.

“The demands and pressures of the presidency are relentless, and we ought to want our presidents to get small breaks to relax, even in-and maybe especially in — the midst of crisis. I guarantee you, that wherever he goes, the President is accompanied by the memory of Jim Foley and every American who has died on his watch. You can’t escape it.”
