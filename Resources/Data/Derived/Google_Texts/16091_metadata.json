The ethical base is lost when businesspeople take over and destroy the traditions of medical practice. Hospital Corporation of America, the nation\u2019s largest for-profit hospital chain, is under investigation for similar practices.\n\nLeaders of corporate America care little about the credo that established medicine as a noble profession, operated not for profitability but for the good of the patients. Sadly, doctors within the corporate system who have opposed fraudulent and illegal practices designed to maximize profitability are punished and terminated. Meanwhile, the white-collar criminal behavior of corporate executives is not adequately punished.\n\nSuch practices have a corrosive effect on independent doctors as well. This leads many to game the system and find loopholes to maximize profits. Costs soar. Hospitals and medical schools are often complicit.\n\nMany decent doctors deplore the changes in health care delivery systems that foster such abuses. But I find it hard to be heard when I speak of accountability. I call on our current and next generation of medical school graduates to have the vision and courage to take back the leadership of medicine and restore its right to be considered a noble profession.\n\nHOWARD A. CORWIN\n\nNaples, Fla., Feb. 3, 2014\n\nThe writer was a clinical professor of psychiatry at Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nEditors\u2019 Note: We invite readers to respond briefly by Thursday for the Sunday Dialogue.
