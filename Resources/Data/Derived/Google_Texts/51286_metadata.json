Pain is not just a symptom \u2026 it starts out as a symptom, but then it becomes the disease.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the Maryland General Assembly legalized medical marijuana, which some advocates say is a big step in the right direction toward alleviating chronic pain for sufferers.\n\nRELATED: Commission approves medical marijuana recommendations\n\nLast year, a study conducted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center found that the annual number of deaths from prescription drug overdose is 25 percent lower in the 23 states with legal medical marijuana programs.\n\nYet anti-drug organizations, such as the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, fear legalizing medical marijuana is a slippery slope that could lead to more youth using drugs.\n\nOfficials with CADCA say more than two-thirds of drug treatment admissions for patients under 18 involve marijuana abuse.\n\nWebster can see potential benefits of medical marijuana for his patients, but said much more research must be done.\n\n\u201cI know that marijuana has chemical components that can be medicinal, they can be helpful, they can relieve pain,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you buy marijuana, you don\u2019t know how much of the therapeutic chemicals that are involved versus the psychoactive properties.\u201d\n\nWebster believes if those two can be separated, there\u2019s a real opportunity for patients to use marijuana rather than more risky substances, such as opioids.\n\nHerman said she\u2019s in favor of anything that can make people\u2019s pain subside.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t push any kind of medicine or anything, but if they\u2019re able to find something that helps them, that\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t judge.\u201d\n\nPart of the Affordable Care Act required the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to enter into an agreement with the Institute of Medicine to increase awareness of pain as a serious public health issue.\n\nA 2011 report from the IOM called for sweeping changes in how pain is perceived and treated in the U.S. The study estimated that the cost of pain care, including lost wages and productivity, could top $600 billion.\n\nA task force made up of pain experts and patient advocates is developing a national strategy, though it keeps getting delayed, Herman said.\n\nFollowing her car accident, she\u2019s dealt with neck pain, then TMJ syndrome in her jaw, sometimes known as lockjaw, then fibromyalgia. She also has chronic fatigue.\n\nOften, people who are dealing with chronic pain have multiple issues. Pain can compromise one\u2019s auto-immune system. Many times, it leads to depression.\n\nHerman, who is on disability, copes in part with her pain by using acupuncture. She says misconceptions regarding chronic pain abound.\n\n\u201cThere are so many of them\u2014that pain is your fault, that you did something to cause it, that it means you\u2019re weak, that it means you\u2019re broken,\u201d she said. \u201cOr that we\u2019re drug addicts, and that\u2019s just not true.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "It\u2019s an invisible struggle for Gwenn Herman and the more than 100 million Americans dealing with chronic pain.", "author": "Allison Bourg", "og": {"site_name": "WMAR", "description": "It\u2019s an invisible struggle for Gwenn Herman and the more than 100 million Americans dealing with chronic pain.", "title": "Chronic pain a constant struggles for many Americans", "url": "http://www.abc2news.com/news/health/chronic-pain-a-constant-struggles-for-many-americans", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://sharing.abc2news.com/sharescnn/photo/2015/03/12/1426184532_14931744_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 483188346, "iphone": 487666890}}, "site": "@abc2news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Chronic pain a constant struggle for many", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.abc2news.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 215133865190}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Allison Bourg"}, "keywords": "chronic pain, marijuana, opiods, drugs, health, news, local, wmar, baltimore, maryland", "google-site-verification": "y-3dMF_ByckcLQ9y4xG8edBECKiLt5ekX9qo12IPIYU", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/pages/Baltimore-MD/WMAR-TV-abc2newscom/51379687226", "published_time": "2015-03-26T20:33:46+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/", "section": "Health", "modified_time": "2015-03-26T20:33:46+0000", "tag": "health news, hot topic, infocus"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc0ba\"", "article_summary": "As founder and executive director of Pain Connection Chronic Pain Outreach Center Inc., a Rockville-based nonprofit, Herman helps people who have chronic pain deal with its social and psychological aspects.\nBALTIMORE - It\u2019s an invisible struggle for Gwenn Herman and the more than 100 million Americans dealing with chronic pain.\nShe says misconceptions regarding chronic pain abound.\nOften, people who are dealing with chronic pain have multiple issues.\nRELATED: Shining a light on 'invisible' disabilitiesShe and other advocates for those living with chronic pain are awaiting the development of a national pain strategy, a goal that arose from the federal Affordable Care Act."}
