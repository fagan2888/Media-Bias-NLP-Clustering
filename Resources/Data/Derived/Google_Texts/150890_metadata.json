The program gets its name from investment \u201cangels\u201d who provide financing for startup businesses.\n\n\u201cThey had an idea that was born out of personal experience, which is the best thing,\u201d Keen said.\n\nThe two plans fit together. The two men had business expertise but not the technical knowledge of nursing and home care. Howard knows nursing but not business.\n\n\u201cThey started showing revenues right away and had a full plate before we knew it, and were looking to grow,\u201d Keen said. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of what we\u2019re trying to do, to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit in Omaha and in the state.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s crowded field of elder care includes Omaha\u2019s Home Instead Senior Care, which has 900 franchises in the United States and 15 foreign countries, with thousands of clients receiving nonmedical care. Right at Home, another Omaha franchiser, offers similar services.\n\nThe Visiting Nurse Association, in business for 115 years in Omaha, offers what it calls \u201ccomplete in-home care\u201d and close connections to many of Omaha\u2019s hospitals.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s emphasis on avoiding hospital readmissions has everyone\u2019s attention, said Ruth Freed, director of clinical alignment at Methodist Health System.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll see more (such businesses) or whether the market kind of has enough of those in the community,\u201d Freed said.\n\nMethodist\u2019s home health division, for example, refers patients to outside groups such as Home Instead or the Visiting Nurse Association. Hospitals themselves also offer services such as nurses who visit patients in their homes to make sure their care continues.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act helped drive efforts to reduce readmissions, Freed said. \u201cBut I think hospitals would have begun to do this kind of thing because it\u2019s the right thing to do for the patient. Maybe what the ACA did is just maybe cause us to work a little earlier on it.\u201d\n\nA Place at Home aims to fill gaps among existing services, with the need rising because of the new law and the growing number of senior citizens.\n\nReadmissions cost Medicare patients $26 billion a year, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said, estimating that $17billion of that could be saved if patients got the right care in the first place plus follow-up assistance.\n\nAt the same time, a new report from AARP said that the number of people \u2014 including family members \u2014 available to take care of the elderly will decline in coming decades, making hired help more prevalent.\n\nFor each person older than 80 in 2010 there were more than seven people in the 45 to 64 age range of most caregivers. That will decline to fewer than 4 to 1 in 2030 and 3 to 1 by 2050, AARP said, when the United States will have three times as many people over 80 than today.\n\nA Place at Home employs 35 part-time and full-time certified nursing assistants and four part-time registered nurses, besides Howard, who spend as much as 3,000 hours a month with clients.\n\n\u201cWe have really melded together,\u201d Howard said, smiling at the two younger men in the one-room office they share at 12925 West Dodge Road. \u201cI think of them as family. They never make me feel old.\u201d\n\nShe was a public health nurse decades ago in Connecticut but soon moved to Omaha with her husband, Thomas, a physician. She left work to raise a family, becoming an active volunteer for a wide range of causes in Omaha.\n\nTwelve years ago she rekindled her career, earning a master\u2019s degree and joining her husband\u2019s office. There, she discovered patients struggling with the health care process: following doctors\u2019 orders, asking questions, becoming anxious during checkups, communicating with family members.\n\n\u201cThat was the spark,\u201d Howard said. She trained the office staff to make sure patients were following up on the care and instructions they received. Eventually she started a business called My Concierge Nurses, with registered nurses acting as advocates for clients.\n\nBut starting the business was slow going. \u201cI\u2019m a nurse,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI\u2019m not a business woman.\u201d\n\nA friend suggested she contact the Halo Institute. There, she met Distefano and Evanich.\n\nThe two had been friends since fourth grade, growing up in northwest Omaha. They took different paths as young adults but kept in contact.\n\nDistefano earned a degree in criminal justice and wanted to work with juveniles, but discovered it was difficult for him to take steps that resulted in young people being removed from their families.\n\nHe became a management trainee for a telemarketing company, worked for a time in England and then managed an Enterprise auto rental office in Scottsdale, Ariz. When he married, he returned home.\n\nBack in Omaha, he reconnected with Evanich, who had studied real estate and property management and worked as a Realtor.\n\n\u201cI have never wanted to have a boss,\u201d Evanich said, but hoped to run his own company.\n\nBoth had grandparents and great-grandparents who had faced old age and medical problems, and things didn\u2019t always turn out for the best. Distefano\u2019s grandmother in Audubon, Iowa, ended up having to spend all her money and leave her home, against her will, to live in a nursing home across the street.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take rocket science to figure out that there must be a better way,\u201d Evanich said. The two worked out a business plan in November 2011. Distefano\u2019s mother-in-law showed him a World-Herald article about the Halo Institute, and the two signed up.\n\nAfter meeting Howard, the three officially merged in June 2012 and opened Aug. 1 of that year, with each putting up $5,000 for startup costs. Distefano is CEO, Evanich is president and Howard is chief nursing officer.\n\nTheir original $5,000 was quickly paid back, but most of the revenue goes back into the business so far. Their monthly salaries have been small.\n\nHoward\u2019s passion is nurse advocacy. Many elderly people don\u2019t have family members who can go with them to doctor appointments.\n\nBy working out a personalized plan with the patient and family members (a plan costs $450), the registered nurse can act on behalf of the patient and the family.\n\n\u201cWe sit in their place,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe do what they want us to do.\u201d\n\nWhen staff members first sit down with elderly patients, often there is \u201ca mess of medications,\u201d Evanich said, prescribed by different doctors and sometimes interacting with each other in negative ways. The plan gets the medications in order and properly administered.\n\nWith family members on board, the plan can address issues such as nutrition, physical fitness and household needs.\n\nThe plan sets personal goals. One client, for example, wanted to live at least five more years, so the plan set out strategies to make that happen. Nurses collaborate with clients\u2019 doctors, making sure decisions are in the patients\u2019 best interests and family members remain in the loop. \u201cWe\u2019re that conduit, which is often lacking today,\u201d Howard said.\n\nThe company\u2019s registered nurse advocacy includes assessing health and in-home safety, recommending referrals for medical and living needs, telephone communication and coordinated care planning, which includes collaborating with care providers, researching health and wellness options and advocating during medical appointments and emergencies.\n\nPrices include $100 to $150 an hour for in-home or medical visit by a registered nurse, depending on advance notice, and $450 for five hours a month and $850 for 10 hours a month.\n\nA Place at Home offers three levels of in-home service by certified nursing assistants: basic care ($22 an hour) such as light housekeeping, shopping, laundry, house plant care and organization assistance; personal care ($19 an hour) such as bathing, dressing, mobility and meal preparation; and companion care ($19 an hour) including hobby maintenance, church-going, respite care, reading and social media interaction with family.\n\nA Place at Home doesn\u2019t provide skilled care, such as occupational or physical therapy. But the company is licensed by the State Department of Health and Human Services to give medications and other minor medical tasks.\n\nFees also include $3,000 a week for 24/7 care by certified nursing assistants, $300 a day for a live-in caregiver and $185 for overnight care.\n\nThe company also helps with transitions, whether it\u2019s living at home after the death of a spouse or moving into an independent living apartment or an assisted living facility. Some people who move into elder-care housing remain clients afterward.\n\n\u201cSeniors are so worried that they\u2019re not going to have enough money,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe want to be part of the solution.\u201d\n\nThe company can explain how clients can pay for the living arrangements they need. For example, filing long-term care insurance claims may help pay for services that can keep them in their homes. Staff members can coach the clients through the claims process, which can be complicated.\n\nSometimes the health care system can create undue anxiety, Howard said.\n\nA notice from Medicare about a $10,000 medical treatment may state clearly that \u201cThis is not a bill,\u201d but the patient may not understand, and the anxiety alone can be damaging.\n\nA Place at Home\u2019s clients come mostly from referrals by doctors\u2019 offices, rehab centers, social workers, case managers and a few from hospitals, plus calls from the company\u2019s advertising and social media outreach.\n\n\u201cHospitals know about us,\u201d Howard said, but also have other resources for patients.\n\nThis year, Medicare withheld nearly $1 million from hospitals in Omaha and Lincoln because of excess readmissions. Potential penalties will increase next year, although readmissions declined in 2012 in part because of the threat of penalties.\n\nUnder Obamacare, hospitals also can be penalized because of low patient satisfaction scores. With a nurse advocate, Distefano said, it\u2019s less likely that the patient will end up confused and frustrated with the hospital experience.\n\nDrexel Sibbernsen is one of the company\u2019s first clients, and certified nursing assistant Asha Tolbert is one of its first caregivers. She\u2019s part of a 24/7 team who work with Sibbernsen, a resident of Immanuel Village.\n\nThe arrangement works well, Sibbernsen said, especially when he gets a ride to have lunch or supper at the Omaha Country Club, where he is past president. \u201cIt\u2019s just marvelous,\u201d he said.\n\nContact the writer:\n\n402-444-1080, steve.jordon@owh.com\n\ntwitter.com/buffettOWH", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Three people blend their health and business skills, with help from Halo Institute, to start a new venture in elder care.", "title": "Teaming up to provide home care", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/money/teaming-up-to-provide-home-care/article_5d371c9b-0341-5e11-87eb-1fbae3a9e42a.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/54/6546dee5-1a2e-58d3-ab6b-50ee979072e8/5333052ea63af.image.jpg?resize=760%2C506", "height": 506}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Three people blend their health and business skills, with help from Halo Institute, to start a new venture in elder care.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "money", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "money"}, "article_summary": "Fees also include $3,000 a week for 24/7 care by certified nursing assistants, $300 a day for a live-in caregiver and $185 for overnight care.\nThere, she discovered patients struggling with the health care process: following doctors\u2019 orders, asking questions, becoming anxious during checkups, communicating with family members.\nA Place at Home doesn\u2019t provide skilled care, such as occupational or physical therapy.\nSometimes the health care system can create undue anxiety, Howard said.\nThe two men had business expertise but not the technical knowledge of nursing and home care."}
