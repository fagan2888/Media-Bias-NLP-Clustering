Yet as much as I enjoy Colbert \u2014 and especially this joke about Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 I gotta say, the funniest thing I saw this week had nothing to do with him. And it didn\u2019t take place amidst the skyscrapers and bright lights of Manhattan, either.\n\nNo, this spectacle had a much drabber locale. And unlike Colbert, none of its stars could be accurately described as a triple-threat. True, its musical accompaniment was solid (aesthetically, if not necessarily legally). But to a certain degree it was the event\u2019s amateurishness \u2014 its haphazard, ramshackle, chaotic energy \u2014 that made it so great. If more traditional, professional folks had run it, I doubt it\u2019d have been even half as fun.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably guessed this already, but I\u2019m talking about the \u201cStop the Iran Deal Rally,\u201d the carnival thrown Wednesday in D.C. by a group that calls itself the Tea Party Patriots. The one that was held after the White House had enough votes to protect the deal from Republicans. The one that featured Sarah Palin, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Donald Trump. The one that took a jackhammer to the border dividing reality from \u201cVeep.\u201d\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already seen any footage \u2014 and if you have a good sense of humor concerning the ignominious death of representative democracy \u2014 I can\u2019t recommend it enough. (This CNN clip is an okay introduction; the woman who says she opposes the deal because she has \u201ca couple daughters in New York City\u201d and \u201csure wouldn\u2019t want to see them nuked\u201d is my favorite.) But you can get a good sense from written reports, too.\n\nMy onetime colleague Jim Newell\u2019s piece in Slate, for example, does a great job of establishing the kitsch-ceiling for the event. (Spoiler: It\u2019s high.) But as good as the quotes from a guy Newell describes as wearing \u201ca Hillary Clinton rubber mask\u201d are, the piece does something more important: it provides a snapshot of the people going to Donald Trump rallies. And it suggests that they, too, would rather be somewhere else.\n\nI don\u2019t mean that literally. All the reports I\u2019ve read suggest that most attendees had fun. What I mean to say is that many Trumpites \u2014 more so than devotees of Palin or Cruz \u2014 don\u2019t sound very political. They don\u2019t sound like the kind of people who spend their leisure time reading about electoral politics or watching \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Instead, they sound like they showed up because they felt they had no other choice.\n\nTake Pete Webb, for example, a gentleman who told Newell he\u2019d come all the way from Miami and who believes Congress is \u201clame\u201d and has \u201cgot to be stopped.\u201d What\u2019s got Webb so angry, presumably, is that Congressional Republicans won\u2019t thwart the Iran deal. Not due to choice, but because foreign policy is usually the executive branch\u2019s purview. And because the Constitution is big on that \u201cseparation of powers\u201d stuff.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week's absurd rally against a done deal seals it.
