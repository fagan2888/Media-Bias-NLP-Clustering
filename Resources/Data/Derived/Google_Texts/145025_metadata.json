Allies, meanwhile, noted that the public comment on the code had devolved into political diatribe as well as sometimes-mean-spirited technical criticism.\n\nNow, Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee have their own take -- based on emails sent at the time from officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which was overseeing the site.\n\nFrom their report:\n\nOn October 11, 2013, CMS employee Jon Booth, complained to top CMS officials including Administrator [Marilyn] Tavenner and Mr. [Henry] Chao [the deputy chief information officer], that \u201cthis Github project has turned into a place for programmers to bash our system.\u201d He recommended that CMS remove the code from Github and noted that, \u201cI am sure there may be some blowback from this decision but I think it is better to take a short term hit with this deletion than to let this bashing of the source code continue on our official Github site on an ongoing basis.\u201d In internal discussions, CMS officials stated two reasons for removing the code: the \u201cbad PR\u201d associated with the online Github discussions and the feeling that it would be a \u201creal or perceived security risk.\n\nThe report argued there was no real security risk to leaving it up because administration officials knew they couldn\u2019t erase it entirely from the Internet, and the code in question was not for the parts of the website that involved personal information.\n\n(Image via scyther5/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Rebecca Carroll", "description": "Republicans release CMS emails about pulling code from open-source site.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "Republicans release CMS emails about pulling code from open-source site.", "title": "Officials Pulled HealthCare.gov Code From GitHub Because of \u2018Bashing\u2019", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/emerging-tech-blog/2014/09/officials-pulled-healthcaregov-code-github-because-bashing/94514/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/09/18/091814codingNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/09/18/091814codingNG/open-graph.jpg", "description": "Republicans release CMS emails about pulling code from open-source site.", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Officials Pulled HealthCare.gov Code From GitHub Because of \u2018Bashing\u2019"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-18T20:29:37Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/09/18/091814codingNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Officials Pulled HealthCare.gov Code From GitHub Because of \u2018Bashing\u2019", "keywords": "open source, healthcare.gov, obamacare, github", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2014/09/18/091814codingNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "open-source,healthcare.gov,obamacare,github,channel-nextgov->-emerging-tech->-emerging-tech,type-story,length-short,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "Republicans release CMS emails about pulling code from open-source site."}, "article_summary": "Allies, meanwhile, noted that the public comment on the code had devolved into political diatribe as well as sometimes-mean-spirited technical criticism.\nLess than two weeks after HealthCare.gov launched last October and proved initially unusable, the federal Obamacare website\u2019s source code disappeared from GitHub, a site that allows the public to comment on and improve open-source projects.\nOfficials at the time didn\u2019t comment or respond to questions about the disappearance, and critics wondered what had happened to the Obama administration\u2019s dedication to transparency.\nThe report argued there was no real security risk to leaving it up because administration officials knew they couldn\u2019t erase it entirely from the Internet, and the code in question was not for the parts of the website that involved personal information.\nNow, Republicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee have their own take -- based on emails sent at the time from officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which was overseeing the site."}
