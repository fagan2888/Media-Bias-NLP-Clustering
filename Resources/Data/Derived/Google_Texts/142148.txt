The "Apologetic Bandit" struck again Friday, and this time, his actions were caught on camera at an Arco gas station in Mission Viejo, Calif., authorities said.

This most recent robbery comes on the heels of two similar ones in the last week, according to an Orange County Sheriff's Department statement.

Although he brandished a gun at the clerk, the robber was extremely polite and even apologetic, authorities said.

Upon leaving, the gunman, dressed in all black, told the clerk to “have a good night.”

Orange County Sheriffs report that the suspect matched the description of a man believed to have committed several other robberies in southern Orange County area over the year.

The suspect is male, 5 feet, 7 inches tall, and 20 to 22 years old with a slight build. He wears all black clothing, a black mask with glasses and black converse shoes.

It’s not clear whether he has a getaway vehicle, according to the statement.

Anyone with information is urged to call the Fugitive Watch hot line at 800-9-CAUGHT (800-922-8448) or send a text to 408-355-0999.
