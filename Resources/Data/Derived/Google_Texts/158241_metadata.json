The business was sold by CI Capital Partners, a New York-based private equity firm.\n\nToronto-based Kik makes household, personal care, pool and spa lines, including bleach, polishes, surface cleaners, sanitizers and algaecides. Terms of the deal weren\u0092t disclosed.\n\nUnder CI Capital, Kik acquired Chemtura Corp.\u0092s (NYSE: CHMT) consumer products business for $300 million in January 2014. Back in 2011, Kik picked up Chem-Lab Products Inc., which brought it into the pool-products business.\n\nNew York-based Centerbridge plans to keep growing the company organically and through add-on acquisitions. For the private equity firm, the deal comes one day after it announced plans to back Heartland Food Products Group once the business completes the acquisition of Splenda from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). Back in June, Centerbridge agreed to sell transportation business Kenan Advantage Group Inc. to Omers Private Equity.\n\nCI generally makes equity investments between $25 million and $100 million per transaction. The firm focuses on business services, distribution, health care services, government services and defense and light manufacturing businesses.\n\nMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC (NYSE: MS) and Rothschild acted as Kik\u0092s financial advisers for the deal, and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP provided legal advice. Barclays (NYSE: BCS) advised Centerbridge, and Barclays and BMO Capital markets provided debt financing for the debt. Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP was Centerbridge\u0092s legal counsel.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/manufacturing/centerbridge-swims-away-with-pool-product-maker-kik-257855-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/pool-snapshot.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Centerbridge Swims Away with Pool Product Maker Kik"}}, "article_summary": "Centerbridge Swims Away with Pool Product Maker KikThe private equity-backed target spent $300M on Chemtura\u0092s consumer products business in 2014Centerbridge Partners has closed the acquisition of household and personal products-maker Kik Custom Products.\nThe firm focuses on business services, distribution, health care services, government services and defense and light manufacturing businesses.\nUnder CI Capital, Kik acquired Chemtura Corp.\u0092s (NYSE: CHMT) consumer products business for $300 million in January 2014.\nBack in June, Centerbridge agreed to sell transportation business Kenan Advantage Group Inc. to Omers Private Equity.\nThe business was sold by CI Capital Partners, a New York-based private equity firm."}
