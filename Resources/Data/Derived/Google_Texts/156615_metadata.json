If the Supreme Court had decided against federal subsidies, she was planning to go without insurance until then. Thankfully, she doesn\u2019t have to worry about that anymore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just thrilled, because otherwise I would have had to just relinquish my insurance and hope nothing happened to me,\u201d De Ratmiroff said. \u201cEither that or use the emergency room.\u201d\n\nDe Ratmiroff said she currently pays just $106 per month for her premium, which would normally cost over $600. Before signing on with a health insurance plan through the ACA in 2014, she was paying $620 per month for her own insurance, and it was about to get even more expensive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky because I\u2019m so close to Medicare,\u201d she concluded. \u201cBut what about people in their fifties, whose premiums really start to rise? They were the ones hanging by a thread with this decision.\u201d\n\nWhen the ACA was signed into law in 2010, it mandated that people above a certain income level who don\u2019t have health insurance through employment would need to purchase policies -- or else face increasing yearly penalties. To help people pay for these mandated insurance policies, states that had set up health insurance marketplaces offered subsidies to those who couldn't afford to pay their entire health insurance premium. But U.S. residents like De Ratmiroff, who live in states where no such state marketplaces exist, have to rely on a federal marketplace and federal subsidies to afford their premiums.\n\nMandating that everyone purchase insurance or face a fine, and providing subsidies to help people pay for those plans, are two policies that help stabilize the health insurance market and make premiums more affordable for everyone, explained Christine Eibner, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation.\n\nIf the health insurance mandate wasn't in the ACA, health insurance companies wouldn\u2019t be able to comply with one of the most popular features of the law: that everyone be allowed to purchase an insurance policy, regardless of pre-existing conditions.\n\nBefore the ACA, young and healthy people tended to opt out of health insurance, leaving the sickest people with the most expensive needs in the policies. This led to health insurance companies rejecting people with pre-existing illnesses, as they assumed, rightly, that they would incur the highest costs to the company.\n\nSubsidies for health insurance premiums are crucial for helping people pay for those mandated health insurance policies. Without subsidies, more people would drop out of the insurance market, which would lead to an increase in costs for everyone that\u2019s left, Eibner explained.\n\n\"We have estimated that if the subsidies were to be eliminated, premiums would increase by 47 percent,\u201d said Eibner. \u201cWe predict that those two policies together, especially the subsidies, have a stabilizing effect. They do bring younger and healthier people into the market, and they keep premiums lower than they would otherwise be.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: How To Move More This Weekend How To Move More This Weekend\n\n1 of 25 Mini Golf This old-timey favorite is fun for kids and adults alike, and can burn 100 calories in just 30 minutes.
