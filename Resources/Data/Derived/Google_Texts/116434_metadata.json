However, Indonesian law requires that inmates be given 72 hours notice of execution, which could mean they will be put to death as early as Tuesday.\n\nAs we reported on Friday, the two Australians are the sole Bali Nine detainees who are facing a firing squad. Other Australians connected to the ring have received lengthy or life prison sentences. Two Nigerians, a Brazilian, a Frenchman and a Ghanaian iand one Indonesian in addition to Veloso are also on death row.\n\nThe group is being held on the island of Nusakambangan, known as \"death island\" because of its high percentage of inmates awaiting execution.\n\nAustralia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she would continue to pressure Jakarta to grant clemency to the Australians, but Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who took office last year, has followed his predecessors in maintaining a zero-tolerance policy for drug smuggling.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reports:\n\n\n\n\"A French man on death row with Chan and Sukumaran won a temporary reprieve from the firing squad but any hope for the nine others has disappeared. \"Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told Fairfax Media the French Embassy was not among those summoned to discuss the imminent executions because Serge Atlaoui still had a legal case before the Administrative Court.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Updated at 3:40 p.m. ET Two Australians who were convicted nearly a decade ago of drug smuggling in Indonesia have been informed by authorities that their", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/indonesia-sets-executions-3-bali-nine-drug-smugglers", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201504/402207430.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Updated at 3:40 p.m. ET Two Australians who were convicted nearly a decade ago of drug smuggling in Indonesia have been informed by authorities that their", "title": "Indonesia Sets Executions For 2 'Bali Nine' Drug Smugglers"}, "story_id": 402175267, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Scott Neuman", "org_id": 1, "dc": {"title": "Indonesia Sets Executions For 2 &#039;Bali Nine&#039; Drug Smugglers"}, "nid": 39619, "datePublished": "2015-04-25", "wordCount": 424, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "ETTwo Australians who were convicted nearly a decade ago of drug smuggling in Indonesia have been informed by authorities that their execution by firing squad is imminent.\nAs we reported on Friday, the two Australians are the sole Bali Nine detainees who are facing a firing squad.\n\"Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir told Fairfax Media the French Embassy was not among those summoned to discuss the imminent executions because Serge Atlaoui still had a legal case before the Administrative Court.\"\nTwo Nigerians, a Brazilian, a Frenchman and a Ghanaian iand one Indonesian in addition to Veloso are also on death row.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald reports:\"A French man on death row with Chan and Sukumaran won a temporary reprieve from the firing squad but any hope for the nine others has disappeared."}
