This is a small town,\" Sharpe said. \"But we're not going to bust into anybody's church on Sunday morning.\"\n\nThe trouble at Full Gospel Tabernacle began on Saturday night, when Pastor Jamie Coots, whose serpent-handling religious rituals made him a reality TV star, died after a rattlesnake sunk its fangs into his right hand.\n\nCoots was a third-generation serpent handler and aspired to one day pass the practice, and his church, on to his adult son, Little Cody.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Reality show snake-handling preacher dies - of snakebite\n\nDespite Coots' death, Sharpe said he will not enforce Kentucky's ban against using serpents in religious services.\n\n\"The Middlesboro police have their priorities and the State Police have theirs. If they want to come in and investigate that or any other church, they are quite welcome.\"\n\nA National Geographic show featured Coots and cast handling copperheads, rattlers and cottonmouths. The channel's website shows a picture of Coots, goateed, with a fedora covering his bald head.\n\n\"Even after losing half of his finger to a snake bite and seeing others die from bites during services,\" Coots \"still believes he must take up serpents and follow the Holiness faith,\" the website says.\n\nCoots belonged to a small circle of Pentecostal Holiness pastors who take this passage from the Bible's Gospel of Mark literally: \u201cAnd these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\u201d\n\nSince those words are said to be spoken by Jesus, pastors like Coots take them as divine commandments. But there are other spiritual reasons to handle serpents, practitioners say, often describing the dangerous rituals as a mental and emotional rush, as if they were touching the hand of God.\n\n\"They almost always use drug metaphors, like 'higher than any high you can experience,\" said Paul Williamson, a professor of psychology at Henderson State University in Arkansas who studies serpent handlers.\n\nAt the same time, they are extremely careful with the serpents, Williamson said, only allowing those who live sin-free lives and have been \"annointed\" by the Holy Spirit to handle the snakes. \"There's death in that box,\" pastors often warn the congregation before services start.\n\n\"Because serpent handling is not a practice that occurs in the mainstream, people tend to look at it as anomalous and strange, \" said Williamson. \"But to them, it's really no different from a Catholic who takes Communion. It's a powerful and immediate experience of God that gives meaning and purpose to their lives.\"\n\nWilliamson estimates there are at most 2,000 people who belong to the few hundred churches, centered in Appalachia, that practice serpent handling. Most of the churches, like Coots', are fairly small, with less than 50 worshippers.\n\nFaith in the divine played a role on Coots' death Saturday night, Sharpe said.\n\n\"He was very open about his beliefs, that if he was bitten, he did not want medical treatment.\" Coots had been bitten by a snake a half-dozen times before and recovered.\n\nWilliamson said Coots and other snake-handlers generally seek medical treatment for other ailments. \"But when it comes to serpent-handling, it requires a belief in God and obedience to the commands of Jesus. If something does happen, they trust God with the consequences.\"\n\nSharpe said his department and an ambulance crew responded to a call at the church Saturday night but Coots and his family had already gone home. When they arrived at the Coots home, the pastor was unconscious and \"in pretty bad shape.\"\n\nMedical professionals stayed at Coots' house for half an hour, telling the family about the consequences of not seeking treatment, the police chief said, as family, friends and church members came and went. But the Coots family was adamant that God alone would heal the pastor, if it was divine will.\n\n\"Certainly, they were not aware of the danger,\" Sharpe said. \"We have to offer this treatment, but we can't force them to take it.\"\n\nCoots was far from the first serpent-handler to die from a snakebite. Mack Wolford, one of the tradition's most famous practitioners, was killed by a bite in 2012. His father died in 1983 from the same cause.\n\nThe police chief said he knew Coots fairly well and spoke with the pastor several times about being bitten by serpents.\n\nIt is not illegal to keep poisonous snakes in Kentucky, but it requires permits from the state Fish and Wildlife Department. Coots' permits were up-to-date, Sharpe said. \"He was pretty meticulous.\"\n\n\"They were well aware of what they were doing, that they were handling dangerous snakes and could get bit. Please understand that these are not ignorant people but people with beliefs just a little outside the mainstream.\"\n\nIn February 2013, Coots was given one year of probation for crossing into Tennessee with venomous snakes. The state banned snake-handling in 1947 after five people died within a two-year span, the National Geographic Channel says on the show site.\n\nHe was previously arrested in 2008 for keeping 74 snakes in his home, according to the channel.\n\n(CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, Belief Blog Co-editor (CNN) -- In the close-knit town of Middlesboro, Kentucky, almost everyone knew what was happening inside the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name Church -- including Police Chief Jeff Sharpe.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "A faithful death: Why a snake handler refused treatment", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/was-snake-handlers-death-preventable/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140217052939-preacher-dies-of-snakebite-earlystart-00001329-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, Belief Blog Co-editor\r\n\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- In the close-knit town of Middlesboro, Kentucky, almost everyone knew what was happening inside the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name Church -- including Police Chief Jeff Sharpe.", "title": "A faithful death: Why a snake handler refused treatment"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "belief, bible, christianity, death, prayer, jamie coots, pentecostal, snake hand, snake handlers, snake salvation", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/was-snake-handlers-death-preventable/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2290\"", "article_summary": "MORE ON CNN: Reality show snake-handling preacher dies - of snakebiteDespite Coots' death, Sharpe said he will not enforce Kentucky's ban against using serpents in religious services.\nCoots was a third-generation serpent handler and aspired to one day pass the practice, and his church, on to his adult son, Little Cody.\n\"He was very open about his beliefs, that if he was bitten, he did not want medical treatment.\"\n\"But when it comes to serpent-handling, it requires a belief in God and obedience to the commands of Jesus.\nThe police chief said he knew Coots fairly well and spoke with the pastor several times about being bitten by serpents."}
