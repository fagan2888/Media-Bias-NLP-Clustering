Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, said last week that airmen at Hurlburt Field, Florida, found the photo of \u201csome moron standing at this command\u201d and \u201cbragging about the command and control abilities\u201d of the terrorist group.\n\nSome 22 hours later, three Joint Direct Attack Munitions\u2014guided \u201csmart\u201d bombs\u2014destroyed the headquarters.\n\nThe incident swept headlines as an undermining of the group\u2019s typically savvy ability to use social media as a foundational piece in its recruitment and terrorism efforts.\n\nWhile this case is certainly no black swan among ISIS\u2019 social media downfalls, the group\u2019s propaganda machine has proven a challenge as the U.S. struggles to redefine its counterterrorism strategy beyond the military.\n\nO\u2019Hanlon said the problem lays in the U.S.\u2019 inability to gain credibility within the groups ISIS is successfully targeting.\n\n\u201cWe should do what we can to counter the message by pointing out ISIL\u2019s flaw, if our critiques will be believed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut since they often won\u2019t be believed, we need allies throughout the broader Muslim world to send the same message. And of course, we can\u2019t force them to do so at a pace or in a way they don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nPhillips said the U.S.\u2019 counter-propaganda efforts would likely have limited appeal to those \u201cmost at risk\u201d in ISIS\u2019 recruitment campaign, but that the U.S. government should publicize the group\u2019s atrocities, particularly those against other Muslims.\n\nHe added the U.S. could covertly subsidize defectors who publicly criticize ISIS to counter its \u201cradicalization\u201d efforts.\n\n\u201cMilitary, intelligence and law enforcement efforts will always be key elements of counterterrorism campaigns,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in the long run, the war of ideas is crucial to destroying the appeal of Islamist totalitarian ideology and reducing the flow of new recruits into terrorist organizations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One year ago this week ISIS seized Iraq\u2019s second largest city Mosul\u2014its first major land grab in a battle for territorial expansion that continues today.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One year ago this week ISIS seized Iraq\u2019s second largest city Mosul\u2014its first major land grab in a battle for territorial expansion that continues today.", "title": "How ISIS Is Waging a \u2018War Of Ideas\u2019 Through Social Media", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150608_ISISSeflie_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-08T18:17:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Hj8f14"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One year ago this week ISIS seized Iraq\u2019s second largest city Mosul\u2014its first major land grab in a battle for territorial expansion that continues today.", "title": "How ISIS Is Waging a \u2018War Of Ideas\u2019 Through Social Media", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150608_ISISSeflie_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-06-08T14:08:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-08T18:17:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS, ISIL, Mosul, Hawk Carlisle"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf39e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat the social media alarmists ignore is that social media can increase not just the recruitment rate, but also the attrition rate,\u201d Abrahms said.\nMax Abrahms, a political science professor at Northeastern University specializing in insurgency and terrorism, said \u201csocial media alarmists,\u201d those who focus too narrowly on ISIS benefitting from social media, fail to consider the drawbacks.\nBut some feel the group\u2019s social media success has been overstated.\nO\u2019Hanlon said the problem lays in the U.S.\u2019 inability to gain credibility within the groups ISIS is successfully targeting.\nWhile this case is certainly no black swan among ISIS\u2019 social media downfalls, the group\u2019s propaganda machine has proven a challenge as the U.S. struggles to redefine its counterterrorism strategy beyond the military."}
