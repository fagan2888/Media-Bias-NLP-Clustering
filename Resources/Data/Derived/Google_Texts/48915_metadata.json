For example, research has shown that yoga doesn\u2019t necessarily help at all in treating asthma compared to other breathing exercises. And while yoga and mindfulness can improve quality of life, and reduce chemotherapy side effects, it hasn\u2019t been proved to treat cancer in any way, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nThat being said, let\u2019s take a look at all the conditions or disorders yoga does treat \u2014 according to the scientific evidence that\u2019s out there, at least. Maybe this way, you can give yoga a try, and better understand how it may benefit you.\n\nBack Pain\n\nSome 80 percent of adults will experience back pain at some point in their lives, and it\u2019s something that can cause a lot of distress and distraction. But research has shown that yoga or simply stretching can alleviate chronic back pain. A 2011 study found that both yoga and stretching helped people with chronic pain \u2014 they were considered \u201csafe options\u201d for a condition that is normally treated with a regimen of painkillers. As long as you focus on yoga\u2019s therapeutic effects (and don\u2019t push yourself too much trying to perfect the crazy poses), yoga may relieve your chronic back pain.\n\nArthritis\n\nDoctors still aren\u2019t certain whether yoga directly improves arthritis; several studies have yielded different and conflicting results. However, it\u2019s generally agreed that yoga can and does assist in reducing the stress and frustration caused by arthritis \u2014 and that incorporating yoga into an arthritis treatment program can only enhance it.\n\n\u201cWhile there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence of the benefits of yoga (just visit any yoga studio), to date only a handful of scientific studies have been conducted on persons with [arthritis],\u201d Johns Hopkins University states. \u201cThese early studies have shown promising results with some improvement in joint health, physical functioning, and mental/emotional well-being\u2026 People with arthritis may also enjoy yoga more than traditional forms of exercise, and exercise enjoyment is an important predictor of adherence.\u201d\n\nHeart Disease\n\nA recent study out of Erasmus University Medical Center found that yoga was beneficial for cardiovascular health. While yoga mainly works on flexibility and muscular strength, it\u2019s not considered an aerobic exercise like running \u2014 so it\u2019s an interesting finding.\n\nThe researchers note they\u2019re not sure exactly how yoga improves cardiovascular health. \u201cAlso unclear, are the dose-response relationship and the relative costs and benefits of yoga when compared to exercise or medication,\u201d Myriam Hunink, lead author of the study, said. \u201cHowever, these results indicate that yoga is potentially very useful and in my view worth pursuing as a risk improvement practice.\u201d\n\nIndeed, yoga is unlike other types of physical activity in that it focuses more on slower poses, meditative breathing, and a calm approach. This trifecta can assist in reducing stress and lowering blood pressure, which can all have a good effect on your heart health.\n\nAnxiety Disorders, Depression\n\nYou may enter a yoga class, your body tensed and tight from weeks and even months\u2019 worth of accumulated stress. Our body holds emotion in it \u2014 and yoga can help unravel that. Just an hour\u2019s worth of yoga can force you to leave all your stresses and anxiety behind, and this \u201cyoga high\u201d effect can last for hours afterwards.\n\nThough there aren\u2019t too many studies on this yet, one study found that \u201cseveral studies of exercise and yoga have demonstrated therapeutic effectiveness superior to no-activity controls and comparable with established depression and anxiety treatments\u201d such as cognitive behavioral therapy, sertraline, and imipramine. \u201cHigh-energy exercise and frequent aerobic exercise reduce symptoms of depression more than less frequent or low-energy exercise. For anxiety disorders, exercise and yoga have also shown positive effects.\u201d\n\nChemotherapy Side Effects\n\nWhile there is no evidence that yoga can fight cancer, or lower a person\u2019s risk, it has been shown to reduce inflammation and alleviate chemotherapy side effects in cancer patients.\n\nIn one recent study, scientists gathered breast cancer patients who were suffering from debilitating chemotherapy effects, and placed them in 90-minute yoga classes twice a week. They found the cancer patients had more energy, less fatigue, and slept much better than the patients who didn\u2019t do yoga.\n\nSleep Disorders\n\nThis brings us to yoga and sleep: like most exercise, yoga can improve your sleeping patterns and fight insomnia. Stress and the \u201cbuzz\u201d of external anxieties \u2014 and yes, a sedentary lifestyle \u2014 can keep us lying awake at night. Learning to breathe more slowly and deeply in yoga classes can ultimately improve our sleep. A 2004 study found that yoga treated chronic insomnia in patients,", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "yoga, conditions yoga can treat", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Yoga may not directly cure any diseases, but it can make a difference in treating certain conditions \u2014 from back pain to anxiety disorders.", "title": "6 Health Conditions Yoga Can Actually Treat", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/take-deep-breath-good-health-6-conditions-yoga-can-treat-327352", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/27/yoga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yoga may not directly cure any diseases, but it can make a difference in treating certain conditions \u2014 from back pain to anxiety disorders.", "title": "6 Health Conditions Yoga Can Actually Treat", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/take-deep-breath-good-health-6-conditions-yoga-can-treat-327352", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/27/yoga.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/27/yoga.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-03-28T10:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-28T10:02:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Yoga may not directly cure any diseases, but it can make a difference in treating certain conditions \u2014 from back pain to anxiety disorders."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd1b\"", "article_summary": "Sleep DisordersThis brings us to yoga and sleep: like most exercise, yoga can improve your sleeping patterns and fight insomnia.\nThis trifecta can assist in reducing stress and lowering blood pressure, which can all have a good effect on your heart health.\nThey found the cancer patients had more energy, less fatigue, and slept much better than the patients who didn\u2019t do yoga.\nFor example, research has shown that yoga doesn\u2019t necessarily help at all in treating asthma compared to other breathing exercises.\nArthritisDoctors still aren\u2019t certain whether yoga directly improves arthritis; several studies have yielded different and conflicting results."}
