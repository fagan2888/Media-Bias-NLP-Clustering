Bell, sweating profusely as he talked to reporters after a workout, needed it.\n\n\u201cAppreciate it, D-Will,\u201d Bell told him.\n\nIt just as easily could have been ceremonial, the AFC\u2019s current leading rusher passing the towel as baton to the AFC rushing champ a year ago.\n\nBell, the Steelers\u2019 All-Pro halfback, completed his two-game NFL suspension for his 2014 marijuana convictions and will rejoin his teammates in practice this week before playing Sunday at St. Louis against the Rams. The Steelers have a roster exemption for him until 4 p.m. Wednesday, when they must remove another player to make room for him. That player could be second-year halfback/wide receiver Dri Archer, who did not play at all on offense in the 43-18 victory against San Francisco after playing only three snaps on offense in the opener.\n\nBut with Williams and Bell, offensive coordinator Todd Haley has a luxury of riches at halfback. Williams, a 10-year veteran, is the NFL\u2019s second-leading rusher with 204 yards after two games.\n\n\u201cDeAngelo played great, but that didn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching him since I was growing up. He did everything plus more than I expected. He did his thing, and I\u2019m just glad to come in and help him out a little bit.\u201d\n\nBell led the AFC with 1,361 yards rushing in his second season and added 83 pass receptions for another 854 yards in 2014. He rarely came off the field last season, which is one reason his veteran backup, LeGarrette Blount, walked out on the team at Tennessee and was cut the next day.\n\nWilliams said he will have no problem stepping aside to let Bell do his thing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you this right now, Le\u2019Veon is going to rewrite the rushing record here,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, and I\u2019m not putting any pressure on the guy. I know what he can do. And you know what I\u2019m going to do? I\u2019m going to watch him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just an old guy trying to find his way.\u201d\n\nBell said he is willing to share time with Williams, 32, who rushed for 1,515 yards and 18 touchdowns with Carolina in 2008 and signed with the Steelers after the Panthers released him this year.\n\n\u201cHe obviously showed in the first two games he can come in and the offense doesn\u2019t slow down at all,\u201d Bell said. \u201cAnd obviously, last year what I did, we\u2019re both excited. We both do different things, we\u2019re different style of runners. They\u2019ll use us both, I\u2019m pretty sure.\u201d\n\nUnder new NFL rules, Bell was permitted to work out at the Steelers facility and attend all their meetings while suspended, but was not permitted on the practice field, even to watch. He said staying around and staying abreast helped him keep pace with what they are doing.\n\n\u201cI think it was a good thing, obviously not to be gone for two whole weeks. I\u2019ll still be caught up on everything so when I get thrown back in there I\u2019m not lost and have to catch up on things. \u2026 I\u2019m just glad to be back on the field.\u201d\n\nBell said the coaches can divvy up playing time however they see fit, and it will be no problem with either him or Williams.\n\n\u201cHowever coaches use us. I\u2019m a guy who wants to win, he\u2019s a guy who wants to win. However we\u2019re able to help this team win games is all that matters to me. Neither of us are selfish guys.\u201d\n\nThe Steelers offense ranked second in the NFL last season with 411.1 yards per game, and Bell believes they can do even more, as they did Sunday by scoring 43 points.\n\n\u201cThe offense didn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d he said of their performance without him through two games. \u201cI expect us to be out there and put up crazy numbers. I know what type of playmakers we have. I know our guys up front do a heck of a job blocking and I know we\u2019ve got the best quarterback in the league, the best receiver in the league. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all.\u201d\n\nThe rest of Bell\u2019s teammates welcomed him back, as well.\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s been working out hard, he\u2019s been involved, he\u2019s anxious to get back on the field and we\u2019ll welcome him back with open arms,\u201d tight end Heath Miller said.\n\nThe Steelers offense will get another boost in two more weeks when wide receiver Martavis Bryant, suspended for four games by the NFL for multiple positive drug tests, returns.\n\nEd Bouchette: ebouchette@post-gazette.com and Twitter @EdBouchette.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Veteran DeAngelo Williams fills in nicely for the reigning AFC rushing champion, who was suspended but will play Sunday in St. Louis.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "That wasn\u2019t the baton DeAngelo Williams passed to Le\u2019Veon Bell in the Steelers locker room Monday, but a towel.
