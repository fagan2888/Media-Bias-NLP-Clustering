She passed the word along to her NFL boyfriend.\n\n\u201cI heard so many great things about Dominick, and it is our honor to be here today to award him with the signed ball and a couple of tickets to the game,\u201d said Hynoski, who signed with the Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2011. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have this opportunity, he definitely deserves it for all the hard work he puts in, and it\u2019s really our pleasure to be here.\u201d\n\nAlthough he enjoyed a breakout season in 2012, passing for 2,135 yards, 16 touchdowns and nine rushing touchdowns, it was a difficult year for Trautz and his family off the field. Heather was unable to attend most of his games because she was hospitalized for most of the season.\n\nWith his mother in the hospital, Trautz was forced to look after his younger brother, Xavier Figueroa. When he wasn\u2019t in class or on the field, he was visiting his mother and helping her get through a difficult time both physically and mentally.\n\n\u201cAt the end of each game he would call me and tell me that \u2018I did this for you,\u2019\u201d said Heather Trautz, whose long-term prognosis is uncertain. \u201cI could not be more proud of him. He\u2019s supportive, he\u2019s caring, he\u2019s humble, and he is my rock.\u201d\n\nDespite juggling school, football, and his responsibilities at home, Trautz refuses to see any of it as being a burden.\n\nAfter all of his continued hard work, the lifelong Giants fan will finally get the chance to relax this Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to one or two games before, but to go to the \u2018Manning Bowl\u2019 for free is amazing, and I\u2019m very grateful that they came and gave their time to me,\u201d said Trautz, who will attend the game with his brother.\n\n\u201cNow, I can\u2019t help but keep on picturing my mother with the family back at Metlife Stadium for the state championship game.\u201d\n\nBut before he can root on \u201cBig Blue\u201d against Denver, he\u2019ll look to lead North Bergen to a 2-0 start when the Bruins host Montclair in today's 7 p.m. makeup game at Bruins Stadium.\n\n\u201cEvery game I play is dedicated to her and the goal now is to win a state championship for my team and for my family.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "north-bergen", "title": "Giants commend North Bergen quarterback with signed football, tickets to \"Manning Bowl\"", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Giants commend North Bergen quarterback with signed football, tickets to \\\"Manning Bowl\\\"\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/giants_commend_north_bergen_qu.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2013/09/13400035-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11240896\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-14T07:04:42Z\", \"author\": \"Michael Wright/The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"north-bergen\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/09/13400035-small.jpg", "description": "NORTH BERGEN  Dominick Trautz has more responsibilities than your average high school senior.\n\nAside from being a straight-A student and the senior quarterback of the North Bergen High School football team, his duties extend beyond the football field and classroom, as he is also responsible for taking care of his mother Heather, wh", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, September 15, 2013,  8:32 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2013/09/13400035-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mwrightJJournal\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michael Wright/The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"10728279\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "NORTH BERGEN  Dominick Trautz has more responsibilities than your average high school senior.\n\nAside from being a straight-A student and the senior quarterback of the North Bergen High School football team, his duties extend beyond the football field and classroom, as he is also responsible for taking care of his mother Heather, wh", "title": "Giants commend North Bergen quarterback with signed football, tickets to \"Manning Bowl\"", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/giants_commend_north_bergen_qu.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 14, 2013,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Michael Wright/The Jersey Journal", "Description": "NORTH BERGEN  Dominick Trautz has more responsibilities than your average high school senior.
