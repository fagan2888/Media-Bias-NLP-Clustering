Court of Appeals, which denied the petition to rehear the case with a full court, known as en banc.\n\n\"Essentially we were asking the full court to rehear a panel decision in which it upheld the H.H.S. mandate against our challenge on behalf of Priests for Life,\" Muise explains to OneNewsNow.\n\nThe court denied the petition for a rehearing \u2013 but that didn't end the Law Center's case on behalf of Priests for Life. Three of the judges dissented.\n\nMuise tells what happened next: \"And one judge in particular, Circuit Judge [Janice Rogers] Brown, wrote a very forceful dissent, which clearly demonstrates that the panel got the original decision wrong and that we should ultimately prevail in the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\n\nA sampling of those opinions can be read here via the Law Center's website.\n\nSo an appeal is in the works, with the Law Center hoping the strong dissenting opinions will convince the high court to review the case.
