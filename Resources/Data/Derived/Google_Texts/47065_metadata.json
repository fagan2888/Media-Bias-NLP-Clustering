It\u2019s a con. ObamaCare is unfixable.\n\n\u2018Joe Garcia is working to fix ObamaCare,\u201d says an ad for the Florida House Democrat. \u201cHe voted to let you keep your existing health plan and took the White House to task for the disastrous health care website.\u201d\n\nOf course, Garcia fails to mention ObamaCare is the reason millions lost their health plans to begin with. Or that its problems extend well beyond a glitchy website.\n\nBut this is the Democrats\u2019 midterm election strategy, as revealed in a memo Politico got its hands on this week: Admit that ObamaCare has flaws, promise to repair them and argue that Republicans will only make things worse. Party leaders point to polls showing more people favor repair than repeal.\n\nStill, why should anyone believe them?\n\nDemocrats already promised voters that ObamaCare would fix what was wrong with the nation\u2019s health care system, only to be caught in a web of lies. Now they\u2019re asking voters to trust them again to fix the very problems ObamaCare itself created.\n\nPlus, ObamaCare\u2019s flaws aren\u2019t theoretical any more. Millions have been hurt. They\u2019ve had plans canceled, gotten stuck with huge deductibles, lost access to their doctors or were priced out of the market altogether.\n\nCase in point is a recent news story noting how many ObamaCare enrollees in San Francisco \u201care struggling to find even one doctor willing to take new patients.\u201d\n\nAnother tells the story of a mechanic who can\u2019t find a physician to treat his debilitating back pain after ObamaCare forced him to drop his old plan and buy one through an exchange.\n\nAs every marketer knows, dissatisfied customers will tell twice as many people about their experience as will satisfied ones.\n\nBut the deeper problem with the Democrats\u2019 campaign promise is it\u2019s built on yet another lie: They can\u2019t fix ObamaCare. Nobody can. Its flaws are fundamental, not incidental. Any \u201cfixes\u201d just create new problems.\n\nObamaCare\u2019s sky-high premiums, for example, are an inevitable result of the regulations at the core of the law.\n\nThe ill effects of the employer mandate can\u2019t be avoided, unless the mandate itself is killed. But the mandate is there to keep companies from dumping workers into the exchanges and bloating ObamaCare\u2019s already massive price tag.\n\nObamaCare must get the young and healthy to enroll, but actively discourages them from doing so. Why buy an overpriced ObamaCare plan now, when you can wait and buy a subsidized plan, guaranteed, after you get sick?\n\nOn and on it goes.\n\nThere\u2019s a way to achieve ObamaCare\u2019s original goals of making insurance more affordable, protecting those with pre-existing conditions, improving efficiency and cutting the number of uninsured.\n\nBut it starts with killing ObamaCare and replacing it with market-based reforms already proven to work.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Promises: Vulnerable Democrats think they've found a winning strategy for the November elections: Tell voters they can fix ObamaCare, but Republicans won't let", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Promises: Vulnerable Democrats think they\u2019ve found a winning strategy for the November elections: Tell voters they can fix ObamaCare, but Republicans won\u2019t let them.
