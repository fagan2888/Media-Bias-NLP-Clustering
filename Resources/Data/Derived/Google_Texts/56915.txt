Expect another 1-2 inches of rain along and to the North of I-10 overnight.

JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Widespread rain is expected for most of us tonight. We've seen some very heavy rainfall at times, with the heavier showers dropping rain at the rate of 3 inches per hour. We've seen 6.5 inches of rain at Mayport so far, prompting minor flooding.

Persistent rain overnight will result in another 1-2 inches of rain along and to the North of I-10, with isolated pockets of heavier rain. Consistent showers Monday morning will be disruptive to the morning commute.

The strong gusty winds at the beaches will die down overnight and temperatures will sink into the upper 60s and low 70s.

Monday will be wet also, but drier days are right around the corner.
