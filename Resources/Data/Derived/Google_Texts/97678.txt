An 18-year-old Marboro Township man was injured Monday morning when his vehicle overturned and he was trapped in the wreckage, police said.

David M. Adoni, 18, of Morganville was trapped following the 11:41 a.m. crash at Route 520 between Middletown Road and Longbridge Road, according to police Lt. Michael Pigott.

“He left the roadway for unknown reasons and then we believe he overcompensated with the wheel and turned back too quickly causing the vehicle to roll over,” Pigott said.

Holmdel First Aid Squad and the Holmdel Fire Department were able to get Adoni out of the vehicle. Adoni was treated for injuries at the scene and taken to Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune for further treatment, Pigott said.

It was not immediately known whether Adoni was admitted.

The crash is under investigation by Patrolman John Maguire. He was assisted at the scene by Sgt. Charles Groder, Patrolman Michael Michalski and members of the Holmdel First Aid and fire companies.

Anyone who witnessed the crash should contact Maguire at 732-946-9690 ext. 1876.
