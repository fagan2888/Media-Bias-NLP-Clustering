Right Hooks The Most Distrusted Administration in History

In 2006, a relatively unknown U.S. senator named Barack Obama told an audience at the University of Nairobi, Kenya, that one of the most important values a government should foster is openness and integrity. “In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists — to protect them and to promote their common welfare — all else is lost,” Obama said. In 2007, as a candidate for president, he announced a plan to restore trust in government. “The American people want to trust in our government again,” he said. “We just need a government that will trust in us.” Throughout his presidency, Obama has repeatedly made a big deal out of restoring trust in government. And in June 2014, he declared, “Government is simply the name we give to the things we choose to do together.”

How’s all that Hope ‘n’ Change™ working out? Obama oversaw a government that lied about its care of veterans while awarding its top bureaucrats with bonuses. It targeted nonprofit conservative organizations though IRS investigations. Obama himself strong-armed wildly unpopular deals through Congress, such as ObamaCare and the treaty-that’s-not-a-treaty condoning Iran’s use of nuclear power. If these instances are not scandals, they are at least scandalous.

And then on Saturday, Gallup released a poll that found Americans' distrust in government has grown. When Obama was first in office, 66% of Americans said there is widespread corruption in the halls of government. That number has climbed to 75% today. Nice work, Obama.
