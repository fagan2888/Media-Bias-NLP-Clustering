One councilman wants to give poor, low-water users a break; another councilman wants billing to be more clear.\n\n\u2022 Water is pricey, power is pricey. What\u2019s a poor resident to do? Well, maybe move to Texas. As Slate reports, a weird thing happened the other day: \u201cThe so-called spot price of electricity in Texas fell toward zero, hit zero, and then went negative for several hours. As the Lone Star State slumbered, power producers were paying the state\u2019s electricity system to take electricity off their hands. At one point, the negative price was $8.52 per megawatt hour.\u201d\n\nAtkins Targets an Ally\n\nAssembly Speaker Toni Akins, our region\u2019s most powerful Democratic legislator, is going after the state Senate seat held by Democrat Marty Block.\n\nThis is a Big Deal. As the L.A. Times notes, this kind of internecine warfare is unusual for the Dems, who control the state Legislature and the governor\u2019s office. A high-profile fight would also suck up money that could be used to keep the GOP from getting more power.\n\nBut Atkins needs somewhere to land when she gets termed out. And she\u2019s apparently miffed because Block (allegedly) broke a promise to let her take his state Senate seat.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think she should defer to a man who approached her & asked her not to run in 2012, promising 1 term,\u201d tweeted her spokesman Dave Rolland.\n\nPoliticians, of course, break I-won\u2019t-run-again promises all the time, and it\u2019s hard to imagine why any voter would care about a supposedly private pledge. Then there\u2019s the matter of Block\u2019s denial that such a promise ever took place.\n\nAtkins knows she could be painted as a bully, and she even used that word in her chat with the L.A. Times. If she needs to fend off Block, a veteran and sharp politician just like her, she has lots of money in the bank to help her out.\n\nBut Block may gain on the financial front thanks to the stakes in the Dem-vs.-Dem drama in Sacramento. Meanwhile, there seems to be little if any talk about any actual political differences between Block and Atkins. Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez told us at our live podcast taping last month that there aren\u2019t any \u2014 and an Atkins challenge would simply be a personality contest between her and Block.\n\nLabor leader Mickey Kasparian expressed frustration that Dems are engaging in a civil war instead of challenging the Republican mayor.\n\nSara Libby rounded up who\u2019s on Team Atkins and who\u2019s on Team Block in the most recent Sacramento Report.\n\nFather Serra Still Stands Tall\n\nEach state gets to plant two statues in the U.S. Capitol building, and some choices are mighty peculiar. You\u2019ll find several traitorous Confederates, for instance, lining the halls of American power. Plus a disgraced politician or two, a comedian and only a handful of women.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s statues depict two almost-natives: Ronald Reagan and Father Junipero Serra. The latter is in the news: Pope Francis is scheduled to canonize him this week despite complaints from critics who say Father Serra doesn\u2019t deserve honors in stone or honors as a saint.\n\n\u201cNative American groups in California and nationwide say Serra is not deserving of sainthood because his missions subjected natives to corporal punishment and would not allow them to leave,\u201d USA Today reports.\n\n\u2022 Meanwhile, a modern-day cancer patient from San Diego writes in The Wall Street Journal about how \u201cwalking on Father Serra\u2019s old California mission trail has connected me with a wellspring of joy.\u201d\n\nThe patient, Edie Littlefield Sundby, wrote a controversial 2013 Wall Street Journal commentary blasting Obamacare based on her experience. She became a touchstone for critics of the Affordable Care Act, but critics blasted her opinion piece as misleading. As the L.A. Times reported, \u201cthere are signs that the Affordable Care Act might help save her \u2026 for (the Journal) to put her story out as if her insurance problems would disappear if only the Affordable Care Act ceased to exist is nothing short of malpractice.\u201d\n\nQuick News Hits\n\n\u2022 VOSD readers are clearly fascinated by the rapidly unfolding Marne Foster mess. Our hit parade is topped by three stories about the school board president\u2019s burgeoning scandal involving her son. Check the list of the week\u2019s Top 10 Most Popular Stories on our site here.\n\n\u2022 Rep. Duncan Hunter is advocating for a former soldier who was pulled from Afghanistan after standing up for children who were being sexually abused by the U.S.\u2019s Afghan allies. (New York Times)\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re at 97th on a new NerdWallet list ranking affordable metro areas for home buyers. Not even San Francisco or New York City ranked that poorly. Only three metro areas are worse: Honolulu, Los Angeles and McAllen, Texas (where incomes are very low).\n\nIt\u2019s not just that houses are so expensive here. The estimated 2015 family income here is $89,000, well below several other big metro areas with pricey homes.\n\nWhere\u2019s the most affordable place to live? Indianapolis, where families make a bit less ($81,000) but can afford a whole lot more square feet: 5,302 versus just 975 here.\n\nIndy sounds great! Except for the snow, the race cars and the annoying sitcom handyman next door.\n\nRandy Dotinga is a freelance contributor to Voice of San Diego and national president of the 1,200-member American Society of Journalists and Authors (asja.org).
