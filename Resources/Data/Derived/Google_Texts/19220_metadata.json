Under the plan, hospitals are required to accept bundled payments for hip and knee replacement procedures, for 90 days after admission.\n\nThe plan to cut the cost of care for millions of deteriorating knees and hips is Medicare's first mandatory test for hospitals moving to an alternative to the FFS model. Fee-for-services models traditionally incentivized volumes before outcomes.\n\nNursing homes should also prepare for a program of readmission penalties. A program will be rolled out in October with the financial penalties starting in 2018.\n\n\n\nOther changes and proposals include payroll-based, journal reporting of staffing (PBJ), requirements of participation revisions stemming from the Affordable Care Act and quality assurance and performance improvement (QAPI) facility assessments.\n\n\n\nFurther work also will be done on designing alternative care pathways, new operations processes and better partnering in patient transitions.\n\n\n\nAll of these rebuilding moves come as the industry consolidates in the face of lower occupancy rates in the lull before the baby boomers retire in droves. That generation is, at least, a decade or two away from their 80s, when long-term care in a skilled nursing facility is most likely.\n\nManaged care itself, however, also likely will push occupancy rates down as it cuts SNF utilization for post-acute services covered by Medicare by reducing stays and sending patients to lower-cost home-health services.\n\nSimilarly, expanding Medicaid funding for home and community-based services, including PACE programs, will transition lower acuity residents out of long-term care SNF units.\n\nDespite the possibility of lower occupancy rates, industry consolidation will help keep SNF prices high, as smaller facilities are selling out to mid-size organizations looking to grow to improve economies of scale.\n\nLarger SNF groups, meanwhile, are evaluating their portfolios, considering regional strategies and whether diversification makes sense.\n\nAt the same time, facility renovations are popular, as residents will continue to expect more private rooms and baths, which will reduce the number of available beds, as well as expensive amenities, such as high-end technology and on-demand dining.\n\nOther advice for nursing home owners and administrators looking ahead:\n\nAlign your incentives with the incentives of those who are paying for your services. Remember that your revenues are someone else's costs.\n\nMaintain at least a three-star (out of five) CMS ranking. Admittedly, this might be difficult with the new PBJ reporting.\n\nWork on increasing the ability to care for clinically complex patients. Many facilities are converting their staffing models to increase the number of RNs and reduce LPNs\n\nContinue to work on uniform data collection efforts, especially collecting the right data at admission.\n\nMaintain high-quality outcomes, while working to achieve length-of-stay efficiencies.\n\nBetsy Rust, CPA, is a consulting partner with Plante Moran's senior care and living practice.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "description": "Align your incentives with the incentives of those who are paying for your services.
