According to a new survey from consulting firm Oliver Wyman , just 19% of producers said it was \u201cworth their time\u201d to support individual exchange enrollment.The primary reasons for Obamacare discontent seem to be the White House\u2019s dismissal of the producer role, lack of commission payment by carriers and the size of the commission itself. In fact, 25% of producers told Oliver Wyman they expect commission to fall by 25% or more in the future.\u201cConsidering the time and effort put into it, I would categorically say the exchange wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d Dan Eich, president of Oak Insure in Olympia, Wash., told Insurance Business. \u201cWhen 2015 comes around, I will likely make the decision not to participate, except with my existing clients.\u201dEich said he has been snowed under since the exchange opened in October, working nights and weekends to service new individual applicants\u2014all without pay from carriers.\u201cI haven\u2019t been paid for any of these applications that have gone into the state system,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m certain the carriers will make payments eventually, but it\u2019s just taking forever for all the files to be transported from the state.\u201dEich\u2019s situation is certainly not unique. In fact, almost half of producers told Oliver Wyman they expect to focus less on health insurance post-reform.That\u2019s an attitude Orange County, Calif. agency owner Patrick Freeman said he can understand.\u201cAs a member of NAHU, I\u2019ve seen what\u2019s going on in other states and I can understand why agents are down on it,\u201d said Freeman, who runs Freeman Insurance Agency in Laguna Beach. \u201cWe weren\u2019t treated very well\u2014a number of states have tried to eliminate brokers without a lot of success.\u201dLike Eich, Freeman has not received full commission payments from carriers on the exchange. He is confident he will receive payment eventually, but is unsure whether he will continue taking on new clients during the 2015 enrollment period. He plans to do a profit and loss statement on this year\u2019s activity to \u201csee if it makes sense.\u201dHowever, like other survey respondents, Freeman is wary of how it may affect other portions of his business\u2014particularly if the open enrollment period coincides with that of Medicare.\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane. Putting these open enrollment periods of not of each other is total abuse of the system,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cMedicare is probably 60% to 70% of our business, and if the enrollment periods do coincide, our choice will be to take care of our Medicare clients and give minimal service to IFP clients.\u201dEich also plans on moving forward in different pursuits.\u201cSmall group is a large part of my business, so that\u2019s where my concentration will be,\u201d he said. \u201cIndividual is something I participate in because I have a fairly large book of business. As far as focusing in that area or trying to market that in the future, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201dGiven the results of the Oliver Wyman survey, this will likely be true of most agents and brokers.\u201cAnd that won\u2019t be good for the consumer,\u201d warned Freeman.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/producers-obamacare-wasnt-worth-it-17466.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/NoHandGuy(300x250).jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "Less than 20% of independents say it was worth their time to support individual enrollment in public exchange plans.", "title": "Producers: Obamacare wasn\u2019t worth it"}, "twitter": {"description": "Less than 20% of independents say it was worth their time to support individual enrollment in public exchange plans.", "title": "Producers: Obamacare wasn\u2019t worth it", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/producers-obamacare-wasnt-worth-it-17466.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/NoHandGuy(300x250).jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Less than 20% of independents say it was worth their time to support individual enrollment in public exchange plans.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd265d\"", "article_summary": "An overwhelming majority of independent agents and brokers who sold individual health plans through state and federal exchanges this year believe it wasn\u2019t worth the bother.\nIn fact, 25% of producers told Oliver Wyman they expect commission to fall by 25% or more in the future.\u201cConsidering the time and effort put into it, I would categorically say the exchange wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d Dan Eich, president of Oak Insure in Olympia, Wash., told Insurance Business.\nPutting these open enrollment periods of not of each other is total abuse of the system,\u201d Freeman said.\nAccording to a new survey from consulting firm Oliver Wyman , just 19% of producers said it was \u201cworth their time\u201d to support individual exchange enrollment.The primary reasons for Obamacare discontent seem to be the White House\u2019s dismissal of the producer role, lack of commission payment by carriers and the size of the commission itself.\n\u201cIndividual is something I participate in because I have a fairly large book of business."}
