Until now, public health plans really only covered families and the elderly, leaving young men, who disproportionately fill our prison cells, with few options for affordable coverage.\n\nGetting this population insured is a major priority for public health officials. Under prison realignment, which requires California to reduce prison overcrowding, the corrections department is speeding up the pace of releases and sending more former inmates into the community. Currently, 90 percent re-enter the community without health insurance, according to Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, a nonprofit that advocates for better connectivity between jails and health providers.\n\nUnder ACA, those still in prison will continue to get care through the state and county corrections systems. But, starting next year, they\u2019ll be eligible for Medi-Cal once they\u2019re released. The can also participate in the state-run insurance exchange, Covered California.\n\nIdeally, inmates should start the enrollment process before they\u2019re out. If they don\u2019t, they should talk to the counselors and social service providers they\u2019re put in touch with through the re-entry process \u2013 folks like Harris.\n\nThe Orders: Connect with Covered California and trained helpers.\n\nA better question might be: \u201cHow does Harris find the information his clients need?\u201d\n\nAfter contacting Second Opinion, Harris got in touch with the San Ysidro Health Center and is having someone there come out to talk to his clients about their options.\n\nThe health center is one of several local organizations getting trained by Covered California to offer enrollment assistance. Others include Family Health Centers of San Diego, Neighborhood Healthcare, 2-1-1 San Diego and SAY San Diego.\n\nCheck out last week\u2019s Second Opinion: Is It Cheaper to Pay the Fine Than to Buy Coverage?\n\nDisclosure: Coming Home to Stay is partially funded by The California Endowment, which also funds Speak City Heights.\n\nVoice of San Diego is a nonprofit that depends on you, our readers.
