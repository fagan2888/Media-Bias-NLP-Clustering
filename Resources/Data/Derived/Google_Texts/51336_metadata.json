A runaway trolley barrels toward five unsuspecting people. You\u2019re standing on a bridge above the tracks and realize you may be able to stop the trolley by dropping something heavy in its path, like, say, that fat man standing next to you. Do you push him?\n\nThe problem began as a philosopher\u2019s tool to advance abstract ethics arguments. But eventually it found its way into actual experiments by psychologists and neurologists, who asked the question to study the way people make decisions. In a new paper in the journal Social and Personality Psychology Compass, four business ethicists say that\u2019s taking the trolley too far. It\u2019s just too unrealistic. Why are five people on the tracks? Why aren\u2019t they paying attention? Is anyone actually fat enough to stop a trolley? Who uses the word trolley?\n\nMedical Daily spoke with one of the authors, Dr. Christopher W. Bauman of the University of California, Irvine, to find out why he says the trolley problem has had its day. (We\u2019ve edited for clarity and brevity.)\n\nDid you encounter the trolley problem in your own college courses?\n\nI actually use the trolley problem when teaching ethics, and I think it can be a very useful illustrator of different types of reasoning. It was created by philosophers who are interested in figuring out the normative answer, or what people ought to do. Our concern is that these scenarios have been co-opted and applied in really the wrong way.\n\nFor example?\n\nThere are some incredibly well-known studies. One of them was published in Science. It\u2019s been cited almost 1,000 times in about [13] years since publication. In this particular study, the researchers put people in an fMRI scanner. They showed them the trolley problem and other similar scenarios. And their conclusions were that these particular scenarios solicited moral judgment and that now we know a lot about moral judgment based on these scenarios.\n\nWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\n\nWhat we\u2019re arguing in our paper is that these scenarios are unlike any moral judgment that people actually engage in in their real lives. It\u2019s not common to confront a situation that gives you this binary choice that\u2019s as plain as day. And also it\u2019s pretty amusing. If you really want to study the way people manage moral dilemmas, why are doing that using stimuli that are funny, bizarre and sometimes betray the laws of physics?\n\nBut isn\u2019t the trolley problem just a proxy for other, real-life problems?\n\nIf we are to believe in the experimental method, then we want control over as many factors as we possibly can so that we minimize the extraneous influences on people\u2019s choice. If we\u2019re using highly stylized scenarios that people freely associate from, we\u2019re leaving many things to chance, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily give us a clean way of testing our hypotheses.\n\nWhat do you propose then instead of the trolley problem?\n\nManagers often have to figure out, \u201cWho do I lay off and who do I retain?\u201d Drug manufacturers make these kinds of decisions all the time. You have side effects; what\u2019s a reasonable level of tolerance? There are real-world parallels to the basic structure of the trolley dilemma. But why not study how they appear in the real world in believable contexts rather than pushing some fat man off a bridge and his body\u2019s going to stop a train from maiming five people?\n\nSource: D.M.
