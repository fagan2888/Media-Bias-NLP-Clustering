Nerdland got a little somber Saturday morning as MSNBC’s Melissa Harris-Perry addressed the controversial remarks she made last week regarding 2012 Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s family in a tearful and heartfelt apology.

Harris-Perry began her show speaking about a segment that aired last Sunday. The episode featured a panel of comedians poised to joke about the lack of diversity in the Republican party at the expense of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s grandson, Kieran, who is adopted. The panelists and Harris-Perry’s comments sparked a media firestorm, one that prompted an apology from the MSNBC host.

“Whatever the intent was, the reality is that the segment proceeded in a way that was offensive. And showing the photo in that context, that segment, was poor judgment. So without reservation or qualification, I apologize to the Romney family,” Harris-Perry said. “Adults who enter into public life, implicitly consent to having less privacy. But their families, especially their children, should not be treated callously or thoughtlessly. My intention was not malicious, but I broke the ground-rule that families are off-limits. For that I am sorry.”

She then proceeded to speak on the topic of trans-racial adoption, a topic which left Harris-Perry emotional as she began to choke up.

“Also, Allow me to apologize to other families formed through trans-racial adoption, because I am deeply sorry that we suggested that interracial families are in any way funny or deserving of ridicule,” she said.

Harris-Perry first apologized for the panel’s comments via Twitter on Tuesday using the #MHPapology. Gov. Romney is expected to address the MSNBC host’s comments during an appearance on Fox News Sunday tomorrow.
