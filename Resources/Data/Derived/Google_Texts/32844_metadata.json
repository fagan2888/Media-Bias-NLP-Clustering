They were supposed to be small-scale single-payer systems that would be free from the profit motive; a progressive's dream solution to the problem of providing health insurance for all.\n\nInstead, they've turned into a nightmare. So far, 12 of the 23 co-ops have failed, defaulting on more than $1.2 billion in federal loans. Only two have been able to break even so far, and most of the remaining co-ops are eyeing massive premium increases\u2014as high as 40 percent in some cases\u2014to stay solvent.\n\nA government program being poorly run is nothing new, of course. But the co-ops established under the health care law were subject to a series of regulations that make you wonder how they were ever supposed to succeed in the first place.\n\n\"It should be no surprise that so many of them are going belly-up,\" said John Davidson, director of health policy for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, on the latest edition of the Watchdog Podcast. \"The rules that they put on these co-ops almost set them up to fail.\"\n\nFor starters, the co-ops were barred from hiring anyone who had served at an executive level at any health insurance company in the country.\n\nThink about that for a second. This was essentially a brand new business venture that was prevented from relying on the expertise of anyone who might have the slightest idea what they were doing.\n\nAnother regulation prevented the co-ops from raising any capital aside from what was provided via those federal loans. Other rules prevented the co-ops from being allowed to turn a profit, and if one happened to accidentally make money anyway, it wasn't allowed to use its profits to help it grow.\n\nIt's the kind of business plan that would be laughed out of a business school classroom.\n\n\"The co-ops were essentially amateur exercises,\" said Davidson. \"Running a health insurance company and keeping it actuarially sound is a difficult thing to do, under the best of circumstances.\"\n\nRepublicans are eager to make the failures of the co-ops look like a major disaster for Democrats who backed the overhaul and particularly for the progressives who pushed for the inclusion of the pseudo-single-payer-programs.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a political nightmare, but it's a real life nightmare too.\n\nSeveral hundred thousand people\u2014more than 100,000 in New York alone, where the nation's largest co-op is now going under\u2014stand to lose their health insurance as a result of the implosions. Even those who don't lose coverage altogether face the prospect of paying significantly higher premiums.\n\n\"There were some hopes and pray\u00aders as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adated with the co-ops that were prob\u00adably un\u00adreal\u00adist\u00adic,\" Larry Levitt, a seni\u00ador vice pres\u00adid\u00adent at the Kais\u00ader Fam\u00adily Found\u00ada\u00adtion, told National Journal's Caitlin Owens last week. \"The sup\u00adport for the co-ops was as much ideo\u00adlo\u00adgic\u00adal as prag\u00admat\u00adic. The way they emerged was so bizarre.\"\n\nAs Owens' detailed piece goes on to explain, there is a long history behind the sudden failure of so many of the co-op programs.\n\nBut the rules and regulations written into the text of the law makes it hard to believe there was ever much of a chance for the co-ops to succeed.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "It's been a very bad month for the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Why Obamacare Co-Ops Keep Failing", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/11/26/why-obamacare-co-ops-keep-failing", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14484864723669.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14484864723669.jpg", "description": "It's been a very bad month for the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Obamacare Co-Ops Keep Failing"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Must Reads", "published_time": "2015-11-26T11:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/eric-boehm"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "For starters, the co-ops were barred from hiring anyone who had served at an executive level at any health insurance company in the country.\n\"Running a health insurance company and keeping it actuarially sound is a difficult thing to do, under the best of circumstances.\"\nAnother regulation prevented the co-ops from raising any capital aside from what was provided via those federal loans.\nThey were supposed to be small-scale single-payer systems that would be free from the profit motive; a progressive's dream solution to the problem of providing health insurance for all.\nOther rules prevented the co-ops from being allowed to turn a profit, and if one happened to accidentally make money anyway, it wasn't allowed to use its profits to help it grow."}
