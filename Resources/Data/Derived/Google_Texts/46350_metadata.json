It puts literally all families below the poverty level if one works less than 40 hours per week.\n\nThe US government poverty guidelines of the government follows \u2013 although depending on the interpretation of the specific agency and state \u2013 these numbers could be pretax or post-tax because the government guidelines do not specify:\n\nHousehold Size Poverty threshold Hours needed to work to exceed Poverty threshold Obamacare Part time Max Income 1 $11,490 1532 $10,875 2 15,510 2139 10,875 3 19,530 3582 10,875 4 23,550 3248 10,875\n\nConsider that 2000 hours are equal to a year working, and except for a single person on their own, this is not even close to a living wage for a family if there is only one bread winner. Now consider that most non-full time employment at retailers will likely fall to 1500 hours per year due to Obamacare.\n\nHouston \u2013 we have a problem \u2026. The law of unintended consequences over health care have made the existing minimum wage which was already too low problematic even with subsidies. The political wheels are turning \u2013 bringing the attention of the pundits and dumbed down masses to a few major retailers who help their employees get government assistance.\n\nEven the big gun \u2013 Nobel Laureat Paul Krugman opined this week:\n\nStill, even if international competition isn\u2019t an issue, can we really help workers simply by legislating a higher wage? Doesn\u2019t that violate the law of supply and demand? Won\u2019t the market gods smite us with their invisible hand? The answer is that we have a lot of evidence on what happens when you raise the minimum wage. And the evidence is overwhelmingly positive: hiking the minimum wage has little or no adverse effect on employment, while significantly increasing workers\u2019 earnings.\n\nIf you have the time, you can scan the \u201clot of evidence\u201d \u2013 and if you are not already too biased, you will realize the empirical evidence is fairly weak \u2013 but that does not diminish that families cannot live on minimum wage. One of the primary arguments is that minimum wage has not kept up to inflation \u2013 the answer depends on how you index minimum wage, and how you view the CPI \u2013 but this argument is weak also.\n\nIt seems like the minimum wage has kept up with inflation for most periods since 1955. If the minimum wage was okay in 1955, should it not be okay today? Could the inflation index be flawed? Or is the current poverty level calculation flawed (too high)?\n\nNote: If we picked a reference year between 1975 and 1980, minimum wage would have lagged inflation for much if the intervening time since.\n\nWill increasing the minimum wage help? Like everything \u2013 there will be winners and losers. The losers will be the lower income families who are not benefited by the raise in the minimum wage \u2013 but will have to bear the higher costs which likely will be passed along.\n\nDoes this mean politicians should do nothing? Is it acceptable that income disparity continues to grow? Has the government shown they can manage the unintended consequences of their growing involvement in a languishing economy?\n\nMy concern about screwing with the minimum wage is with the laws of supply and demand \u2013 it is telling us that there are too many workers and not enough jobs. There is not a chance that increasing the minimum wage even begins to address this issue. Minimum wage is not a problem if there are more than one household worker. The real problem is not enough jobs being created in an economy which has been mismanaged for over ten years.\n\nDo not take this post as suggesting that the minimum wage should not be studied and/or adjusted, but it is an argument that the minimum wage is not the core problem \u2013 and that any solution limited to simply adjusted minimum wage could lead further unintended consequences.\n\nOther Economic News this Week:\n\nThe Econintersect economic forecast for December 2013 again improved. What this forecast cannot see is the real effect of austerity and Obamacare \u2013 but it does see that business is betting the effects on the economy will be minimal.\n\nThe ECRI WLI growth index value has been weakly in positive territory for over four months \u2013 but in a noticeable improvement trend. The index is indicating the economy six month from today will be slightly better than it is today.\n\nCurrent ECRI WLI Growth Index\n\n/images/z weekly_indexes.PNG\n\nInitial unemployment claims went from 316,000 (reported last week) to 298,000 this week. Historically, claims exceeding 400,000 per week usually occur when employment gains are less than the workforce growth, resulting in an increasing unemployment rate. The real gauge \u2013 the 4 week moving average \u2013 improved from 331,750 (reported last week) to 322,250. Because of the noise (week-to-week movements from abnormal events AND the backward revisions to previous weeks releases), the 4-week average remains the reliable gauge.\n\nWeekly Initial Unemployment Claims \u2013 4 Week Average \u2013 Seasonally Adjusted \u2013 2011 (red line), 2012 (green line), 2013 (blue line)\n\n/images/z unemployment.PNG\n\nBankruptcies this Week: OCZ Technology Group\n\nData released this week which contained economically intuitive components (forward looking) were:\n\nRail movements growth trend is continuing to accelerate.\n\nAll other data released this week either does not have enough historical correlation to the economy to be considered intuitive, or is simply a coincident indicator to the economy.\n\nWeekly Economic Release Scorecard:", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "81mKPeNoK2AdXUzIIgladUq0VieusTnqUAUxuRpnjes", "blogcatalog": "9BC9564332", "description": "A new economics based website.
