This will allow for job growth of around 160,000 per month next year, pushing the unemployment rate down from its current 5.0 percent to 4.6 percent in late 2016,\u201d Faucher wrote in a note to investors.\n\nHe said the recent decision by the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates from zero would have little impact on the economy.\n\n\u201cA gradual increase in the federal funds rate will not be a significant weight on growth in 2016,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough the Federal Open Market Committee did raise the rate earlier this month, it is still very low, in a range of 0.25-0.50 percent. PNC expects three more 0.25 percentage point increases in 2016, which would bring the rate up to 1.00-1.25 percent at the end of next year.\u201d\n\nRelated: Cheap Oil and Pricey Unicorns: The 20 Biggest Business Stories of 2015\n\nWhite House Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman, in a blog post Tuesday put the best possible face on the data.\n\n\u201cThird-quarter economic growth continued at a solid pace as domestic demand grew robustly,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSlowing foreign growth continues to weigh on output in the United States, underscoring the importance of policies that promote continued strong and consistent domestic demand.\n\n\u201cLast week\u2019s omnibus budget and tax agreement will help encourage these positive domestic trends. But there is more work to do, and the president remains committed to policies that will boost our long-run growth and wages: including opening our exports to new markets through high-standards free trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and raising the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nIn an election year, of course, little of consequence is likely to happen on the legislative side of the policymaking process, which means that the economy will have to sputter along as best it can without much help from Washington.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A slight downward revision to the estimate of Gross Domestic Product in the third quarter of this year to 2.0 percent adds to economic forecasters\u2019 sense that over the next few quarters, the U.S. economy will continue to experience sold, if unspectacular, growth.", "title": "Slowly and Unspectacularly, the U.S. Economy Chugs Toward 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Slowly-and-Unspectacularly-US-Economy-Chugs-Toward-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-economy_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/Slowly-and-Unspectacularly-US-Economy-Chugs-Toward-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-economy_3.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A slight downward revision to the estimate of Gross Domestic Product in the third quarter of this year to 2.0 percent adds to economic forecasters\u2019 sense that over the next few quarters, the U.S. economy will continue to experience sold, if unspectacular, growth.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cLast week\u2019s omnibus budget and tax agreement will help encourage these positive domestic trends.\n\u201cA gradual increase in the federal funds rate will not be a significant weight on growth in 2016,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cPNC is forecasting real GDP growth of 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter, and then 2.4 percent in 2016.\n\u201cThird-quarter economic growth continued at a solid pace as domestic demand grew robustly,\u201d he wrote.\nHe said the recent decision by the Federal Reserve to begin raising interest rates from zero would have little impact on the economy."}
