Rick Scott who said the federal government should not link the $1.3 billion in uncompensated care funding with the state\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid. He has threatened a lawsuit against the Obama administration if it cuts off the funding, which is set to expire June 30.\n\nThe Texas funding is scheduled to end in September 2016. Officials there have also expressed indignation at what they perceive to be coercive pressure and talked about joining Scott\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nKansas Medicaid officials said they received about $45 million this year in federal funding for their state uncompensated care program, which began in 2013 and is slated to continue through 2017.\n\nTennessee Medicaid spokewoman Kelly Gunderson said her state gets over $750 million in federal funding to cover uncompensated care.\n\nThe first message was delivered in an April 14 letter from Vikki Wachino, acting director of the Center For Medicaid and CHIP Services, to Florida Medicaid officials. She said that expanding Medicaid coverage is a better way to help residents get access to health care than an \u201coverreliance on supplemental payments\u201d to providers through a program called the Low Income Pool, or LIP.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion would reduce uncompensated care in the state, and therefore have an impact on the [Low-Income Pool], which is why the state\u2019s expansion status is an important consideration in our approach regarding extending the LIP beyond June,\u201d she wrote.\n\nCMS spokesman Aaron Albright said Tuesday the Obama administration wants to apply similar principles to all the states that receive such funding, whether or not they expanded Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in contact with those states that have uncompensated care pools and reiterated that we look forward to an ongoing dialogue to develop a solution that works for patients, hospitals and the taxpayer,\u201d he said. \u201cWe told states that our letter to Florida articulates key principles CMS will use in considering proposals regarding uncompensated care pool programs in their states, but that discussions with each state will also take into account state-specific circumstances.\u201d\n\nCMS officials confirmed they have also reached out to states that expanded Medicaid about the future criteria for the funding, including California, Massachusetts, Arizona, Hawaii and New Mexico.\n\nEach state has negotiated its own program with the federal government to pay providers for treating the uninsured. But the programs differ in scope, funding and length of time remaining.\n\nJudy Solomon of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the special federal funding that some states negotiated for uncompensated care was never supposed to last indefinitely. The need for the funding changed dramatically as millions of people gained health coverage under the health law, she said.\n\n\u201cThese demonstration programs are at the discretion of the Secretary of HHS and there is no entitlement to any state or providers to continue these funding arrangements when they expire,\u201d Solomon said, adding, \u201cThe need for uncompensated care funding is changing dramatically.\u201d\n\nArizona Medicaid spokeswoman Monica Higuera Coury said her state, which did expand Medicaid, was also told that the special funding would begin to be phased out this year. Arizona receives a maximum $137 million a year to offset uncompensated care costs at Phoenix Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cWe are looking forward to working with \u2026CMS to put a transition plan together that moves us away from total reliance on the [funding] while still protecting this very important safety net for our children,\u201d she said.\n\nSome experts were surprised the Obama administration linked Medicaid expansion to the special funding because of the potential legal issues.\n\n\u201cNo one would be shocked to hear that states don\u2019t need the money because uncompensated care has dropped \u2026 but saying you are taking away this money because you are not expanding is trickier,\u201d said Charlene Frizzera, a senior advisor at consulting firm Leavitt Partners. \u201cPeople are shocked that CMS has done that.\u201d\n\nBut Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center For Children and Families, said the administration was simply acting as a steward of taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it hardball, but rather responsible policy and fiscal oversight to ensure that federal tax dollars are spent in the most effective way,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen coverage is available to reduce the number of uninsured people \u2026 and states refuse those funds, why should the federal government provide them with unauthorized funding to put a Band-Aid on it?\u201d\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
