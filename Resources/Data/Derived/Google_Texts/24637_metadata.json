Marco Rubio, who's running for president in 2016, is known for his stances on immigration and tax reform. Here's the Florida Republican's take on Obamacare, the Islamic State and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nMarco Rubio, as you almost certainly know by now, is the most naturally talented candidate running for the Republican presidential nomination. He's a gifted debater and tells his personal story compellingly. He's proven to be a successful wooer of big-dollar GOP donors and an effective counterpuncher when attacked by his one-time mentor, Jeb Bush.\n\nAmid all those accolades -- and Rubio has earned them -- has been a consistent whisper from rival campaigns: Rubio is neither spending the time in early-voting states that other candidates are, nor is he building the sorts of voter identification and turnout operations in early states that others are. Here's how WaPo's Sean Sullivan and Karen Tumulty described Rubio's problems in a story over the weekend:\n\nRepublican activists \u2014 including many who appreciate Rubio\u2019s formidable political gifts and view him as the party\u2019s best hope for beating Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton \u2014 say they are alarmed at his seeming disdain for the day-to-day grind of retail politics. Even some staunch supporters are anxious.\n\nThere are two ways of looking at what Rubio is up to here.\n\n\n\nMarco Rubio. (AP Photo/Mary Schwalm)\n\n1. His campaign made a decision to use his natural abilities -- as displayed via the debates -- to get his support up in early state and national polling rather than going the more traditional route of lavishing the candidate's time on Iowa and New Hampshire over the spring and summer to create momentum. Now that Rubio is widely regarded as a top-tier candidate, he can build the sort of organizations -- and on-the-ground excitement -- he needs to win one of the early-voting states, the argument goes. (South Carolina looks like Rubio's best bet of the first three states; Nevada, which votes fourth, may be where he is running strongest.) And, as voters start to dial in, Rubio is making sure he is now in front of them; \"no candidate spent more time meeting voters in all the early states in December than Marco,\" Rubio communications director Alex Conant told me. According to the campaign's internal calculations, Rubio has spent 15 days in Iowa, 11 in New Hampshire, eight in South Carolina and five in Nevada.\n\n2. Rubio's campaign fundamentally believes that the wall-to-wall cable news coverage of the race coupled with the rise of social media and the presence of Donald Trump in the mix have fundamentally turned the race into a national primary in which the traditional care and feeding of early-state voters may matter less than a more-generalized sense of buzz and momentum.\n\nThe Rubio folks would have you believe that #1 is the explanation, solely. I tend to believe it's a bit of a combination -- they did make a big gamble that momentum could come top down rather than button up. As in, Rubio would shine in debates, which he has, and that would lead to excitement and a rise in poll numbers in early states. National campaign first, then a state and local one. Which is the opposite of how all of the other candidates not named \"Trump\" are running. (Chris Christie is the prototypical bottom-up candidate; he has lavished New Hampshire with time in hopes of convincing Granite State voters that he deserves a look; polling suggests that Christie's approach is working too.)\n\nTo date, the Rubio strategy has paid off. He is now widely regarded as the establishment favorite in the race -- winning over a steady stream of big-money Republican donors and hovering in low double digits in both key early-state and national polling.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) came out swinging during the CNBC debate and had some big applause lines. See his most memorable moments of the third Republican debate. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post)\n\nThe question that won't be answered until Iowa voters caucus on Feb. 1 is whether the relative lack of emphasis that Rubio and his team have put on building organizations in the first two voting states will come home to roost. Organization can't be built in a month, particularly when you are competing against other candidates -- namely Ted Cruz -- who have been at this for the better part of the last year.\n\nBut, what if organization -- as traditionally defined in politics -- is overrated in an election like this one where a real estate developer who has never held office before is the clear front-runner for the party's nomination? What if this election amounts to one big national primary where the candidates running ahead at the national level are the ones who win the early states? Where popularity and buzz supplant precinct captains as the coin of the political realm?\n\nThat's the gamble -- and the secret -- at the heart of Rubio's campaign. The Florida senator casts himself on the campaign trail as one of a new generation of leaders, breaking with the ways of the past to find new solutions to longtime problems. The campaign he has built -- and the way he's executing it -- suggest a radical commitment to shaking up the established order.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Florida senator is making a major gamble on organization.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Florida senator is making a major gamble on organization.", "title": "Here\u2019s the dirty little secret of Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/21/heres-the-dirty-little-secret-of-marco-rubios-campaign/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-12-21/AP/GOP_2016_Rubio-081df.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thefix"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/12/21/heres-the-dirty-little-secret-of-marco-rubios-campaign/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Marco Rubio; Rubio 2016; Rubio for president", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/chris.cillizza"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Marco Rubio; Rubio 2016; Rubio for president"}, "article_summary": "That's the gamble -- and the secret -- at the heart of Rubio's campaign.\nSen.
