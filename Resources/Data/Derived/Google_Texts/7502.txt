British-born actress Emily Blunt recently drew attention for saying that she regretted becoming an American citizen after watching the first GOP debate. Today, Blunt talked with Savannah Guthrie on Today, where she apologized for the offense cause by her “off-hand joke.”

“It was so not the intention to hurt anybody or cause any offense, so I really apologize to those that I caused offense,” Blunt said. “I think I’ll probably leave the political jokes to late night or something.”

Blunt’s comments were made at the Toronto Film Festival, where she joked about how she thought after the first debate, “this was a terrible mistake. What have I done?’

Blunt said that the day she earned her citizenship was indeed, a “special day,” bringing up her joy to share the same citizenry as her husband (John Krasinksi) and their daughter. She also commented on what she learned while preparing for the citizenship test.

“There was a lot I learned about the Constitution and American history,” Blunt said. “I think I know more about American history than I do British history, which is interesting.”
