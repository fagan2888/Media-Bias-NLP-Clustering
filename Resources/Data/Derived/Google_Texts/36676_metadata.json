No, I mean, I'm just stating the facts.\u201d \u201cAnother candidate boasts that he introduced an amendment to end nationwide marriage equality -- which isn\u2019t even an accomplishment at all. A third says Americans should just disobey the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling entirely. I'm sure he loves the Constitution -- except for Article III. And maybe the Equal Protection Amendment. And the 14th Amendment, generally,\u201d Obama continued, referring to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R), both of whom stood by Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to LGBT couples.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS In this Sept. 8, 2015, file photo, Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, with Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee at her side, greets the crowd after being released from the Carter County Detention Center, in Grayson, Ky.

Easley, File)\n\nAfter listing off a few of his administration\u2019s signature accomplishments, Obama took another shot at \u201cthe busload of Republicans fighting each other for this job\" for using him as a political punching bag. \u201cIn their world, everything was terrific back in 2008 when we were in the midst of a spiral into the worst financial crisis and economic crisis since the Great Depression, when unemployment and uninsured rates were rising and when our economy was shedding jobs each month, and we were mired in two wars, hopelessly addicted to foreign oil, and bin Laden was still at large,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThose were the Golden Years, apparently. And then, I came in and messed it all up.\u201d \u201cYou got to give these folks credit for chutzpah,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd so since everything was doing so well back in 2007-2008, now if we can just repeal Obamacare, and gut Wall Street reform, and shut down our government over women\u2019s access to health care, and deny that the planet is getting warmer, they\u2019ve got a plan to get us back on track.\u201d\n\nMANDEL NGAN via Getty Images US President Barack Obama (L) hugs Jim Obergefell, who introduced him, as he arrives on stage to speak at the Democratic National Committee LGBT Gala at Gotham Hall in New York, New York on September 27, 2015. AFP PHOTO/MANDEL NGAN\n\nReturning to the main topic of the evening, Obama celebrated his policy achievements that benefited LGBT Americans, including his decision to overturn the military\u2019s ban on openly gay soldiers, his executive order banning workplace discrimination against LGBT individuals employed by the federal government and federal contractors, as well as this year\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s ruling legalizing gay marriage nationwide. The lead plaintiff in the case, Jim Obergefell, introduced Obama at Sunday\u2019s fundraiser. The president also heralded the country\u2019s evolving attitudes toward gay rights, noting it was a highly divisive political issue that not many Americans supported. \u201cTime after time, the cynics told us that we were foolish to keep believing, that we were na\u00efve to hope, that change was too messy or not possible at all. And if you admit it, there were some in this room here who were skeptical that everything that needed to happen would happen. The cynics were wrong. Tonight, we live in an America where \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 is something that \u2018don\u2019t exist,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe live in an America where a growing share of older generations recognize that love is love, and younger generations don't even know what all the fuss was about. And tonight, thanks to the unbending sense of justice passed down through generations of citizens who never gave up hope that we could bring this country closer to our founding ideals -- that all of us are created equal -- we now live in America where our marriages are equal as well.\u201d\n\nMANDEL NGAN via Getty Images US President Barack Obama waves after speaking at the Democratic National Committee LGBT Gala at Gotham Hall in New York, New York on September 27, 2015. AFP PHOTO/MANDEL NGAN\n\nObama acknowledged that there was more work to be done in advancing LGBT rights, telling the audience that \u201cto secure the gains this country has made requires continued vigilance.\u201d He also reiterated his call for a ban on conversion therapy for LGBT youth. Noting that it will take time for some Americans to embrace LGBT rights, Obama took yet another jab at Republicans by calling out those who cited religious freedom as a motive for obstructing LGBT rights. \u201cWe affirm that we cherish our religious freedom and are profoundly respectful of religious traditions. But we also have to say clearly that our religious freedom doesn\u2019t grant us the freedom to deny our fellow Americans their constitutional rights,\u201d he said. \u201cEven as we are respectful and accommodating genuine concerns and interests of religious institutions, we need to reject politicians who are supporting new forms of discrimination as a way to scare up votes. That's not how we move America forward.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nPoliticians React To Gay Marriage Ruling 48\n\nPoliticians React To Gay Marriage Ruling\n\n1 of 48 President Barack Obama Share this slide:\n\nToday is a big step in our march toward equality.
