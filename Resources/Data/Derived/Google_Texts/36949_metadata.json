The protest also coincided with the return of the legislature for the first time since it passed the state\u2019s controversial Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, otherwise known as HB 2, a measure which nullified all local nondiscrimination ordinances and banned transgender people from using government building bathrooms in accordance with their gender identities.\n\nYet Moral Monday activists are hardly through with the so-called \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d said the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, president of the North Carolina NAACP and the movement\u2019s most visible leader. Quite the contrary \u2014 they\u2019re as fired up as ever.\n\nRELATED: NCAA goes soft on North Carolina after House Bill 2\n\n\u201cWe are planning on coming back. Because we have to,\u201d Barber told reporters gathered inside the Martin Street Baptist Church, about a mile away from the General Assembly, during a press conference in Raleigh Tuesday. \u201cYou cannot allow this kind of hate, this kind of a merging together of racism, homophobia, sexism, classism to go unchallenged.\u201d\n\nStanding alongside several North Carolinians who were arrested the week prior, Barber announced another Moral Monday event would take place on May 16. In true Moral Monday fashion, he gave few details about what the next protest would look like. However, he did not rule out the possibility of more arrests.\n\n\u201cRemember, now, that\u2019s our house. That\u2019s the people\u2019s house,\u201d Barber said of the Legislative Building. \u201cWe don\u2019t go to be arrested; we go to exercise our constitutional right to instruct our legislature. If we go in a person\u2019s office to sit in there and wait to meet with them and they chose to arrest us, really, they have the problem.\u201d\n\nThe Moral Monday protests began in the spring of 2013 \u2014 the first year that Republicans held total control of North Carolina\u2019s government since 1896. Traditionally, the Tar Heel state had been a rare bastion of moderation in the otherwise reliably conservative South. But with Republican Gov. Pat McCrory in office and a GOP supermajority in the legislature, North Carolina underwent a hard-right shift ushered in by legislation that cut education funding, rejected Obamacare, restricted abortion access, and made it more difficult for people to vote.\n\nAt its peak, the Moral Monday movement staged almost weekly protests and rallies at the General Assembly with hundreds of people arrested. Still, Republicans were able to hold onto their majorities in the state legislature during the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nRELATED: Ted Cruz responds to Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s bathroom break\n\nFor many, HB 2 \u2014 a measure that was passed in a one-day special session last March and quickly provoked a national corporate backlash \u2014 may have been a bridge too far.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a 54-year-old straight, white, married woman, who had never protested anything before,\u201d said Lisa Leonard, a Raleigh native, during Tuesday\u2019s press conference. \u201cBut this legislation and the way it was passed was for me, the last straw.\u201d\n\nBecause of the number and nature of seats up for election in 2016, not to mention the fact that North Carolina is one the most-gerrymandered states in the country, Democrats have essentially no shot at taking control of either the state Senate or the state House of Representatives come November. But they could win a crucial prize in the governor\u2019s race, where McCrory has taken a major hit in the polls since the passage of HB 2.\n\nNot that electing a Democratic governor is Barber\u2019s main objective. Rather, he insists the Moral Monday movement is strictly nonpartisan. At the press conference Tuesday, Barber made a point of stressing that everyone \u2014 regardless of race, gender, or party affiliation \u2014 was welcome to join the movement\u2019s efforts. Frequently, he and other activists tied the current push to roll back LGBT rights in North Carolina to the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, when activists faced similar arguments that racial segregation was necessary to protect women and girls. He also highlighted HB 2\u2019s lesser-known repercussions \u2014 namely, that the law prevents municipalities from setting a minimum wage higher than the state\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis is not a bathroom bill,\u201d Barber said, seeking to frame the issue in a larger context. \u201cThis is an anti-civil rights, anti-human rights, anti-worker, anti-family, anti-children piece of legislation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Moral Monday activists are hardly through with North Carolina's so-called \u201cbathroom bill.\" And they're insisting it's about much more than bathrooms.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/grassroots-protest-movement-takes-aim-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Moral Monday activists are hardly through with North Carolina's so-called \u201cbathroom bill.\" And they're insisting it's about much more than bathrooms.", "title": "Grassroots protest movement takes aim at North Carolina's 'bathroom bill'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/grassroots-protest-movement-takes-aim-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/h_14817040.jpg?itok=R0j4EMs4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/grassroots-protest-movement-takes-aim-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/h_14817040.jpg?itok=UEchXLVc", "title": "Grassroots protest movement takes aim at North Carolina's 'bathroom bill'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Moral Monday activists are hardly through with North Carolina's so-called \u201cbathroom bill.\" And they're insisting it's about much more than bathrooms."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-04T08:57:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "emma-margolin", "title": "Grassroots protest movement takes aim at North Carolina's 'bathroom bill'", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/grassroots-protest-movement-takes-aim-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill", "published": 1, "date": "05/04/2016 08:57:00 EDT", "tags": "election-2016,elections,equality,lgbt,moral-monday,north-carolina,republicans,transgender"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Moral Monday activists are hardly through with North Carolina's so-called \u201cbathroom bill.\" And they're insisting it's about much more than bathrooms.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Elections, Election 2016, Equality, LGBT, Republicans, Moral Monday, North Carolina, Transgender"}, "article_summary": "RELATED: NCAA goes soft on North Carolina after House Bill 2\u201cWe are planning on coming back.\nDr. William J.
