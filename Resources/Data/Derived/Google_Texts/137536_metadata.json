The resulting floodwaters have reportedly led to the deaths of five people.\n\nThe city's schools and city buildings, as well as many private-sector offices, are closed because of perilous road conditions. And the National Weather Service says more rain \u2014 and more flooding \u2014 is on the way.\n\n\"Without a gap to dry out between Monday's 17 inches in rainfall and upcoming showers, the lighter storms still run a risk of localized flooding,\" Ed Mayberry of Houston Public Media reports. \"Scores of subdivisions flooded, and power was knocked out to thousands of residents who were urged to shelter in place in this nearly sea-level city.\"\n\nOther residents couldn't safely stay in their flooded homes; at least five shelters have been set up across the city. The Associated Press reports that more than 1,000 people were taken from apartments in the northern part of Houston and moved to a shopping mall; they're being ferried by buses to shelters, the wire service says.\n\nMajor interstates are submerged, including I-10, the AP writes. Mayberry also notes that a retaining wall near Highway 290 has collapsed. And flights through Houston were grounded for much of Monday.\n\nAs early as Monday morning, the National Weather Service was already calling the rain event \"historic\": More than a foot of rain fell in 12 hours.\n\nAnd by Monday afternoon, the Houston Press reports, some areas of the city had seen more rain than ever before. Meteorologist Jeff Lindner told the Houston Press that one region didn't just hit the \"500-year\" mark for water levels \u2014 it beat it, by 2 inches.\n\nThe Press continues:\n\n\"An average of 7.75 inches drenched the county overall, Linder said, meaning that some 240 billion gallons of water fell across the region \u2014 enough to surge through Niagara Falls for 88 consecutive hours.\"\n\nThere have been more than 1,200 high-water rescues, the Press says.\n\nThe National Weather Service is reminding people not to attempt to drive through floodwaters, which often are much deeper than they appear.\n\nSeveral of the five reported flood-related deaths involved vehicles in high water.\n\nThe images on television and social media are dramatic.\n\nOn live TV, audiences watched as a man drove into deep floodwaters and yelled out from his window, apparently confused, \"What do I do?\" A flabbergasted TV reporter shouted that the man needed to leave the car and then waded in to help him out.\n\nPhotos and videos on Twitter showed rescuers working to help horses trapped in floodwaters.\n\nA Houston Chronicle photographer captured a man saving an armadillo from high waters. (A second photo showed the armadillo standing, apparently unharmed by the ordeal.)\n\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner called the weather system \"stubborn,\" the AP reports. He expressed special sympathy for those whose homes flooded last May after a devastating storm.\n\n\"I regret anyone whose home is flooded again,\" Turner said, according to the wire service. \"There's nothing I can say that's going to ease your frustration. We certainly can't control the weather.\"", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Camila Domonoske", "og": {"site_name": "WAMU 88.5", "description": "Submerged subdivisions, impassable roads, overflowing creeks: For the second day in a row, Houston has been struggling to cope with disastrous flooding.\n        Nearly 18 inches of rain has f", "title": "Houston Floods Continue; At Least 5 People Reported Dead", "url": "http://wamu.org/news/16/04/19/houston_floods_continue_at_least_5_people_reported_dead", "image": "http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif?utmac=UA-5828686-4&utmdt=Houston+Floods+Continue%3B+At+Least+5+People+Reported+Dead&utme=8(APIKey)9(MDAxNzk1MDc4MDEyMTU0NTY4ODBlNmE3Yw001)", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 0, "nid": 225883, "google-site-verification": "8AyE7rFVyUE7ZiqFGJ29mxnUk_L6YMXe4KHsLRUvvmQ"}, "article_summary": "And by Monday afternoon, the Houston Press reports, some areas of the city had seen more rain than ever before.\nThe National Weather Service is reminding people not to attempt to drive through floodwaters, which often are much deeper than they appear.\nAnd the National Weather Service says more rain \u2014 and more flooding \u2014 is on the way.\nMeteorologist Jeff Lindner told the Houston Press that one region didn't just hit the \"500-year\" mark for water levels \u2014 it beat it, by 2 inches.\nAs early as Monday morning, the National Weather Service was already calling the rain event \"historic\": More than a foot of rain fell in 12 hours."}
