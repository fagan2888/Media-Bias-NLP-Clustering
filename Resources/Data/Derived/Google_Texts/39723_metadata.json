Here they oppose the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act in the name of \u201cfreedom,\u201d and yet then turn around and vote against a woman\u2019s freedom to choose abortion. So argued a liberal professor on a discussion list I was on, and I\u2019ve heard lots of liberals make the same arguments.\n\nThose liberal hypocrites! Here they argue for sexual liberty in the name of \u201cfreedom,\u201d and yet they support freedom-restricting gun controls. So argue plenty of conservatives (and some libertarians), including on this blog.\n\nThose libertarian hypocrites! Here they talk about how people should have freedom, and yet they are just fine with big corporations constraining employees\u2019 and consumers\u2019 freedom. So argue still other people.\n\nI\u2019m quite skeptical of all these claims of hypocrisy, because they ignore the reality that many people sincerely and plausibly have different understandings of \u201cfreedom.\u201d\n\nNo-one really thinks that everyone should be free to do whatever they please. To everyone, \u201cfreedom\u201d means freedom to do those things that don\u2019t sufficiently harm others (and often also means freedom from constraint imposed by particular actors, such as government using the threat of legal action, and not other actors, such as churches using moral or spiritual sanctions).\n\nAnd that judgment necessarily requires making contested moral and pragmatic decisions:\n\nWhat, as a moral matter, constitutes \u201charm\u201d? For instance, does paying someone a low wage for their work count as harming them? How about discriminating against them in various transactions? Interfering with their business relations? Libeling them? Having sex with their spouses? Revealing information about them that they view as private?\n\nWhat, as a practical matter, causes such \u201charm\u201d? For instance, does legal private gun possession really cause more crime and injury than would be present if guns were prohibited?\n\nWhen can avoiding some kinds of harm justify restrictions on people\u2019s freedom? For instance, when can some behavior \u2014 e.g., the distribution of guns or alcohol \u2014 be properly restricted, for instance, when it is not itself harmful, but makes it possible for third parties to act harmfully?\n\nWho counts as \u201cothers\u201d who should be protected against \u201charm\u201d? Fetuses? Animals?\n\nWell-intentioned people can easily answer these questions differently than we would; and that they answer them differently doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re hypocrites.\n\nNow one can certainly argue that people who believe in the freedom to do X should also believe in the freedom to do Y because of this-and-such similarity and because the supposed differences are actually overstated for this-and-such reason. But claims of hypocrisy are more than just claims of honest error. They are claims that people are consciously pretending to be for freedom when they know they are actually against it \u2014 claims of dishonesty.\n\nOccasionally, such claims of conscious pretense are supported with actual evidence, but usually they aren\u2019t: The view often seems to be \u201cthose people must be lying when they say they are for freedom,\u201d even when there is no evidence for this beyond the fact that those people have a different understanding of the boundaries of freedom than the speaker does. Something similar happens with regard to constitutional debates, where people often claim that someone is hypocritical for interpreting two provisions differently, without at all considering the possibility that there is an honest disagreement about how the provisions are to be interpreted.\n\nSo such accusations of hypocrisy are factually unsupported. And such unsupported accusations of hypocrisy, as with all unsupported accusations that the other side is consciously dishonest or morally corrupt, are also destructive of helpful public debate.\n\nThey may energize one\u2019s base, but they make it much harder to persuade people who are leaning toward the other side, and I suspect that they also alienate the middle as well. Instead of substantive discussion of how we should understand freedom, we get accusations of deception, accusations that don\u2019t really advance understanding. I\u2019d much rather see more arguments that recognize that they stem from honest disagreement and fewer claims that the other side is just a bunch of hypocrites.\n\nSo when you next hear someone argue, for instance, that someone is a hypocrite because he opposes most racial discrimination but not \u201caffirmative action,\u201d or because he thinks life begins at conception but would allow abortion in cases of rape, resist for a moment the h-word. Instead, ask yourself: Can I think of reasons why decent people might distinguish affirmative action from various other forms of discrimination, or abortion in rape cases from abortion in other cases (even if I don\u2019t find those distinctions persuasive myself)? If not, can I think a little more, since there almost always are such reasonable distinctions (again, even if not fully persuasive ones)? And if I can think of those distinctions, why should we assume that our adversaries actually aren\u2019t thinking of them, too, and are instead being hypocrites?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why claims of hypocrisy in public policy debates are often overstated.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Why claims of hypocrisy in public policy debates are often overstated.", "title": "Freedom and hypocrisy", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/28/freedom-and-hypocrisy/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@volokhc"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/28/freedom-and-hypocrisy/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hypocrisy, freedom,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "hypocrisy, freedom,"}, "article_summary": "And such unsupported accusations of hypocrisy, as with all unsupported accusations that the other side is consciously dishonest or morally corrupt, are also destructive of helpful public debate.\nHere they talk about how people should have freedom, and yet they are just fine with big corporations constraining employees\u2019 and consumers\u2019 freedom.\nTo everyone, \u201cfreedom\u201d means freedom to do those things that don\u2019t sufficiently harm others (and often also means freedom from constraint imposed by particular actors, such as government using the threat of legal action, and not other actors, such as churches using moral or spiritual sanctions).\nHere they oppose the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act in the name of \u201cfreedom,\u201d and yet then turn around and vote against a woman\u2019s freedom to choose abortion.\nInstead of substantive discussion of how we should understand freedom, we get accusations of deception, accusations that don\u2019t really advance understanding."}
