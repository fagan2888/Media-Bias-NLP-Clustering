But by insisting that he wants to collaborate with Republicans, the president \u2014 who will host congressional leaders of both parties at the White House on Tuesday \u2014 also hinted that there is negotiating room beyond those threats.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s attitude is that we shouldn\u2019t let our disagreements, as big as they are on some issues, prevent us from working together on the things we do agree on,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama. \u201cIf Republicans take a similar attitude, there is an opportunity to prove people wrong and make some progress.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor now, Mr. Obama and congressional Republicans are dwelling mostly on the big disagreements.\n\nCongressional leaders pointed to the swift veto threats as the latest evidence that the president has no real interest in working with them \u2014 \u201cAt a minimum, he could have waited a few hours,\u201d said Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio \u2014 and warned that Mr. Obama could be spoiling his chance for a productive relationship.\n\n\u201cThey think they can keep poking people in the eye and it won\u2019t have any consequences, and the reality is, it will,\u201d said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. \u201cTo us right now, it looks like the president wants to pick a fight with us every other day, and if that\u2019s their strategy, good luck. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work very well.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials argued that it was Republicans who had chosen to bait Mr. Obama into an early confrontation, by advancing measures they knew he would reject. The Keystone bill, in particular, seemed written with the intention of drawing a veto because it takes power from the president and gives it to Congress. All of the bills the president has said he would veto contain provisions he has long opposed.\n\n\u201cWhile it may raise questions in the minds of some Republicans about the president\u2019s willingness to work with Republicans in Congress to advance priorities,\u201d Mr. Earnest said Monday of the veto threats, \u201cit might also raise questions in the mind of some others that Republicans have chosen as their first few pieces of legislation bills that they know the president opposes.\u201d\n\nBeyond the bickering lies a timeworn reality that Mr. Obama is embracing, and a tactic deployed by his predecessors in both political parties: employing vetoes, and the threat of using them, as a crucial element of negotiation between presidents and Congresses led by the other party. Bill Clinton mastered the art, often using vetoes as a negotiating tool on major agenda items. He vetoed welfare reform legislation twice before signing it into law in 1996.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a question of saying \u2018no\u2019 \u2014 the veto is a bargaining tool for the president where he extracts legislative concessions from the opposition,\u201d said Charles M. Cameron, a politics professor at Princeton University who wrote a book on the subject. \u201cIf the president will stick to his guns, either the Republicans are going to get nothing done or they\u2019re going to have to give him some of what he wants.\u201d\n\nThe threats Mr. Obama issued last week were of the \u201cblame-game veto\u201d variety, Mr. Cameron said \u2014 the sort that allow both sides to make a political point and rally their respective bases, but that are not really intended to yield a legislative compromise.\n\nThe president\u2019s veto threat on the Keystone measure convinced at least one wavering lawmaker of his own party, Representative Debbie Dingell of Michigan, that she should vote \u201cno\u201d on the bill.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cI was waiting to see where the president was going to be and what he was going to ask us to do,\u201d said Ms. Dingell, who joined 152 other Democrats in opposing the measure.\n\nAt the same time, the threat united Republicans. After the bill passed on Friday, Mr. Boehner issued a news release boasting, \u201cHouse Defies President\u2019s Veto Threat, Approves Job-Creating Keystone Pipeline.\u201d\n\nBut more often, said Sam Kernell, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, a president\u2019s veto threat is the start of a negotiation that leads to a law.\n\n\u201cObama is tracking history here, because threats are really a big part of divided government,\u201d Mr. Kernell said. His research analyzing veto threats by presidents reaching back to Ronald Reagan shows that measures that prompt them are \u201chighly likely\u201d to become law.\n\nAnita Dunn, a former senior aide to Mr. Obama, said he and congressional Republicans were both staking out early positions so they could ultimately sit down and strike such bargains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of common interest, after the rhetorical grenades have been thrown, in stepping back and figuring out what in two years both sides can claim as achievements,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"tone":
