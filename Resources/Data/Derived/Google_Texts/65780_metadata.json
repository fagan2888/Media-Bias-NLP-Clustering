John Hickenlooper, was wooing business investors and analysts at the Westin Denver Downtown hotel at lunchtime Monday, Colorado politics regarding him played loudly in the public arena.\n\nMichael Huttner made his presence known in a press release, with a familiar name in the \u201ccontact\u201d spot.\n\nA decade ago, there was no clearer, or possibly louder, voice from Colorado\u2019s political left than Huttner, the founder of ProgressNow Colorado and a consultant for similar groups across the country since. He\u2019s back now with the well-financed Making Colorado Great.\n\nIts mission statement? \u201c[T]o hold Bob Beauprez accountable to the people of Colorado.\u201d See where this is going?\n\nWhile Hickenlooper has vowed to avoid negative campaigning, his ally Huttner was fast out of the gate Monday. He called on Beauprez to renounce an endorsement from Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is awaiting booking on a grand jury indictment alleging abuse of power. Over the phone, Huttner also brought up Beauprez\u2019s support from embattled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, as well as an affiliation through a conservative group\u2019s board with former House Speaker Tom DeLay, who was indicted in the same Texas county in 2005, convicted in 2011, and acquitted on appeal last year.\n\nBeauprez\u2019s campaign did not comment on heavyweight Huttner directly, but supported Perry\u2019s decision to seek the removal of Travis County, Texas, District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg from office after she was arrested for driving while intoxicated last year. Perry followed through on a threat to veto funding for the Democratic prosecutor\u2019s Public Integrity Unit, which is investigating a taxpayer-supported Texas cancer research center where donors to Perry campaigns benefited suspiciously from lucrative grants.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a disturbing trend of John Hickenlooper\u2019s allies supporting drunk driving offenders,\u201d said Beauprez spokesman Allen Fuller. \u201cMost Coloradans are more concerned about public safety than protecting drunk drivers.\u201d\n\nHuttner said he\u2019s with Making Colorado Great because he\u2019s tired of Beauprez\u2019s \u201cextreme, backwards views.\u201d The group, which does not have to disclose its donors, has plenty of money and airtime to get that message out: about $1.7 million in TV ad contracts so far, according to Federal Communications Commission documents.\n\n\u201cI care deeply about Colorado and it is crucial that the people here learn about him,\u201d said Huttner, whose political consulting firm has offices in Boulder, where he lives, New York City and Washington, D.C. \u201cAnd when you look at Beauprez\u2019s history of unethical misconduct, as well as his extreme views on key issues, Both Ways Bob Beauprez truly represents the wrong kind of politics for Colorado.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "527,campaign donations,Michael Huttner,TV ads", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The man behind many liberal organizations that have formed in Colorado or elsewhere have relied on the Boulder operative, who is focusing now on Bob  Beauprez.", "title": "Colorado politics picks up familiar player in liberal Michael Huttner", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/08/18/michael-huttners-return-colorado-politics-ups-campaign-season-ante/111531/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/08/20100113__20100114_D01_FE14STBARGRILLp2-495x374.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The man behind many liberal organizations that have formed in Colorado or elsewhere have relied on the Boulder operative, who is focusing now on Bob  Beauprez.", "creator": "@joeybunch", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/08/18/michael-huttners-return-colorado-politics-ups-campaign-season-ante/111531/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/08/20100113__20100114_D01_FE14STBARGRILLp2-495x374.jpg", "title": "Michael Huttner\u2019s return to Colorado politics ups campaign season ante", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The main voice of the liberal side of Colorado politics for more than a decade is focusing now on GOP gubernatorial challenger Bob Beauprez."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec2d\"", "article_summary": "John Hickenlooper, was wooing business investors and analysts at the Westin Denver Downtown hotel at lunchtime Monday, Colorado politics regarding him played loudly in the public arena.\nMichael Huttner made his presence known in a press release, with a familiar name in the \u201ccontact\u201d spot.\nWhile the politician who says he hates the rough-and-tumble of campaign politics, incumbent Gov.\nHe called on Beauprez to renounce an endorsement from Texas Gov.\nOver the phone, Huttner also brought up Beauprez\u2019s support from embattled New Jersey Gov."}
