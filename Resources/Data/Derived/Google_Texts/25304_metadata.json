In short, people may not like Obamacare, but they really hate Republicans.\n\nSo, for example, the CBS News poll released yesterday found that 43 percent of Americans approve of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare's formal name) and 51 percent disapprove (alas, they didn't drill deeper and get a breakdown of people opposing it because the law goes too far and those opposing it because it doesn't go far enough). But those figures are sterling compared to the public's view of the GOP, which gets 18 percent approval and 78 percent disapproval.\n\nTo put it another way, more than twice as many Americans approve of Obamacare as approve of congressional Republicans.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nOr take the new polling that CNN released over the first couple of days of the week, which found 56 percent of Americans opposed to the health care reform law (though as I noted Monday, that figure is misleading since more than one in five of the law's critics think it isn't liberal enough; the figure for people who oppose the law because it's too liberal is 38 percent). At the same time, fully three-quarters of Americans \u2013 75 percent! \u2013 think that most Republicans in Congress don't deserve to be re-elected. That means twice as many people want to get rid of the congressional GOP as dislike Obamacare for being too liberal.\n\nAnd then there's the Washington Post/ABC News poll that found that 46 percent of Americans favor the law while 49 percent don't (again with only 36 percent against the law because it's big government and 10 percent disliking it because they want bigger government). And the Republicans? Only 32 percent said they had a favorable impression of the GOP (which is, note, less than 46 percent), while 63 percent have an unfavorable impression of the party.\n\nThe effort to shut down the government was driven in part by the notion that the dramatic stand would rally the American people. Ted Cruz and his pals do seem to have managed to rally the American people \u2013 just not in the way they intended.\n\nRead Kelly Riddell: Sit Back and Watch Obamacare Implode\n\nRead Jamie Stiehm: How the Government Shutdown Was Like Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet", "article_metadata": {"zone": "robert-schlesinger/blogentries", "keyword": "picks", "title": "Polls Show Obamacare Is More Popular Than Republicans", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2013/10/23/polls-show-obamacare-is-more-popular-than-republicans", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "A new spate of polls this week shows the GOP lags well behind Obamacare.", "title": "Poll Numbers the GOP Wishes It Could Have"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "A new spate of polls this week shows the GOP lags well behind Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "title": "Polls Show Obamacare Is More Popular Than Republicans"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Oct. 23, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Schlesinger, Robert, opinion blogs,health insurance, Robert Schlesinger White House Ghosts, Robert Schlesinger blog, house ghosts Robert Schlesinger,Robert Schlesinger,picks,polls, ghosts Robert Schlesinger,health care reform,Republican Party, US News opinion,health care,Robert Schlesinger,health care,health care reform,health insurance,Republican Party,polls,picks", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A new spate of polls this week shows the GOP lags well behind Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0f8\"", "article_summary": "To put it another way, more than twice as many Americans approve of Obamacare as approve of congressional Republicans.\nThat means twice as many people want to get rid of the congressional GOP as dislike Obamacare for being too liberal.\nDan Wasserman/Tribune Content AgencyOne of the most striking \u2013 and entertaining \u2013 things about the spate of polls released this week sketching the post-government-shutdown political landscape is the contrast in public standing between the congressional Republicans and their white whale, Obamacare.\nIn short, people may not like Obamacare, but they really hate Republicans.\nRead Kelly Riddell: Sit Back and Watch Obamacare ImplodeRead Jamie Stiehm: How the Government Shutdown Was Like Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"}
