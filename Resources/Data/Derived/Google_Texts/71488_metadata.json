But the boys didn't face any penalty. It was a very one-sided equation,\" Lippman said, according to HealthDay.\n\nA 2008 study of a nationally representative group of teenagers, aged 13 to 19, found that 19 percent of boys and girls had sent sexually explicit photographs or videos of themselves to someone by text or another electronic means, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.\n\nStudy co-author Scott Campbell, an associate professor of communications, says girls are no more likely than boys to engage in sexting but more likely to suffer social repercussions. \"This is the same kind of double standard that we've seen in traditional contexts,\" he said in the statement.\n\nThe researchers surveyed 51 adolescents, aged 12 to 18, who were split about evenly between boys and girls, from the metropolitan areas of Atlanta, New York City, and Denver. Among the 43 children who participated in the survey, nine acknowledged sending sexually explicit photographs of themselves, while nearly half said they\u2019d received such sexts. However, most of those who\u2019d received such sexually explicit content were boys, looking at girls.\n\nAccording to interviews with the children, sexting is sometimes a way of broaching romance. \"If a guy wants to hook up with you, he'll send pictures of his private parts or a naked picture of him,\u201d one girl wrote in the survey. A boy wrote, \"I know I can get it from\" girls who send him sexts. Whereas some of the participants said sexting was \u201cno big deal,\u201d others judged girls for sending explicit photographs of themselves to boys. \"This is common only for girls with 'slut' reputations,\" wrote an 18-year-old male.\n\nStill, the small study doesn\u2019t break new ground in the realm of teenage sexting, according to David Finkelhor, director of the University of New Hampshire's Crimes against Children Research Center. \"Sexting is really a small part of the teen sexual decision-making problem,\u201d he told HealthDay. \u201cThe big elements are decision-making around consent and assault, drinking, intercourse, and contraceptive usage.\"\n\nSource: Lippman J, Campbell S.
