He looked ready for prime time. Yet, he would see no time.\n\nMarshall missed Monday night\u2019s game with a sprained right foot, the fallout from his absence glaring and far-reaching in the Broncos\u2019 deflating loss to the Bengals.\n\nThe Broncos entered Paul Brown Stadium with a defensive edge sharpened over the past four weeks. They ranked second against the run, and owned a big-play secondary. It was set up to make Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton, who has spent a career paging Dr. Heimlich in big games, beat them.\n\nDenver spoiled its own strategy by losing its identity, if not its fundamentals. Playing second and third-string linebackers makes for great copy, but not necessarily sold performances. Todd Davis, the waiver-claim replacement for Marshall (foot) and Danny Trevathan (knee), missed multiple tackles. Middle linebacker Steven Johnson became a victim of mismatches in coverage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no excuses. We have to play better,\u201d defensive end DeMarcus Ware said \u201cWe had new guys in there, but whether it\u2019s the ones or the fours it just shows how much the little things matter.\u201d\n\nIt was the inability of the Broncos to impose their will at the line of scrimmage that haunted them most.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 rush defense dissolved before the team\u2019s eyes long before Peyton Manning\u2019s unnerving fourth quarter interceptions and the endless special teams meltdowns.\n\nDenver had allowed 71.6 yards per game on the ground going into the game. After Rams rookie Tre Mason eclipsed 100 yards at St. Louis \u2014 the first running back to accomplish the feat \u2014 the Broncos changed their practice habits. No more small gains, and easy tackles. Hard hits and a few scuffles ensued, according to Ware.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver Broncos vs. Cincinnati Bengals, Dec. 22, 2014\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just turn the switch on,\u201d Ware said. \u201cIt has to stay on.\u201d\n\nThe absence of Marshall proved also damaging in the passing game. The Bengals exploited Johnson and Davis with throws to the backs and tight end Jermaine Gersham (11 targets, nine catches).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEspecially frustrated in myself. I could have done better.\u201d\n\nThe Broncos insisted this game held meaning, preaching how a win was a playoff victory because it guaranteed a playoff bye. And yet the lights flickered, consistency elusive. Only Aqib Talib\u2019s pick six and Von Miller\u2019s rip fumble spared the defense its worst game of the season.\n\nThe fight that defined a month-long stretch was largely absent in the first half. Rookie Jeremy Hill ran 85 yards for a first-quarter touchdown, marking the second longest run ever against the Broncos. He didn\u2019t break free as much as expose breakdowns. Davis missed an ankle tackle in the backfield. Safety Rahim Moore bounced off, and a pursuing Johnson couldn\u2019t catch Hill near midfield.\n\n\u201cWe had communication issues on Hill\u2019s run,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI just have to learn from this.\u201d\n\nHill finished with 133 yards rushing, shoving himself into NFL offensive rookie of the year consideration alongside former LSU teammate Odell Beckham Jr. When Hill missed a series with a sore ankle, his replacement, Giovani Bernard, shredded the Broncos in the passing game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to me and Gio to get the running game going and get the pressure off Andy,\u201d Hill said.\n\nDefensive tackle Terrance Knighton said last week that he hated eyeing the scoreboard, and seeing the opponent with \u201ceven 50 yards on the ground.\u201d It\u2019s what made this game so discouraging for Broncos fans. This was supposed to be the different Broncos, a team that could take a punch to the stomach and deliver a jab to the windpipe.\n\n\u201cTheir defense made more plays than our defense. We will bounce back from this,\u201d Knighton said. \u201cWe have no choice. My confidence in this team hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nThe defense succeeded in one goal, making the loss more disappointing. The Bengals became one dimensional, Dalton a game-manager with less than 150 yards passing deep into the fourth quarter.\n\nDalton delivered an awful pass to Talib, missing wildly, early in the first quarter. Talib made an incredible diving interception near the right sideline, got up, and ran for a touchdown, making it 7-0 Broncos.\n\nBut it was a fleeting moment in a game where the defense couldn\u2019t draw a line in the turf. The sand, or the rain.\n\nTroy E.
