However, as important as that is, I don\u2019t think it is the most important thing,\u201d he told the magazine.\n\n\u201cI think it is the fact that the director of national intelligence gave a false statement to Congress under oath, which is a felony,\u201d he said, referring to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who denied to Congress that the U.S. government was collecting information about millions of Americans.\n\nLater, documents ilegally leaked by Snowden showed that the National Security Agency (NSA) was collecting virtually all Americans\u2019 phone records as well as many Internet communications.\n\nClapper has since said that he responded in the \u201cleast untruthful\u201d manner possible, but has yet to be formally reprimanded for the statement.\n\nSnowden, who is living in Russia and facing criminal charges in the United States that could put him in jail for decades, said Clapper and other officials should be punished for their actions.\n\n\u201cIf we allow our officials to knowingly break the law publicly and face no consequences, we\u2019re instituting a culture of immunity, and this is what I think historically will actually be considered the biggest disappointment of the Obama administration,\u201d Snowden said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be related to social or economic policies; it\u2019s going to be the fact that he said let\u2019s go forward, not backward, in regard to the violations of law that occurred under the Bush administration.\u201d\n\nThe former government contractor has long portrayed the leaking of government documents as an act of patriotism, and says he's disappointed that Congress hasn't taken stronger action to curb the NSA.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, there hasn\u2019t been much legislative change on the surveillance issue, although there are some tepid proposals,\u201d he said.\n\nOne prominent proposal, The USA Freedom Act, would end the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone records, among other measures. However, it does not touch many of the programs unveiled by Snowden, such as the \u201cbackdoor\u201d snooping on Americans through a law designed to target foreigners.\n\n\u201cIn the United States, we\u2019ve got this big debate, but we\u2019ve got official paralysis \u2014 because they\u2019re the ones who had their hand caught most deeply in the cookie jar,\u201d Snowden said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Edward Snowden said his surveillance documents were not the biggest revelations.", "description": "Edward Snowden said his surveillance documents were not the biggest revelations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Edward Snowden said his surveillance documents were not the biggest revelations.", "title": "Snowden decries 'culture of immunity' for law-breakers", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/221991-snowden-finds-biggest-disappointment-of-obama-administration", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-27T17:03:51-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-10-27T17:03-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/221991-snowden-finds-biggest-disappointment-of-obama-administration", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-27T16:44-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "National Security Agency,Edward Snowden,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-27T16:44:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-27T17:03:51-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/221991-snowden-finds-biggest-disappointment-of-obama-administration", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Edward Snowden said his surveillance documents were not the biggest revelations.", "card": "summary", "title": "Snowden decries 'culture of immunity' for law-breakers"}, "dcterms.title": "Snowden decries 'culture of immunity' for law-breakers"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd62f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn the United States, there hasn\u2019t been much legislative change on the surveillance issue, although there are some tepid proposals,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn the United States, we\u2019ve got this big debate, but we\u2019ve got official paralysis \u2014 because they\u2019re the ones who had their hand caught most deeply in the cookie jar,\u201d Snowden said.\nPresident Obama\u2019s willingness to stand behind spy leaders even as they lie to Congress will define his legacy, according to Edward Snowden.\nHowever, it does not touch many of the programs unveiled by Snowden, such as the \u201cbackdoor\u201d snooping on Americans through a law designed to target foreigners.\nHowever, as important as that is, I don\u2019t think it is the most important thing,\u201d he told the magazine."}
