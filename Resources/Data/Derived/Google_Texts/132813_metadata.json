Religion is increasingly important as the \u201cmajor world religions are all taking advantage of the opportunities provided by globalization to transform their messages and reach a new global audience.\u201d The new technologies are changing the nature of the way movements can mobilize support to the extent that Charles Tilly could argue that old-style social movements could be replaced \u201cas vehicles of popular claim making\u201d by new forms of claim making and new ways of mobilizing expressions of social and political visions. These changes set the framework for movements of democratization in the Muslim world at the beginning of the 21st century.\n\nThe events of the Arab Spring in 2011 were seen by some analysts as the coming of a fourth wave of democratization, this time involving Muslim-majority countries. Demonstrations overthrowing the authoritarian regimes in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen; a major civil war in Syria; and demonstrations in many other Arab countries showed the strength of popular support for democratization. However, already by the end of the 1990s, the new politics were visible in a number of places.\n\nReformasi movements in Southeast Asia were a starting point for a new cycle of democratization. In Indonesia, large demonstrations in 1998 resulted in the overthrow of the authoritarian military regime of Suharto, who had ruled for more than thirty years. The transition created an elected parliament that elected two successive presidents, and then in 2004, a new president was directly elected. The success of the transition to democracy is reflected in the successful transfer of power in the presidency three times.\n\nIn Malaysia, the political system was multiparty but the coalition led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) had ruled since Malaysia had gained independence. This dominance was challenged by a reformasi movement when the prime minister and head of UMNO, Mahathir Mohammad, fired his deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, and brought criminal charges against him. The supporters of Anwar joined with other opposition parties to create a major opposition coalition that challenged the UMNO coalition in the 1999 general elections. Although the new opposition did not win, it had success in gaining Malay ethnic and younger voters, and the parties continued to work together as an effective coalition. An observer at the time noted, \u201cThe institutionalization of a two-coalition system \u2026 changes the dynamics of Malaysian politics.\u201d In the first decade of the 21st century, this \u201ctwo-coalition\u201d politics resulted in highly competitive elections and growing power for the opposition coalition. In the 2013 elections, the opposition won a majority of the popular votes but did not yet win a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe new politics are visible in Senegal and Turkey. Until 2000, Senegalese politics had been dominated by single major party from the time of independence. Small opposition parties were allowed, like the Senegalese Democratic Party led by Abdoulaye Wade. Wade ran for president four times, losing to the head of the dominant party each time. Then, in 2000, he again challenged Abdou Diouf, who had served as president since 1981, and won. This victory signaled more competitive politics, with Wade serving two terms as president and then losing elections in 2012, followed by a peaceful transition of power.\n\nIn Turkey, following military involvement in the resignation of a government in 1997, the Islamically oriented political groups reorganized and some formed the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalk\u0131nma Partisi; AKP), which was \u201ca new style of party\u201d whose populism went beyond the appeal of both the older, more rigid Islamist parties and the secularist parties of the old urban statist elite. The party and its allies won parliamentary majorities in 2002 and subsequent elections, and dominated politics sufficiently to raise fears of \u201cmajoritarian\u201d authoritarianism by the second decade of the 21st century. Part of the AKP program was democratic reform to comply with European Union membership guidelines. An important dimension of these reforms was the reduction of the political role of the military. By 2012, an observer could state, \u201cFor the first time in the republic\u2019s history, Turkey\u2019s performance is also totally in civilian hands. The military, once empowered to check civilian politics, is no longer strong enough either to step in or to threaten to take action.\u201d During the demonstrations of 2013, there was little indication that the military was prepared to intervene.\n\nEven in the carefully controlled electoral system in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the late 1990s was the time of a major reformist movement. In what analysts regard as a major upset, the reformist candidate for president, Mohammad Khatami, defeated the candidate who had the support of most of the ruling religious establishment in the presidential elections of 1997. Khatami won 70 percent of the vote in elections with an 80 percent turnout of eligible voters. Khatami was an activist supporter of creating an open society and declared, \u201cThe essence of Iranian history is the struggle for democracy.\u201d Subsequent elections were highly competitive, within the limits set by the system. Popular support for reformist democracy is reflected in the huge demonstrations following the 2009 presidential elections protesting the results which most believed to have been rigged, and also in the surprise victory of the moderate candidate in the first round of the 2013 presidential elections.\n\nThe new politics of a possible fourth wave of democratization became globally visible in the events of the Arab Spring and subsequent developments. The year 2011 was a time of mounting protests around the world, with the actions of the Arab Spring leading the way. Time magazine named \u201cThe Protester\u201d as the Person of the Year. In the global rise of oppositional politics, Time, among many others, identified a special role for the new electronic media of communication. \u201cCalling the Arab uprisings Facebook and YouTube and Twitter revolutions is not, it turns out, just glib, wishful American overstatement. In the Middle East and North Africa, in Spain and Greece and New York, social media and smart phones did not replace face-to-face social bonds and confrontation but helped enable and turbocharge them, allowing protesters to mobilize more nimbly and communicate with one another and the wider world more effectively than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe nature of the 2011 protests tends to confirm Charles Tilly\u2019s prediction that social movements of contention would take different forms in the 21st century. In discussing the nature of protests as public performances, Sidney Tarrow noted that in the 21st century, \u201celectronic communication has made some forms of physical performance less effective, while other forms\u2014such as the use of the Internet\u2014have become more so. For example, protests against the stolen Iranian election of 2009 were organized largely through new means of electronic communication\u2014cell phones, the Internet, Facebook, and Twitter.\u201d The result is a new type of movement that Manuel Castells calls networked social movements. \u201cHistorically, social movements have been dependent on the existence of specific communication mechanisms: rumors, sermons, pamphlets and manifestos, spread from person to person, from the pulpit, from the press, or by whatever means of communication was available. In our time, multimodal, digital networks of horizontal communication are the fastest and most autonomous, interactive, reprogrammable and self-expanding means of communication in history\u2026 . This is why the networked social movements of the digital age represent a new species of social movement.\u201d\n\nThe new movements have many dimensions. Throughout the Arab world, and elsewhere in the world of emerging economies, high levels of poverty and economic inequality exist. This deprivation provides a foundation for the strong sense of discontent among the population. The Arab Human Development Reports over the years document the continuing economic problems of Arab societies. However, poverty and economic deprivation are long-standing problems and are often more acute in countries that did not experience major demonstrations in the Arab Spring, and most of the protesters were not from the poorest levels of society. Mohamed Bouazizi, whose self-immolation was the starting point for the Tunisian revolution and the Arab Spring, was not an impoverished peasant; he was a licensed street vendor who was harassed by the police. Khaled Said, who was dragged from an Internet cafe\u0301 and beaten to death by Egyptian security police, became a symbol for the rising fervor of opposition in Egypt. He was a middle-class computer repair person. In Tahrir Square in Cairo, the participants were primarily from the urban educated classes, with strong working-class support. In terms of the economic dimensions of the Arab Spring, some argue that the \u201cuprisings were indigenously inspired movements fueled by the rising expectations of a nascent global middle class in the face of opportunity that for too long had been denied.\u201d\n\nThe new movements were not, however, expressions of class tensions in their societies. Marxist class struggle ideology found little expression in the statements of the protesters. The demands were for an end to authoritarian rule and corruption in government, and greater equality. Whatever might be the specific cause for protest, whether opposition to a military dictator or, as in the protests in Turkey in 2013, the reconstruction of a public park, the new movements have an important economic foundation for discontent but are not part of a self-conscious class struggle.\n\nYounger people were, and are, among the most pressured by economic problems. Even in a relatively strong economy like Tunisia\u2019s, the youth unemployment rate was around 25 percent. Throughout the Muslim world, the demographic \u201cyouth bulge\u201d is a major factor. In most Muslim countries, the majority of the population is under 30 years of age, with median ages ranging from 31 in Tunisia and Albania to 17\u201318 in Afghanistan, Yemen, and the Gaza Strip. Although participants in the protests in the Arab Spring and in other protest movements around the world in 2011 came from many different levels of society, young people were central, especially youth with some education and real expectations of upward mobility and freedom. One study of the opposition movements around the world in 2011 concluded, \u201cAt the centre of all protest movements is a new sociological type: the graduate with no future.\u201d Although urban poor and workers participated, \u201cit was to the \u2018graduates without a future\u2019 that it fell to kick things off. From the rich world to the poor world, it is educated young people whose life chances and illusions are now being shattered. Though their general conditions are still better than those of slum-dwellers and some workers, they have experienced far greater disappointment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Listen to the presidential candidates and you come away with a warped view of Islam and democracy.
