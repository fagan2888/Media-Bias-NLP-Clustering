According to NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” President Obama’s handling of the Ebola crisis has been one big joke.

Saturday’s episode opened with a segment poking fun at both Obama and his chosen Ebola Czar Ron Klain, who has been the subject of criticism because he has no experience in the medical field.

SNL’s “Obama” kicks off the skit with a press conference to introduce the new leader of the fight against the Ebola virus.

“We made a few mistakes early on,” the fake Obama says of the Ebola crisis. “but I assure you, it was nowhere near as bad as how we handled the ISIS situation, … our various Secret Service mishaps, or the scandals of the IRS and the NSA. And, I don’t know if you guys remember, but the Obamacare website had some pretty serious problems too.”

“In fact, if you look at all the stuff that has happened my second term, this whole Ebola thing is probably one of my greatest accomplishments,” he adds, then introducing “Ron Klain.”

SNL’s Klain then takes the podium for a disastrous first appearance as the Ebola Czar.

“I am not a doctor, but, to be fair, I did serve as chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden,” “Klain” tells a reporter. “So, I do have some experience with a little something called foot-in-mouth disease.”

He himself makes some foot-in-mouth statements about the midterm elections as well as his lack of “statistics” regarding the disease.

There’s even a surprise appearance from “Al Sharpton” at the end.
