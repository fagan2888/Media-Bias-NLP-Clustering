Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, a senator from Vermont, is currently touting what he calls a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d program that would do just that.\n\nFew, however, believe that in the current political climate \u2013 or perhaps, any political climate \u2013 the U.S. would be able to convert to a full-blown single payer system because of the trillions of dollars it would cost. But that doesn\u2019t mean that U.S. consumers can\u2019t enjoy at least some of the benefits of Medicare, according to Peter Orszag and Timothy G. Ferris.\n\nRelated: Medicare for All? Why Sanders Has the Edge over Clinton on Health Care\n\nIn a column published by Bloomberg View today, Orszag, a former director of both the Congressional Budget Office and the White House Office of Management and Budget, and Ferris, the director of the Mass General Physicians Organization, make the case that Medicare\u2019s well-developed billing and claims processing system could be extended to the entire health care sector.\n\nEstimates suggest that much of the United States\u2019 runaway spending on healthcare over the past few decades is caused by the volume and complexity of the paperwork associated with insurance claims.\n\nBy contrast, Orszag and Ferris point out, \u201cMedicare\u2019s processing costs are relatively low, in part because administrative contractors streamline the payment process. All health-care payments could be gradually moved to this platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a change could be made in steps,\u201d they say. \u201cFirst, state Medicaid programs could begin using regional Medicare administrative contractors to process claims. Then Medicare Advantage programs, which are private insurance plans that currently enroll about 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, could be required to do the same. Next, the government could either require or provide incentives for self-insured employer plans to use the system.\u201d\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Healthcare Plan Would Cost $13.8 Trillion over a Decade\n\n\u201cUltimately,\u201d they argue, \u201cthe economies of scale would become large enough to encourage private insurers to adopt the system, too. Policy makers could add incentives, if need be.\u201d\n\nBut any suggestion that the government get more involved in healthcare will be seen as the next step on the slippery slope to socialized medicine. However, the system that Orszag and Ferris lay out keeps a layer of insulation between the government and decisions about patient care.\n\nIn essence, the government would be acting as a sort of general contractor for the private sector health insurers. The more efficient claims would continue to be processed in the private sector.\n\n\u201cThe Medicare administrative process is already regionalized and subject to competition among processing contractors. It already includes standards for efficiency and provider education, and requires transparency in processing,\u201d they write.\n\nRelated: 10 Healthcare Trends That Will Affect You in 2016\n\n\u201cAt the same time, doctors and other care providers would save money and effort by dealing with just one payment-processing system, and the consistency in paperwork would reduce errors.\u201d\n\nIn sum, they say, a consolidation of claims processing could save up to 25 percent a year on what has become one of the most expensive elements of U.S. health care.\n\nPie in the sky? Probably, if only because the issue is complicated and easily demagogued. And one factor the authors leave out is the extensive fraud perpetrated on Medicare on an annual basis. Of course, private insurers have fraud problems as well, but none as well publicized as Medicare\u2019s.\n\nStill, to anybody with a stack of insurance claim letters piling up on their desk, it might sound appealing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A prominent economist and a prominent physician team up to propose a way to leverage the existing Medicare claims processing system to achieve savings across the board on healthcare costs.", "title": "A New Proposal for a Government Takeover of Healthcare (Billing)", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/21/New-Proposal-Government-Takeover-Healthcare-Billing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/pro_obamacare_protest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/21/New-Proposal-Government-Takeover-Healthcare-Billing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/pro_obamacare_protest.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A prominent economist and a prominent physician team up to propose a way to leverage the existing Medicare claims processing system to achieve savings across the board on healthcare costs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "For many on the left, the ideal health care system for the U.S. would have a single-payer \u2013 health care for all, insured by the federal government.\nAll health-care payments could be gradually moved to this platform.\u201d\u201cSuch a change could be made in steps,\u201d they say.\nIn essence, the government would be acting as a sort of general contractor for the private sector health insurers.\nHowever, the system that Orszag and Ferris lay out keeps a layer of insulation between the government and decisions about patient care.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that U.S. consumers can\u2019t enjoy at least some of the benefits of Medicare, according to Peter Orszag and Timothy G.
