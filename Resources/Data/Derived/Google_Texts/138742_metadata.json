Jeffree Nelson, owner of Jeffree Nelson Custom Homes, is proud of what he does. \u201cI love bringing my ideas together with my clients\u2019 ideas, putting the designs on paper, working with my clients and our trades people, seeing it all come together, working through the challenges, creating custom homes that reflect my clients\u2019 dreams \u2013 right through to that final walk-through. The looks on the homeowners\u2019 faces when they are realizing their dreams \u2013 it makes me very proud \u2013 and inspires me to do it again and again.\u201d\n\nHow did you get started in the building industry?\n\nI started Jeffree Nelson Custom Homes 16 years ago, but I\u2019ve worked in the building industry for 25 years. I have an architecture degree and started working for a residential custom home builder when I was 20-years-old. I developed a passion for this kind a building at a young age. It was so rewarding to realize someone\u2019s dreams. When the builder I was working for started to think about retirement, I remember walking through a house we had just finished thinking, \u2018I could do this.\u201d I got a couple of customers and things just grew from there. In 16 years, I have built about 100 homes; and 98 of them have been referrals.\n\nHow do you differentiate your business from others?\n\nI\u2019m a one-man show. I take a client\u2019s wish list, their unique lifestyle, how they want their home to function and design a home custom to them. I want to incorporate a part of the homeowner or maybe an experience they\u2019ve had to make their home uniquely theirs. I\u2019m on the building site every day to make it a seamless process. It\u2019s a personal experience for me \u2013 because it\u2019s such a personal experience for my clients. The quality of the journey should evident.\n\nWhat advice would you give someone looking to build or remodel?\n\nSpend some time touring projects of the builders you are considering. Look at the quality and craftsmanship. Get referrals and ask, \u2018what could the builder have done differently or better;\u2019 be sure of the specifications and allowances. Make sure the builder is fully aware of the housing site. Make sure they are licensed, insured and have some builders\u2019 association membership.\n\nHow has being a member of the MBA helped your business?\n\nBeing a member of the MBA has helped in many ways. It has a great history of working with and helping builders, remodelers and people in the trades. The staff has a real passion for making our local industry the best, which is so critical because this industry has a huge impact on our local economy.\n\nHow has technology changed your business?\n\nTechnology has really helped with communication \u2013 emailing, texting and sending photos with smart phones \u2013 to our clients, trades people and suppliers. Exterior products, or building science, continue to evolve and get better. And of course, there is the technology we build into our homes like being able to control lighting, temperature \u2013 even music remotely from a cell phone.\n\nWhat is your proudest professional achievement?\n\nI\u2019m very proud of the relationships I\u2019ve developed with the people I\u2019ve built homes for, and my subcontractors and suppliers. Many have become great friends. Also, I\u2019m proud that I have survived the ups and downs of this business. This industry has recently gone through some tough times. I believe you go through ups and downs to be a good business owner. It teaches you a lot about yourself.\n\nWhat is one of your greatest business challenges?\n\nThis business is constantly changing. Other than navigating the ups and downs of this business, it\u2019s probably zoning and building code changes.\n\nWhat is the best advice you were ever given?\n\nWhen I was trying to decide what to call my business, someone told me to put my name on it. It\u2019s about quality and performance. Putting my name on it means I back that up.\n\nWhat is your favorite quote or saying that represents your business philosophy?\n\nMy mother always told me, \u2018treat people the way you\u2019d like to be treated and you will be successful.\u2019 That\u2019s from clients to subcontractors. It creates a culture that builds pride in what you do. It\u2019s reflected in the product.\n\nWho is your personal hero?\n\nI get a lot of strength and motivation from my parents. They taught me the value of hard work. My wife, who teaches nursing and trains students to go into such an honorable profession, and my three kids, who work hard and are motivated every day, inspire me to keep going.\n\nWhat is your dream project?\n\nAn elaborate tree house. Ha! But I think it would be against some building code.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"title": "Taking pride in the work", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/homes/buildinglifestyles/272363321.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/Jeffree-Nelson-redo1.jpg", "height": 513}, "type": "article", "description": "You can hear it in his voice and see it in the homes he builds.
