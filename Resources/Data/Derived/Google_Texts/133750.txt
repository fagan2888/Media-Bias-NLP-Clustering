5. Is Advantage or Medigap better?

It depends. Advantage plans have lower premiums, and almost all come with Part D drug plans. But you’ll have higher out-of-pocket expenses and be restricted to the plan’s network. If you don’t like your plan, you can switch to another one at open enrollment. Medigap will leave you with little or no out-of-pocket exposure, depending on which plan design you choose. And you can go to any doctor who accepts Medicare (about 99 percent of them). But once you’ve picked a plan, you might be stuck with it. After a six-month grace period when you first enroll in Part B, in most states Medigap insurers can turn you down or charge you extra because of pre-existing conditions. Here's more detailed information to help you decide.
