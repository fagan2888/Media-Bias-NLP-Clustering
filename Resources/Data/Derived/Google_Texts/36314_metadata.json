The Texan, who has presented himself as the candidate best poised to unite the GOP against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in November, last year said Kentucky Republican McConnell had betrayed conservatives. He also accused lawmakers in both parties of being in the grip of lobbyists. \u201cIf the Washington lobbyists want to see that happen,\u201d Cruz said of an apology, \u201cthey can hold their breath a long, long time.\u201d\n\nContested convention almost a certainty, say insiders: If Republican insiders are right, Cruz will get his chance to try to unite the GOP not once, but multiple times. About 90% of operatives, activists and strategists in battleground states surveyed by Politico believe this summer\u2019s national convention will require multiple ballots to select the Republican presidential nominee. The insiders said neither Cruz nor real-estate mogul Donald Trump would win the nomination on the first ballot at the Cleveland convention.\n\nExperts on Trump\u2019s health plans: huh? Trump\u2019s ideas on health care are bewildering Republican experts on the subject, the New York Times writes. One, Gail Wilensky, said if the Affordable Care Act is repealed \u2014 as Trump advocates \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have a serious way to expand coverage to replace what you have taken away.\u201d The administrator of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush from 1990 to 1992, Wilensky said: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I see in Trump\u2019s plan that would do anything more than cover a couple million people.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley won\u2019t endorse in primary: Don\u2019t look for former Democratic presidential contender Martin O\u2019Malley to make an endorsement in the primary. In an interview with MSNBC, the former Maryland governor would only say he looks forward to supporting the party\u2019s nominee. He said he would \u201cgladly\u201d vote for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders before supporting Cruz or Trump. The Hill has more on O\u2019Malley\u2019s remarks.\n\nWarren, Brown want Panama Papers probe: Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown are urging the Treasury Department to investigate whether any U.S. or U.S.-linked entity was involved with the law firm at the heart of the \u201cPanama Papers,\u201d Reuters reports. The senators, both Democrats, have written to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and asked for an inquiry into law firm Mossack Fonseca\u2019s activities and its clients.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Ted Cruz won\u2019t say he\u2019s sorry to Mitch McConnell for calling him a liar; Martin O\u2019Malley won\u2019t endorse in the Democratic primary; Donald Trump\u2019s health-care plans bewilder Republican experts; and more.", "creator": "@mktwrobs", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EE240_Cruz_d_ZG_20160128190622.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Robert Schroeder", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Ted Cruz won\u2019t say he\u2019s sorry to Mitch McConnell for calling him a liar; Martin O\u2019Malley won\u2019t endorse in the Democratic primary; Donald Trump\u2019s health-care plans bewilder Republican experts; and more.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ted-cruz-wont-apologize-to-mitch-mcconnell-martin-omalley-wont-endorse-donald-trumps-health-plans-bewilder-experts-2016-04-08", "author": "Robert Schroeder", "parsely-title": "Ted Cruz won\u2019t apologize to Mitch McConnell | Martin O\u2019Malley won\u2019t endorse | Donald Trump\u2019s health plans bewilder experts", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-04-08T08:35:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Ted Cruz won\u2019t say he\u2019s sorry to Mitch McConnell for calling him a liar; Martin O\u2019Malley won\u2019t endorse in the Democratic primary; Donald Trump\u2019s health-care plans bewilder Republican experts; and more.", "title": "Ted Cruz won\u2019t apologize to Mitch McConnell | Martin O\u2019Malley won\u2019t endorse | Donald Trump\u2019s health plans bewilder experts", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ted-cruz-wont-apologize-to-mitch-mcconnell-martin-omalley-wont-endorse-donald-trumps-health-plans-bewilder-experts-2016-04-08", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EE240_Cruz_d_ZG_20160128190622.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EE240_Cruz_d_ZG_20160128190622.jpg"}, "article.id": "9D71FAFE-FD7B-11E5-8A49-277879D46F06", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "\u201cAin\u2019t gonna happen,\u201d says the Republican presidential hopeful.\nTrump\u2019s ideas on health care are bewildering Republican experts on the subject, the New York Times writes.\nAbout 90% of operatives, activists and strategists in battleground states surveyed by Politico believe this summer\u2019s national convention will require multiple ballots to select the Republican presidential nominee.\nThe insiders said neither Cruz nor real-estate mogul Donald Trump would win the nomination on the first ballot at the Cleveland convention.\nExperts on Trump\u2019s health plans: huh?"}
