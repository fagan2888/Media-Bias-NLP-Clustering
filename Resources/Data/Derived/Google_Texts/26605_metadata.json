After all, Republicans insisted at the time, the United States already had the \u201cbest health care system in the world.\u201d\n\nChances are, these GOP policymakers never stopped by a free clinic , where thousands of struggling, uninsured Americans would routinely sleep outside, hoping for an opportunity to receive medical treatment they otherwise couldn\u2019t afford. I still remember watching Bill Moyers sit down five years ago with Wendell Potter , a former executive at a major health insurance company, who discovered the need for systematic reform after visiting a free clinic.\n\nPotter visited a health care expedition in Wise, Virginia, in July 2007. \u201cI just assumed that it would be, you know, like booths set up and people just getting their blood pressure checked and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what I saw were doctors who were set up to provide care in animal stalls. Or they\u2019d erected tents, to care for people\u2026. I\u2019ve got some pictures of people being treated on gurneys, on rain-soaked pavement. And I saw people lined up, standing in line or sitting in these long, long lines, waiting to get care.\u201d\n\nPotter added that families were there from \u201call over the region\u201d because people had heard, \u201cfrom word of mouth,\u201d about the possibility of being able to see a doctor without insurance. He asked himself, \u201cWhat country am I in? It just didn\u2019t seem to be a possibility that I was in the United States.\u201d\n\nThat was then; this is now. This story out of Arkansas is a sign of the times (thanks to reader R.B. for the tip).\n\nAn article in the Mena Star explains that \u2013 despite the efforts of state Rep. Nate Bell, the Mena Republican who has made it his mission to stop outreach informing people of their options for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 citizens in Mena are getting covered under Obamacare. Announcing that 9th Street Ministries, sponsored by the First Baptist Church in Mena, will offer its last clinic later this month, Nurse Stacey Bowser, the clinical director at 9th Street Ministries, said, \u201cWe\u2019ve done our mission.\u201d The clinic has offered free medical services once a month to the uninsured in Mena since 1998. For years, they were seeing hundreds of people a month desperate for care (the clinic only served people with no insurance of their own). But now folks in Mena are signing up with the private option and other coverage options via the ACA. \u201cThis complete dropoff of numbers of people coming to the clinic is a result of all those who have successfully enrolled in an insurance policy now,\u201d Bowser said.\n\nOrdinarily, it might seem like a tragedy to see a free medical clinic close its doors forever, but this story out of Arkansas is actually the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s evidence of historic progress that the clinic no longer feels needed.\n\nThe local newspaper\u2019s servers have been hit or miss since this story first started getting attention yesterday \u2013 so if you click the link and don\u2019t get through, that\u2019s why \u2013 but the report added.\n\n\u201cBecause people are qualifying for insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, our free medical clinic will not be needed anymore,\u201d Stacey Bowser RN, 9th Street Ministries Clinic Director, stated. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from seeing around 300 people a month on a regular basis, but as people were enrolling in Obamacare, the numbers we were seeing have dropped. We were down to 80 people that came through the medical clinic in February, all the way down to three people at the medical clinic in March. Our services won\u2019t be needed anymore, and this will conclude our mission.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to overstate this. The ACA has done an enormous amount of good in a short period of time, but while the uninsured rate is dropping, it\u2019s not zero. I\u2019m glad Arkansas\u2019 9th Street Ministries no longer feels needed, but in the months and years to come, there will still be plenty of other free clinics and community health centers helping people facing crises.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Ordinarily, it might seem like a tragedy to see a free medical clinic close its doors forever, but a new story out of Arkansas is actually the opposite.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/closing-arkansas-clinic-weve-done-our", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Ordinarily, it might seem like a tragedy to see a free medical clinic close its doors forever, but a new story out of Arkansas is actually the opposite.", "title": "Closing Arkansas clinic: 'We've done our mission'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/closing-arkansas-clinic-weve-done-our", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/08/152848715.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/closing-arkansas-clinic-weve-done-our", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/08/152848715.jpg?itok=NlrD8u-b", "height": 553}, "title": "Closing Arkansas clinic: 'We've done our mission'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ordinarily, it might seem like a tragedy to see a free medical clinic close its doors forever, but a new story out of Arkansas is actually the opposite."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-11T10:22:16-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "affordable-care-act,arkansas,economy,health,health-care-reform,medicaid,obamacare,poverty,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Closing Arkansas clinic: 'We've done our mission'", "published": 1, "date": "04/11/2014 10:22:16 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/closing-arkansas-clinic-weve-done-our"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Ordinarily, it might seem like a tragedy to see a free medical clinic close its doors forever, but a new story out of Arkansas is actually the opposite.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Poverty, Economy, Health Care Reform, Health, Affordable Care Act, Arkansas, Medicaid, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bc9\"", "article_summary": "We were down to 80 people that came through the medical clinic in February, all the way down to three people at the medical clinic in March.\nOrdinarily, it might seem like a tragedy to see a free medical clinic close its doors forever, but this story out of Arkansas is actually the opposite \u2013 it\u2019s evidence of historic progress that the clinic no longer feels needed.\nPotter visited a health care expedition in Wise, Virginia, in July 2007.\n\u201cBecause people are qualifying for insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, our free medical clinic will not be needed anymore,\u201d Stacey Bowser RN, 9th Street Ministries Clinic Director, stated.\nI still remember watching Bill Moyers sit down five years ago with Wendell Potter , a former executive at a major health insurance company, who discovered the need for systematic reform after visiting a free clinic."}
