The regime has now denied access to Rep. James McGovern (D-Mass.), creating a whole new diplomatic imbroglio a month after it expelled senior State Department official Tom Malinoswki.\n\nHome of the U.S. Navy\u2019s Fifth Fleet, Bahrain is an officially designated \u201cmajor non-NATO ally.\u201d But tensions have steadily mounted since the 2011 mass protests for democracy. Washington\u2019s muted criticism of the regime\u2019s violent crackdown has been enough to send the small Gulf kingdom into paroxysms against the U.S. Ambassador, State Department officials, and now a member of Congress.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBahrain\u2019s Foreign Minister claimed the problem with Malinowski was \u201cconfined to him personally and it is not about relations with the US,\u201d citing Malinowski\u2019s previous visit to Bahrain as a representative of Human Rights Watch. But the move against McGovern suggests a pattern of shutting out American officials who might be critical of its record on human rights.\n\nA single family largely controls the government in Bahrain, where the king\u2019s uncle has been the unelected Prime Minister for over 40 years. (Yes, it\u2019s one of those sorts of allies.) It routinely represses dissent and no senior official has been brought to account for the killings or torture of dissidents since 2011. Journalists and activists who criticized the king on Twitter are in prison, and talk of political dialogue with the opposition appears as hollow as ever.\n\nMcGovern and I were set to go to Bahrain together this month, having requested permission in early June. While we\u2019ve both been critical of the human rights abuses there, being denied entry is still a big deal. We were going to meet with government officials, members of the opposition, and civil society figures. The regime says it\u2019s reforming; we wanted to judge for ourselves. Instead we were shut out of the country, just like New York Times Pulitzer prizewinner Nick Kristof, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Juan Mendez, and many other supporters of human rights.\n\nMcGovern, who has served in Congress for nearly 18 years, has impressive foreign policy credentials and co-chairs the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. \u201cPreventing me from traveling to Bahrain is a senseless and unproductive step,\u201d he said. \u201cWith or without me in the country, silencing opposition will never work as an effective strategy for long-term peace and stability. We cannot continue turning a blind eye to Bahrain\u2019s reluctance to engage in a meaningful dialogue with its opposition. The need for a meaningful dialogue is urgent. But with key opposition and civil society leaders in jail and with no senior government officials present at the table, the dialogue that would deliver long lasting solutions is impossible.\u201d\n\nBut Washington, which has mounted no serious response to Bahrain\u2019s persecution of peaceful critics, seems at a loss even when the target of the regime\u2019s heavy-hand are its own officials. It offered virtually no public response to the unprecedented expulsion of Malinowksi in July. State Department expressions of concern are routinely mocked by human rights defenders in Bahrain as useless.\n\nAs the U.S. government carries out its non-policy of fingers-crossed, Bahrain slides deeper into polarization and sectarianism. Peaceful political leaders arrested in 2011 remain in jail, as do some of the medics who were tortured after treating injured protestors.\n\nMeanwhile Bahrain has opened new diplomatic, military, and trade links with Russia just when Washington is trying to isolate the Kremlin over Ukraine. Russian arms export agency Rosoboronexport announced details last week of a new deal with the Bahrain regime.\n\nThe U.S. relationship with Bahrain is a mess. On July 31, 18 leading foreign policy specialists\u2014including two of Malinowski\u2019s predecessors\u2014joined to urge Susan Rice to \u201cto convene all relevant interagency officials to conduct a thorough review of the bilateral relationship with Bahrain.\u201d\n\nAt such a crucial time in such a sensitive region, Washington can\u2019t afford erratic partners like the hardliners in Bahrain\u2019s ruling family. It should urgently review the whole relationship and look for other partners in Bahrain who can deliver the sort of peace that the United States needs: people willing to respect human rights, uphold the rule of law, and end the country\u2019s chronic political unrest.\n\nDooley is director of the Human Rights Defenders program at Human Rights First @dooley_dooley.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A month ago Bahrain expelled senior State Department official Tom Malinoswki.", "description": "A month ago Bahrain expelled senior State Department official Tom Malinoswki.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A month ago Bahrain expelled senior State Department official Tom Malinoswki.", "title": "US congressman refused access to Bahrain", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/215769-us-congressman-refused-access-to-bahrain", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/215769-us-congressman-refused-access-to-bahrain", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-23T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Brian Dooley", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-23T09:00:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/215769-us-congressman-refused-access-to-bahrain", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A month ago Bahrain expelled senior State Department official Tom Malinoswki.", "card": "summary", "title": "US congressman refused access to Bahrain"}, "dcterms.title": "US congressman refused access to Bahrain"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf594\"", "article_summary": "Dooley is director of the Human Rights Defenders program at Human Rights First @dooley_dooley.\n), creating a whole new diplomatic imbroglio a month after it expelled senior State Department official Tom Malinoswki.\nWhile we\u2019ve both been critical of the human rights abuses there, being denied entry is still a big deal.\nState Department expressions of concern are routinely mocked by human rights defenders in Bahrain as useless.\nMcGovern, who has served in Congress for nearly 18 years, has impressive foreign policy credentials and co-chairs the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission."}
