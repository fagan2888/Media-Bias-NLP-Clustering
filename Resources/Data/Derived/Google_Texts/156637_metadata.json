John Matthews, passed away Christmas Day.\n\nSenator John Matthews represents the 39th District of South Carolina, including the upper part of Dorchester County.\n\nGeraldine was a prominent contributor to public education in South Carolina, having served as a school librarian.\n\nShe was a positive influence in the life of many of the students who knew her. In July, after being promoted to Commander of the state\u2019s Army National Guard, Lt. Col. Renita L. Berry specifically thanked Geraldine for guiding her in her education, a key tool in Berry becoming the first African-American female to hold brigade command in SC Army National Guard.\n\nGeraldine was also on the Board of Directors of the Orangeburg County School District 5 Education Foundation.\n\n\u201cHer loss affects us both individually and as a group \u2013 and not just politically or socially, but as human beings, too. Mrs. Matthews was a marvelous woman. A dedicated woman. A person who knew what was right \u2013 who stood up for what was right \u2013 who worked to make sure that right was achieved. And in those efforts, she helped many achieve impressive goals.\u201d said Ethel D. Campbell, Chair of the Dorchester County Democratic Party.\n\nThe address for the wake (Wednesday, 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.) at Pineville UMC is:\n\n1801 Winter Creek Road\n\nBowman, SC 29018\n\nThe address for the funeral (Thursday, 11 a.m.) at Bethune-Bowman High School is:\n\n4857 Charleston Highway\n\nRowesville, SC 29133\n\nCopyright WCSC 2015.
