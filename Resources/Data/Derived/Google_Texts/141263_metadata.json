People tend to get fired up about engagement and healthy habits for a given period of time, then they go back to their old selves again. At-risk populations \u2014 the people who cost the system the most \u2014 resist using wearables, while people who are already healthy gravitate to them.\n\nAn oft-cited study by Endeavour Partners found that one-third of American consumers who bought a wearable device stopped using it within six months. Moreover, one out of every 10 adults owns some kind of activity tracker, but half of them no longer use it.\n\nIn order for engagement via wearables to truly move the dial for health care providers, patients (or employees) must strap on the devices and truly change their habits in the long term.\n\nWhether the wearable or the engagement platform is good enough to do that is a touch bet for a VC to make.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t get ROI (return on investment) by following sugar for three months,\u201d one venture capitalist told me.\n\nI\u2019ve seen several startups shift their focus away from wearables to some other more sustainable role in health care delivery or benefits delivery within large employers.\n\nThese days we\u2019re hearing about large funding rounds going to companies that are willing to dive deep into the health care delivery system \u2014 wading through the complexities of the business model, the regulations, the cultural nuances \u2014 in order to remove waste, create efficiencies, and remove friction points.\n\nSaaS-based health analytics platforms like Kyruus, Health Catalyst, and Aledade are pulling in some of the biggest funding rounds these days. They\u2019re also seeing the fastest growth as value-based reimbursement models proliferate.\n\nFitbit and Apple will continue to sell health wearables \u2014 millions of them \u2014 but those companies get the money up front, and they\u2019re not hurt if the buyer stops using the device in three months.", "article_metadata": {"bt": {"pubDate": "2015-05-22T14:30:19+00:00", "author": "mark-sullivan", "modDate": "2015-05-22T13:24:26+00:00", "keywords": "fitness-trackers,patient-engagement,wearables", "type": "news", "id": 1735312}, "og": {"site_name": "VentureBeat", "description": "It\u2019s human nature.
