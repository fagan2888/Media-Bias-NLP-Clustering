Fulton County Commission Chairman John Eaves has been re-elected to a third term. “I certainly want to thank the constituents of Fulton County”, says Eaves, “I got almost 160,000 votes yesterday”. Eaves defeated Republican challenger Earl Cooper with 63 percent of the vote to Cooper’s 36 percent in Tuesday’s election.

According to Eaves, “I look forward to continuing to roll up my sleeves, doing what I can, and work with friends, neighbors, constituents and business folk in trying to make our county the greatest county that it can possibly be.”

Eaves promoted a platform of a strong healthcare delivery system, which includes Grady Memorial Hospital, criminal justice reform, and economic development. Asked about the future of Grady, Eaves says, “people need to be reminded that Grady was about to close seven years ago, and Fulton County stepped up to the plate. We infused about 100 million dollars into their budget. We changed the government structure of the hospital.” And now Grady, according to Eaves, is operating in the black, serving more than 600,000 people a year. But, he says, “Grady still has a way to go. I think continued financial, consistent support from Fulton County is essential.” Eaves says he thinks with the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, championed by President Barack Obama, there still is greater opportunity for more people to be served. And while he admits it might be a dim hope, Eaves says that Medicare expansion would provide more access to affordable healthcare.

Fulton County Commissioner Emma Darnell defeated Republican Abraham Watson, taking more than 91 percent of the vote. It means Democrats keep their decades-long control of Fulton County Government. Four of the seven seats on the commission will be held by democrats.
