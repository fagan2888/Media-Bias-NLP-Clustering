As a result many hospitals want to change the traditional single-serving-line model, which can create confusion between entry and exit points, according to Belanger. Some facilities separate the line into several different stations with various food options, although for this to work, she cautioned, the design team must \"create a flow that allows guests to visualize the menu offerings, traverse to the desired offering stations, and pay and exit from a controlled space in a minimal time frame.\" Article", "article_metadata": {"description": "To maximize patient satisfaction, many hospitals redesign their dining spaces, according to Healthcare Design Magazine.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "To maximize patient satisfaction, many hospitals redesign their dining spaces, according to Healthcare Design Magazine.", "title": "To improve patient experience, some hospitals redesign dining areas", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/improve-patient-experience-some-hospitals-redesign-dining-areas/2015-06-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "confusion,convenience,hospital design,hospital food,Operations & Business Management,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89ff\"", "article_summary": "To maximize patient satisfaction, many hospitals cast an eye toward the design of their dining spaces, according to Healthcare Design Magazine.\nAlthough these areas are not major revenue drivers, they play a large part in satisfaction and patient experience, Yi Belanger, a designer at Add Inc., told the publication.\nAn outdated or poor-quality dining area may create the impression that the overall facility suffers from the same problems.\nAs a result many hospitals want to change the traditional single-serving-line model, which can create confusion between entry and exit points, according to Belanger.\nSome facilities separate the line into several different stations with various food options, although for this to work, she cautioned, the design team must \"create a flow that allows guests to visualize the menu offerings, traverse to the desired offering stations, and pay and exit from a controlled space in a minimal time frame.\""}
