Hosted by Maine Quality Counts, the conference cast a spotlight on how Maine can better deliver both health and health care.\n\nIn a state of our size, that\u2019s a pretty remarkable turnout. Dr. Sue Woods, a consumer health data expert for the VA, put it in perspective this way:\n\nThe day\u2019s big draw was Dr. Atul Gawande, a Brigham and Women\u2019s surgeon, Harvard professor, author, and columnist for the New Yorker. His full list of accomplishments is extensive, and also includes the title of preeminent global thinker, according to both Time and Foreign Policy Magazine.\n\nTo health care nerds (I\u2019m raising my hand here), he\u2019s a rock star. The line for his book signing snaked around half of the Augusta Civic Center\u2019s main floor. Much of his talk centered around that book, \u201cBeing Mortal,\u201d an examination of medicine\u2019s ambivalence about end-of-life care.\n\nBut I was struck by the historical perspective he lent to health care\u2019s modern problems. We\u2019ve made astounding advances in the science and technology of medicine in recent decades, Gawande said. Over the last 75 years, we\u2019ve enumerated 60,000 ways the human body can fail, 4,000 medical and surgical procedures, 6,000 different drugs and thousands of ways to prevent illness, he said.\n\nBut deploying that knowledge to each and every community and individual is \u201carguably the most ambitious thing man has ever attempted,\u201d he said.\n\nChief among the challenges \u2014 cost. Health care is eating up more and more of our household and government budgets, he said. That has led to what Gawande described as health care\u2019s \u201cdeepest crisis of its existence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single state, not a single country that isn\u2019t asking whether we can afford what doctors do,\u201d he said.\n\nStates like Maine are moving toward answers, Gawande said. He credited a broad effort to improve health care quality in the state \u2014 a decade-long movement that has spanned chronic disease prevention, tracking hospital infections, empowering patients and more.\n\nGawande found proof in the numbers. Under Medicare, Maine falls into both the top quarter of states for best outcomes and the bottom quarter for Medicare costs, Gawande said.\n\n\u201cIf the rest of the country were like Maine, we\u2019d have tens, probably hundreds of billions of dollars available for everything from infrastructure and education to health,\u201d he said.\n\nWhere health care works in harmony as a system, it\u2019s most successful, Gawande said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been obsessed with the components \u2014 we want the best drugs, the best devices, the best doctors, the best specialists. But we don\u2019t think much about how we put them together,\u201d he said.\n\nTry this analogy on for size: Imagine constructing a car with the very best parts, Gawande said. Porsche brakes, a BMW chassis, a Ferrari engine, and a Volvo body.\n\n\u201cYou put it all together and what do you get?\u201d he said. \u201cA mess. A very expensive mess that does not go anywhere.\u201d\n\nTo watch Gawande\u2019s full speech, keep an eye on the Maine Quality Counts website for a link in the coming days.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fad\"", "article_summary": "Hosted by Maine Quality Counts, the conference cast a spotlight on how Maine can better deliver both health and health care.\nTo health care nerds (I\u2019m raising my hand here), he\u2019s a rock star.\nHealth care is eating up more and more of our household and government budgets, he said.\nWhere health care works in harmony as a system, it\u2019s most successful, Gawande said.\nHe credited a broad effort to improve health care quality in the state \u2014 a decade-long movement that has spanned chronic disease prevention, tracking hospital infections, empowering patients and more."}
