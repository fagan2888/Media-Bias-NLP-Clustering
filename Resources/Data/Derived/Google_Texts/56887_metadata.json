Talk to your friends at the Chamber about that,\u201d Roginsky said in response. \u201cTens of millions of people for whom immigration reform is a priority. Talk to the millions of lesbians and gay men and women who are unable to get jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not priorities, that they\u2019re not important topics,\u201d Carlson told Roginsky, backtracking. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, the timing of it all,\u201d suggesting that Obama has brought these topics up to shift attention from Monday\u2019s press briefing by White House Spokesperson Jay Carney.\n\n\u201cIf it was six months ago, or a year ago, you would\u2019ve said he was doing it to distract from Benghazi,\u201d Roginsky countered. \u201cIf it was a year before that, you would\u2019ve said he was doing it to distract from his re-election campaign. Let me put it to you this way: those of us in the Democratic Party who were unhappy with George [W.] Bush over Iraq never said, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s not talk about anything but Iraq. Let\u2019s not talk about anything else the president\u2019s gonna do.'\u201d\n\n\u201cJulie\u2019s distracting, actually,\u201d Webb said, cutting Roginsky off.\n\nWatch the discussion, as posted by Equality Matters on Monday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "height": 430}, "title": "Gretchen Carlson gets shut down after calling LGBT rights and climate change \u2018distractions\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf7f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWouldn\u2019t the first thing you talk about \u2014 instead of immigration, potentially \u2014 would be jobs, if you weren\u2019t gonna talk about Obamacare?\u201d Carlson asked Roginsky.\n\u201cTens of millions of people for whom immigration reform is a priority.\nFox News host Gretchen Carlson was stymied by contributor Julie Roginsky on Monday after Carlson attempted to paint the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), immigration reform and climate change as \u201cdistractions\u201d employed by President Barack Obama to shift the country\u2019s focus away from the Affordable Care Act.\nTalk to the millions of lesbians and gay men and women who are unable to get jobs.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not priorities, that they\u2019re not important topics,\u201d Carlson told Roginsky, backtracking.\n\u201cIf it was a year before that, you would\u2019ve said he was doing it to distract from his re-election campaign."}
