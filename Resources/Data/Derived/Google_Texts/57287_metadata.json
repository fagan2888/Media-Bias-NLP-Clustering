In states where NPs had independence in practice and prescribing costs averaged $509, according to researchers Joanne Spetz, Ph.D., a professor at the Institute for Health Policy Studies and associate director for research Strategy at the Center for the Health professionals at the University of California San Francisco, and Stephen T. Parente, director of the medical Industry Leadership Institute at the Carlson School of Business at the University of Minnesota,\n\nIf retail-based clinic visits make up for 10 percent of all outpatient primary care visits by 2015, national cost savings would be $2.2 billion, adding on an additional $810 million if NPs in all 50 states practiced independently. That savings could grow even more--by $472 million--if NPs could prescribe on their own too, researchers said.\n\n\"Our findings underscore earlier research indicating that when NPs practice to the full extent of their training, they can deliver highly efficient high-quality primary care,\" Spetz said in a University of California San Francisco article. \"We believe that primary care practices should leverage NPs' knowledge and skills and the increased availability of convenient care delivery settings to expand access to health care.\"\n\nDespite their cost savings, not everyone supports retail clinics. The Rhode Island Medical Society released a position paper stating \"health care services delivered in an RBC are isolated, commercial transactions between strangers. By design, the RBC provides narrowly focused, disarticulated, fragmentary care on a strictly protocol-driven, episodic and impersonal basis,\" FiercePracticeManagement previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study\n\n- check out the University of California San Francisco article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRetail-based clinics threaten medical home model, doc groups say\n\nWhat retail clinics are doing right\n\nReport: Retail clinics offer relief of primary care physician shortage\n\nDo retail health clinics complement or compete with primary care providers?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Retail-based clinics,\u00a0already a proven healthcare cost saver, can even further reduce costs when\u00a0nurse practitioners are allowed to practice and prescribe independently, according to a.new study\u00a0published in the November issue of\u00a0Health Affairs.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Retail-based clinics,\u00a0already a proven healthcare cost saver, can even further reduce costs when\u00a0nurse practitioners are allowed to practice and prescribe independently, according to a.new study\u00a0published in the November issue of\u00a0Health Affairs.", "title": "Study: NPs in retail clinics could reduce healthcare costs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/study-nps-retail-clinics-could-reduce-healthcare-costs/2013-11-06", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce021\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the study- check out the University of California San Francisco articleRelated Articles:Retail-based clinics threaten medical home model, doc groups sayWhat retail clinics are doing rightReport: Retail clinics offer relief of primary care physician shortageDo retail health clinics complement or compete with primary care providers?\nIn states where physicians oversaw NPs, costs averaged $543, as compared to $484 in states where NPs practiced independently.\nDespite their cost savings, not everyone supports retail clinics.\n\"We believe that primary care practices should leverage NPs' knowledge and skills and the increased availability of convenient care delivery settings to expand access to health care.\"\nThe Rhode Island Medical Society released a position paper stating \"health care services delivered in an RBC are isolated, commercial transactions between strangers."}
