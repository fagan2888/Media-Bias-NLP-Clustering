He was an undercover officer who posed as a drug buyer to catch drug dealers.\n\nThe undercover officer had made scores of drug arrests.\n\nOn the day of Laabs\u2019 death he was rewarded for his tenacity by being promoted to detective sergeant in the Manitou Springs Police Department.\n\nBy all rights it was a day of celebration for the 28-year-old officer. But on that day, Dec. 18, 1975, Laabs\u2019 career and life would end in a possible undercover drug buy. Whoever killed him has not been brought to justice.\n\nLaabs had worked several years as a police officer in New Mexico and Wyoming before working in Boulder County and Pueblo.\n\nIn Boulder County he worked on a commission basis for the Longmont Police Department.\n\nHe was paid between $172 and $180 to make six arrests.\n\nBecause of the commissions defense attorneys questioned his motivation for making arrests. It was as though he was a bounty hunter when he \u201centrapped\u201d defendants into buying drugs.\n\nDefense attorney Roger Stevens, who represented four Longmont youths arrested in Laabs\u2019 sting, said Laabs begged them to buy two \u201clids\u201d of marijuana.\n\n\u201cHe had a financial interest in making arrests,\u201d Stevens had argued.\n\nAt a 1973 Boulder County Court hearing, Longmont Police Chief Carroll Hebrew said Laabs had worked for him for only 10 days in September of 1972 and solved six cases during that time span.\n\nLaabs later solved 80 drug cases for the Pueblo Police Department. It was not clear by a Saturday, Dec. 20, 1975 article whether Laabs was paid on a commission basis at the time.\n\nBefore the unit was disbanded in 1973, Laabs also worked for the Metro Enforcement Group, a state-wide unit that investigated and solved drug cases across Colorado.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "colorado springs,Donald Robert Laabs,Manitou Springs,New Mexico,policeman,shot,Wyoming", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2013/11/23/policeman-killed-on-day-of-promotion-in-colorado-springs/7515/", "site_name": "Cold Cases", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Policeman killed on day of promotion in Colorado Springs"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Policeman killed on day of promotion in Colorado Springs", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2013/11/23/policeman-killed-on-day-of-promotion-in-colorado-springs/7515/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@kmitchelldp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Policeman killed on day of promotion in Colorado Springs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc945b\"", "article_summary": "But on that day, Dec. 18, 1975, Laabs\u2019 career and life would end in a possible undercover drug buy.\nBefore the unit was disbanded in 1973, Laabs also worked for the Metro Enforcement Group, a state-wide unit that investigated and solved drug cases across Colorado.\nHe was an undercover officer who posed as a drug buyer to catch drug dealers.\nOn the day of Laabs\u2019 death he was rewarded for his tenacity by being promoted to detective sergeant in the Manitou Springs Police Department.\nThe undercover officer had made scores of drug arrests."}
