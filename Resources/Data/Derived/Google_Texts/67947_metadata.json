A fellow Italian journalist, Gianluigi Nuzzi, is also being investigated for revelations made in his book, \u201cMerchants in the Temple.\u201d\n\nWhile describing the investigation as \u201ca terrible moment,\u201d Fittipaldi remained defiant:\n\n\u201cFrom my point of view they are crazy charges, in the sense that in no democratic state, in no Western democracy, are there such restrictive laws on press freedom and expression.\u201d\n\nFittipaldi said he went to meet with investigators on Monday to learn the details of the accusations against him. He and Nuzzi are accused of crimes against the Vatican City State and its security, part of a 2013 decree by Pope Francis intended to prevent documents from being leaked. It applies only within the Vatican City State and carries a jail sentence of up to eight years.\n\nTwo people who were part of a temporary commission to advise Pope Francis on reforms, Spanish priest Lucio Angel Vallejo Balda and laywoman Francesca Chaouqui, were arrested earlier this month on allegations that they leaked the documents.\n\nREAD: US Catholic bishops meet, still struggling to adapt to \u2018Pope Francis effect\u2019\n\nFittipaldi argued that the pontiff himself had already discussed everything Fittipaldi wrote about in the book, albeit in less detail.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d already denounced the sicknesses of the Curia (or Vatican administration),\u201d Fittipaldi said. \u201cObviously he didn\u2019t go into detail because he\u2019s not an investigative journalist.\u201d\n\nThe publication of the two books has been dubbed \u201cVatileaks II,\u201d a take on the first such scandal, in 2012, when Nuzzi published documents leaked to him by then-Pope Benedict XVI\u2019s butler.\n\nFittipaldi, however, said that the two episodes are not comparable, as Nuzzi\u2019s earlier book refers to the private affairs and correspondence of the then-pope, whereas the two new books rely on a number of sources from different Vatican bodies.\n\nThe new books \u201cnarrate the financial riches, the economic scandals within the Vatican. It\u2019s news, I think, that is fundamental to recount. It\u2019s important for the faithful and the nonfaithful around the world,\u201d he said.\n\nThe investigation will be a test case for the 2013 law and is viewed by Fittipaldi as a bid to deter other such disclosures:\n\n\u201cThey want to create an internal precedent, as a way to stop other leaks in the future. They don\u2019t care at all about what we think of these medieval rules.\u201d\n\nYS/MG END SCAMMELL", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Culture, Ethics, Institutions, Politics, Avarice, Catholic, Christian, Curia, Emiliano Fittipaldi, leaks", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "VATICAN CITY (RNS) Emiliano Fittipaldi is accused of crimes against the Vatican City State and its security, part of a 2013 decree by Pope Francis intended to prevent documents from being leaked.", "title": "Journalist in leaks case denounces Vatican law, says it infringes on freedom of expression", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/17/journalist-leaks-case-denounces-vatican-law-says-infringes-freedom-expression/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/thumb-FITTIPALDI-Vatican.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rosiescammell"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/17/journalist-leaks-case-denounces-vatican-law-says-infringes-freedom-expression/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/17/journalist-leaks-case-denounces-vatican-law-says-infringes-freedom-expression/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "VATICAN CITY (RNS) Emiliano Fittipaldi is accused of crimes against the Vatican City State and its security, part of a 2013 decree by Pope Francis intended to prevent documents from being leaked."}, "article_summary": "Emiliano Fittipaldi, whose new book \u201cAvarice\u201d reveals the struggle for financial reform at the Vatican, is under investigation for publishing secret documents leaked from the Holy See.\nIt applies only within the Vatican City State and carries a jail sentence of up to eight years.\nHe and Nuzzi are accused of crimes against the Vatican City State and its security, part of a 2013 decree by Pope Francis intended to prevent documents from being leaked.\n\u201cHe\u2019d already denounced the sicknesses of the Curia (or Vatican administration),\u201d Fittipaldi said.\nThe new books \u201cnarrate the financial riches, the economic scandals within the Vatican."}
