Companies that don\u2019t must pay back the difference to policyholders in cash or lower future premiums.\n\nThe idea is to enhance efficiency and effectiveness while balancing premiums and profits.\n\nFor now, a Star Tribune analysis of government data found, the trend is moving in that direction.\n\nBy 2013, United, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, had cut its mandatory annual premium refunds to roughly $90 million. The country\u2019s other major insurers \u2014 Humana, Cigna, Aetna and WellPoint \u2014 also reduced their refund payments enormously from 2011 to 2013. Cigna led the way, almost wiping them out entirely.\n\n\u201cA lot more of [each] premium dollar is being spent on care by for-profit companies,\u201d said Mike McCue, an MBA from the University of Minnesota who now teaches health care finance at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nGraphic: Health law forces premium refunds Graphic: Health law forces premium refunds\n\nMcCue, an expert in so-called medical loss ratios that determine premium refunds, believes insurers will continue to adjust premiums rates and claims predictions in hopes of avoiding refunds.\n\nPushing premium dollars into patient care and away from other expenses is what U.S. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota had in mind when he authored medical loss ratio legislation and helped get a version of it included in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe more you spend on administration, marketing, CEO salaries and profits, the more health care is going to cost everybody,\u201d Franken said in an interview.\n\nFranken, a Democrat, originally proposed that insurers spend 85 to 90 percent of premiums on care or be forced to refund the difference. He settled for a compromise of 80 to 85 percent, depending on whether coverage was for individual, small group or large group policies.\n\nAs a result, Franken said, health insurance costs are now rising more slowly than they have in decades. \u201cWhat we hoped and thought would happen happened,\u201d he said.\n\nWhether spending a bigger share of premium dollars on patient care improves health outcomes remains a matter of conjecture.\n\nWashington and Lee University law professor Tim Jost said a big reason the new law set minimum standards and required companies that didn\u2019t meet them to issue refunds was that premium rates were increasing much faster than claims.\n\n\u201cAfter the economy collapsed [in 2007], claims were climbing at much lower rates than they had been,\u201d said Jost, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on the Affordable Care Act. \u201cBut premiums kept going up at double-digit rates.\u201d\n\nThe results, according to Jost, were record profits for for-profit health insurers and record reserves for nonprofit insurers.\n\nPremium refunds, he said, have forced companies of all kinds to set premiums and conduct business in ways that are \u201cmore realistic.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth Group has paid far more in premium refunds than any other insurance company in the country, roughly $545 million from 2011 to 2013. WellPoint is a distant second at $195 million.\n\nOn a per member basis, United\u2019s largest premium refunds and adjustments have come for people covered under individual policies. Using membership information provided by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Star Tribune determined that United paid refunds on individual policies that averaged $93.53 per member in 2011, $55.32 per member in 2012 and $30.36 in 2013. In contrast, rebates for large group policies were $25.89 per member in 2011, $10.07 in 2012 and $4.75 in 2013.\n\nA United spokeswoman said in an e-mail to the Star Tribune that the company\u2019s \u201cgoal in pricing is to match expected medical cost increases with premiums \u2026 [O]ur rebate is less than one-half of 1 percent of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s total annual premium collected. We will continue to apply sound actuarial principles in determining our pricing and when, despite our best predictions, we do not meet \u2026 requirements, we will issue refunds.\u201d\n\nDavid Heupel, a senior health analyst at Minneapolis-based Thrivent Financial, tracks United for investors. He doesn\u2019t see the size of the company\u2019s premium refunds \u201cas saying United is doing a bad job.\u201d Rather, Heupel believes that United and other for-profit health insurers continue to search for the optimal balance that serves shareholders while meeting directives of the new health care law.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to benchmark the allowable profitability and still offer a competitive package,\u201d Heupel said. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want to do is underprice on false assumptions.\u201d\n\nThat distinguishes for-profit companies from nonprofit companies, Virginia Commonwealth\u2019s McCue said. Nonprofit health insurers have traditionally spent more than 85 percent of premiums on care, he noted, so most nonprofits have not needed to refund premiums under the new law.\n\nOne for-profit strategy could be to predict claims and set premiums planning to pay a small rebate, added Washington and Lee\u2019s Jost.\n\n\u201cIf you do have to pay rebates, you don\u2019t lose much,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have to pay rebates, you maximize profits.\u201d\n\nBesides, getting a refund might actually produce brand loyalty in customers, Jost and Heupel suggested.\n\nBut Steve Parente, a health care finance expert at the University of Minnesota, said companies would ultimately like to avoid refunds and are now pressing for ways to reduce costs more aggressively.\n\n\u201cThey were interested in this before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no one was holding them to a standard,\u201d\n\nParente says United is \u201cnarrowing the hospitals and providers they deal with and negotiating rates\u201d to cut costs and make sure they don\u2019t have to pay premium refunds.\n\nHowever, Heupel does not think for-profit companies will ever spend more than the legally required 80 to 85 percent of premiums on patient care. Otherwise, they will cut into profit margins that are critical to maintaining stock prices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you get anything back if you get to 95 cents on the dollar,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "WASHINGTON &mdash; In 2011, the nation&rsquo;s new health care law required UnitedHealth Group to provide its health insurance customers $305 million in premium refunds because the company spent more than the law allowed on administration, marketing and profits.", "title": "Health insurers must pay up or pay back", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/health-insurers-must-pay-up-or-pay-back/271440501/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1UNITED071913.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1UNITED071913.JPG?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON &mdash; In 2011, the nation&rsquo;s new health care law required UnitedHealth Group to provide its health insurance customers $305 million in premium refunds because the company spent more than the law allowed on administration, marketing and profits.", "title": "Health insurers must pay up or pay back", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/health-insurers-must-pay-up-or-pay-back/271440501/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1UNITED071913.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/1UNITED071913.JPG?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "WASHINGTON &mdash; In 2011, the nation&rsquo;s new health care law required UnitedHealth Group to provide its health insurance customers $305 million in premium refunds because the company spent more than the law allowed on administration, marketing and profits."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f09\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut premiums kept going up at double-digit rates.\u201dThe results, according to Jost, were record profits for for-profit health insurers and record reserves for nonprofit insurers.\nGraphic: Health law forces premium refunds Graphic: Health law forces premium refundsMcCue, an expert in so-called medical loss ratios that determine premium refunds, believes insurers will continue to adjust premiums rates and claims predictions in hopes of avoiding refunds.\n\u201cThe more you spend on administration, marketing, CEO salaries and profits, the more health care is going to cost everybody,\u201d Franken said in an interview.\nBy 2013, United, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, had cut its mandatory annual premium refunds to roughly $90 million.\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t want to do is underprice on false assumptions.\u201dThat distinguishes for-profit companies from nonprofit companies, Virginia Commonwealth\u2019s McCue said."}
