COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Lion cub cousins soon will be working on their roars after being born less than a week apart to half sisters at the Columbus Zoo

Zoo officials said Saturday that first-time mom Kazi gave birth to three cubs on Thursday, though only two survived. Kazi’s half sister Asali delivered four cubs in the zoo’s lion yard on Aug. 16.

Zoo officials say Kazi’s two surviving cubs are in great health, and all four of Asali’s cubs are doing well.

The lion habitat will remain closed to allow the mothers and their offspring some quiet. Both mothers were mated with a lion named Tomo.
