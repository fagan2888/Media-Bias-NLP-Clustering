Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee says the goal this time around is to keep shoppers from getting tangled up in the surge of last-minute enrollment.\n\nTo that end, Lee says, anyone who starts the sign-up process by the original deadline \u2013 Sunday at midnight \u2013 will now have until Feb. 6 at midnight to finish.\n\nThose who still need to sign up for health coverage can do so through an insurance broker, on Covered California\u2019s website or at any number of enrollment events this weekend, including one Sunday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires all Americans to have health coverage, except for those who qualify for an exemption. Those who are not exempt and still go without insurance will face an increased tax penalty in 2016.\n\nCovered California has sent out teams into neighborhoods with low enrollment rates across the state in a last-minute effort to boost signups.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "The original deadline to buy a health plan or switch plans for 2016 was Sunday at midnight.
