Ted Lieu of California sharply criticized the FDA in a letter to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and has called for congressional hearings into the matter, FierceHealthcare reported.\n\nAnd John Allen, M.D., the president of the American Gastroenterological Association, told CNN that duodenoscopes have been linked to superbug infections since 1987, when 10 of his patients became sick with the pseudomonas bacteria after undergoing a procedure with the devices, which are used to look at tiny ducts on patients' intestinal tracts.\n\n\"It certainly is disturbing that a fundamental design issue with these scopes would cause problems for this long,\" he said.\n\nThe design issue in question is the fact that bacteria such as CRE can remain on duodenoscopes even after staff follow the manufacturer-recommended reprocessing protocol, which despite the FDA's recent warning about the devices, has not been updated since the recent outbreaks, which first surfaced in 2012.\n\nThus the FDA is rushing to update risk information included on duodenoscope labels as well as establish better sterilization protocols, William Maisel, M.D., head of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, told Reuters. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also is close to finalizing a new disinfection protocol for the devices.\n\nThe hospitals at the center of the most recent outbreak don't seem to be waiting for government agencies to update protocols. UCLA switched to gas sterilization of its duodenoscopes, FierceHealthcare previously reported, and Carolinas HealthCare System, where two patients died of CRE infections in recent months, has done the same, the Shelby Star reported. The North Carolina hospitals also isolate CRE-infected patients and have assigned a specific nursing staff to treat CRE patients at facilities that are at the highest risk, according to the newspaper.\n\nThese precautions haven't silenced calls for reform, however.\n\n\"The devices need to be designed better, the instructions need to be more clear, the hospitals need better training, and adequate time needs to be given in hospitals to ensure sterility is top notch,\" Mary Logan, chief executive of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, told Reuters.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the CNN article\n\n- here's the Reuters report\n\n- read the Shelby Star article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAntibiotic stewardship can curb rise of deadly superbugs\n\nCRE superbug spreads to North Carolina, kills two\n\nFDA issues warning about scopes linked to superbug outbreak\n\nSuperbug kills two patients in California\n\nNew superbug danger: Patients sickened by infected endoscopes\n\nHospitals must screen for superbugs like CRE or face deadly consequences\n\nCDC urges hospital action to stop deadly bacteria\n\nReport: Superbugs a 'looming global crisis'\n\nGlobal innovation funds needed to fight superbugs\n\nWhite House wants $1.2B to fight antibiotic resistance", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid concerns over the response of the Food and Drug Administration to a deadly outbreak of the superbug Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), the agency plans to modify the labels on duodenoscopes, the specialized medical devices blamed for spreading the bacteria, Reuters\u00a0reported.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Amid concerns over the response of the Food and Drug Administration to a deadly outbreak of the superbug Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), the agency plans to modify the labels on duodenoscopes, the specialized medical devices blamed for spreading the bacteria, Reuters\u00a0reported.", "title": "Under-fire FDA rushes to respond to superbug outbreak", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/under-fire-fda-rushes-respond-superbug-outbreak/2015-02-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "antibiotic-resistant bacteria,Care Delivery,CRE outbreak,drug-resistant superbugs,Food and Drug Administration (FDA),Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "article_summary": "The hospitals at the center of the most recent outbreak don't seem to be waiting for government agencies to update protocols.\nThe North Carolina hospitals also isolate CRE-infected patients and have assigned a specific nursing staff to treat CRE patients at facilities that are at the highest risk, according to the newspaper.\n\"It certainly is disturbing that a fundamental design issue with these scopes would cause problems for this long,\" he said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also is close to finalizing a new disinfection protocol for the devices.\nAmid concerns over the response of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to a deadly outbreak of the superbug Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), the agency plans to modify the labels on duodenoscopes, the specialized medical devices blamed for spreading the bacteria, Reuters reported."}
