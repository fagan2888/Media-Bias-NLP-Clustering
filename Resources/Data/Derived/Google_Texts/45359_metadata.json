According to Kaiser Health News, a subsidiary of Kaiser Family Health, the plan applies to non-union U.S. workers only and is expected to save UPS an estimated $60 million annually.\n\nWhile the Kaiser Family Foundation says the average family plan is $15,700, not all employers help out with those costs, and it looks like ObamaCare isn't helping out either. Even though USA Today reports that \"new rules state that those families will not be penalized for not purchasing coverage...the point of the law was to make coverage affordable for families.\" Currently, 4 percent of large employers exclude spouses from employee healthcare, with an additional 8 percent expected to make such a change in 2014.\n\nWith the promise of expanding coverage to all Americans under ObamaCare not coming to fruition, one wonders whether or not Congress will take steps to ensure that 500,000 children get the health insurance that ObamaCare promised them. Unfortunately, as more and more companies continue to dump employee health coverage to save costs, that 500,000 children will continue to rise, making ObamaCare even more of a train wreck than it already is.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "With several major corporations announcing they will be dropping their employer-sponsored health coverage for tens of thousands of workers, ObamaCare may leave up to 500,000 children ineligible for ObamaCare subsidies.", "title": "Obamacare Glitch May Leave 500,000 Children Without Coverage As Employers Drop Families", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/jeffrey-meyer/obamacare-glitch-may-leave-500000-children-without-coverage-employers-drop", "updated_time": "2013-09-24T13:42:28-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-24T13:42:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-24T13:42:28-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "With several major corporations announcing they will be dropping their employer-sponsored health coverage for tens of thousands of workers, ObamaCare may leave up to 500,000 children ineligible for ObamaCare subsidies.", "title": "Obamacare Glitch May Leave 500,000 Children Without Coverage As Employers Drop Families", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/jeffrey-meyer/obamacare-glitch-may-leave-500000-children-without-coverage-employers-drop", "image": {"src": "http:"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "With several major corporations announcing they will be dropping their employer-sponsored health coverage for tens of thousands of workers, ObamaCare may leave up to 500,000 children ineligible for ObamaCare subsidies.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcceac\"", "article_summary": "According to Kaiser Health News, a subsidiary of Kaiser Family Health, the plan applies to non-union U.S. workers only and is expected to save UPS an estimated $60 million annually.\nObamaCare defines \"affordable\" health care as 9.5% of an employee's household income, but this \"glitch\" in ObamaCare may leave hundreds of thousands of families without healthcare.\nAfter several major corporations including IBM, Walmart and Walgreens, announced they will be dropping their employer-sponsored health coverage for tens of thousands of workers, a new error was revealed in ObamaCare that may leave up to 500,000 children without coverage.\nEven though USA Today reports that \"new rules state that those families will not be penalized for not purchasing coverage...the point of the law was to make coverage affordable for families.\"\nUnfortunately, as more and more companies continue to dump employee health coverage to save costs, that 500,000 children will continue to rise, making ObamaCare even more of a train wreck than it already is."}
