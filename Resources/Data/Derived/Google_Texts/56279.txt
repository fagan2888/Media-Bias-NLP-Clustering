U.K. stocks fell for the first time in three sessions Friday, with miners paying the price from a dive in Chinese equities, but the benchmark FTSE 100 still posted a gain for the week.

The FTSE 100 UKX, +0.04% declined 0.3% to 6,375.15, with the basic materials group putting in the worst performance. The moves cut into Thursday’s 0.9% rise, which was supported by gains for miners. The index ended this week 0.6% higher, a second straight weekly advance.

Blue chips in Britain and across the broader European market SXXP, +0.10% fell Friday as Chinese stocks sank. That plunge came after a Chinese regulator said it’s investigating two major Chinese brokerages over suspected violations of securities rules. The Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.26% slid 5.5%, the worst fall since August, during which markets globally were rocked in part by China’s sudden yuan devaluation.

Separately, Chinese data released Friday showed profit made by industrial companies in the country fell for a fifth straight month in October, down 4.6% from the year-ago period.

“A nose-dive in Chinese stocks ... brought back unhappy memories of August, and as a result we saw heavy losses for miners once again,” said Chris Beauchamp, senior market analyst at IG, in a note. Miners are sensitive to developments in China as the country is a major importer of metals.

Anglo American PLC AAL, +1.45% tumbled 8.2% and BHP Billiton PLC BLT, +1.74% dropped 3.1%.

The sector has “been in retreat for almost the whole of 2015,” said Beauchamp “but fresh lows were seen today in the likes of Anglo American and BHP Billiton, as expectations of further cuts in demand and a hit to dividend payments caus[ing] more investors to abandon ship.”
