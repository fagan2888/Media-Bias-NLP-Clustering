He'd lean back slightly before darting forward and gracefully leap the bar as it climbed yet higher and higher.\n\nParents and coaches from every team started whispering about the kid all by himself.\n\n'Who's that guy? The bar looks taller than he is, and he's big. Jeez he's good.'\n\nEventually the bar reached heights even Freismuth couldn't conquer (6 feet, 6 inches), but only just barely. On three final attempts he'd get tired and clip the bar, missing out on a new personal record by just half an inch.\n\n\"I wanted that really bad, but at the end there I was just running out of gas,\" Freismuth said. \"I mean, jump after jump it kind of takes a toll on you. But I'm happy with 6-foot-5; 6-6 would've just been gravy on the top.\"\n\nFreismuth would win the boy's high jump at the Windsor Invitational by a wide margin with second place coming in at 5 feet, 11 inches. It was 10 of 20 points Freismuth would earn for the Indians on his own out of a third-place team-total 68.\n\nStanding there all by his lonesome, the center of attention, is something he's pretty used to these days and even welcomes. Committed to play football at Colorado State next year, Freismuth is near impossible to miss when doing anything at 6-foot-4, 203-pounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's good because all eyes are on me and that kind of helps me to be the center of attention on that, having the crowd behind me,\" he said in the sincerest fashion you can imagine.\n\nBut he wasn't done there. Freismuth would go on to win the 200-meter dash in 23.64, as well as run on the 400 and 800 relays (fourth and fifth).\n\n\"Not off to a bad start at all,\" he said.\n\nFreismuth wasn't the only winner for the Indians on Saturday.\n\nHeather Waite took first in the pole vault in 11 feet to score 10 more for Loveland. The girl's 400 relay team won with a time of 51.80 and the 4 x 800 in 10:37.04.\n\nAlex Koschel finished tied for second in the triple jump (33 feet, 6 inches), Taylor Buschy third in the 400 meter (1:00.69) and Karli Wilson also took third in the 200 (27.88). The Loveland girls took second behind Fort Collins, which won both boys and girls comfortably.\n\nConditions were far from ideal with gusts of wind a constant obstacle for every event. Berthoud coach Colby Schultz said that no team would be particularly happy with times, but that it was still a positive day to keep building in the early season.\n\n\"We're starting to figure out the pieces with our young kids and how to fit them in with the team and what we're doing,\" he said. \"It was great to see a couple seniors like Tacey Divittorio really step up and have a good day in opens and Nick Dietz in high jump. I think it's a day we can build on for sure.\"\n\nDivittorio placed fourth in the girl's 100 meter (12.91) and second in the 200 (27.73), while Dietz took third in high jump at 5 feet, 11 inches.\n\nResurrection Christian also got flashes against much bigger schools with Cole Watson winning the boy's 300 hurdles with a time of 42.73 and Sawyer Pehkonen second in the 800 (2:08.27).\n\nOverall, Rez coach Luke Appleton liked what he saw from the Cougars, who are already posting times they didn't reach until the end of last season, he said.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Sports Writer Cris Tiller at 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/rhpreps\n\nWindsor Invitational\n\nAt Windsor HS\n\nBOYS\n\nTeam scores \u2014 1.
