MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki tonight drew a comparison between the unfiltered stylings of Donald Trump and Florida Democrat Alan Grayson. Grayson, of course, does have a propensity for saying pretty out-there things, like back in 2009 when he infamously said that the Republicans’ health care plan is basically “don’t get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.”

Subbing in for Chris Matthews on Hardball tonight, Kornacki called Grayson a “loose cannon candidate” and brought up how Trump may be getting in the way of GOP attempts to “make inroads with Latino voters.” He connected that to Democrats trying to take back a Florida Senate seat, but they have someone running who “speaks the language of the base.”

And so, he wondered, how the Democrats can keep him from being the nominee without pissing off the base. Guardian reporter Sabrina Siddiqui said, “Republicans very much don’t want Donald Trump to become the face of their party, and national party Democrats… don’t want Alan Grayson to become the face of the Democratic party over there.”

And as they continued, they said things like he has “no filter” or he has a “tone” problem or his message “almost gets lost in the bombast,” things that could very easily be said about Trump as well.
