The NHL and its teams affiliated with the American Hockey League were shut down from Wednesday through Friday.\n\nPickard was enjoying the holidays in his hometown of Winnipeg, Canada, and traveled to Denver in the afternoon on Christmas Day. He is in his second stint with the Avalanche, having also played with the big club Nov. 11-22 when Semyon Varlamov was dealing with a groin injury.\n\nPickard played in two games, both in relief of Berra, and is 9-8-4 with the AHL\u2019s San Antonio Rampage. He was the AHL goalie of the month for October after beginning 5-0-1. The Rampage has since struggled.\n\nHead to head. The September trade swapping young defensemen Stefan Elliott and Brandon Gormley got a fair comparison Sunday. Elliott was drafted by Colorado in 2009 and traded to Arizona for Gormley, a 2010 Coyotes draft pick, just before training camp this season.\n\nGormley played in Avs\u2019 Nov. 5 game at Arizona, but Elliott was injured at the time.\n\nGormley was scratched in the four previous games but cracked the lineup Sunday because Nate Guenin sat out for precautionary reasons after suffering a head injury last week against the Maple Leafs.\n\nFootnotes. Colorado residents Brad Watson and Dave Jackson were the referees Sunday, and Front Range product John Grandt was one of the two linesmen. The NHL tries to limit travel for its on-ice officials over the holidays. \u2026 Colorado\u2019s lone healthy scratch was forward Chris Wagner. \u2026 The Avs departed for San Jose after Sunday\u2019s game.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs goalie Calvin Pickard\u2019s pick-up really pays off", "title": "Avs goalie Calvin Pickard\u2019s pick-up really pays off", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/27/avs-goalie-calvin-pickards-pick-up-really-pays-off/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227_083540_calvin-pickard.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151227_083540_calvin-pickard.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-27T20:36:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:01:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Gormley played in Avs\u2019 Nov. 5 game at Arizona, but Elliott was injured at the time.\nPickard played in two games, both in relief of Berra, and is 9-8-4 with the AHL\u2019s San Antonio Rampage.\nAvalanche goalie Calvin Pickard had some extra spending money for Christmas, thanks to Reto Berra\u2019s off-ice injury in Colorado\u2019s last game before the holiday break.\nPickard was enjoying the holidays in his hometown of Winnipeg, Canada, and traveled to Denver in the afternoon on Christmas Day.\nPickard said he was called up from the minors Christmas Day, but he was told to expect the promotion days earlier."}
