Teen Leadership Portage County (Photo: Screenshot)

EDITOR: I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Lauri Rockman, coordinator of Teen Leadership Portage County. I would also like to thank the facilitators Anton Anday, Mitch Fisher, Steve Hodgson, Judy Rannow, Ron Strege and Jeff Whitrock, for giving of their free time to volunteer for this wonderful program.

Through this program, teens are given the opportunity to be directly involved in their community. The teens work with mentors, members of our community who also volunteer their time, who show the teens the ins and outs of how many programs in our city work and provide them insights on how to be a good leader. My son Cale was fortunate to be a member of this great group, and was able to give his input at a city meeting via an invitation from Portage County Executive Patty Dreier herself. Also, with mentor Sheriff Mike Lucas, my son was able to truly grow in many ways.

Thank you again to all of you who give of your time and talents to help our teens grow in the spirit of giving, helping and personal growth. You have a direct hand in forming our leaders of tomorrow.

Elaine Jakusz,

Stevens Point
