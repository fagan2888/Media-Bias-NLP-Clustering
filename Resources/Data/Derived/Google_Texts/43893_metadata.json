The sex workers are also attracted to Clinton because of her support for government public health agencies like Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nWhen it comes to the economy, Dennis Hof\u2019s Bunnies stand behind Hillary\u2019s dismissal of trickle-down economics (though one can imagine they don\u2019t agree with Clinton when she says businesses and corporations don\u2019t create jobs).\n\nPerhaps the most colorful endorsement the prostitutes provide for Hillary is that which is anchored by her foreign policy experience.\n\nAs reads the website:\n\nAs secretary Of State, Hillary Clinton gained invaluable experience negotiating with foreign leaders, and the Bunnies can definitely relate to negotiating through a language barrier. The Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe, and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will. With her eye on the international landscape, the Bunnies are confident that President Hillary Clinton would also avoid a repeat of the Secret Service\u2019s Colombian prostitution scandal by making sure that her detail \u201cbuys American.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re betting Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t too turned on by this endorsement, while Bill is probably already looking into organizing a campaign event at the Bunny Ranch.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The prostitutes at Dennis Hof's famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Carson City, Nevada, have launched a campaign endorsing Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.", "title": "Prostitutes at Moonlite Bunny Ranch endorse Hillary Clinton for...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/04/Hookers-for-Hillary-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/04/20/prostitutes-moonlite-bunny-ranch-endorse-hillary-clinton-president/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "prostitutes-endorse-hillary-clinton", "published_time": "2015-04-20T14:46:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T14:50:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb554\"", "article_summary": "The prostitutes at Dennis Hof\u2019s famous Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Carson City, Nevada, have launched a campaign endorsing Hillary Clinton for president in 2016.\nThe workers at the Bunny Ranch are particularly enthusiastic about Hillary\u2019s positions on health care, foreign policy and the economy.\nThe Bunny Ranch entertains customers from all around the globe, and the girls have great respect for any woman who can take powerful men from oppressive cultures and make them bend to her will.\nAs reads the website:As secretary Of State, Hillary Clinton gained invaluable experience negotiating with foreign leaders, and the Bunnies can definitely relate to negotiating through a language barrier.\nPerhaps the most colorful endorsement the prostitutes provide for Hillary is that which is anchored by her foreign policy experience."}
