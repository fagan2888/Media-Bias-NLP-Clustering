Housing in four U.S. counties is so unaffordable that first-time homebuyers would have to spend more than 100 percent of their income to cover their mortgage payment each month.

Residents in Brooklyn (Kings County), New York, on average would need 120.4 percent of their monthly wages to cover a mortgage payment for a home there. That is the most unaffordable housing market in the country on an absolute measure, according to the first-quarter affordability study released by RealtyTrac.

The next most unaffordable markets are Marin County, California, near San Francisco, where residents would need to use 109.2 percent of their wages to purchase a home; Santa Cruz County, California, at 106.9 percent; and Manhattan, New York, at 105.1 percent. The top 20 most unaffordable counties are in three states: California, Hawaii and New York.

“It’s almost absurd,” says Daren Blomquist, senior vice president at RealtyTrac, “that you have to spend more than 100 percent of your income to buy a home.”

RealtyTrac considered a county’s average wages and calculated the mortgage monthly payment using the county’s median home price and the current mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan with a 3 percent down payment, a common amount for first-time homebuyers. The mortgage payment also included property taxes, home insurance and mortgage insurance.

In general, the maximum percentage of wages used to pay for a monthly mortgage payment is 28 percent to qualify for a conventional mortgage, says Pava Leyrer, chief operating officer of Northern Mortgage Services. Home loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of Agriculture are a bit more lenient at 29 percent, she says.

In the majority of counties analyzed -- 264 out of 457 counties -- homebuyers would have to use more than 28 percent of their wages to make monthly mortgage payments. Nationwide, the average for wages spent on mortgage payments is 30.2 percent, up from 26.4 percent a year ago.

Blomquist noted that homebuyers can make their monthly mortgage payments more affordable by contributing larger down payments to their home purchases.

Nine percent of U.S. markets are unaffordable in historic terms in the first quarter, compared with only 2 percent the same time a year ago.

“We’re way below the bubble in terms of markets that were unaffordable. During the bubble, 99 percent were unaffordable,” says Blomquist. “But if home price growth continues to outpace wage growth, then maybe we’re going down that path again.”
