Eighty-one percent of the poll\u2019s respondents said it\u2019s important to improve the health of Kentuckians.\n\nHealth care has been a key issue in the governor\u2019s race, with the candidates focused on the state\u2019s implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act. Kentucky was one of a dozen states to fully establish its own health care exchange \u2014 called Kynect \u2014 and it also expanded Medicaid.\n\nThe implementation of those programs under Gov. Steve Beshear\u2019s administration have drawn praise from ACA supporters, but criticism from the legislation\u2019s opponents \u2014 particularly over the cost of the Medicaid expansion. More than 500,000 Kentuckians have signed up for health insurance through the ACA.\n\nBut Kentuckians have been divided over the law. In January, a Kentucky Health Issues Poll found that the ACA was viewed favorably by 39 percent of respondents and unfavorably by 41 percent. In the same poll, 51 percent of respondents said they didn\u2019t have enough information on how the ACA affected them personally.\n\nRepublican candidate Matt Bevin has said he would attempt to rollback the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act and replace Kentucky\u2019s health insurance exchange with the federal marketplace. He has said he would target low-income individuals\u2019 health by creating policies that grow the economy, jobs and incomes.\n\nDemocratic candidate Jack Conway would keep Kynect and Medicaid expansion. He said it\u2019s important to ensure that Kentuckians stay insured.\n\nIndependent candidate Drew Curtis opposes repealing Kynect, the state\u2019s health care exchange, at this time, according to his campaign website. Curtis has said he would rely on experts to complete an audit of Kynect\u2019s functionality to see what can be improved before ordering changes. He also supports a statewide smoking ban.\n\nThe Kentucky Health Issues Poll released this week found that health was topped as a priority for Kentuckians only by economy (91 percent), K-12 public education (90 percent) and jobs (89 percent).\n\nBut 88 percent of Democrats said that reducing the cost of health care was extremely or very important, compared to 78 percent of Republicans. And 91 percent of Democrats said improving the health of Kentucky residents was extremely or very important, compared to 71 percent of Republican.\n\nThe poll was released by the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky and Interact for Health, formerly the Health Foundation of Greater Cincinnati.\n\nKHIP was conducted between Sept. 17 and Oct. 7. Researchers from the Institute for Policy Research at the University of Cincinnati interviewed 1,608 adults throughout Kentucky by telephone.\n\nKentucky voters choose the next governor on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Released less than a week before Election Day, the poll found that 83 percent of Kentucky adults said it's important for policymakers to work to reduce the cost of health care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Released less than a week before Election Day, the poll found that 83 percent of Kentucky adults said it's important for policymakers to work to reduce the cost of health care.", "title": "Health Care Costs a Top Issue For Kentuckians, Poll Says", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14734800244_3433a20229_k-e1444851038691.jpg", "height": 701}, "updated_time": "2015-10-29T07:10:33-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/health-care-costs-top-issue-kentuckians-poll-says/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Released less than a week before Election Day, the poll found that 83 percent of Kentucky adults said it's important for policymakers to work to reduce the cost of health care.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14734800244_3433a20229_k-e1444851038691.jpg", "title": "Health Care Costs a Top Issue For Kentuckians, Poll Says", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-10-28T13:22:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-29T07:10:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "A large majority of Kentuckians want state leaders to make the reduction of health care costs a top priority, according to a Kentucky Health Issues Poll released this week.\nIndependent candidate Drew Curtis opposes repealing Kynect, the state\u2019s health care exchange, at this time, according to his campaign website.\nHealth care has been a key issue in the governor\u2019s race, with the candidates focused on the state\u2019s implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act.\nThe Kentucky Health Issues Poll released this week found that health was topped as a priority for Kentuckians only by economy (91 percent), K-12 public education (90 percent) and jobs (89 percent).\nKentucky was one of a dozen states to fully establish its own health care exchange \u2014 called Kynect \u2014 and it also expanded Medicaid."}
