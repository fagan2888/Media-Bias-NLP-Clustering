The costs included emergency responses and disaster assistance, as well as the amount the federal government spends to subsidize federal flood insurance, crop insurance and related health care.\n\nRelated: How Climate Change Costs Could Soar to the Billions\n\nWeather models also demonstrate that climate-driven changes, such as higher sea levels and hurricane activity changes, may magnify this problem, the administration warned. Unabated climate change could diminish the global economy by more than four percent a year by 2100, the administration says \u2013 with potential losses in the U.S. of at least $120 billion a year.\n\nAlarmed by these trends, Obama is trying to bolster resources for his global warming initiatives by hiking funding for the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s efforts to slash industrial carbon emissions and beef up Energy Department spending to encourage the development of cleaner, alternative energy sources.\n\nHe\u2019s also backing a United Nations climate fund, promoting clean energy and energy-efficiency programs, and calling for tighter regulations of oil and gas drilling, even as the administration moved late last month to open up a vast stretch of East Coast waters to oil and gas drilling.\n\nThe president\u2019s new budget would boost EPA spending by six percent next year, from $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion, while raising spending for the Energy Department by 10 percent \u2013 from $27.3 billion to $29.6 billion.\n\nRelated: 5 Winners in President Obama\u2019s Budget Proposal\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done for the first time is very specifically quantify as much as possible what we have seen over a number of years [on climate change costs],\u201d White House budget director Shaun Donovan told the Senate Budget Committee Tuesday morning. \u201cThe basic analysis is that it is foolish for us not to act and take further steps to reduce climate change, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also to prepare our communities for the more extreme weather we\u2019re seeing.\u201d\n\nThe additional EPA funding would support efforts on tough federal standards, guidelines and voluntary programs, including $25 million to assist states to develop their own clean power plans. Obama would also offer $4 million to states that exceed the minimum requirements of the federal Clean Power Plan.\n\nThose initiatives might include, for example, efforts to address disproportionate impacts of pollution on residents of low-income communities, or support for businesses to expand efforts in energy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\nThe Obama proposal also includes additional spending on so-called \u201cClimate Resilience and Preparedness\u201d efforts, such as $184 million more for National Flood Insurance Program Risk Mapping, more spending for regional coastal planning, and greater preparedness for droughts and wildfires.\n\nRelated: GOP, Business Groups, Blast Obama\u2019s Budget\n\nInternationally, the president would provide $1.29 billion \u2013 a significant increase from this year\u2019s level \u2013 to advance the goals of the Global Climate Change Initiative by supporting multilateral and bilateral engagement with major and emerging economies.\n\nLast year, Obama struck important climate change agreements with China and India \u2013 which along with the U.S. emit the most greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. The State Department and White House are looking to a major global warming conference in Paris later this year as the likely setting of a new international agreement to reduce or slow the growth of carbon emissions.\n\n\u201cNo challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change,\u201d Obama said in his budget statement. \u201cThe significant costs to inaction on climate change hit the federal government\u2019s bottom-line directly, as worsening climate impacts create government liabilities.\u201d\n\nRelated: India\u2019s Resistance to Climate Change Gives Way to Deal\n\nThe proposals are encountering stiff opposition on Capitol Hill, where Republicans who now fully control Congress have long battled EPA regulations for reducing carbon emissions that they say will drive utilities out of business, seriously harm the coal industry, and dramatically raise the cost of fuel and electricity to consumers. Some industry groups also denounced the president\u2019s proposed tax increase for the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe budget proposes to increase royalty fees for fossil fuel projects on public lands to raise a projected $2.5 billion over the next 10 years. About $10 million of that would go to fund greater oversight and regulation of oil and gas sites on federal lands and in federal waters.\n\nThe budget plan would also wipe out an estimated $44 billion of energy industry tax breaks over the coming decade.\n\nRelated: GOP Leaders Fume over Obama\u2019s Climate Deal with China\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s annual call to raise taxes on U.S. oil and natural gas development would hurt job creation, infrastructure investment, the federal deficit, seniors on fixed incomes and domestic manufacturing,\u201d Jack Gerard, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement. \u201cTax increases would jeopardize America\u2019s competitiveness as it would discourage future investment.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental groups, not unexpectedly, hailed the president\u2019s new budget plans.\n\n\u201cThis budget clearly shows President Obama is making action on the climate crisis a top goal of his administration over the next year,\u201d said Michael Brune, Sierra Club executive director. \u201cThis proposal recognizes the obligation we have to act on climate and the opportunity that arises as we do.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama challenged congressional and industry critics on Monday to consider th", "title": "Obama\u2019s Budget Boosts EPA to Fight Climate Change", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/03/Obama-s-Budget-Boosts-EPA-Fight-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10292012_hurricane_sandy_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/03/Obama-s-Budget-Boosts-EPA-Fight-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10292012_hurricane_sandy_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama challenged congressional and industry critics on Monday to consider th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNo challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change,\u201d Obama said in his budget statement.\nRelated: How Climate Change Costs Could Soar to the BillionsWeather models also demonstrate that climate-driven changes, such as higher sea levels and hurricane activity changes, may magnify this problem, the administration warned.\nRelated: 5 Winners in President Obama\u2019s Budget Proposal\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done for the first time is very specifically quantify as much as possible what we have seen over a number of years [on climate change costs],\u201d White House budget director Shaun Donovan told the Senate Budget Committee Tuesday morning.\nLast year, Obama struck important climate change agreements with China and India \u2013 which along with the U.S. emit the most greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.\nPresident Obama challenged congressional and industry critics on Monday to consider the stunning costs of delaying measures to combat carbon emissions as he outlined his budget initiatives for handling climate change,."}
