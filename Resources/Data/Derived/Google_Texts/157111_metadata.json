LOUIS \u2014 Semyon Varlamov will start in goal Monday night as the Avalanche concludes its five-game road trip at the Scottrade Center, where they\u2019ll face the St. Louis Blues for their fifth and final regular-season matchup.\n\nThe Avs are 1-1-2 on the trip. Varlamov, who has played three of the previous four games, will oppose St. Louis goalie Brian Elliott, the one-time Avs palyer who leads the NHL with a 1.90 goals-against average.\n\n\u201cI thought we played really well in both games in Florida, against the Panthers and Lightning,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said Monday of his team\u2019s last two games. \u201cWe were solid and I believe we\u2019ve played three pretty good games out of four, and we\u2019re at .500 hockey. I\u2019d like to be ahead of that but the way we\u2019re playing, hopefully we\u2019ll (finish above).\n\n\u201cTo beat these guys, we\u2019ll have to be solid in all three zones. Offensively we\u2019ll have to go to the net, place the puck behind their D and get our forecheck going. The forecheck, in my opinion, will be the key.\u201d\n\nMatt Duchene will continue to center Alex Tanguay and Jarome Iginla, and Ryan O\u2019Reilly will center Gabe Landeskog and Nathan MacKinnon. The Avs\u2019 lone healthy scratch will be defenseman Zach Redmond, who has not played in the previous 10 games.\n\n\u201cTough little stretch here and this is a big game,\u201d Duchene said after the morning skate. \u201cWe all said before the road trip that when you go on a trip like this you want to be over .500, and we can do that (Monday night) with a win. It feels like we\u2019ve played these guys every other day lately. But we know what to expect, they know what to expect. They\u2019re a team we have a good rivalry with.\u201d\n\nColorado is 1-1-2 against the Blues, losing in a shootout, in overtime and regulation (3-0 on Dec. 29 at St. Louis). The last meeting was perhaps the Avs\u2019 worst game of the season; they posted just 16 shots on third-string goalie Martin Brodeur.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Semyon Varlamov to start in goal as Avalanche caps five-game trip", "title": "Semyon Varlamov to start in goal as Avalanche caps five-game trip", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/19/semyon-varlamov-to-start-in-goal-as-avalanche-caps-five-game-trip/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150119__varlamovp1.jpg", "height": 501}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150119__varlamovp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-19T12:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T04:38:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ST.
