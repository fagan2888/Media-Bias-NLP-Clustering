(She\u2019s white.) On Dec. 9, Fisher\u2019s case, which may set an important precedent on the constitutionality of race-based admissions, will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. But Fisher, now 25, won\u2019t be directly affected by the result when the justices rule next spring. As her claim progressed through the courts, she enrolled at Louisiana State University, earned her degree, and then moved to Austin, where UT is located, to take a job as a financial analyst. Her only direct stake in the outcome of the case is a request that UT refund her $50 application fee and a $50 housing deposit. The university says she has no right to a refund.\n\nWelcome to the world of ideologically driven Supreme Court litigation, where named plaintiffs often play bit roles in battles waged by legal advocacy groups pursuing policy changes. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody thinks Abigail Fisher\u2019s attorneys are litigating this case so that their client can get $100,\u201d says Richard Re, an assistant professor at the University of California at Los Angeles who specializes in constitutional law and the federal courts. \u201cThey\u2019re litigating this case because of the principle.\u201d\n\nFisher\u2019s suit was the brainchild of Edward Blum, a former stockbroker who now spends his days organizing lawsuits to fight racial preferences and classifications. Blum\u2019s one-man operation, the nonprofit Project on Fair Representation, is backed by conservative groups including the Milwaukee-based Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation and the Washington-based Searle Freedom Trust.\n\nBlum, a former Austin resident who now splits his time between Florida and Maine, spent more than two years trying to recruit a plaintiff for his UT challenge. He set up a website, spoke to student groups, and networked before finally landing on Fisher through her father, a UT alumnus. \u201cAbby continues with this case not in order to seek that monetary restitution, but rather because she is committed to ending for future applicants the unfair and unnecessary use of race at the University of Texas,\u201d Blum says. Fisher said in a video provided by Blum that \u201cit\u2019s really great to have a voice in this and to stand up for an issue that I believe in.\u201d She declined to be interviewed.\n\nBlum is behind similar lawsuits filed in 2014 on behalf of a group of unnamed applicants against Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Those cases, which are pending at the trial court level, have the potential to wipe out the use of race in admissions altogether.\n\nHe\u2019s also spearheading a Supreme Court case that could revolutionize application of the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d principle. The appeal, scheduled to be argued Dec. 8, contends that Texas\u2019 state senate map is unconstitutional because district lines were drawn to equalize the population in each one, rather than according to the number of eligible voters. A ruling in Blum\u2019s favor would usher in a major shift in the standards for determining equal representation. It would also likely give Republicans a boost by reducing representation for heavily immigrant\u2014and Latino\u2014urban areas of Arizona, California, and Texas. The impact, however, would be minimal for the two plaintiffs, Edward Pfenninger and Sue Evenwel, a Republican county chairwoman. Their individual votes would have slightly more chance of swaying the outcome in redrawn districts. Both are represented by Republicans.\n\nConservatives are hardly alone in pressing cases in which the named plaintiffs have only a tenuous interest in the outcome. Civil rights groups on the left, including the NAACP, have long used test cases to push their agendas. The high court is considering two cases this term where the issue is whether a plaintiff has enough of a stake\u2014or standing\u2014to press a consumer or class-action suit against a business. In one, the court is considering whether a defendant can end a suit that seeks class-action status by offering to pay the named plaintiff in full. The case centers on a man who says he received illegal text messages from a company hired to recruit for the Navy and has refused to accept a settlement offer of more than $1,500 per text. The second fight tests whether Congress can authorize consumers to seek damages even if they don\u2019t suffer any concrete injury. In that case, a man is trying to sue an online data broker over an Internet profile he says inaccurately listed him as married, middle-aged, and wealthy.\n\nThe question of standing threatened to derail a challenge to the Affordable Care Act heard in March. That case, funded by the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute, sought to gut the health insurance subsidies that underpin Obamacare. For plaintiffs, the group recruited four Virginia residents who claimed they would be better off without the tax credits because their incomes would fall below the law\u2019s threshold for requiring them to buy insurance policies. In the weeks leading up to the arguments, reports in the Wall Street Journal and Mother Jones questioned whether any of the four would have in fact been affected by the outcome of the case. The justices devoted 10 minutes of the 80-minute argument to exploring the question, though they ultimately sidestepped that issue and upheld the subsidies.\n\nThe issue of standing also hovers over the Fisher case. The university\u2019s attorney, Gregory Garre, argues that Fisher can\u2019t continue to challenge the admissions policy now that she\u2019s a college graduate. He says the application fees aren\u2019t enough to anchor her case because they aren\u2019t connected to the alleged wrongdoing; Fisher would have paid those even if she had been admitted. \u201cDamages in the amount of the application fees would not make the admissions any more \u2018equal,\u2019 \u201d Garre said in court filings.\n\nThe justices first reviewed Fisher\u2019s case in 2013 but sent it back to a lower court. That suggests that, at least then, a majority were satisfied that Fisher had an adequate stake. If that\u2019s still their opinion, the court might use the case to issue a ruling that broadly restricts affirmative action\u2014and Abigail Fisher might collect her $100.\n\nThe bottom line: Plaintiffs in ideologically driven test cases before the Supreme Court often have little at stake personally in the outcome.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Greg Stohr", "twitter": {"description": "Plaintiffs get their names associated with landmark decisions but often little else.", "title": "That Feeling When You Win a Supreme Court Case ... and Get Nothing", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/that-feeling-when-you-win-a-supreme-court-case-and-get-nothing", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4JjfbEf.hco/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Greg Stohr", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Louisiana State University System,Supreme Court,Politics &amp; Policy", "news_keywords": "Louisiana State University System,Supreme Court,Politics &amp; Policy", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/that-feeling-when-you-win-a-supreme-court-case-and-get-nothing", "parsely-title": "That Feeling When You Win a Supreme Court Case ... and Get Nothing", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-03T21:50:12.447Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Plaintiffs get their names associated with landmark decisions but often little else.", "parsely-tags": "Louisiana State University System,Supreme Court,Politics &amp; Policy,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-12-03T21:50:12.447Z", "parsely-section": "businessweek-magazine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Plaintiffs get their names associated with landmark decisions but often little else.", "title": "That Feeling When You Win a Supreme Court Case ... and Get Nothing", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-03/that-feeling-when-you-win-a-supreme-court-case-and-get-nothing", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4JjfbEf.hco/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Plaintiffs get their names associated with landmark decisions but often little else."}, "parsely-post-id": "NYSQHW6JTSED01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i4JjfbEf.hco/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019s also spearheading a Supreme Court case that could revolutionize application of the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d principle.\nOn Dec. 9, Fisher\u2019s case, which may set an important precedent on the constitutionality of race-based admissions, will be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe bottom line: Plaintiffs in ideologically driven test cases before the Supreme Court often have little at stake personally in the outcome.\nIf that\u2019s still their opinion, the court might use the case to issue a ruling that broadly restricts affirmative action\u2014and Abigail Fisher might collect her $100.\nThe justices first reviewed Fisher\u2019s case in 2013 but sent it back to a lower court."}
