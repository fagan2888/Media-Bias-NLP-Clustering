My boyfriend wants to get married, but I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll lose my Medicaid. What should I do?\u201d\n\nMaybe Wedding Belle\n\nDear Maybe Wedding Belle,\n\nIf you get married, your new spouse\u2019s income would get factored into your Medicaid application. Your new (presumably higher) income may be too high to allow you to stay on Medicaid. The specific income limits depend upon what state you live in.\n\nThe \u201cMedicaid expansion\u201d is available in some states, and makes people (or families) with incomes up to 138% of Federal Poverty eligible. Look for your state on the Kaiser Family Foundation list.\n\nIf your new spouse has an employer-based health plan offered to him/her, then you should look at how much it would cost to cover you and the children on that plan. Health reform does not set guidelines for \u201caffordability\u201d on employer\u2019s plans for family coverage. As long as the plan costs less than 9.5% of his income to cover just himself, then it is considered affordable. It may cost a great deal more than 9.5% to cover you and the children.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Health Unsurance", "description": "\u201cI have three children and am on Medicaid.\u00a0 My boyfriend wants to get married, but I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll lose my Medicaid.\u00a0 What should I do?\u201d Maybe Wedding Belle Dear Maybe Wedding Belle, If you ge...", "title": "Medicaid and marriage -- what might change", "url": "http://healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/2013/12/04/children/medicaid-and-marriage-what-might-change/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/files/2013/10/LR_photo_2013-75x75.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@bdnmaineblogs", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"admins": 5800548, "app_id": 169032116512887}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "36.1095"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-04T14:56:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-04T14:56:54+00:00", "author": "http://healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/author/lridd2011/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfee2\"", "article_summary": "What should I do?\u201dMaybe Wedding BelleDear Maybe Wedding Belle,If you get married, your new spouse\u2019s income would get factored into your Medicaid application.\nMy boyfriend wants to get married, but I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll lose my Medicaid.\nYour new (presumably higher) income may be too high to allow you to stay on Medicaid.\nThe \u201cMedicaid expansion\u201d is available in some states, and makes people (or families) with incomes up to 138% of Federal Poverty eligible.\nAs long as the plan costs less than 9.5% of his income to cover just himself, then it is considered affordable."}
