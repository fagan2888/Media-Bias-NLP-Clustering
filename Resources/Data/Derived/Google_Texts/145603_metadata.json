(Photo: Selina's Bridal Boutique/Special to the Register)\n\nBack Alley Bargains, 220 Fifth St., Valley Junction in West Des Moines, will close on Aug. 31 and Selina's Bridal Boutique will move into the space Sept. 2.\n\nSelina's , which is now a couple doors north at 228 Fifth St., will expand its special occasion dresses to include a greater selection of prom, homecoming and charity gala type dresses, along with bridal gowns and accessories.\n\nOwner Selina Orman said the space is about the same size as her current location - a former bank - but she will have larger display windows for her gowns. She is holding a moving sale with bridal gowns starting at $79.99 and bridesmaid dresses at $19.99.\n\nBack Alley Bargains is a discount furniture store owned by Kirk Sloan and run by his mother, Darlene Sloan. The shop offers closeouts and one-of-a-kind items, Darlene Sloan said. Right now all merchandise is discounted 50 percent and may be reduced again as the store winds down, she said.\n\nThe Sloans are closing the shop because of lagging sales, which Darlene Sloan attributed in part to a struggling economy. Merchandise remaining for sale includes a love seat, reclining chairs, lounge chairs, picnic tables, outdoor benches, cabinets, television stand and coffee table.\n\nBack Alley Bargains is open noon to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, and noon to 8 p.m. Thursday. The shop is closed Sunday and Monday. Call 515-277-6035.\n\nSelina's is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.
