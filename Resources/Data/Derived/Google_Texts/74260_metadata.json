For all 38 states that self-reported data on the topic, black women have an infant morality rate that's at least 20 percent higher than it is for women overall, according to the report. In seven states, black women post an infant mortality rate double what women overall experience. Diabetes in particular is a problem that has a disproportionate impact on Latinas and Asian women, and Native American women experience higher rates of asthma than women overall do.\n\nInequities extend to access to care and healthcare coverage. In more than half of U.S. states, black women are uninsured at rates that are at least 10 percent higher than the uninsured rate for women overall, according to the report. In one-third of U.S. states black women are uninsured at rates 20 percent higher than women overall. In 17 states, Latinas are uninsured at rates double the rate uninsured rate of women overall.\n\nThese problems stem from 21 states' refusal to accept federal funding to expand Medicaid coverage for low-income residents, concludes the Alliance for Justice Society, whose executive director LeeAnn Hall serves on the board of Colorlines' publisher Race Forward. Those states that refused Medicaid expansion performed especially poorly in AJS' report card. Boosting Medicaid expansion tops the organization's policy recommendations.\n\n\"While many states are making critical progress on women's health thanks to the Affordable Care Act, this report card underscores that we must do more, starting with getting every state to cover low-income women through Medicaid,\" Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) said in a statement, echoing the report card's findings.\n\nFor more, read the Alliance for a Just Society report card here.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "How does your state fare?", "description": "How does your state fare?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "admin", "og": {"site_name": "Colorlines", "description": "How does your state fare?", "title": "Despite Obamacare Advances, Racial Health Disparities for Women of Color Abound", "url": "https://www.colorlines.com/articles/despite-obamacare-advances-racial-health-disparities-women-color-abound", "image": "https://www.colorlines.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_lead_normal/public/images/articles/2014/10/stethoscope.jpg?itok=0wlXCHjk", "updated_time": "2015-04-18T15:46:42-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "How does your state fare?", "creator": "@colorlines", "url": "https://www.colorlines.com/articles/despite-obamacare-advances-racial-health-disparities-women-color-abound", "image": "https://www.colorlines.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_lead_normal/public/images/articles/2014/10/stethoscope.jpg?itok=0wlXCHjk", "title": "Despite Obamacare Advances, Racial Health Disparities for Women of Color Abound", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dcterms.identifier": "https://www.colorlines.com/articles/despite-obamacare-advances-racial-health-disparities-women-color-abound", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-16T16:25-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/colorlines", "tag": "women of color", "published_time": "2014-10-16T16:25:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-18T15:46:42-04:00"}, "news_keywords": "health, health care, health disparities, women of color", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dcterms.title": "Despite Obamacare Advances, Racial Health Disparities for Women of Color Abound"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82de\"", "article_summary": "Black women have worse health outcomes than women overall in unique areas, like hypertension and infant mortality.\nIn 17 states, Latinas are uninsured at rates double the rate uninsured rate of women overall.\nDiabetes in particular is a problem that has a disproportionate impact on Latinas and Asian women, and Native American women experience higher rates of asthma than women overall do.\nIn seven states, black women post an infant mortality rate double what women overall experience.\nIn one-third of U.S. states black women are uninsured at rates 20 percent higher than women overall."}
