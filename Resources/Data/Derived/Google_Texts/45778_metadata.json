It is now held by Republican Morgan Griffith of Salem, who won election to Congress in 2010.\n\nKitts, 46, said Monday that he thinks that his military background, which includes earning two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart, sets him apart from other Democratic hopefuls. He said that he is exploring fundraising possibilities and plans a formal announcement of his candidacy soon.\n\n\u201cI feel a gap,\u201d Kitts said of Griffith\u2019s representation of the sprawling 9th District, which covers all of Virginia south and west from Salem.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between being a politician and being a leader. \u2026 A leader is needed out here, not another politician,\u201d Kitts said.\n\nKitts is joining about a half dozen Democrats who have expressed interest in taking on Griffith, Democratic district committee Vice Chairwoman Aviva Frye said Tuesday. The field includes Roanoke Mayor David Bowers and farmer and retired postal worker Bill Bunch of Tazewell County.\n\nDemocrats are still setting their schedule for choosing a candidate, Frye said. Local delegates will be picked on the weekend of April 16, she said. The delegates then will select a nominee at a district convention in May, Frye said.\n\nContacted Tuesday, Griffith said that while the district\u2019s Democrats had not yet chosen his opponent, the party\u2019s national priorities suggested the candidate would be \u201cnot in step with the people of Southwest Virginia.\u201d\n\nKitts is a Roanoke native whose father runs a fasteners manufacturing company in Lynchburg. Kitts is married with two daughters \u2014 one now deployed with the 82nd Airborne, he said, and the other a freshman at Christiansburg High School. In November, he retired from an Army career that took him to Germany and Saudi Arabia, as well as to war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in public safety along the way, stacking up credits at different institutions, then finishing with two years at Bluefield College.\n\nIn a book about the surge campaign in Iraq, Lt. Col. Michael Silverman\u2019s \u201cAwakening Victory,\u201d Kitts is described as one of the unit\u2019s brightest platoon sergeants, and also \u201cthe biggest smartass in the battalion.\u201d\n\nA first sergeant when he retired, Kitts said that his time in the military taught him about taking care of people and about the consequences of actions.\n\nAs an example, he cited a 2005 incident that he later wrote about in the Army Times. Patrolling near a checkpoint, Kitts\u2019 squad was approached by a car that looked like one they had been warned could carry a bomb. When the car sped toward them, squad members opened fire. They wounded the driver, who turned out to be an Iraqi Army solider, an ally, who said that he hadn\u2019t seen their signal to stop. A bullet also went past the car and hit a 5-year-old girl down the street.\n\nKitts said the girl was rushed to a U.S. hospital and saved. He wrote that he ended up in the same medical facility with her after spraining his ankle, and talked to her as she recovered.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kitts said that though the child\u2019s shooting was accidental and he hadn\u2019t fired the shot, he had commanded the unit.\n\n\u201cYou can delegate authority but you can never delegate responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nKitts was wounded himself \u2014 in a separate incident \u2014 when a bomb blew up beneath his vehicle, he said. His Purple Heart medal now hangs on a wall at home on a plaque with a piece of the armor plating from the vehicle\u2019s floor, he said.\n\nIf elected, Kitts said he would support the Affordable Care Act but would consider changes to improve it. He said that he would oppose banning immigrants of certain religions or from certain countries because doing so seems to fly in the face of the principles on which America was founded.\n\nAs an avid target shooter and the owner of \u201cmore than one and less than 100\u201d firearms, Kitts said he strongly supports gun ownership. But he said he believes background checks should precede all sales and that people should receive more firearms safety training.\n\nKitts said he agreed with Republicans\u2019 call for more mental health care as a partial solution to gun violence, \u201cbut that comes under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nOverall, \u201cI\u2019m moderate. I\u2019d honestly call myself a Blue Dog,\u201d he said, referring to the name for a group of fiscally conservative Democrats.\n\nHe sounded eager to start campaigning against Griffith.\n\n\u201cWhen I really believe in something, I\u2019m a bull in a china shop. I\u2019m a hammer,\u201d Kitts said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always believed in taking care of people first.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "CHRISTIANSBURG \u2014 A decorated combat veteran hopes to represent the \u201cFighting 9th.\u201d", "title": "Purple Heart recipient enters 9th District race", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/purple-heart-recipient-enters-th-district-race/article_5b91980e-4f9b-5bfd-ae37-985c46055d8a.html", "image": {"width": 421, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/c8/8c85dda0-ad32-51d8-896f-dea776f3660c/57410c5045178.image.jpg?resize=421%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "CHRISTIANSBURG \u2014 A decorated combat veteran hopes to represent the \u201cFighting 9th.\u201d", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "9th district,politics,christiansburg,montgomery_county", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "9th district,politics,christiansburg,montgomery_county"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always believed in taking care of people first.\u201d\n\u201cI feel a gap,\u201d Kitts said of Griffith\u2019s representation of the sprawling 9th District, which covers all of Virginia south and west from Salem.\nKitts is joining about a half dozen Democrats who have expressed interest in taking on Griffith, Democratic district committee Vice Chairwoman Aviva Frye said Tuesday.\nKitts, 46, said Monday that he thinks that his military background, which includes earning two Bronze Stars and a Purple Heart, sets him apart from other Democratic hopefuls.\nThe delegates then will select a nominee at a district convention in May, Frye said."}
