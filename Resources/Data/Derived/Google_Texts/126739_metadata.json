Demonstrators who have called for an uprising against the Israeli occupation have decried the lack of justice and had bitterly predicted that 16-year-old Mohammad Abu Khieder\u2019s killers would never face trial.\n\nBy arresting the suspects, who were said by security officials to have killed Khieder for \u201cnationalistic\u201d reasons, the Israeli government must confront extremist elements within its society.\n\nSome Israeli officials had speculated that the slaying was the result of a family dispute amid disbelief that it could be revenge for the deaths of the three Israelis.\n\n\u201cThis a shock for most Israeli Jews, and I think it\u2019s a kind of wake-up call,\u201d said Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni on Sunday evening. \u201cThis is something that will change the way people think, and it will lead to a better understanding that we need to act when we see even the smallest signs of incitement.\u201d\n\nVisiting the home of one of the Israeli teens slain last month after being abducted in the West Bank, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Khieder\u2019s killers would \u201cface the full weight of the law.\u201d\n\nHe also called on the Palestinian Authority, which controls some areas of the West Bank, to go after the killers of the Israelis \u2014 16-year-old Naftali Fraenkel, 16-year-old Gilad Shaar and 19-year-old Eyal Yifrach. Israel blames the killings on the Palestinian militant group Hamas, and the assailants are thought to remain at large.\n\n\u201cI know that in our society, the society of Israel, there is no place for such murderers,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the difference between us and our neighbors. They consider murderers to be heroes.\u201d\n\nPalestinians counter that Israelis attack Arabs with impunity and that Israeli authorities do not do nearly enough to combat hate crimes or rein in security forces.\n\nHussein Abu Khieder, Mohammad\u2019s father, said Sunday that he thought Israel had acted against his son\u2019s alleged killers only because of international pressure.\n\nRegardless of the reason, he said, he welcomed the arrests and expressed hope that they represent a broader change in Israeli attitudes toward crimes against Palestinians. \u201cIt is not like it used to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t get away with it anymore.\u201d\n\nAuthorities did not release the names of those arrested Sunday, citing a legal order that bars them from commenting publicly on certain details of the investigation.\n\nKhieder was abducted as he waited outside a mosque for dawn prayers. By the time his body was found later that morning, 90 percent of it was covered in burns.\n\nEran Schwartz, a spokesman for the legal aid organization Honenu, said the six suspects ranged in age from 16 to 25 and came from Jerusalem neighborhoods as well as West Bank settlements.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Six Jewish suspects arrested in slaying of Palestinian teenager", "title": "Six Jewish suspects arrested in slaying of Palestinian teenager", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/06/six-jewish-suspects-arrested-in-slaying-of-palestinian-teenager/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__20140707_A1_ND07MIDEASTp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140706__20140707_A1_ND07MIDEASTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-06T13:44:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:09:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel reckoned with rising homegrown extremism Sunday as it arrested six Jewish suspects who are thought to have burned to death an Arab teenager in revenge for the killing of three Israeli teens.\nHussein Abu Khieder, Mohammad\u2019s father, said Sunday that he thought Israel had acted against his son\u2019s alleged killers only because of international pressure.\nIsrael blames the killings on the Palestinian militant group Hamas, and the assailants are thought to remain at large.\nEran Schwartz, a spokesman for the legal aid organization Honenu, said the six suspects ranged in age from 16 to 25 and came from Jerusalem neighborhoods as well as West Bank settlements.\nBy arresting the suspects, who were said by security officials to have killed Khieder for \u201cnationalistic\u201d reasons, the Israeli government must confront extremist elements within its society."}
