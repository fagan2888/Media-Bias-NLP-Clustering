That divide and anger and anxiety is not going to produce what we need,\" he said.\n\nSchultz added that the U.S. needs \"a vision of optimism, a vision of unity and inclusion.\"\n\nHe has publicly identified himself as a Democrat, but Schultz has not endorsed any presidential candidate. He has decried the divisiveness that has defined this election cycle.\n\n\"Perhaps we are no longer living in a time where we can look up and see the leaders that we once had,\" Schultz said.\n\nHe added that he hasn't sat down with any of the presidential hopefuls to convey that message.\n\nSchultz also hasn't donated money to a candidate in years, after announcing in 2011 that he refused to do so until lawmakers end partisan gridlock in Washington. Several other CEOs joined him in making that pledge.\n\nRelated: Cisco's Republican CEO will back Hillary Clinton or John Kasich\n\nStarbucks has stores in 70 countries. And Schultz said foreigners are \"flabbergasted by what they're seeing and reading\" about America.\n\n\"I can tell you, without exaggeration and with no exception, almost every conversation that I've been in with Starbucks partners, government officials, and our customers -- all of those conversations have posed the question, 'What is going on in your country?'\"\n\nHe also hit back at critics who say he uses Starbucks as a political tool, insisting that the company's initiatives are not a marketing ploy.\n\n\"This is no vanity play,\" Schultz said. \"This is about the role and responsibility of our company...we need to do everything we can to reject bigotry and hate and fear and embrace optimism.\"\n\nHe added that he thinks the country is in \"dire need of both an economic and moral transformation,\" and that the country urgently needs to address a widening wealth gap.\n\nSchultz has tried to set that kind of example. He pointed out that all Starbucks (SBUX) workers that put in 20 or more hours per week get healthcare, even though the Affordable Care Act only mandates coverage for workers who work 30 hours.\n\nRelated: Starbucks CEO - We must reclaim the American Dream\n\n\"We were pressured [by shareholders] to change that number from 20 to 30 because we would have saved tens of millions of dollars,\" he said.\n\nThe company consistently spends more on workers' health care than it does on coffee beans, Schultz said.\n\nBut he insists that offering benefits and wages over the legal minimum is directly linked to a company's financial performance.\n\nThe company has boomed under his leadership -- shares are up 240% over the past five years.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "starbucks, howard schultz, coffee, ceo, economic inequality, donald trump, hillary clinton, moderate, politics, presidential race, campaign", "title": "Starbucks CEO: Voters are embracing 'fool's gold'", "og": {"site_name": "CNNMoney", "description": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told CNN's Poppy Harlow that American politics are in a 'tragic situation.'", "title": "Starbucks CEO: Voters are embracing 'fool's gold'", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/23/news/starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-presidential-race/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160323112003-starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-election-780x439.png", "type": "article"}, "section": "news", "author": "Jackie Wattles", "vr": {"category": "news", "type": "Article"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-23T01:07:04", "keywords": "starbucks, howard schultz, coffee, ceo, economic inequality, donald trump, hillary clinton, moderate, politics, presidential race, campaign", "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "date": "2016-03-23 01:07:04", "twitter": {"description": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told CNN's Poppy Harlow that American politics are in a 'tragic situation.'", "title": "Starbucks CEO: Voters are embracing 'fool's gold'", "url": "http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/23/news/starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-presidential-race/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160323112003-starbucks-ceo-howard-schultz-election-540x304.png", "site": "@CNNMoney", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=1140", "description": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz told CNN's Poppy Harlow that American politics are in a 'tragic situation.'"}, "article_summary": "Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says America's voters are embracing \"fool's gold.\"\n\"I look at the primaries, and I think many people are embracing what I would loosely describe as fool's gold.\nRelated: Starbucks CEO - We must reclaim the American Dream\"We were pressured [by shareholders] to change that number from 20 to 30 because we would have saved tens of millions of dollars,\" he said.\nSchultz added that the U.S. needs \"a vision of optimism, a vision of unity and inclusion.\"\nHe also hit back at critics who say he uses Starbucks as a political tool, insisting that the company's initiatives are not a marketing ploy."}
