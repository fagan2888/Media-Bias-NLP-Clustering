A 26-year-old snowboarder was found dead in a stand of trees at Keystone Resort on Saturday morning, authorities in Summit County said.

Eric Haiar, of Silverthorne, was found along the intermediate trail Spring Dipper, according to Summit County Coroner Tim Keeling.

The coroner said Haiar “lost control … and collided with a tree.” Keeling said Haiar, who was wearing a helmet, died from “blunt force trauma injuries.”

The coroner said Haiar was originally from Texas.

“Keystone Ski Patrol responded to the scene immediately, and the victim was transported to Keystone Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead,” the resort said in a statement.
