NEW YORK (MainStreet) — How'd you like to sell your home in three days with just a few mouse clicks? No real estate agents, no repairs — heck, you might not even have to sweep the floor.

If San Francisco start-up OpenDoor.com has its way, that'll be the future of real estate.

"A house is the largest asset that many people have, but selling it is a stressful, painful process that's been largely untouched by technology. We think we can change that," says Eric Wu of OpenDoor, which aims to buy homes practically sight unseen.

OpenDoor, which began operations recently in its first market (Phoenix, Ariz.), allows sellers to enter some basic information over the Web, then runs some quick analytics on a property and comes back with a purchase offer — usually within minutes.

If you accept, the company can close the sale in as little as three days, although OpenDoor might do an on-site inspection to verify the home's condition. (It also studies any online photos it can find from Google Street View or other sources.)

Wu, who serves as OpenDoor's CEO, says the firm generally offers "a few percentage points" below fair-market value, while sellers also pay a 5.5% "convenience charge" and much of the closing costs.

But in exchange, OpenDoor will buy the property quickly and handle needed repairs, then put the place back on the market, cover the carrying costs until a buyer emerges and pay any real estate commissions on the resale. It's sort of like selling your car to a dealer rather than unloading it yourself.
