Efforts in Congress to clarify the EPA\u2019s powers have been defeated. And two Supreme Court decisions have done little to decide the question.\n\nMost recently, in April, the EPA itself declared what waters were subject to its oversight \u2014 developing a joint rule with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that sought to end the debate and empower the EPA to press hundreds of enforcements actions against alleged polluters across the country.\n\nThe new rule, for instance, explicitly defines several terms \u2014 tributary, floodplain and wetland \u2014 and makes clear that those waters are subject to its authority.\n\nBut the EPA\u2019s effort has been met with immense opposition from farmers who say the agency is overreaching. An expansive online campaign organized and financed by the American Farm Bureau Federation has asserted that the new rule will give the EPA jurisdiction over farmers\u2019 irrigation ditches, watering ponds and even puddles of rain.\n\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation\u2019s president, Bob Stallman, said the proposed rule was the \u201cthe biggest federal land grab \u2014 in terms of power over land use \u2014 that we\u2019ve seen to date.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to address the concerns of farmers, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy in recent weeks has been touring states in the Midwest.\n\n\u201cThere are issues we need to discuss and clarify to get this rule right,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have important work to do. All the silly contentions being brought up \u2014 that we intend to regulate dry ground or stock ponds or mud puddles after a rain \u2014 all that does is get in the way of our being able to have those serious discussions.\u201d\n\nThe Clean Water Act of 1972 authorized the EPA to protect the \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d from dangerous and or illegal pollution. But that term has been the subject of controversy and dispute virtually from the time the act was signed into law. Regulators and industry representatives are generally in agreement that the law applies to some of the nation\u2019s larger rivers. At issue, however, are the streams that flow intermittently and the wetlands adjacent to these streams that dry up during the summer.\n\nLegal fights over those streams and wetlands, current and former EPA officials say, have cost the agency time, money and effectiveness in the face of real environmental threats. Indeed, in recent years the EPA has allowed hundreds of cases of water pollution to go unpunished because it currently lacks the confidence that it can prevail in court.\n\nGranta Nakayama, who served as the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at the EPA until 2009, found that between July 2006 and March 2008 the agency had decided not to pursue formal enforcement in 304 cases because of jurisdictional uncertainty.\n\nIn 2008, in an internal memo, Nakayama wrote that the uncertainty \u201cresults in delays in enforcement and increases the resources needed to bring enforcement cases.\u201d\n\nAnd so in 2007, when an oil company discharged thousands of gallons of crude oil into Edwards Creek in Titus County, Texas, the EPA did not issue a fine, pursue legal action or even require clean up. Similarly, after a farming operation dumped manure into tributaries that fed Lake Blackshear in Georgia, the EPA did not seek to hold the polluting company responsible \u2014 despite the fact that tests showed unsafe levels of bacteria and viruses in the lake, which was regularly used for waterskiing and other recreation.\n\n\u201cThe proposed rule will improve the process for making jurisdictional determinations for the Clean Water Act by minimizing delays and costs, and will improve the predictability and consistency of the permit and enforcement process for landowners,\u201d an EPA spokesperson said.\n\nThe EPA expects that improving efficiency in jurisdictional determinations will also save the businesses that they regulate time and money.\n\n\u201cProtecting water is important to the long-term health of the economy,\u201d the EPA spokesperson said. \u201cStreams and wetlands are economic drivers because of their role in fishing, hunting, agriculture, recreation, energy, and manufacturing.\u201d\n\nTwo Supreme Court decisions in the last 15 years have been the cause of much of the uncertainty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forty-two years after the passage of the Clean Water Act, debate abounds about the legislation's application", "title": "Underwater: Why the EPA is struggling to combat pollution", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Forty-two years after the passage of the Clean Water Act, debate abounds about the legislation's application", "title": "Underwater: Why the EPA is struggling to combat pollution", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/27/under_water_why_the_epa_is_struggling_to_combat_pollution_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_131534318.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Forty-two years after the passage of the Clean Water Act, debate abounds about the legislation's application", "title": "Underwater: Why the EPA is struggling to combat pollution", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_131534318.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Naveena Sadasivam", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Pollution, ProPublica", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Indeed, in recent years the EPA has allowed hundreds of cases of water pollution to go unpunished because it currently lacks the confidence that it can prevail in court.\nTopics: Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Pollution, ProPublica, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on ProPublicaFor years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been frustrated in its efforts to pursue hundreds of cases of water pollution \u2014 repeatedly tied up in legal fights about exactly what bodies of water it has the authority to monitor and protect.\nThe EPA expects that improving efficiency in jurisdictional determinations will also save the businesses that they regulate time and money.\n\u201cProtecting water is important to the long-term health of the economy,\u201d the EPA spokesperson said.\nLegal fights over those streams and wetlands, current and former EPA officials say, have cost the agency time, money and effectiveness in the face of real environmental threats."}
