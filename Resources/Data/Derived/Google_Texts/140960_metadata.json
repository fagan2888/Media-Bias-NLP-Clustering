Her death was reported in February.\n\nHer mother, Marsha Mueller, added, \u201cKayla did not marry this man. He took her to his room and he abused her and she came back crying.\u201d\n\nThe news is but the latest in a litany of horrors perpetrated by the Islamic State group, which has beheaded, burned and crucified male captives while passing around women as sex slaves.\n\nMueller was held for a time by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife, known as Umm Sayyaf. Al-Baghdadi took Mueller as a \u201cwife,\u201d repeatedly raping her when he visited, according to a Yazidi teenager who was held with Mueller and escaped in October 2014.\n\nThe 14-year-old made her way to Iraqi Kurdistan, where she talked to U.S. commandos in November 2014. Intelligence agencies corroborated her account and American officials passed it on to her parents in June.\n\nUmm Sayyaf confirmed that al-Baghdadi had \u201cowned\u201d Kayla during Umm Sayyaf\u2019s lengthy American interrogation in Iraq, the Muellers said they were told by American officials.\n\nA U.S. official confirmed their account, first reported by London\u2019s Independent newspaper. The official was not authorized to be quoted by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nAbu Sayyaf was killed in a Delta Force raid of his Syrian compound in June, which resulted in a treasure trove of intelligence about the Islamic State group.\n\nUmm Sayyaf has been turned over to the Iraqi Kurds for trial. The Muellers have been told that justice will be served in her case, said a family spokeswoman, Emily Lenzner.\n\nMueller was held with three other women, all Yazidis, the Muellers were told. All were sexually abused. When al-Baghdadi visited, he would take Mueller to his room, the witness told American officials. She would tell her fellow captives \u2014 sometimes tearfully \u2014 what had happened.\n\n\u201cKayla tried to protect these young girls,\u201d her mother said. \u201cShe was like a mother figure to them.\u201d\n\nWhen the teenage Yazidi girl escaped with her sister, she asked Mueller to accompany her, the parents were told, but Kayla refused, worrying that her obvious Western appearance would lead to their capture.\n\nBy the time the Yadizi escapee reported the situation to Delta Force commandos in Iraq, Kayla had been moved, her parents were told.\n\nU.S. intelligence officials found information on Sayyaf\u2019s computer indicating that Mueller, who spoke some Arabic, had been searching for information about fertility to help Umm Sayyaf, who was trying to get pregnant, according to two U.S. officials who refused to be quoted because the information is classified.\n\nMueller, from Prescott, Arizona, was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Omar Alkhani, in August 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria, where he had been hired to fix the Internet service for the hospital.\n\nMueller had begged him to let her tag along because she wanted to do relief work in the war-ravaged country.\n\nAlkhani was released after two months, having been beaten.\n\nThe Islamic State group claimed Mueller was killed in a Jordanian air strike near Raqqah, the group\u2019s self-declared capital in Syria. U.S. officials confirmed the death but not the circumstances.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American hostage Kayla Mueller was repeatedly raped by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, U.S. intelligence officials told her family in June.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "American hostage Kayla Mueller was repeatedly raped by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, U.S. intelligence officials told her family in June.", "title": "Kayla Mueller raped repeatedly by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/15/kayla-mueller-raped-repeatedly-islamic-state-leade/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/14/dd055f58630c1b247f0f6a7067006ae2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/14/dd055f58630c1b247f0f6a7067006ae2.jpg", "description": "American hostage Kayla Mueller was repeatedly raped by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, U.S. intelligence officials told her family in June.", "card": "summary", "title": "Kayla Mueller raped repeatedly by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Bag"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Kayla Mueller, Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi, Umm Sayyaf, US Intelligence, Carl Mueller"}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 American hostage Kayla Mueller was repeatedly raped by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group, U.S. intelligence officials told her family in June.\nMueller was held for a time by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife, known as Umm Sayyaf.\nThe Islamic State group claimed Mueller was killed in a Jordanian air strike near Raqqah, the group\u2019s self-declared capital in Syria.\nWhen al-Baghdadi visited, he would take Mueller to his room, the witness told American officials.\nAl-Baghdadi took Mueller as a \u201cwife,\u201d repeatedly raping her when he visited, according to a Yazidi teenager who was held with Mueller and escaped in October 2014."}
