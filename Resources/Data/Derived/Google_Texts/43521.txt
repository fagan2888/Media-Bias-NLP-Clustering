Flu shots that are packaged in multidose vials have preservatives, including thimerosal, which prevents the growth of bacteria. Thimerosal contains ethylmercury, which the CDC says is cleared from the body faster than another form, methylmercury, found in certain kinds of fish. Therefore ethylmercury is less likely to cause any harm, the agency says. The CDC also says thimerosal has shown to be safe when used in vaccines; however, starting in 1999 public health agencies and manufacturers agreed to reduce or eliminate thimerosal in vaccines as precaution. This year, up to 118 million doses of the flu shot will be thimerosal-free. Read more here.
