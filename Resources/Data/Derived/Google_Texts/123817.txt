An officer who shot and injured a former American Legion chaplain was justified, the 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office said Friday.

Officer Allison Detwiler shot 61-year-old Chester Dean after he allegedly opened fire at witnesses during a welfare check on May 30.

Detwiler and other Colorado Springs police officers were called to Dean's home on reports that he was suicidal. Detwiler reported that while she was walking up to Dean's front door, he started shooting at two people nearby.

Detwiler fired back and hit Dean in the hip, something the DA's office said was "reasonable, appropriate and justified." Dean was treated for non-life threatening injuries.

According to our partners at The Gazette, Dean was a chaplain for the American Legion for three years, and had recently left the position at the time of the shooting. People who knew him told The Gazette he served in the position "honorably."

Dean is reportedly facing several charges, including attempted first-degree murder of a peace office, and is being held at the CJC on a $500,000 bond.
