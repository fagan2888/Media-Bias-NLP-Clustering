Now, you can be sure that some Republican lawyers somewhere are burning the midnight oil trying to find an objectionable phrase or clause in the Affordable Care Act, but in the meantime Fox News needs headlines, so Benghazi beckons.\n\nWhen four people, including an American diplomat, were killed during a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, an investigation was appropriate. The diplomat, Christopher Stevens, was the first U.S. Ambassador to be killed in an attack since 1979.\n\nAnd there have been thorough investigations. Several of them actually. According to Correct the Record, there have been 32 hearings (public or private) involving 10 committees.\n\nThe latest committee, the Benghazi Select Committee, is not expecting to complete its work until 2016, which \u2014 this is surely a coincidence \u2014 is when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s name could potentially appear on the ballot as a candidate for president.\n\nBy the time it\u2019s through, the Benghazi Select Committee will have been the longest Congressional investigation in U.S. history, spending as much as $6 million.\n\nVarious investigations have asked 2,780 questions and published 10 different reports on Secretary Clinton\u2019s handling of the attack on the embassy. She has taken responsibility. Through all the money, man-hours, and reams of paper, there is not a single example of wrongdoing by Secretary Clinton or anyone in the Obama administration. Nor has there been evidence of an intelligence failure. Nor has there been proof that Clinton or Obama gave a \u201cstand down\u201d order.\n\nBut now, with Obamacare and same-sex marriage both lost causes, the fringe of the GOP will undoubtedly focus all their energies on trying to damage Clinton as she runs for president.\n\nH/T: Politifact, Correct the Record", "article_metadata": {"description": "By the time it's through, the Benghazi Select Committee will have been the longest Congressional investigation in history, spending as much as $6 million.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "By the time it's through, the Benghazi Select Committee will have been the longest Congressional investigation in history, spending as much as $6 million.", "title": "Benghazi Is the House Republicans' New Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/GowdyBenghazi.jpg", "url": "https://bluenationreview.com/benghazi-is-the-house-republicans-new-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Blue Nation Review", "description": "By the time it's through, the Benghazi Select Committee will have been the longest Congressional investigation in history, spending as much as $6 million.", "title": "Benghazi Is the House Republicans' New Obamacare", "image": {"src": "https://bluenationreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/GowdyBenghazi.jpg"}, "creator": "@ShawnDrurySC", "site": "@bluenationrev", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Blue Nation", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview", "section": "Democrats", "tag": "benghazi,Benghazi Select Committee,Hillary Clinton,obamacare,same-sex marriage", "published_time": "2015-07-01T09:12:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "By the time it\u2019s through, the Benghazi Select Committee will have been the longest Congressional investigation in U.S. history, spending as much as $6 million.\nDespite some first-rate theatrics and top-flight demagoguery, House Republicans couldn\u2019t swipe health care from millions of people.They get an \u201cA\u201d for effort.\nWhen four people, including an American diplomat, were killed during a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya in 2012, an investigation was appropriate.\nThrough all the money, man-hours, and reams of paper, there is not a single example of wrongdoing by Secretary Clinton or anyone in the Obama administration.\nThe latest committee, the Benghazi Select Committee, is not expecting to complete its work until 2016, which \u2014 this is surely a coincidence \u2014 is when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s name could potentially appear on the ballot as a candidate for president."}
