If you don\u2019t have time to read through the pertinent parts of the law or the court rulings, then look no further.\n\nHere is your guide to the rulings: [note: all emphasis is mine]\n\nIt all starts with Section 36B of the U.S. tax code, which is titled \u201cRefundable credit for coverage under a qualified health plan.\u201d Under 36B(b)(2)(A) the tax code defines the \u201cPremium assistance amount\u201d as:\n\n\u201cthe monthly premiums for such month for 1 or more qualified health plans offered in the individual market within a State which cover the taxpayer, the taxpayer\u2019s spouse, or any dependent (as defined in section 152) of the taxpayer and which were enrolled in through an Exchange established by the State under 1311 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nFurther, under 36B(c)(2)(A)(i), the law defines the term \u201ccoverage month\u201d and reiterates the very same language found above:\n\n\u201ccovered by a qualified health plan described in subsection (b)(2)(A) that was enrolled in through an Exchange established by the State under section 1311 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nClearly, for the purposes of determining who can get a tax credit or subsidy for their health plan, the individual would have to be enrolled in an exchange established by the state and section 1311 of Obamacare is vitally important.\n\nLet\u2019s look at section 1311.\n\nStarting right off the bat, the heading of the first subsection (a) is \u201cAssistance to States to Establish American Health Benefit Exchanges.\u201d In this subsection, it outlines funds that will be given to a state so that \u201cA State shall use amounts awarded under this subsection for activities (including planning activities) related to establishing an American Health Benefit Exchange.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s more!\n\n1311(b)(1) \u2013 \u201c Each State shall, not later than January 1, 2014, establish an American Health Benefit Exchange (referred to in this title as an \u201cExchange\u201d)\u201d\n\nshall, not later than January 1, 2014, establish an American Health Benefit Exchange (referred to in this title as an \u201cExchange\u201d)\u201d In 1311(d)(1) it is absolutely crystal clear \u2013 \u201cIn general.\u2013An Exchange shall be a governmental agency or nonprofit entity that is established by a State.\u201d\n\nDoes it get any clearer than that?\n\nSection 1311(b)(5)(A) talks about federal funding limitations for the state run and established exchanges. Subsection (f) establishes rules for regional or interstate exchanges, but nowhere in section 1311, referenced to in the tax code, does it talk about a federal exchange. Only once in 1311(c)(5)(A) does it mention a different \u201cInternet portal\u201d that the secretary will \u201coperate, maintain and update.\u201d\n\nThis Internet portal? Section 1103(a)(1) states the establishment of this portal and its purpose:\n\n\u201cthe Secretary, in consultation with the States, shall establish a mechanism, including an Internet website, through which a resident of any State may identify affordable health insurance coverage options in that State.\u201d\n\nThe specific purpose of this federal site was to \u201cprovide ways for residents of any State to receive information\u201d about coverage options, not to get coverage.\n\nThe notion that the federal exchange website qualifies under section 1311 of Obamacare is utterly absurd. The law\u2019s own definition of a \u201cQualified Health Plan\u201d even points this out in 1301(a)(1)(A) which defines it as a health plan that \u201cmeets the criteria for certification described in section 1311(c).\u201d\n\nThe only loophole that one could possibly conjure up to say that the federal exchange site qualifies under section 1311 is that the word \u201cState\u201d is capitalized and could possibly mean a general government, rather than a slightly more narrow definition of a literal state within our union.\n\nUnfortunately, this holds absolutely no water as every mention of \u201ca State\u201d or \u201ceach State\u201d in section 1311 and even in 1301 (which establishes the federal Internet portal) has the word capitalized. Sorry, but no luck there either.\n\nThe federally run exchange that we have all become familiar with is established in 1321(c)(1) so that if the State (capital letter S) does not set up an exchange, that the secretary shall \u201cestablish and operate such Exchange within the State.\u201d\n\nThe federal exchange website that stood in place for the 34 states who did not set up an Obamacare exchange, plainly and clearly does not apply to the tax credit or subsidy in section 36B of the tax code referenced above. Regardless of the \u201cintent\u201d of Congress, or the Fourth Circuit Court\u2019s interpretation of their intent, the federal exchange site is not legally allowed to offer subsidies or tax credits for the purpose of purchasing health insurance.\n\nAs the D.C. Circuit Court points out, the way this law was written will \u201clikely have significant consequences, both for the millions of individuals receiving tax credits through federal Exchanges and for health insurance markets more broadly.\u201d\n\nWhile many on the left will be quick to blame (and some already have) the D.C. Circuit Court for this ruling and claim it to be political, the fault for this gross oversight lies with the authors of this grotesquely enormous bill, the Congress who passed it, the president who signed it and the complexity of the bill itself which will unfortunately have unintended (and some intended) consequences for years to come.\n\nPerhaps this is yet another first step in learning a lesson on moderation.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
