Just the thought of a sweet snack can make even the most hardcore dieter weak at the knees. The promise of a single fresh-baked chocolate chip cookie can make children eat an entire plate of vegetables or motivate couch potatoes to run that one extra mile. So what exactly does sugar do to our brains that make it so, well addictive?\n\nHooked From The First Bite\n\nFrom the first bite sugar sends a message to the brain, activating the its reward system. That\u2019s right; sugar has a similar effect on your brain to hanging out with friends, sex, and even drugs. This reward system is a series of electrical and chemical path systems across several different regions of the brain, Dr. Nicole Avena, a researcher in the department of psychiatry at the University Of Florida College Of Medicine explained in a recent TED talk.\n\nThe main chemical involved in this biological reward system is dopamine. In people who experience dependency on drugs, nicotine, and alcohol, the dopamine receptors are sent into overdrive causing the individual to be constantly seek that \u201chigh\u201d effect. The end result is addiction. Sugar causes a similar reaction in the brain, although not nearly as extreme as in the case of other addictive substances.\n\nDopamine\n\nWhenever we eat food dopamine is released in the brain. However after eating the same food time after time, the dopamine levels begin to even out and we no longer find the dish as satisfying as we once did, Avena explained. This is because the human brain evolved to motivate us to eat a wider variety of food. This evolutionary tacit ensures that humans both receive a balanced amount of vitamins and minerals, while also helping us to steer away from dangerous rotting food. Interestingly enough, no matter how much sugar a person consumes, the dopamine levels will never even out enough to motivate the discourage an individual from eating more sugar.\n\nAddictive Elements\n\nNot all doctors will agree that food is addictive, but the pleasure feeling one has after consuming a sugary treat is undeniable. Like all addictive activities, too much of sugar can be a far from a good thing. It may cause loss of control, cravings, and even an increased tolerance for sugar. In sugar-fed mice, absence of the addictive was seen to produce events of binging, craving, and even withdrawal symptoms, Business Insider reported.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends that no more than 10 percent of an individual\u2019s diet should come from sugar. This doesn\u2019t seem to back when you take into perspective that for an average healthy adult this is about 25 grams which looks like 6 teaspoons of sugar a day. When figuring that a can of coke contains 39 grams of sugar, it\u2019s easy to see how we can go overboard on our sugar consumption quite often. Weight gain and its more extreme cousin obesity are some of the most recognizable side effects of diets too high in sugar. Too much of the sweet stuff can also lead to other unpleasant health complications such as high blood pressure, liver damage.\n\nSo What Exactly Is Sugar?\n\nIn order to best control your sugar intake, it would probably be wise to know what exactly sugar is. Sugar is actually a carbohydrate. The white stuff we add to our tea and coffee is sucrose, a complex sugar comprised of two simpler sugars: fructose and glucose. Foods in the grocery store don\u2019t always clearly label their sugar content so when reviewing nutrition labels it\u2019s important to be aware that words such as glucose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, dextrose, starch, corn syrup, fruit juice, raw sugar, and honey. Sugar is also added to ketchup, yoghurt, and flavored water just to name a few.\n\nWhat About Natural Sugar?\n\nSugar does get a bit of a bad reputation sometimes though. It occurs naturally in many important foods such as fruit and milk. But what about the hype concerning natural sugar such as agave and coconut sugar; are they any better for you? Yes,but maybe not as much as you may be lead to believe.\n\nAccording JJ Virgin, author of The Virgin Diet and The Virgin Diet Cookbook, coconut sugar contains about the same amounts of fructose and glucose as ordinary table sugar. \u201cA small amount of coconut sugar would probably not create problems, but it\u2019s definitely not an \u2018unlimited\u2019 sweetener,\u201d explained Virgin to Yahoo News. And agave? \u201cThe reality is that it is often heavily processed and contains up to 90% fructose. There is nothing healthy about the agave syrups and agave-sweetened processed foods you find in health food stores,\u201d says Virgin.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "how, does, sugar, affect, your, brain, turns, out, very, similar, way, drugs, and, alcohol", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The reason for our obsession with sugary foods has to do with the effect the sweet substance has on the human brain.", "title": "Turns Out Sugar Affects Your Brain In The Same Way That Drugs Do", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-does-sugar-affect-your-brain-turns-out-very-similar-way-drugs-and-alcohol-295034", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/25/sugar.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The reason for our obsession with sugary foods has to do with the effect the sweet substance has on the human brain.", "title": "Turns Out Sugar Affects Your Brain In The Same Way That Drugs Do", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/how-does-sugar-affect-your-brain-turns-out-very-similar-way-drugs-and-alcohol-295034", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/25/sugar.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/25/sugar.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-25T17:04:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-25T17:04:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The reason for our obsession with sugary foods has to do with the effect the sweet substance has on the human brain."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0b2\"", "article_summary": "Hooked From The First BiteFrom the first bite sugar sends a message to the brain, activating the its reward system.\nThat\u2019s right; sugar has a similar effect on your brain to hanging out with friends, sex, and even drugs.\nSugar causes a similar reaction in the brain, although not nearly as extreme as in the case of other addictive substances.\nThe main chemical involved in this biological reward system is dopamine.\nDopamineWhenever we eat food dopamine is released in the brain."}
