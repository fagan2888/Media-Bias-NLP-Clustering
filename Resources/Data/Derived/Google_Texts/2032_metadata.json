At one point, she spoke with a wheelchair-bound Marine and his mother. The Iraq War veteran, who had a Marines blanket draped across most of his body, was injured by a grenade attack in March 2006.\n\nClinton walked away from the conversation somewhat shaken. \"Whoa,\" she said when CNN asked her about the interaction.\n\nJUST WATCHED Republicans descend on New Hampshire July 4th weekend Replay More Videos ...
