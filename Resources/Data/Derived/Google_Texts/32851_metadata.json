Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was anything but conservative in showing of his impression skills during his Thursday CPAC speech.\n\nIn discussing the importance of honesty in politics, Cruz rolled out his impression of Jay Leno to hit Obamacare.\n\n\"So uh, President Obama called me. He said 'Jay, if you like your job, you can keep it,'\" the senator said in full Leno mode.\n\nTurns out, this isn't the first, or second, or even third time Cruz has used this schtick. He's got more than a Jay Leno up his sleeve, from an act on former President Ronald Reagan, to a Darth Vader moment on the Senate floor.\n\nWatch Cruz's impressions in the clip above.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Sen. Ted Cruz Sen. Ted Cruz\n\n1 of 17 Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) left, greets Former Alaska Gov.
