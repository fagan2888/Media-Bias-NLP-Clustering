(TOMI) (OTC Pink:TOMZ), a global bacteria decontamination and infection prevention company, announced its financial results for the first quarter of 2016.\n\nDr. Halden Shane, TOMI\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, stated: \u201cDuring the first quarter of 2016, we made great progress in accelerating the commercialization of our SteraMist platform around the world. We reached an important milestone as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) amended our registration to include our Binary Ionization Technology\u2019s (BIT\u2122) efficacy against a broad spectrum of pathogens*, including MRSA**, H1N1** and C. diff spores+. This achievement significantly increases our market opportunity in the US hospital and healthcare channels and has already resulted in orders from one of the top-ranked hospitals and the leading center for infectious disease in the United States for our SteraMist platform. TOMI provides hospitals and healthcare facilities with a simple, quick and cost effective solution to reducing penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act and Medicare\u2019s non-payment policy. We remain focused on further penetrating the US hospital and healthcare market where we see tremendous growth potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo support our growth, we strengthened our leadership team with key hires, built out our internal sales infrastructure and expanded the TOMI Service Network (TSN\u2122). We also carefully managed costs to ensure we make the appropriate investments in our future while also maintaining a prudent cost structure. With our well-capitalized balance sheet, we believe we are in a strong financial position to reach sustained profitability and maximize value creation for our shareholders.\u201d\n\nFinancial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to 2015\n\nNet revenue was $1.7 million, up more than $1.0 million from the $676,000 in net revenue in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nGross margins were 56%, compared to 59%.\n\nTotal costs and expenses were $2.0 million, compared to $822,000.\n\nLoss from operations was $1.0 million, compared to $424,000.\n\nNet loss was $1.0 million, or $0.01 per share. In the first quarter of 2015, net loss included a $2.7 million fair value adjustment on a derivative liability and was $4.3 million, $0.05 per diluted share.\n\nAt March 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $4.6 million and working capital was $7.2 million, compared to $5.9 million and $7.9 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015.\n\n\u201cThe growth in net revenue reflects our accelerated commercialization into new markets around the world,\u201d stated Nick Jennings, TOMI\u2019s CFO. \u201cThe decline in gross margins in the first quarter 2016 was due to a large volume order from our Mexican distributor that received favorable pricing. Our costs and expenses reflect our investments in building out our sales infrastructure and increased marketing spend to support our future growth.\u201d\n\nRecent Business Highlights\n\nDomestic\n\nReceived an amended registration from the EPA for TOMI\u2019s patented BIT\u2122 to include its effectiveness in disinfecting Clostridium difficile spores (C. diff) + , Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ** and influenza (H1N1) * * .\n\n, Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and influenza (H1N1) .
