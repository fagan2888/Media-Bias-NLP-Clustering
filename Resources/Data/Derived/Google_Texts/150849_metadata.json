And will the double-amputee Olympian ever run competitively again on the carbon-fiber blades that made him one of the world\u2019s most recognizable athletes?\n\nHere\u2019s what Pistorius\u2019 five-year jail sentence for culpable homicide in Reeva Steenkamp\u2019s shooting death means:\n\n___\n\nHOW MANY YEARS IN PRISON?\n\nJudge Thokozile Masipa sentenced Pistorius to five years in prison for negligently killing Steenkamp by shooting her through a closed toilet door in his home. But the specific law cited by the judge when she announced Pistorius\u2019 sentence in a packed Pretoria courtroom allows a prisoner to apply for release after one-sixth of their term to serve the remainder under house arrest. That means Pistorius could be released from prison after 10 months, providing he meets criteria regarding good behavior while in jail.\n\n___\n\nWILL THE BLADE RUNNER RUN AGAIN?\n\nPistorius\u2019 agent, Peet van Zyl, said no decision will be made on the multiple Paralympic champion\u2019s career until they speak, which wasn\u2019t possible Tuesday after Pistorius was taken straight to prison. The five-year sentence raises serious doubts if Pistorius, who is 27, will ever run at major meets again, especially after van Zyl testified during the trial that Pistorius had planned to retire at the end of 2017 anyway.\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee said that Pistorius would not be allowed to run at IPC events while serving his sentence \u2014 no matter where he was serving it \u2014 seemingly ruling the world\u2019s most famous disabled sportsman out of the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, one of the last major events he planned to run in. The International Olympic Committee and the IAAF, which control able-bodied athletics events, declined to comment on Pistorius\u2019 case.\n\n___\n\nPROSECUTORS CONSIDER APPEAL\n\nPistorius\u2019 legal battle may not be over yet.\n\nProsecutors said they are considering an appeal after Judge Masipa\u2019s ruling meant Pistorius might serve less than a year in prison for shooting his girlfriend multiple times with his 9 mm pistol. Prosecutors had already expressed disappointment that Pistorius was acquitted of murder charges and instead found guilty of a lesser charge of culpable homicide, comparable to manslaughter. They have 14 days to apply for permission to appeal, and can appeal against the sentence or the verdict.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pistorius sentencing: What it means", "title": "Pistorius sentencing: What it means", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pistorius sentencing: What it means", "title": "Pistorius sentencing: What it means", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/21/pistorius_sentencing_what_it_means/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/south-africa-pistorius-trial.jpeg20-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pistorius sentencing: What it means", "title": "Pistorius sentencing: What it means", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/south-africa-pistorius-trial.jpeg20-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Gerald Imray and Christopher Torchia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That means Pistorius could be released from prison after 10 months, providing he meets criteria regarding good behavior while in jail.\nHere\u2019s what Pistorius\u2019 five-year jail sentence for culpable homicide in Reeva Steenkamp\u2019s shooting death means:___HOW MANY YEARS IN PRISON?\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsPRETORIA, South Africa (AP) \u2014 How much prison time will Oscar Pistorius ultimately serve for killing his girlfriend?\nPistorius\u2019 agent, Peet van Zyl, said no decision will be made on the multiple Paralympic champion\u2019s career until they speak, which wasn\u2019t possible Tuesday after Pistorius was taken straight to prison.\nThe International Olympic Committee and the IAAF, which control able-bodied athletics events, declined to comment on Pistorius\u2019 case."}
