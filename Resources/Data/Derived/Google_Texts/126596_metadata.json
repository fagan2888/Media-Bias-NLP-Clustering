Brendan McDermid/Reuters\n\nBankrupt rapper 50 Cent says he owns pieces of more than two dozen businesses, including an adult film production company, a clothing unit that might have a new deal and a boxing-promotion company that used to represent Floyd Mayweather.\n\nIn a court document filed late Tuesday, lawyers for the 40-year-old rapper, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, listed 32 entities that he has a stake in, though his team didn\u2019t assign a value to any of his holdings.\n\nMr. Jackson estimated that his assets are worth between $10 million and $50 million in his bankruptcy petition, though he testified under oath on Tuesday that he is worth $4.4 million, according to the New York Daily News.\n\nUnder bankruptcy-court rules, Mr. Jackson was supposed to file an itemized list of his assets and debts by July 27. His lawyers asked Judge Ann Nevins for another week to wade through Mr. Jackson\u2019s complicated financial situation.\n\nMr. Jackson is poised to draw royalties from several short film companies, according to the court filing. The eight-page document listed his ownership in a company that promotes boxers and a Las Vegas gym; G-Unit Brands Inc., which does endorsement deals; and Cheetah Vision Inc., which is related to television shows and movies.\n\nCourt papers say his G-Unit Clothing LLC has a \u201cpossible new clothing deal in the works\u201d but did not specify further. A business called Sire Spirits LLC has something to do with his promotion of Effen vodka. Another, G-Unity Foundation Inc., was listed as a charity.\n\nThe court document doesn\u2019t directly refer to any payout that Mr. Jackson received from his investment in the maker of Glaceau Vitaminwater. Forbes reported that Mr. Jackson walked away with as much as $100 million when that company was sold to Coca-Cola for $4.1 billion in 2007.\n\nLast week, Mr. Jackson said that the more than $20 million cost of two legal disputes, and not his lavish spending habits, prompted him to file for bankruptcy on July 13.\n\nMr. Jackson lost a dispute over a broken business deal to develop headphones. An ex-partner accused Mr. Jackson of later stealing the design of the \u201cSleek by 50\u201d headphones, prompting a judge to award the partner more than $17.2 million in October. Mr. Jackson is appealing the dispute.\n\nMore recently, a jury determined that Mr. Jackson should pay $5 million to a woman who said Mr. Jackson violated her privacy by posting a sex tape of her online. The filing canceled a hearing scheduled for jurors to determine whether he should pay additional damages in the 2010 lawsuit filed by Lastonia Leviston, rapper Rick Ross\u2019s ex-girlfriend. The sex-tape lawsuit accused Mr. Jackson of posting the video on his website as part of a \u201crap war\u201d between himself and Mr. Ross.\n\nMr. Jackson appeared on the music scene in 2003 with hit rap song \u201cIn Da Club.\u201d He has sold more than 22 million albums and will appear in the boxing drama \u201cSouthpaw,\u201d which hits theaters later this week. His Farmington, Conn., mansion, once owned by boxer Mike Tyson, is reported to have 21 bedrooms, a racquetball court, a home movie theater and an eight-car garage.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
