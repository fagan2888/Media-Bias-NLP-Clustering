Jen Flanagan, who is chairing a new commission looking into the issue.\n\n\u201cI could not agree with you more,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary John Polanowicz told Flanagan at a budget hearing in Watertown last week after she said she was \u201cdisheartened\u201d that so much substance abuse treatment takes place in correctional facilities rather than health care settings.\n\nPolanowicz said there is a need for more services, and said, \u201cOnce we\u2019ve created that capacity, we need to have that second-order discussion here. We\u2019ve created in effect an on-demand system and allowed a number of organizations in the Commonwealth to wash their hands of the substance abuse issue.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts residents are open to \u201crethinking how drug crimes are treated,\u201d according to the results of a new statewide poll conducted by The MassINC Polling Group for MassINC and The Massachusetts Criminal Justice Reform Coalition. The poll results were released at 10 a.m. Thursday by MassINC, which in 2013 released a report making the case for reforms \u201cto reduce prison populations and save money while reducing crime rates.\u201d\n\nBy more than a 2-to-1 margin, the poll showed residents are \u201cmore likely to perceive drug use as a health problem (64 percent) than a crime (24 percent).\u201d Seventy-eight percent \u201cwould consider early release for drug users, and 83 percent think sending drug users to treatment instead of prison would be effective at reducing crime.\u201d\n\nDrug Treatment Over Incarceration\n\nOn Tuesday, the Committee on Mental Health and Substance Abuse advanced a bill (H 3825) that would establish three commissions investigating the use of drug treatment in lieu of incarceration, cutting down on a state prison population where officials estimate 80 percent of inmates have a substance abuse problem.\n\n\u201cWe have to address this. It\u2019s a public health emergency, so we need some better treatment long-term,\u201d said committee co-chairwoman Rep. Elizabeth Malia, a Jamaica Plain Democrat.\n\nBill sponsor Rep. Randy Hunt, a Sandwich Republican, said the goal is to move people with drug and alcohol problems out of prisons and into treatment, and said the commissions should determine the proper course \u201cso that, when we\u2019re dealing with health insurance companies, that there is a standard of treatment that we would encourage them to support with health insurance dollars from their subscribers.\u201d\n\nPublic Safety and Security Secretary Andrea Cabral has discussed the need for recovery treatment to begin during incarceration and extend after release, and Trial Court Administrator Harry Spence said the court\u2019s plans for more drug courts require funding for treatment as well.\n\n\u201cWithin three years, every person who needs it and for whom it is appropriate, will have access to a drug court in Massachusetts. That\u2019s our goal,\u201d Spence told a budget panel in Fitchburg.\n\nLater he said, \u201cWe could have come to you with a specialty courts request for $700,000 by leaving out any treatment, any clinical supports. We could have just set up a judge and a probation officer and called it a specialty court. It\u2019s clear to us that to do so would be irresponsible. Secondly, not to include the treatment beds just means the court becomes a way of somebody jumping the line for an already desperately limited resource.\u201d\n\nWhile some have said insurance policies are not accommodating enough for drug treatment, an official with the state\u2019s health insurance association said insurers follow national guidelines for coverage.\n\n\u201cPlans already cover a wide range of services for substance abuse and chemical dependency issues,\u201d said Eric Linzer, senior vice president of public affairs and operations for the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans. Saying MAHP is willing to sit down with advocates on the issue, Linzer said, \u201cThis needs to be a discussion that focuses on data and the facts.\u201d\n\nLinzer said Division of Insurance statistics show coverage of inpatient and outpatient treatment for chemical dependency increased from 2011 to 2012, the last year of available data.\n\nWhy Getting Help Can Be Hard\n\n\u201cI was talking to a gentleman in detox last week, where he\u2019s literally sat \u2013 I believe he was drunk \u2013 waiting for the insurance company to approve his care. Now if you\u2019re someone who has a drug problem, or an alcohol problem, and you\u2019re looking for treatment, are you really going to wait six hours?\u201d Flanagan asked the News Service. She said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times when providers will say, \u2018We\u2019ve done everything we can, and the insurance companies will only approve three days.'\u201d\n\nDetox is only the first step in a long treatment process, health officials and lawmakers have said.\n\n\u201cSome of those individuals will be detoxed but not rehabbed and the reality is we\u2019re going to have recidivism,\u201d Polanowicz told members of the House and Senate Ways and Means committees.\n\nIn budgetary hearings where the Leominster Democrat is vice chairwoman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, Flanagan has found common ground on the need for more access to substance abuse treatment from Patrick administration Cabinet secretaries and officials representing the judicial branch.\n\n\u201cI think every aspect of state government that we\u2019ve talked to so far is in agreement that there needs to be something done with substance abuse treatment in Massachusetts,\u201d Flanagan told the News Service. \u201cThe question is how do we do that, how do we re-direct the funds, and how do we make effective and quality treatment options available to people who are seeking treatment.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Public Health says the Bureau of Substance Abuse Services has licensed 869 detox beds for adults, 284 clinical stabilization service beds, 291 transitional support service beds, and 2,211 recovery home beds, along with beds for youths and families.\n\nGov. Deval Patrick\u2019s budget would add 32 detox beds and 32 beds for clinical stabilization service.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to create the kind of system where people who need access to rehabilitation can get that access and not handle them in our DOC system,\u201d Polanowicz said of the 64 new beds in the budget.\n\nThrough a program referred to as Section 35, the state can civilly commit individuals whose drug or alcohol abuse puts themselves or others at risk. Those individuals can be placed at treatment centers in Brockton or New Bedford or in correctional institutions in Bridgewater and Framingham.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening to think that our prisons are one of the top providers of substance abuse and mental health treatment in Massachusetts,\u201d Flanagan said.\n\nDaniel Mumbauer, who leads High Point Treatment Center, said there has been an expansion of services in recent years, but it is \u201cinadequate\u201d to meet the growing needs of substance-addicted people.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have enough detox beds. We don\u2019t have enough rehab beds. We don\u2019t have enough recovery home beds. The number of folks that are in need of services, particularly with the large number of opioid-addicted folks in the Commonwealth today, we\u2019re just not coming close to meeting the need,\u201d Mumbauer told the News Service.\n\nHigh Point, which runs the Men\u2019s Addiction Treatment Center in Brockton and the Women\u2019s Addiction Treatment Center in New Bedford, said when someone is civilly committed that person is sent to one of his facilities, or sent to treatment at correctional institutions if he has no free beds.\n\n\u201cOur beds are filled every day, all our beds, 198 beds \u2013 108 for men, 90 for women \u2013 and people are desperately trying to get into treatment,\u201d Mumbauer said. Insurers don\u2019t pay for treatment in correctional facilities, but they do pay for treatment at High Point, which Mumbauer acknowledged might create a financial incentive for the state to move treatment away from jails and prisons.\n\nPublic Health Commissioner Cheryl Bartlett said abuse of certain drugs is on the rise, and Massachusetts is above most other states in its access to treatment.\n\n\u201cThe scale of prescription pain reliever abuse in Massachusetts exceeded the 2008-2009 national average of 4.8 percent, with 5.3 percent of the state population reporting past year misuse,\u201d Bartlett said in prepared testimony to the legislative budget panel. She said, \u201cI am proud that according to [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration], Massachusetts provides the sixth-highest per capita treatment access in the nation.\u201d\n\nThose seeking greater access said the need for drug abuse treatment is a nationwide issue, and praised other states, such as Texas, for reducing the number of prisons and increasing treatment.\n\n\u201cYou would not believe the amount of time that probation officers spend just trying to find a bed today. It\u2019s dialing for beds,\u201d said Hunt, who visited Texas and said placements in Massachusetts can take three weeks or longer.\n\nRep. Paul Heroux, an Attleboro Democrat who was previously director of research in the state prison system, said the Department of Corrections does not measure the success of its own programs, which he attributed to \u201cbureaucratic arrogance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using evidence-based models, but what we don\u2019t do is measure whether or not we\u2019re reducing recidivism. We have no idea if our programs work or not,\u201d Heroux said. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s resistance to that from the executive branch, broadly speaking.\u201d\n\nCabral became public safety secretary in 2013, after years as the Suffolk County sheriff, and Malia credited her with informing lawmakers about the need for substance abuse treatment.\n\nIn January, Senate President Therese Murray appointed Flanagan to head up a special committee dealing with drug addiction, and Patrick plans to talk about prisoner re-entry at a MassINC event on Thursday.\n\nStory continues below\n\nMost Popular Expand", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leaders across the branches of state government are in broad agreement that the state needs to increase access to mental health and substance abuse treatment.", "og": {"site_name": "wbur", "description": "Leaders across the branches of state government are in broad agreement that the state needs to increase access to mental health and substance abuse treatment.", "title": "State Officials Rethinking Approach To Substance Abuse Treatment", "url": "http://www.wbur.org/2014/02/20/state-officials-drug-abuse", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.wbur.org/images/podcasts/wbur.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wbur.org/2014/02/20/state-officials-drug-abuse", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws/cdn.wbur.org/images/podcasts/wbur.jpg", "site": "@wbur", "card": "summary", "title": "State Officials Rethinking Approach To Substance Abuse Treatment"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-20", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb78\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening to think that our prisons are one of the top providers of substance abuse and mental health treatment in Massachusetts,\u201d Flanagan said.\n\u201cI think every aspect of state government that we\u2019ve talked to so far is in agreement that there needs to be something done with substance abuse treatment in Massachusetts,\u201d Flanagan told the News Service.\nLeaders across the branches of state government are in broad agreement that the state needs to increase access to mental health and substance abuse treatment, with many saying there is a deficit of services and a lack of insurance coverage to pay for treatment.\nHe said, \u201cThere\u2019s resistance to that from the executive branch, broadly speaking.\u201dCabral became public safety secretary in 2013, after years as the Suffolk County sheriff, and Malia credited her with informing lawmakers about the need for substance abuse treatment.\n'\u201dDetox is only the first step in a long treatment process, health officials and lawmakers have said."}
