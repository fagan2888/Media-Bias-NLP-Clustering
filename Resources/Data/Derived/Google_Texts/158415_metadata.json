For many in the Republican Party, they either love him for his refreshing political incorrectness or hate him for the image he projects of the GOP that wants to be more demographically embracing.\n\nFor Black party members, especially longtime stalwarts in the Philadelphia area, it is an even more awkward situation: disagreeing with the candidate\u2019s race-baiting comments that spawn hooliganism while agreeing he is hitting a chord among discontented voters.\n\nThe 2016 campaign, moreover, is casting doubts among the flock locally about the direction of the Grand Old Party and the direction of their vote come November\u2019s general election.\n\n\u201cHow can you support the most outrageous figure there is in the Republican Party?\u201d asked Republican political strategist Randy Robinson. \u201cI don\u2019t support him. I\u2019ll never vote for him or [former Secretary of State] Hillary [Clinton]. I\u2019ll probably just do a write in.\u201d\n\nOther Blacks in the party express similar disbelief that Trump is leading the GOP pack, which once counted at least 17 candidates, as it mushes through state primaries and caucuses. In what many saw as a political knock-knock joke has become a stark reality as \u201cThe Donald\u201d gains momentum with each ballot victory.\n\nRenee Amoore, a third-generation Republican, has deep concerns about Trump\u2019s campaign and the shadow it is casting.\n\n\u201cThis has been very unique from the campaigns, to the violent rallies, and they really concern me,\u201d said the deputy chairman of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. \u201cTo me, it shows how angry people are.\n\n\u201cI never thought it was a joke,\u201d Amoore said of Trump\u2019s nomination bid. \u201cBut I never thought it would go this far.\n\n\u201cI always support our candidates,\u201d she added. \u201cBut if Donald wins, to be honest, that\u2019s something that I have to think about.\u201d\n\nIt has been an arduous struggle to regain the support of Black voters from the days when the GOP was called \u201cthe party of Lincoln,\u201d in reference to Republican President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s emancipation of slaves in 1863. That and other acts would endear the African-American bloc to the party for nearly 70 years.\n\nThe shift to the Democratic Party occurred in the 1930s, with the implementation of New Deal measures by President Franklin Roosevelt to end the Great Depression. African-American loyalty to the party was further solidified in the 1960s with the enactment by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson of civil rights laws, covering such areas as voting rights and fair housing.\n\nAccording to blackdemographics.com, in 2012 when the last presidential election occurred, about 3 percent of African Americans nationally considered themselves Republican compared with 72 percent who were Democrat.\n\nStatistics from the Pennsylvania Division of Voter Registration showed the state had 8.25 million registrants in 2014. Of those, about 3 million signed up as Republicans while 4 million were card-carrying Democrats. The numbers for Republicans in Philadelphia were less favorable, as the party counted 119,267 members vs 806,784 for the Democrats.\n\nBlacks have consistently voted for Democratic presidential candidates for the last 40 years, with President Barack Obama being a notable beneficiary over his two terms in office.\n\nBut the Democratic Party doesn\u2019t promote Black independence, Robinson contends.\n\n\u201cI believe in a do-for-self mindset, lesser government and taxations,\u201d he said. \u201cMost African Americans don\u2019t embrace conservative politics because they equate those with being less Black or [being] a traitor to the race.\n\n\u201cParty affiliation is not a litmus test to your race,\u201d Robinson added, noting, \u201cI\u2019m a moderate Christian conservative.\u201d\n\nThe 20-year veteran of the Republican Party finds the political affiliation fits with his faith.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot African Americans elected as Democrats and they make it about racial pride rather then public policy and that\u2019s the downfall,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cI think Christianity and my faith was more aligned with the Republicans. I\u2019ve seen welfare programs in policy that pretty much dissolved the Black man. It helps children, but not the Black man.\u201d\n\nRyan Sanders, a Philadelphia native who now lives in Harrisburg and serves as the regional manager of the Republican National Committee, explained his allegiance to the GOP.\n\n\u201cMy goals are aligned a little bit closer with the Republican Party in terms of the Second Amendment, business policies \u2026 and I believe that some of the policies that were put in place over the past 20 or 30 years have hurt African Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cI had always been conservative in my heart.\u201d\n\nBut Republican James Williams, the African-American leader of the city\u2019s 50th Ward, acknowledged that \u201cthis is a crazy race and you can\u2019t really predict it. Trump is the outcast candidate and he\u2019s on the fringe. I think he\u2019s taking advantage of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nThe business magnate was considered a long-shot in the field that touted more politically experienced candidates, such as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, as well as Novice, such as Dr. Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina. The 17 horses that started at the gate have withered down to three going down the stretch.\n\nOnly two Republican challengers remain in the party\u2019s primary race: Ohio Gov. John Kasich and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Combined both have chalked up primary victories and delegate numbers below what their unorthodox campaign opponent has collected since the process began in Iowa on Feb. 1.\n\nTrump, whose political slogan is \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d has mocked Muslims, immigrants, women and people with physical disabilities. Despite those barbs, he continues to lead in the survey polls and, in many cases, at the ballot boxes. With 34 primaries and caucuses down and 22 still to go, the front-runner has amassed 673 of the 1,237 delegates needed to capture the GOP nomination outright during the party\u2019s convention this summer in Cleveland.\n\nStill, Williams says Trump is \u201cnot as well-liked by the Republican Party as people would think. He\u2019s just talking rhetoric. He\u2019s playing into people\u2019s fears. What I can say is the good thing about Trump is that he is hurting the far right wing.\u201d\n\nCalvin Tucker, chairman of the Philadelphia Black Republican Council and leader of the city\u2019s 22nd Ward, insists that a lot of what the candidates are doing is political theater.\n\n\u201cYou have to find a lane in the political process, and they\u2019re driving down that lane,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald Trump is appealing to some of the basics regarding immigration and other things like national security.\u201d\n\nRobinson blamed both political parties for the rise of Trump.\n\n\u201cThey prepared America for the clown car show by doing nothing and being so adversarial. People hate Congress, and they want someone to get something done. You have folks who are just simply upset about government,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe party prepared the stage for this, and the establishment candidates are out of the loop.\u201d\n\nSanders took another tact in explaining Trump\u2019s political success: \u201cAmericans are looking for a strong voice. Along with his experience in the business world, and that matched up with some other things in terms of public safety and the overall welfare of the country.\u201d\n\nSo who are area Black Republicans supporting?\n\n\u201cMe, as a voter, if I\u2019m going to pick my candidate for president, John Kasich is clearly the best to lead as POTUS,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cMy decision for the GOP brand and what\u2019s best for America would be [Kasich].\u201d\n\nRobinson favors Kasich because he is from a state facing a mixture of industrial, rural and urban issues as well as labor concerns. He also feels the governor is more in tune with poor people, Black people and the LGBT community.\n\n\u201cAs for being an African American, I need someone who has familiarity with someone who has lived in an urban-type setting,\u201d the political strategist said. \u201cKasich has had some experience, and not all positive, but he understands the importance of labor \u2026 he understands the position of a thriving metropolis and economy of state.\u201d\n\nWilliams, who failed in his bid for an at-large seat on City Council last year, also is betting on Kasich as the best Republican candidate to pit against Democrat Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton come the Nov. 8 election.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the most talented guy in the gym shooting the ball,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s not dunking enough or he\u2019s not flashy enough, but it\u2019s a shame because he\u2019s not getting any notice.\u201d\n\nWilliams gives Cruz a poor rating, calling him \u201cthe worst candidate because he\u2019s against things that are good for the average person and for cities like Philadelphia. Most people might not like Obamacare [the Affordable Care Act], but it helps people and it works. Cruz is a person who says he sticks to the Constitution and if we stuck to that then I wouldn\u2019t be free.\u201d\n\nSanders said he would support whoever is the eventual GOP nominee, even if it\u2019s Trump.\n\n\u201cMe, personally, being from Philadelphia, I know the impact of what the Islamic community has had in our communities and I think as we move forward in the primaries, I think that Donald Trump will have an opportunity to explain his positions and policies,\u201d said Sanders, who is also the co-founder of the Frederick Douglass Inclusion Council.\n\nTucker, the 22nd Ward leader, notes a lot of Blacks think Trump is articulating the concerns of many people, though being inadequate in his delivery.\n\n\u201cOn average, there are a lot of African Americans beginning to say that he may not be saying things the way they should be said but he\u2019s addressing things that need to be said,\u201d he said. \u201c[U.S. Sen.] Bernie Sanders is saying a lot of things millennials want to hear.\u201d\n\nTrump has dominated the survey polls because people are tired of hearing the same empty promises, Tucker said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a basic hunger and desire for change,\u201d he added. \u201cPeople can\u2019t survive on basic income. They see their neighborhood being torn apart. They want change.\u201d\n\nAmoore echoed that voters were eager to shake up the political landscape during the 2016 presidential run.\n\n\u201c[Trump] is not a typical established politician and that\u2019s what people want,\u201d she said, noting his attraction has had undeniably good consequence for the state GOP.\n\n\u201cIn Pennsylvania, 46,000 Democrats [have] changed to Republicans,\u201d Amoore said. \u201cA lot of people are saying that\u2019s because of Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nWilliams, the 50th Ward leader, hasn\u2019t seen a big dividend from the Trump candidacy translate to a sizable migration in Philadelphia. He said only 1,600 Democrats in Philadelphia had switched to the Republican Party, in a city of 1.03 million registered voters where GOP card carriers were outnumbered nearly 8 to 1 in 2014.\n\n\u201cOne out of three Republicans are for Trump,\u201d said Williams, who considers himself a moderate. \u201cMost Republicans view Trump as a Democrat, but it\u2019s just easier for him to win as a Republican. Not a lot of Republicans in the city or the state are really for Trump.\u201d\n\nTucker acknowledges that voters, especially Blacks, may be politically numbed by their circumstances.\n\n\u201cPeople have gotten to the point that regardless of who you [gets] into the White House, things have not substantially changed, particularly in the African-American community,\u201d he said. \u201cPoverty is deep and almost entrenched in our community. We don\u2019t know how to get out of economic distress and unemployment.\u201d\n\nWith the April 26 primary just weeks away, Black Republicans in Philadelphia and elsewhere across Pennsylvania will likely continue to do more soul searching before they weigh in on who\u2019s their nomination choice.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is we\u2019ve got to see a way out of these things we see today,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if our current political landscape can help us move out of that process unless we change that or create a more competitive political environment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Philadelphia Tribune", "description": 17, "title": "Trump presents difficult choice for local Black Republicans", "url": "http://www.phillytrib.com/news/trump-presents-difficult-choice-for-local-black-republicans/article_845fece7-7b64-59c5-88cf-a0196b59ff92.html", "image": {"width": 538, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/phillytrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/5f/05fe6263-2999-59f6-b885-e7e9573f6e47/56eb16d76e92f.image.jpg?resize=538%2C404", "height": 404}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@PhillyTrib", "card": "summary"}, "description": 17, "fb": {"app_id": 192095830844175}, "keywords": "donald trump,republican party,renee amoore,lyndon b. johnson,ted cruz,enewsletter,news,featured", "google-site-verification": "awU4tGDYLbxW_pvA8W2ZKl9Gx4HCDtahI2b3E4fP8Fg", "news_keywords": "donald trump,republican party,renee amoore,lyndon b. johnson,ted cruz,enewsletter,news,featured"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHow can you support the most outrageous figure there is in the Republican Party?\u201d asked Republican political strategist Randy Robinson.\nTucker, the 22nd Ward leader, notes a lot of Blacks think Trump is articulating the concerns of many people, though being inadequate in his delivery.\n\u201cThis has been very unique from the campaigns, to the violent rallies, and they really concern me,\u201d said the deputy chairman of the Republican Party of Pennsylvania.\n\u201cMost Republicans view Trump as a Democrat, but it\u2019s just easier for him to win as a Republican.\nStill, Williams says Trump is \u201cnot as well-liked by the Republican Party as people would think."}
