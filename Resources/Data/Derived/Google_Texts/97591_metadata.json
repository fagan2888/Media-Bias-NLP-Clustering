Now Glenn Beck is getting into the game with a new service of his own, called 1791 Email. He branded it as going specifically after Google, pledging that unlike Gmail, his e-mail service won\u2019t scan user e-mails and/or create targeted ads based on them.\n\nBeck already has a company called 1791, though for now it only sells jeans. Services like search engine DuckDuckGo and communication encryption service Silent Circle have seen a boost in usage since the NSA revelations gave out, and Beck\u2019s 1791 Email service, debuting later this year, is jumping on the privacy bandwagon.\n\nBeck explained, \u201cWe will guarantee that you will never, ever, ever have your e-mails scanned.\u201d The service would be free for current Blaze subscribers.\n\nBeck pledged that the service won\u2019t \u201csurrender\u201d anything without a warrant, saying they believe too much in the Constitution to do otherwise. And say what you will about Beck, note the contrast between his comments and Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer calling it \u201ctreason\u201d to defy the NSA.\n\nWatch the video below, via The Blaze:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Glenn Beck announced 1791 Email on Thursday, a service he pledged would protect user privacy, fighting back against NSA surveillance and Gmail in particular.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-12-at-2.37.58-PM.png", "title": "Glenn Beck Announces New Service to Fight Back Against NSA, Email Snooping"}, "twitter": {"description": "Glenn Beck announced 1791 Email on Thursday, a service he pledged would protect user privacy, fighting back against NSA surveillance and Gmail in particular.", "title": "Glenn Beck Announces New Service to Fight Back Against NSA, Email Snooping", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-12-at-2.37.58-PM.png", "creator": "@feldmaniac", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-09-12T15:00:54+00:00", "keywords": "glenn beck,email,google,gmail,nsa surveillance,online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1323\"", "article_summary": "Now Glenn Beck is getting into the game with a new service of his own, called 1791 Email.\nBeck pledged that the service won\u2019t \u201csurrender\u201d anything without a warrant, saying they believe too much in the Constitution to do otherwise.\nHe branded it as going specifically after Google, pledging that unlike Gmail, his e-mail service won\u2019t scan user e-mails and/or create targeted ads based on them.\nBeck already has a company called 1791, though for now it only sells jeans.\nServices like search engine DuckDuckGo and communication encryption service Silent Circle have seen a boost in usage since the NSA revelations gave out, and Beck\u2019s 1791 Email service, debuting later this year, is jumping on the privacy bandwagon."}
