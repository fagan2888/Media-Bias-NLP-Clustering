As transgender YouTube star Jamie Raines, 21, was getting ready to start taking testosterone, he knew it was worth documenting. Not only for him, but also for young transgender people hoping to one day make their transition with the help of hormone therapy. Over the course of three years, Raines compiled 1,400 selfies to chronicle his entire transition, which will be featured in an upcoming British documentary titled “Girls to Men.”

“When I first started I tried not to have an image in my mind — I was taking testosterone so I could go through the correct puberty for me — and I tried not to have expectations, because testosterone affects everyone differently and different changes come in at different points,” Rainers told BuzzFeed. “Some people get loads of facial hair within the first six months, and some people never get it. I didn’t pin too many hopes on T [testosterone] changing me drastically and just took the changes as they came.”

Although Raines initially planned on documenting the first year of his transition, he decided to keep going when he didn’t develop any facial after the first couple of months. He knew that testosterone affects everyone differently and didn’t want to get his hopes up. Nevertheless, around three years after starting hormone therapy Raines developed the full beard and deeper voice he has been waiting for. He hopes that more transgender people will realize the process does not take place overnight and that patience is a requirement.
