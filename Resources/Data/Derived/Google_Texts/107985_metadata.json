That is, when they treat patients, the amount a hospital can bill Medicare and insurance companies is typically less than what the hospital must pay them. The opposite is true for other specialists, like surgeons.\n\nSo it was no surprise when, in the spring of 2014, one of Mr. Hill\u2019s colleagues came before the hospitalists and confirmed that the company would request bids for outsourcing their group. Still, the room erupted in anger and despair. The doctors were convinced that working for a management company would mean seeing many more patients per shift, and they worried about losing their jobs if they resisted.\n\nAmid the groaning, a relatively new member of the group named Dr. David Schwartz observed, \u201cThey can\u2019t fire all of us \u2014 there are unions.\u201d This was a bit of a stretch: While there are hospitals around the country whose doctors are unionized, there did not appear to be a union anywhere composed of a single group of specialists. But Dr. Schwartz, a barrel-chested man with close-cropped hair and a bushy beard who would not look out of place at a graduate English seminar, thought unionizing might be worth a try.\n\nAt the time, it was only one of several options the doctors considered. They talked of forming an independent hospitalists group, of forming an alliance with an outsourcing firm of their choosing. But the alternatives gradually fell away for a variety of practical reasons, and the doctors were growing increasingly bitter.\n\nDr. Littell developed a riff, which the other hospitalists appropriated, about how the situation was like having your spouse of several decades announce he or she was going to play the field. \u201cYou\u2019ve been great, you\u2019ve always been there,\u201d he would joke. \u201cI just heard there could be better spouses out there.\u201d The kicker: \u201cThe good news is, you\u2019re in the running, too!\u201d\n\nSeveral doctors could not find it within themselves to be amused and gave notice. Eventually, about a third of the 36 in the group left. The hospital replaced many of them with contractor doctors, called locums.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBy the time the doctors decided to hold their union election, almost all of them had become, if not pro-union, then convinced they had no better options. In early October they voted overwhelmingly to form a union that they chose to affiliate with the American Federation of Teachers, which already represented nurses at Sacred Heart.\n\nBy March 2015, the PeaceHealth leadership, whatever its interest in efficiency gains, was apparently not pleased that one of its hospitals had a white-collar labor insurrection on its hands. The company announced that it would not outsource the hospitalists, a move it later said was always a possibility. Mr. Hill, who declined to comment, left in May.\n\nBut backing down on outsourcing did not mean the hospital had given up on getting more out of its doctors.\n\n\u2018Skin in the Game\u2019\n\nTo work in a hospital today is to be constantly preoccupied with money, and one of the more grating features as far as the Sacred Heart hospitalists are concerned has been the administration\u2019s celebration of \u201cskin in the game.\u201d That means creating financial incentives for doctors to hit performance targets \u2014 like lowering patient\u2019s length of stay and doing well on patient satisfaction surveys. The phrase entered the Sacred Heart lexicon in 2014, but the underlying concept has spread throughout the profession in recent years.\n\nDr. Robert M. Wachter, chief of the division of hospital medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, says many hospitals now give doctors financial incentives to perform well according to the criteria on which the hospitals themselves are judged under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 for example, reducing hospital-acquired infections. But there is an active debate in the profession over their utility. \u201cIf at the end of the year, 10 percent of your salary is at risk based on whether you have consistently clean hands, what patients say about you, readmission rates, that can be O.K.,\u201d he said. The counterargument is that \u201cyou could screw things up by tying everything to financial incentives,\u201d he said. \u201cYou stomp on their intrinsic motivation.\u201d\n\nThe hospitalists also chafe at the way the administration has tried to centralize decisions they used to make for themselves. This might include hiring fellow doctors or the order in which they see patients on any day. They also complain of being loaded down with administrative tasks.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trained to be leaders, but they treat us like assembly line workers,\u201d said Dr. Brittany Ellison, a hospitalist in the group. \u201cYou need that time with the patient, where his wife is ratting on him.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, Dr. Alexander has accepted this state of affairs stoically, albeit with his trademark sardonic humor. At one point he told me that a patient with dissociative disorder was on her way to a psychiatric hospital, before observing: \u201cOften people with dissociative disorder become managers. You have to treat people like things. A different way of saying it is sociopath.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHis personal rebellion is to linger over patients as long as he thinks it\u2019s necessary, the hell with the performance metrics that nudge him to see more.\n\nBut just beneath his fatalism, an anger occasionally flares up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the widget the hospital produces?\u201d he asked at one point. \u201cIt\u2019s the doctor-patient relationship. You don\u2019t improve it with extra little tasks.\u201d\n\nA few weeks after I got back from Oregon, I spoke by phone with Rand O\u2019Leary, who was promoted to oversee PeaceHealth\u2019s hospital services in the state last summer. He was genial and disarmingly sympathetic to the hospitalists\u2019 concerns. He said his negotiators and the union had been \u201cdialoguing around\u201d a compensation model that would award doctors a bonus for hitting certain performance targets \u2014 the dreaded \u201cskin in the game.\u201d The targets would include how many patients they see, but would also include measures of patient health and satisfaction.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be all based on production,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt has to be quality \u2014 safety, a good experience. If you\u2019re the patient in the bed, it\u2019s important to you that you\u2019re treated as an individual, that your needs are being met.\u201d\n\nMr. O\u2019Leary was especially proud of a ritual known as REAL rounds, which stands for \u201crounding embraced by all leaders,\u201d in which administrators circulate through a different unit of the hospital each week and talk to doctors, nurses and other caregivers about their needs.\n\nDisconnect at the Table\n\nIf Dr. Alexander\u2019s medical experience has instilled a kind of fatalism, Dr. Schwartz\u2019s has made him skeptical about human nature. During a morning of rounds, I couldn\u2019t help noticing he was constantly on alert for ways that a patient\u2019s version of events might not track.\n\n\u201cYou have to take what people say with a grain of salt,\u201d he later explained. \u201cEspecially if the story changes, or is inconsistent, I get a little suspicious and assume the worst.\u201d\n\nThis is not just true of patients. Noting that the negotiations with the hospital administration have dragged on for roughly a year, Dr. Schwartz said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that they don\u2019t want to get a contract done.\u201d He says the administration worries that if it essentially rewards the hospitalists with a contract, it encourages other hospital workers to unionize too.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Schwartz said he and his colleagues have always wanted to talk about staffing \u2014 ideally, they wanted to agree on a minimum proportion of doctors to patients \u2014 and how this affected patient safety. But when they raised these issues in the past, he said, the administration frequently shut down or retreated to marginal details.\n\nDebra Miller, the system vice president for labor and caregiver relations, told me that PeaceHealth had never resisted the right of its employees to organize and bargain through a third party, and that there were many who did, like nurses and dietary workers. She said that it was standard for the first contract with newly unionized workers to take more than a year to negotiate and that this case presented special challenges. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of hospital-based physicians unionized,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the union themselves are trying to find their way over how to deal with it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160109055836, "twitter": {"description": "An Oregon medical center\u2019s plan to increase efficiency by outsourcing doctors drove a group of its hospitalists to fight back by banding together.", "title": "Doctors Unionize to Resist the Medical Machine", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/business/doctors-unionize-to-resist-the-medical-machine.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004128038"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/10/business/10HOSPITALIST1/10HOSPITALIST1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/business/doctors-unionize-to-resist-the-medical-machine.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004128038", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/business/doctors-unionize-to-resist-the-medical-machine.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "hdl_p": "Defying the Medical Machine", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 9, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "American Federation of Teachers", "keywords": "Hospitals,PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center,Organized Labor,Doctors,outsourcing,American Federation of Teachers,Oregon", "news_keywords": "Hospital,Doctor,Outsourcing,Oregon", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Noam Scheiber", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/10/business/10HOSPITALIST1/10HOSPITALIST1-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By NOAM SCHEIBER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "An Oregon medical center\u2019s plan to increase efficiency by outsourcing doctors drove a group of its hospitalists to fight back by banding together.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/10/business/10HOSPITALIST1/10HOSPITALIST1-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "An Oregon medical center\u2019s plan to increase efficiency by outsourcing doctors drove a group of its hospitalists to fight back by banding together.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 9, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2016-04-06", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "Oregon", "published": "2016-01-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Oregon", "slug": "10hospitalist", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160406074208, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/business/doctors-unionize-to-resist-the-medical-machine.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/10/business/10HOSPITALIST1/10HOSPITALIST1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Oregon medical center\u2019s plan to increase efficiency by outsourcing doctors drove a group of its hospitalists to fight back by banding together.", "title": "Doctors Unionize to Resist the Medical Machine"}, "pdate": 20160109, "des": "outsourcing", "articleid": 100000004128038, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Doctors Unionize to Resist the Medical Machine", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24c6\"", "article_summary": "They talked of forming an independent hospitalists group, of forming an alliance with an outsourcing firm of their choosing.\nBut the alternatives gradually fell away for a variety of practical reasons, and the doctors were growing increasingly bitter.\nBut backing down on outsourcing did not mean the hospital had given up on getting more out of its doctors.\nThis might include hiring fellow doctors or the order in which they see patients on any day.\nDisconnect at the TableIf Dr. Alexander\u2019s medical experience has instilled a kind of fatalism, Dr. Schwartz\u2019s has made him skeptical about human nature."}
