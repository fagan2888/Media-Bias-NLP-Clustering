With heavy Seahawks money late nearly offsetting heavy Patriots money early, the bookies have shifted from favoring Seattle to New England to a pick em.\n\nJust as the betting public speaks without consensus on picking a winner, contributors polled by Breitbart Sports split on calling the game.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDaniel J. Freeman: Seahawks 27, Patriots 24\n\nLeGarrette Blount and Rob Gronkowski will be a formidable matchup for the Legion of Boom, especially with their secondary in questionable health. However, in a single-game, winner-take-all format, it\u2019s hard to pick against a dominant defense.\n\nSean Flynn: Patriots 30, Seahawks 13\n\nThe Seahawks\u2019s defense is great. But even if Seattle could track down the Spoonman from Soungarden and sign him to a one-day contract to anchor a Seahawk secondary alongside Richard Sherman, Tom Brady et al would still have their way with them.\n\nDaniel Leberfeld: Patriots 24, Seahawks 23\n\nNew England wins a close one thanks to tailback LeGarrette Blount\u2019s work on the ground nicely complimenting Tom Brady.\n\nC. Edmund Wright: Seahawks 34, Patriots 28\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to pick the team with the hot quarterback\u2014the Patriots and Tom Brady\u2014but something tells me the Pats will be affected by all the attention on Deflate-gate.\n\nDino Costa: Patriots 23, Seahawks 20\n\nPats win simply because it would be poetic justice to see a team led by Obamacare supporters defeated.\n\nMary Chastain: Patriots 24, Seahawks 14\n\nBecause it\u2019s the freaking Patriots! The score won\u2019t be as high because of Seattle\u2019s defense.\n\nPeter Schweizer: Seahawks 21, Patriots 13\n\nIf the refs allow physical defensive play, the Seahawks will shut down the Pats passing attack. And Marshawn Lynch will gain traction in the second half.\n\nStephen K. Bannon: Patriots 45, Seahawks 7\n\n\u201cStanford\u2019s finest\u201d allows four redzone scores; Russell Wilson repeats his first 55 minute performance of the NFC championship Game.\n\nKevin Scholla: Seahawks 25, Patriots 20\n\nIn a day and age when Roger Goodell attempts to provide \u201csuspense,\u201d it\u2019ll be good to see real football prevail. Defense is the difference for a third straight season.\n\nDaniel J. Flynn: Patriots 24, Seahawks 23\n\nThe fourth New England Super Bowl victory of the Flying Elvis era compels Roger Goodell to rename the Lombardi Trophy the Belichick Trophy.\n\nDon\u2019t player hate.
