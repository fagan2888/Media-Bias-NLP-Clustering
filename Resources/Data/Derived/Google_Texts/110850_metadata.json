WooChing, who has been battling cancer, was last year's Happy Smackah fundraiser recipient. ( Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer )\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: The Times-Call\u2019s Take Two series revisits people and things we have written about in the past year. Take Two stories run on Mondays.\n\nIt has been a little less than a year since Jill Woo Ching was the 2014 Happy Smackah recipient and a 5K race was held in her honor.\n\nSince the annual Longmont event last May, and a full 16 months since her diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, life for Woo Ching has been rocky but full of more support than she could've imagined.\n\n\"I'm so appreciative,\" she said of the experience. \"There were perfect strangers, people who had never knew me, who didn't need to care about me but did.\"\n\nWoo Ching said that the day of the 2014 race, it was \"doubtful\" she could even make the event in her honor, due to chemotherapy-induced sickness, but she did, and she is grateful of both the emotional and monetary support.\n\nLast year's event raised more than $20,000.\n\nIf you go What: 2015 Happy Smackah 5k When: 8 a.m. May 9 Where: West end of Dawson Park near Lakeshore Drive, Longmont Cost: Under age 5: $1; ages 6-12: $15; ages 13-17: $25; ages 18-54: $35; above 55: $25 More info: Register at happysmackah.com\n\nSince then, the Berthoud resident has traveled roughly every eight weeks to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer in Houston, where her primary oncologist is located.\n\n\"After 10 rounds of very difficult chemo, like once every three weeks, I would love to be told 'the tumors in your lungs are gone,' but they just aren't at all,\" she said. \"The hope is to prevent more cancer growth.\"\n\nLeiomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of smooth muscle tissue.\n\nWoo Ching says at this point she's realized she is \"living with cancer\" and is working to manage the disease more than fight it. In addition to that reality, she is also in a back brace most of the time due to a tumor in her lower back. She was hoping a surgery would end that ordeal, but that has since become a non-option due to the high-risk involved.\n\n\"I have discovered in the last year I had some hope that I could have some specific surgery to relieve the pain down there, and that's been ruled out,\" Woo Ching said.\n\nBut Woo Ching credits Happy Smackah with giving her a constant sense of hope. She said that despite her illness, she is trying to stay involved with the organization to help others.\n\nJill Woo Ching, of Berthoud, shows her back brace, which she will wear the rest of her life.

The annual run benefits any student or employee of the St. Vrain Valley School District who has been through a tragedy.\n\nTo Woo Ching, Happy Smackah is important not just because of the money raised but because of the community support it provides for every recipient.\n\n\"I never even thought about the dollar amount,\" she said. \"The idea I'm trying to get across is the fact that people did that for you. The fact that a board of directors chose me out of other applicants, and quite a few of my St. Vrain Valley friends nominated me.\"\n\nWoo Ching says she is a \"cheerleader\" for this year's recipient, Kelly Haley. Haley, a cheer coach from Longmont High School, was diagnosed last month with stage 4 colon cancer, which has since spread to her liver and lungs.\n\nWoo Ching hopes that her story, and Haley's, will show people how much an event like Happy Smackah can help.\n\n\"I'll be there, and what I think is so cool is the families come together,\" she said. \"So that people that came out just for me can realize we can together can do this every year.\"\n\nIsa Jones: 303-684-5274, jonesi@timescall.com or twitter.com/theisajones", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27805115/longmont-happy-smackah-2014-recipient-still-appreciative", "modificationDate": "2015-03-29T17:50:19-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0328/20150328__30TCAHAPw~3_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Isa Jones \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "It has been a little less than a year since Jill Woo Ching was the 2014 Happy Smackah recipient and a 5K race was held in her honor.\nSince the annual Longmont event last May, and a full 16 months since her diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, life for Woo Ching has been rocky but full of more support than she could've imagined.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27805115:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-29T17:36:58-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27805115/longmont-happy-smackah-2014-recipient-still-appreciative", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0328/20150328__30TCAHAPw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It has been a little less than a year since Jill Woo Ching was the 2014 Happy Smackah recipient and a 5K race was held in her honor.\nSince the annual Longmont event last May, and a full 16 months since her diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, life for Woo Ching has been rocky but full of more support than she could've imagined.", "title": "Longmont Happy Smackah: 2014 recipient still appreciative"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "It has been a little less than a year since Jill Woo Ching was the 2014 Happy Smackah recipient and a 5K race was held in her honor.\nSince the annual Longmont event last May, and a full 16 months since her diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma, life for Woo Ching has been rocky but full of more support than she could've imagined.", "title": "Longmont Happy Smackah: 2014 recipient still appreciative", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27805115/longmont-happy-smackah-2014-recipient-still-appreciative", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0328/20150328__30TCAHAPw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-29T17:36:58-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-03-28T09:53:30-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont Happy Smackah: 2014 recipient still appreciative", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Isa JonesStaff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0328/20150328__30TCAHAPw~3.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-03-29T17:50:58-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29db\"", "article_summary": "It has been a little less than a year since Jill Woo Ching was the 2014 Happy Smackah recipient and a 5K race was held in her honor.\nTo Woo Ching, Happy Smackah is important not just because of the money raised but because of the community support it provides for every recipient.\nWoo Ching hopes that her story, and Haley's, will show people how much an event like Happy Smackah can help.\nWooChing, who has been battling cancer, was last year's Happy Smackah fundraiser recipient.\nBut Woo Ching credits Happy Smackah with giving her a constant sense of hope."}
