She is a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\n\n\"They (the baby and placenta) try to drive the maternal blood sugar up to drive more glucose into the baby to feed the growing baby,\" she said. \"The mother's body balances this with increased insulin and other hormones. When the body is unable to keep up with this, and the maternal glucose becomes out of balance (too high), you have gestational diabetes.\"\n\nThe condition affects approximately 18 percent of pregnancies, according to the American Diabetes Association.\n\nWomen who are obese, older, members of an ethnic group with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and who have a history of gestational diabetes or a family history of diabetes are at increased risk for developing gestational diabetes, according to the USPSTF.\n\nIf left untreated, gestational diabetes can lead to a larger-than-normal baby, which can cause problems for the mother later in pregnancy and during delivery. The baby can also suffer nerve damage from pressure on its shoulders during delivery, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe USPSTF writes in the Annals of Internal Medicine that it found with \"moderate certainty\" that there is a net benefit to screening for gestational diabetes after 24 weeks of pregnancy to reduce complications.\n\nThe new recommendation is an update to a 2008 statement by the panel, which concluded there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against screening.\n\nThe panel still says there is not enough evidence to recommend for or against screening for gestational diabetes before 24 weeks.\n\n\"What's happened between 2008 and 2013 is that there have been several large randomized trials that have found some substantial reductions in pregnancy-related outcomes,\" Nicholson said.\n\nIn the review the panel used as the basis of its recommendation, researchers found there were fewer cases of high blood pressure among pregnant women who were treated for gestational diabetes. There were also fewer larger-than-normal babies and fewer cases of babies' shoulders getting stuck during delivery among those women.\n\nLaCoursiere said women who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes are more likely to develop 2 diabetes later on.\n\n\"It's a glimpse into someone's future,\" she said. \"Maybe it's the window of opportunity that will allow women to change their behavior to avoid type 2 diabetes down the road.\"\n\nTreatment for gestational diabetes includes diet and lifestyle changes. If those fail, medication may be necessary.\n\n\"It gets to the point that nutrition in pregnancy is important and everyone should be following a diet of less ice cream and more vegetables,\" Thornburg said.\n\nScreening for gestational diabetes is covered by insurance under the 2010 Affordable Care Act - better known as Obamacare - according to Nicholson.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/SQRXAa Annals of Internal Medicine, online January 13, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USBREA0C1KC20140113", "sailthru.author": "Andrew M.
