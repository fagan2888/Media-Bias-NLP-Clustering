It stresses the need to \u2018finish the job\u2019 \u2013 both to help people now and as a launch pad for the new agenda.\u201d\n\nThe final parameters of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda will be negotiated by UN member states in the coming months, Ban said.\n\nKeeping Patents in Their Place\n\nPublic funding often subsidizes private sector research, at times leading to the public being priced out of the benefits through disadvantageous licensing and patent \u2013 UN secretary-general\u2019s \u2018synthesis report\u2019 on post-2015 development goals\n\nThe report contains several references to intellectual property rights, calling for them to be applied appropriately for all levels of development and in ways that do not detract from human rights and the public interest. The report urges that member states create a technology platform and technology bank, and observe flexibilities for developing countries under international IP rights trade rules.\n\n\u201cWe live in a period of unprecedented technological innovation and change,\u201d the report says under section 4.2 (p. 33) of the nearly 50-page document. \u201cNew technologies are unlocking possibilities for sustainable development. The solutions they can generate, and the levels of access that they can enable, will be crucial to our vision for the world beyond 2015.\u201d\n\nBut, it says, \u201c[A]ccess to vital and environmentally sound technologies is today unevenly spread, both within and between countries, with the poor and many developing countries essentially locked out.\u201d\n\n\u201cLarge amounts of public resources are allocated to military budgets, while comparatively less is spent on research and development for public goods. Public funding often subsidizes private sector research, at times leading to the public being priced out of the benefits through disadvantageous licensing and patent,\u201d it says. \u201cThis also leads to frequent subsidies of innovations that are not aligned with promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns.\u201d\n\n\u201cA sustainable future will require that we act now to phase out unsustainable technologies, to invest in innovation and the development of clean and sound technologies for sustainable development,\u201d it continues. \u201cWe must ensure that they are fairly priced, and broadly disseminated and fairly absorbed, including to and by developing countries.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeveloping countries, and LDCs in particular, will need the support that will allow them to benefit from enhanced access to these technologies, and, ultimately, to expand domestic innovation and the development of their own technological solutions,\u201d it adds. \u201cHistorically, significant technological advances have often resulted from multistakeholder, solution-driven initiatives. Achieving our sustainable development goals will similarly require solution-driven technology partnerships among a variety of actors.\u201d\n\nThe report calls for establishing \u201ceffective modalities for multi-stakeholder cooperation and sharing the costs for the Research, Development, Demonstration, and Diffusion (RDD&D) for new technologies across all stakeholders: public, private, civil society, philanthropic, and other sectors, and inclusive of indigenous knowledge. We must move to prepare concrete initiatives, including those leveraging technology, ready to launch at the commencement of the new agenda and set bold technological goals and resource mobilization targets.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d it said, \u201cwe must facilitate access to the benefits of technology for all, including the poorest, while ensuring that intellectual property regime creates the right incentives for the technological innovation needed for sustainable development. The urgency is particularly great in the case of low-carbon technologies as part of our efforts to mitigate human-induced climate change.\u201d\n\nNew Technology Platform, Bank\n\n\n\nBan proposed to establish \u201can online, global platform building on and complementing existing initiatives, and with the participation of all relevant stakeholders, in order to: (a) map existing technology facilitation initiatives, needs and gaps, including in areas vital for sustainable development, including agriculture, cities and health; (b) enhance international cooperation and coordination in this field, addressing fragmentation and facilitating synergies, including within the UN system; and (c) promote networking, information sharing, knowledge transfer, and technical assistance, to advance the scaling up of clean technology initiatives.\u201d\n\nHe also called on all member states to \u201c(a) urgently finalize arrangements for the establishment of the proposed Technology Bank and the Science, Technology, and Innovation Capacity Building Mechanism for LDCs, (b) significantly scale up cooperation for the sharing of technologies, strengthening knowledge and capacity building for usage, innovation capacities, including ICTs, (c) make the adjustments necessary in the national and international policy frameworks to facilitate these actions, (d) substantially progress in the development, transfer, and dissemination of such technologies and knowledge to developing countries on favorable, concessional, and preferential terms; (e) ensure that our global intellectual property regimes and the application of TRIPS flexibilities are fully consistent with and contribute to the goals of sustainable development; (f) make specific commitments to shifting public resources out of harmful technologies, and into our sustainable development goals; and (g) promote the accelearation [sic] of the innovation-to-market-to-public good cycle of clean and environmentally sound technologies.\u201d\n\nTRIPS flexibilities refer to agreed flexibilities for developing countries in applying the protections in the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\n\nOn health, the report says, \u201cThe agenda must address universal health-care coverage, access and affordability,\u201d and includes to \u201censure the availability of essential medicines.\u201d It also singles out non-communicable diseases for reduction.\n\nNo Business as Usual\n\n\u201cThis enterprise can therefore not be business as usual,\u201d the synthesis report summarises.\n\n\u201cPeople across the world are looking to the United Nations to rise to the challenge with a truly transformative agenda that is both universal and adaptable to the conditions of each country, and that places people and planet at the center,\u201d it states. \u201cTheir voices have underscored the need for democracy, rule of law, civic space and more effective governance and capable institutions; for new and innovative partnerships, including with responsible business and effective local authorities; and for a data revolution, rigorous accountability mechanisms, and renewed global partnerships. People are also stressing that the credibility of new agenda rests on the means that are available to implement it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that forward-looking companies are taking the lead by transforming their business models for sustainable development, and that we have only scratched the surface of the potential for ethics-driven investment by the private sector,\u201d it says. \u201cWith the right incentives, policies, regulations and monitoring, great opportunities could abound.\u201d\n\nThe document lays out actions taken in the lead-up to the new goals. For instance, it mentions: \u201cIn a series of structured dialogues on technology in the General Assembly, possible arrangements were considered for a facilitation mechanism to promote the development, transfer, and dissemination of clean and environmentally sound technologies.\u201d\n\nIn summary, the synthesis report looks forward with a list of 17 overarching goals:\n\nSustainable development goals Goal 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere Goal 2 End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture Goal 3 Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages Goal 4 Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all Goal 5 Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Goal 6 Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 7 Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Goal 8 Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Goal 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Goal 10 Reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 11 Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Goal 12 Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Goal 13 Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts* Goal 14 Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development Goal 15 Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss Goal 16 Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels Goal 17 Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development * Acknowledging that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.\n\nImage Credits: United Nations", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Intellectual Property Watch", "description": "Last week\u2019s United Nations draft report for the post-2015 sustainable development goals under negotiation calls for continued progress toward sweeping improvements in the lives of all people and th\u2026", "title": "Draft UN Post-2015 Development Goals: Future Must Not Be \u2018Business As Usual\u2019, Including IP Rights", "url": "http://www.ip-watch.org/2014/12/07/un-draft-post-2015-development-goals-future-must-not-be-business-as-usual-including-ip-rights/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2015-Time-for-Global-Action_En.jpg", "height": 683}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-07T16:45:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-08T15:20:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2015-Time-for-Global-Action_En.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ipwatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd011e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNew technologies are unlocking possibilities for sustainable development.\nThe report urges that member states create a technology platform and technology bank, and observe flexibilities for developing countries under international IP rights trade rules.\nNo Business as Usual\u201cThis enterprise can therefore not be business as usual,\u201d the synthesis report summarises.\nWe are a non-profit independent news service, and subscribing to our service helps support our goals of bringing more transparency to global IP and innovation policies.\nIt stresses the need to \u2018finish the job\u2019 \u2013 both to help people now and as a launch pad for the new agenda.\u201dThe final parameters of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda will be negotiated by UN member states in the coming months, Ban said."}
