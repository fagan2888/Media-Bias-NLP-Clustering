There are, however, great risks in the future based on the growth of health exchange products,\u201d Michael X. Repka, MD, AAO medical director for governmental affairs, said in a symposium.\n\nMichael X. Repka\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed by Congress and signed into law in March 2010.\n\nOphthalmology gets much of its revenue from Medicare, with an estimated $5.6 billion from Part B and about $2 billion from Part C this year, according to Repka.\n\n\u201cPart D was simplified for beneficiaries and gaps were closed. So, in fact, better glaucoma eye drop compliance should be the norm,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also noted that ophthalmology gained 14 million new patients in 2014 because of enrollment in health care exchanges.\n\n\u201cMany will have little or no eye disease. There will be little change in age-related macular degeneration and cataract because most of those patients are in Medicare programs. However, children and young adults having trauma or diabetic eye disease should be likely to seek care earlier,\u201d Repka said.\n\nAccountable care organizations (ACOs), which were mandated by the ACA, may or may not affect ophthalmology, Repka said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the impact of ACOs on ophthalmology, frankly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ACA allows for increased fraud protection. Another component, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, required disclosure of industry-physician relationships on Oct. 1.\n\nDisclosure: Repka has no relevant financial disclosures.", "article_metadata": {"site_name": "healiotwo", "description": "CHICAGO &mdash; The Affordable Care Act has had a modest impact on ophthalmology so far, but a few unknown factors remain, an expert said at the American Academy of Ophthalmology meeting here.&ldquo;As for ophthalmology, the impact to date has certainly been less than imagined and less than feared.
