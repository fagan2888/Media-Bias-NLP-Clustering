The photos have both spread awareness of the hardships that come with childhood cancer and reminded people everywhere of strength that comes from friendship. Photographer Lora Scantling captured the image of the three young girls who all share one thing in common; they have been afflicted with some form of cancer. The youngest, Rylie, at age 3 has just won her battle with stage five kidney cancer. In the center, Rheann, age 6, has brain cancer and Ainsley, age 4, has leukemia, according to The Huffington Post.\n\nThree young girls spread hope and inspiration with their photographs. facebook/goodgerphotography\n\nThe young girls never met before the photo shoot but quickly formed a friendship. \u201cThe girls had a lot of fun, I mean it was just very moving watching their bond form,\u201d explained Valeria Franklin, Rheann\u2019s mother, on the televised report. The photographers wanted to bring awareness to the hardships faced by children with cancer every day. \u201cI just wanted something that would just show the bond and the strength, that they weren\u2019t alone,\u201d Scantling told the news team. The message printed on one photograph, \u201cSometimes strength comes in knowing that you are not alone,\u201d brings to light an important aspect of childhood cancer; loneliness. For children with cancer, most of the short lives can be spent in a hospital. They are unable to properly attend school and forming friendships can be difficult. The photographs will hopefully remind other children in the world that they are not alone in their struggle.\n\nScantling Photography and Goodger Photography collaborated to take the photographs, with the help of Penelope\u2019s Children\u2019s Boutique and PJ\u2019s Boutique. According to The Huffington Post, the image has gone viral, with thousands of Facebook users already sharing the powerful photograph.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cancer, children with cancer, photo of children with cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Three young girls from Oklahoma, who are all suffering from cancer, have taken the Internet by storm with their photograph which reminds people that with cancer, there is strength in knowing you are not alone.", "title": "Beautiful Photograph Highlights Struggles Of Childhood Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/three-little-girls-battling-cancer-inspire-many-their-message-strength-numbers-276280", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/sweet-girls.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three young girls from Oklahoma, who are all suffering from cancer, have taken the Internet by storm with their photograph which reminds people that with cancer, there is strength in knowing you are not alone.", "title": "Beautiful Photograph Highlights Struggles Of Childhood Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/three-little-girls-battling-cancer-inspire-many-their-message-strength-numbers-276280", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/sweet-girls.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/12/sweet-girls.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-12T17:21:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-12T17:21:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Three young girls from Oklahoma, who are all suffering from cancer, have taken the Internet by storm with their photograph which reminds people that with cancer, there is strength in knowing you are not alone."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6740\"", "article_summary": "facebook/goodgerphotographyThe young girls never met before the photo shoot but quickly formed a friendship.\nPhotographer Lora Scantling captured the image of the three young girls who all share one thing in common; they have been afflicted with some form of cancer.\nThree young girls spread hope and inspiration with their photographs.\nTruly touching and inspirational photographs of three beautiful little girls have become an internet sensation, touching the hearts of all who see them.\nIn the center, Rheann, age 6, has brain cancer and Ainsley, age 4, has leukemia, according to The Huffington Post."}
