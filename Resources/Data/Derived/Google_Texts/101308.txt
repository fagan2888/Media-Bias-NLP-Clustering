Elections are 'decided by who turns out,' Dewhurst says. Dewhurst to Texas GOP: Don't get complacent

AUSTIN, Texas — Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said here on Saturday that Texas could turn blue if Republicans get “complacent.”

“If we’re complacent, yeah, it could happen,” said Dewhurst, who last year lost to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the state’s GOP Senate primary.

Dewhurst, speaking at the Texas Tribune Festival, said efforts to flip the deep-red Lone Star State to the Democrats probably wouldn’t be successful “today,” but could eventually pan out. The state is home to Battleground Texas, an effort to turn the state blue led by Obama veterans.

Elections are “decided by who turns out,” Dewhurst said. “And increasingly we’re seeing fewer and fewer people turn out for our elections. So if the Democrats get all of their base turned out and our base is complacent, you know, we could have a problem.”

But he offered an unequivocal “no” when asked whether the likely GOP gubernatorial nominee, Greg Abbott, was threatened by Democratic State Sen. Wendy Davis, who looks set to get into the race this week.

“I respect her,” Dewhurst continued. “She’s a bright, hard-working lady.”

Abbott, the state’s attorney general, spoke earlier in the day, offering a defense of Texas’s controversial voter ID law and blasting Obamacare while also saying he aims to get a substantial portion of the Hispanic vote.

Davis is slated to speak on Sunday.
