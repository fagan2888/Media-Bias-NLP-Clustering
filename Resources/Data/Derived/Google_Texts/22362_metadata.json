John Cornyn, R-Texas, is seeking re-election as a \u201cstrong conservative\u201d in a state known to dislike Washington and to be heavily dominated by the Republican Party.\n\nBut observers say he is facing headwinds of his own making this election year.\n\nCritics put it more simply. They say he has undermined his own effort by calling the tea party a \u201cpurity movement\u201d and \u201cexploitative\u201d and by not standing up to President Obama\u2019s agenda to move the nation toward more socialism.\n\nThey even raise questions about his characterization as a \u201cconservative.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why tea party favorite Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, told WND he will challenge Cornyn for his Senate seat. Stockman said Cornyn simply folded when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, launched a Senate fight over the president\u2019s signature socialistic program, Obamacare.\n\nAnd it appears that Stockman\u2019s assessment that Cornyn hasn\u2019t lived up to his billing as a conservative is correct.\n\nCritics say his voting record doesn\u2019t entirely fit the vision of an America with limited government and a free-market economy that encourages innovation and self-reliance.\n\nTea-party advocate Freedom Works blasted Cornyn for his \u201cless confrontational\u201d approach in dealing with Obama, an issue for which House Speaker John Boehner also faced criticism.\n\nIn Boehner\u2019s case, he said, \u201cMr. President, this is your moment. We\u2019re ready to be led not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. We want you to lead not as a liberal or a conservative, but as the president of the United States of America. We want you to succeed.\u201d\n\nWhile many conservatives say plainly they don\u2019t want Obama to succeed in his stated goals, Cornyn took a different approach, more closely aligned with Boehner.\n\nHe told the Texas Monthly: \u201cI would say that I hope we\u2019ll be less confrontational \u2026 The shutdown did not help our cause. What did help our cause was the president\u2019s implementation of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nCornyn said defunding Obamacare is \u201cnot possible\u201d but that it will undo itself.\n\nConstitutional attorney Harold Pease, however, said the Obamacare fight isn\u2019t that complicated.\n\nThe Constitution gives the U.S. House, not the Senate and not the White House, the power of the purse, he said.\n\n\u201cHouse opposition to funding Obamacare would have been far more powerful if made a \u2018stand alone\u2019 bill not attached to general funding, but it is not. \u2018Stand alone,\u2019 having no other parts, would have left the Senate no wiggle or compromise room once it went to them, nor would there be for the Joint Conference Committee thereafter that reconciles any differences between the two houses. There would be nothing to reconcile, Obamacare is merely defunded,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bottom line, however, remains Cornyn\u2019s voting record, which could offer foundation for challenges to his \u201cconservative\u201d claim.\n\nConstitution and civil liberties\n\nRegarding the Constitution and civil liberties, Cornyn has voted five times to approve the indefinite detention of American citizens and the use of military force against American citizens.\n\nIt\u2019s in the National Defense Authorization Act 2011 language, and Cornyn endorsed it, then affirmed it by voting against an amendment clarifying that the language would only apply to noncitizens.\n\nThose votes are in addition to Cornyn\u2019s support of CIA reforms to permit detention and \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation of American citizens. In 2006, Cornyn voted for detention of American citizens without charge or trial by voting \u201cno\u201d on Senate Amendment 5095, Oversight of CIA Interrogation and Detention Amendment. Source: Vote Smart.\n\nThough most Republicans voted for the \u201cindefinite detention\u201d provisions in the NDAA, subsequently telling their constituents that no such provisions exist, federal courts have found the provision do exist and have voided their application.\n\nObama\u2019s attorneys are fighting to have the \u201cindefinite detention\u201d provisions restored.\n\nVideo has been captured of Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain, NDAA sponsors, rejoicing that \u201cfor the first time \u2026 the homeland is part of the battlefield\u201d and that people can be detained without trial, \u201cAmerican citizen or not.\u201d\n\nThere is an apparent contradiction between the claims of some Republicans that \u201cindefinite detention\u201d does not exist and the evident intention of the provision\u2019s authors. Graham, as one of the NDAA sponsors, said from the Senate floor, \u201c1031, the statement of authority to detain, does apply to American citizens and it designates the world as the battlefield, including the homeland.\u201d\n\nBut the Fourth and Fifth Amendments prohibit the federal government from holding citizens without trial or treating citizens as \u201ccombatants,\u201d protections stemming from the British occupation of the American colonies.\n\nFurther, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits use of the U.S. military against citizens or even use within U.S. borders without approval of state governors. The Posse Comitatus Act was enacted after the Civil War \u201creconstruction era,\u201d when Southern states were governed by the U.S. military in a quasi-dictatorship.\n\nCornyn\u2019s office cited a separate vote on another amendment, in which Cornyn did oppose such detention, although he was not opposed to the entire bill.\n\nPatriot Act\n\nCornyn also voted six times to extend provisions of the Patriot Act that have been challenged as unconstitutional by advocates of citizen privacy rights.\n\nObama is empowered by the Patriot Act to define who is and is not a \u201cterrorist\u201d and what is and is not \u201cterror.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s Department of Homeland Security has identified conservatives as potential terrorists. Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee recently joined in filibuster against the Patriot Act and Obama\u2019s widely denounced \u201ccitizen assassination\u201d program.\n\nThe Patriot Act also permits warrantless wiretapping, warrantless entry, human tracking, access to bank statements and phone records, access to Internet records, \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation and more \u2013 all targeted at those designated as \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nThe definition of terrorism is subject to frequent conspicuous change, such as the DHS report labeling pro-lifers or Ron Paul supporters \u201cterrorists.\u201d\n\nCornyn also voted to expand FISA court surveillance powers to include American citizens and to grant immunity to telecoms that shared the protected personal data of citizens with the federal government.\n\nAnd Cornyn voted against proposed amendments that would have published the decisions of FISA and brought transparency to the way the Patriot Act and FISA were being used against citizens.\n\nDemocracy and free speech\n\nAlso, Cornyn voted with Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid to end the historic filibuster, a tradition consistent with the U.S. Senate\u2019s reputation as \u201cthe most deliberative\u201d body in the world.\n\nThe result is that now only 51 senators are required to pass legislation and confirm officers, with no need for minority cooperation. Subsequently, Cornyn voted for \u201cfast track\u201d of presidential \u201cczars,\u201d so that new appointments wouldn\u2019t need Senate confirmation.\n\nAbout money\n\nCornyn also voted in favor of TARP bank bailouts, which on paper cost Americans $500 billion, but in reality cost taxpayers in excess of $1.2 trillion, according to reports by Bloomberg following Freedom of Information Act disclosures.\n\nBloomberg, after substantial litigation, discovered that TARP was known from the outset to be an act of desperation to keep the banks open at a time when the survival of the United States as an economic entity was very much in question.\n\nAt American Thinker, James G. Wiles said Bloomberg\u2019s findings included:\n\nThere were actually six different federal programs to keep the private credit markets functioning with taxpayer money in the fall of 2008, after the private lending markets had shut down.\n\nWhile the public was being told the 10 largest financial institutions had borrowed about $160 billion from the Treasury Department, the public was not told that the same firms were also borrowing $669 billion in emergency funds from the Fed. The borrowers included Morgan Stanley ($107 billion), Citicorp. ($99.5 billion) and Bank of America ($ 91.4 billion).\n\nAlmost half of the Fed\u2019s top 30 borrowers were European firms, not American. This included Royal Bank of Scotland ($84.5 billion) and UBS AG ($77.2 billion).\n\nSeveral big American financial institutions who were trumpeting their liquidity at the time of the crisis were, in fact, relying on secret federal borrowings to keep afloat and avoid insolvency. In some instances, the Fed money provided all of an institution\u2019s available cash.\n\nA few institutions required emergency federal loans to stay liquid well into 2010.\n\nThe TARP bailouts included a $4 billion trust fund allowing grants to ACORN and other activist organizations and requiring everyone in the mortgage industry to submit to a federal fingerprint registry.\n\nCornyn defended his votes on TARP and other bailout measures, saying in 2010,\u201dI\u2019m responsible and proud of the vote I cast at the time because I thought it was a public necessity.\u201d\n\nThe budget\n\nCornyn voted against Rand Paul\u2019s budget amendment, which was said to have been set up to generate a $19 billion surplus without cutting entitlements. Cornyn also voted to increase the federal minimum wage, which has been shown by some studies to cause high unemployment as employers absorb the costs of the wage increase.\n\nAdditionally, Cornyn voted to support the \u201cbridge to nowhere\u201d in Alaska, a highly criticized pork barrel expenditure. He voted in support of the Medicare Part D expansion, adding trillions to unfunded federal liabilities and the national debt.\n\nEnergy\n\n\u201cCap and trade\u201d is an Obama-inspired energy use plan purportedly designed to reduce green house gas emissions from manufacturing as well as more traditional energy sources like coal. Obama told reporters his plan would \u201cbankrupt\u201d the coal sector, which provides half of the energy America uses and more than 80,000 jobs.\n\nCornyn voted for a cloture motion to proceed, effectively advancing \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation. The Heritage Foundation estimated that, if enacted, \u201ccap and trade\u201d would reduce U.S. GDP by $9.4 trillion, increase unemployment by 1-2 million and increase household energy costs by an average of $1,241.\n\nLand use, oil & natural gas exploration\n\nS1813 and roll call vote 32 show Cornyn supported placing more land off-limits to energy exploration, reducing opportunities for domestic production and possibly increasing dependency on foreign energy sources, according to critics.\n\nBorder Security\n\nThe Bush administration attempted to implement a decree from a NAFTA \u201cpanel\u201d which \u201crequired\u201d America to open its roads to an unlimited number of Mexican trucks. Critics contend the Mexican trucks could displace American truckers and pose risks for U.S. security. Cornyn voted in favor of Mexican trucks on American roads.\n\nComprehensive immigration reform\n\nIn 2007, Cornyn voted to give visas to illegal immigrants, considered \u201camnesty\u201d by critics.\n\nThe vote was on the Vitter Amendment, No. 1157, \u201cTo strike title VI (related to Nonimmigrants in the United States Previously in Unlawful Status).\u201d The bill, S. 1348 \u2013 one of the first major attempts at \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d \u2013 contained provisions that included a \u201ccommon security perimeter,\u201d visa waivers for all Mexican and Canadian nationals, tri-national law enforcement cooperation (Mexican and Canadian personnel allowed to exercise jurisdiction in U.S.), the relocation of border enforcement resources to Mexico\u2019s southern border and full mobility of labor.\n\nWND earlier reported that Stockman was anxious to create a challenge.\n\n\u201cWe think he [Cornyn] needs to be held accountable for his decisions, and we look forward to a vigorous campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nCornyn wields considerable power after 10 years in Washington and has been a member of the Republican Senate leadership since 2006. He was chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee for the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. In 2012, he became Minority Whip for the 113th Congress.\n\nOther entries in Cornyn\u2019s record of clashes with conservatives interests include:\n\nHe has worked on plans that would make stronger mental health programs that could be used to restrict veterans\u2019 rights to weapons.\n\nHe voted to raise the debt ceiling eight times, including in 2012 when Congress created a \u201cfake crisis,\u201d according to Freedom Works, and pushed through a deal that raised taxes on three-quarters of America.\n\nHe supported a plan eliminating hundreds of executive positions from congressional confirmation and allowing others to be on a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure to speed Senate confirmation of Obama\u2019s picks.\n\nHe supported confirmation of an anti-gun, pro-abortion ACORN lawyer as a federal judge.\n\nCornyn\u2019s campaign office answered WND, requesting a list of tea party organizations critical of the senator and subsequently claiming that Cornyn did not vote for cloture on the cap-and-trade legislation, citing a Red State article discussing the \u201cBoxer Amendment.\u201d\n\nProblematically, Sen. Cornyn did vote for cloture on S. 3036, the Climate Security Act (cap and trade), his vote on the Boxer Amendment notwithstanding.\n\nAdditionally, a staffer said that Cornyn introduced legislation to end TARP, has called for the FISA court to be reformed to ensure Texans\u2019 4th Amendment rights are protected, and introduced a tough border security bill last spring that would have established mandatory E-Verify and stiffened penalties for hiring illegal immigrants.\n\nThe staffer also said, \u201cThe Boxer amendment was the final Cap and Trade bill, it was an amendment that was substituted in and served as the final legislation, which he did not vote for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Veteran Sen.
