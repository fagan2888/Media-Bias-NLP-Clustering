I come and I talk to people all over,\u201d Carson said.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly why hundreds of supporters came out Thursday. Many of them have been following Carson for over a decade and said the fact that he has no political background is what makes him a great candidate.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of what he has. He has a way to bring America back and be strong and exciting and wonderful again instead of worrying about taking money from people,\u201d Barbara Rickett said.\n\n\u201cHe believes in the Constitution and I believe he is going to make sure that we follow the Constitution, that we take care of our veterans, and that we do what\u2019s right for this country,\u201d Jini Clare said.\n\nCarson is a strong opponent of Obamacare and spoke to his followers about the issue, but another one of his main concerns is veterans affairs.\n\n\u201cThe problem is a lot of veterans, when they go from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs, a lot of them fall through the cracks\u2026We need a system that is smooth that allows them to move from one phase to the other without getting lost,\u201d Carson said.\n\nHe said people are realizing that our country is of, for and by the people, and that it\u2019s important we start making changes.\n\n\u201cThe issues that face us as a nation right now are not regional issues. They are national issues and they have a profound effect on the next generations,\u201d Carson said.\n\nCarson is one of 17 candidates currently running for the Republican nomination. In a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 12 percent of registered Republican voters said they\u2019d vote for him. That puts Carson just behind frontrunner Donald Trump, who has 28 percent of voters\u2019 support.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The race for the White House comes to southern Colorado tonight, as Republican Dr. Ben Carson makes his first campaign stop in our area.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=523660712", "og": {"site_name": "FOX21News.com", "description": "The race for the White House comes to southern Colorado tonight, as Republican Dr. Ben Carson makes his first campaign stop in our area.", "title": "Presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson rallies with supporters in Colorado Springs", "url": "http://fox21news.com/2015/08/27/presidential-candidate-dr-ben-carson-rallies-with-supporters-in-colorado-springs/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvkxrm.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/bencarson.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The race for the White House comes to southern Colorado tonight, as Republican Dr. Ben Carson makes his first campaign stop in our area.", "title": "Presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson rallies with supporters in Colorado Springs", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvkxrm.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/bencarson.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@FOX21News", "site": "FOX21News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Election, Local, News, Politics, Top Video ben carson, presidential candidates in colorado springs Macy Egeland", "msapplication-tooltip": "News and Weather for Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Woodland Park and Manitou Springs", "p": {"domain_verify": "1a5ed99ddcda9e0a2f7946a95eb962e9"}, "fb": {"pages": 228459267608}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.barringtontv.android.kxrm", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox21news.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/4159fe745596f59dc9b5aaab59193f42?s=16", "application-name": "FOX21News.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FOX21NewsColorado", "published_time": "2015-08-28T03:16:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-28T15:15:27+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "0K34_rAAo93gBRvx6nXHAOI4q9iR5z5oVPupgiH4h90", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 12 percent of registered Republican voters said they\u2019d vote for him.\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. \u2014 The race for the White House came to southern Colorado Thursday night, as Republican Dr. Ben Carson made his first campaign stop in our area.\nEven though Carson had to speak to the crowd through a megaphone for awhile, he was able to share a clear message.\nThat puts Carson just behind frontrunner Donald Trump, who has 28 percent of voters\u2019 support.\nCarson is a strong opponent of Obamacare and spoke to his followers about the issue, but another one of his main concerns is veterans affairs."}
