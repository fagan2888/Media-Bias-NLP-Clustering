Louie Gohmert (R-TX) exposed how House Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Majority Whip Steve Scalise strengthened President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty with procedural trickery former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber would envy\u2014and they did it all in the name of pushing a bill that they told Republicans would block Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat\u2019s more is that a series of interviews and recent developments indicate that Boehner\u2019s gambit here is placing several of his top lieutenants\u2014including at least two committee chairmen\u2014at political risk of serious primary challenges just a few months after newly elected Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) beat now former House Majority Leader Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) in a Republican primary.\n\nGohmert said most members had no idea what they were actually voting for when 219 members\u2014216 of which were Republicans\u2014approved a measure, H.R. 5759, first put forward by Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL), but subsequently dramatically altered by leadership officials in the Rules Committee process.\n\n\u201cI was a cosponsor of the original Yoho bill. I thought it was a very decent bill, it was very short\u2014it was only about a page and a half\u2014and it basically said that anything the president did in violation of current law including what he\u2019s done with ordering work permits for people who are illegally here, it\u2019s illegal,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nIt\u2019s outside the constitutional bounds. If you came through the Speaker\u2019s lobby on the way to the House floor as so many people do, there\u2019s tables there in the Speaker\u2019s lobby that have copies of all the official bills we are taking up that day. There was official copies of H.R. 5759 out there\u2014and they were the short page and a half bill that Representative Yoho had originally filed. But the night before there was an amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 5759\u2014what that means is that it\u2019s a new bill. It\u2019s different but it\u2019s going to substitute in its entirety the original bill. It had some of Yoho\u2019s original language in it but they eliminated from the title the word \u201camnesty\u201d and replaced it with \u201cexecutive overreach.\u201d Then they had a bunch of \u2018findings\u2019 that sounded tough that make it clear the president is not authorized to do what he did. Section One is the short title of the bill. Section Two is the findings that got added, which sounded tough. Section Three is the operative section though.\n\nGohmert walked Breitbart News through the text of Section Three of the new bill line by line, explaining how each word fits into the legal patchwork of immigration law before getting to the key additions that were made without notifying many of the members who voted for it.\n\n\u201cThey added another section called \u2018exceptions.\u2019 And the exceptions part says this \u2018shall apply except\u2019 and then there\u2019s three parts,\u201d Gohmert said while reading the actual text of the bill on the phone with Breitbart News.\n\nThe third one is \u201cfor humanitarian purposes where the aliens are at imminent risk of serious bodily harm or death.\u201d That\u2019s what they added. Well, this president has been arguing for months that the things he\u2019s doing is because these people are at imminent risk of serious bodily harm and that\u2019s why he\u2019s doing them. So actually by adding this exception it gives the president for the first time a solid statutory basis to argue that providing those work permits is now legal.\n\nGohmert said that this addition gives President Obama a foot in the door for a legal argument justifying executive amnesty.\n\n\u201cBy adding that exception to the original bill, we would now give the president the statutory authority to do what he\u2019s doing to issue these work permits,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cI know that this language is in there for people claiming asylum and for refugee status, but not ever for providing work permits. But by adding this to this bill that\u2019s supposed to claim his effort to provide work permits is illegal, unconstitutional, and inappropriate, the exception that was added gives him a statutory basis for arguing his work permits are now statutorily allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand that the president issued a veto threat if we were going to pass this, but I think that was to give this bill more credibility after this language was added,\u201d Gohmert added. \u201cI understand Harry Reid said he\u2019s never going to take this up. But if Harry Reid took it and passed it in the Senate, and the president signed it, then I think it gives the president a statutory basis to argue he has the power to issue these work permits now.\u201d\n\nGohmert says that even he doesn\u2019t think that it should be interpreted as such\u2014just that it gives the president something to lean on. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree that this should be interpreted that this exception gives the president the authority to do what he\u2019s done,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is this gives him the argument that it does.\u201d\n\nHowever, Yoho\u2019s office challenges the assertion that this loophole that was inserted into his new bill\u2014which his office does admit was an \u201calternative\u201d bill, different than his original legislation\u2014would give the president such a legal argument.\n\nYoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told Breitbart News that \u201cthat exception already exists under the Executive\u2019s constitutional foreign affairs powers \u2013 Chinese in Tiananmen Square, Cubans in the 1960s, etc.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama is not using a humanitarian argument for his actions; he is citing prioritization and prosecutorial discretion for his legal bases,\u201d Kaveney said.\n\nEven if he were using a humanitarian argument, his actions would not fit these exceptions. Previous presidents simply granted voluntary departure to certain children and spouses to match congressional legislation \u2013 clearly much different than what Obama is attempting to do. Even Obama would have a hard time explaining how 5-8 million people, already here, are under threat of imminent risk of serious bodily harm or death. That exception was specifically written that way to pay respect to the foreign policy powers previously discussed but limit any other wild interpretation.\n\nYoho\u2019s bill is the centerpiece of Boehner\u2019s plan to pass a longterm CR-omnibus strategy that funds Obama\u2019s executive amnesty until at least March 2015, and probably forever.\n\nNationally syndicated radio host Laura Ingraham cut Yoho to pieces in an interview last week in which Yoho had no idea how to explain what he was doing.\n\n\u201cCongressman, you know I like you,\u201d she told him. \u201cWe\u2019ve had you on before. But I\u2019m just going to say it because I say the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Yoho responded.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re getting played here,\u201d she said. \u201cI really do.\u201d\n\nCongressman, you are giving the establishment the cover that they desperately crave because they know America is onto this. We\u2019ve been played for fools before. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for you, we\u2019re going to stop this. Da da da. We have limited ability to do this. We don\u2019t have Congress, we\u2019re gonna wait until January to do this.\u201d Then we find out it\u2019s an omnibus spending bill that funds the whole government until the end of next summer, taking away a lot of opportunity to really hone in on those specifics. So my question here is a simple one, because I think you are one of our real hopes here\u2014I really do.\n\n\u201cWell, I appreciate that,\u201d Yoho interjected.\n\n\u201cIn March, has Boehner guaranteed to you he will pick up where Jeff Sessions left off, because Sessions has the right play here\u2014he knows how to deal with this,\u201d Ingraham asked. \u201cHas he pledged to you he will replace this bill with the Sessions bill?\u201d\n\nYoho ducked in his response. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone that far,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd again, Laura, what we\u2019re dealing with is crisis management up here. Over and over again.\u201d\n\nGohmert said that it was House GOP leadership who made the changes to the Yoho legislation and they did so through the Rules Committee.\n\n\u201cAll I know is that someone from our leadership sent the Rules Committee on Wednesday night, right before the Rules Committee met, emailed them this new version\u2014the new version\u2014of 5759 and so that\u2019s what the Rules Committee took up late the night before, this amendment in the nature of a substitute,\u201d Gohmert said when asked if he knows who made the specific alterations. \u201cI don\u2019t know who specifically sent it to Rules, but this was sent to Rules from someone in our leadership saying this is the new bill, it\u2019s an amendment in the nature of a substitute and this is what we want to come to the floor tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNormally it would be from either the Majority Leader\u2019s office or the Speaker\u2019s office,\u201d Gohmert added when asked which person from GOP leadership would have done this. The Majority Whip Scalise\u2019s role in this, Gohmert said, was whipping votes for the original\u2014not the alternative\u2014Yoho bill.\n\n\u201cWe were being whipped\u2014or asked if we were going to vote for the Yoho bill\u2014a day before they even put this new language, the amendment in the nature of a substitute, up,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cThat went up on the Rules Committee website late on Wednesday night, but on Tuesday they were asking people if they were going to vote for the Yoho bill. They were doing a whip count. They were doing a whip count on the Yoho bill without people even knowing what they were going to be adding to it.\u201d\n\nYoho\u2019s office admits that other congressional offices were involved in the alterations to his legislation, but won\u2019t name names. \u201cA few conservative offices reached out to us regarding wanting to make language more explicit and make sure it statutorily makes sense,\u201d Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney said.\n\nWe also wanted to focus on the fact that this was an overreach. The humanitarian exception was added because given Rep. Yoho\u2019s strong Constitutional views, we did not want our bill to overreach into the foreign affairs powers that presidents have (again, not saying we agree, but these powers have been affirmed by jurisprudence). Without this exception, we risked having a possible constitutional flaw that might have threatened the bill. That was a determination and decision that was made by our office, given Rep. Yoho\u2019s Constitutional principles.\n\nKaveney has not responded to followup requests for comment to say which \u201cconservative offices\u201d were involved in these changes or if those \u201cconservative offices\u201d included anyone from leadership. It\u2019s worth noting that Yoho did vote against Boehner for Speaker at the beginning of the last Congress and may do so again in the future.\n\nKaveney did, however, insist on making clear that Yoho\u2019s original bill was his own creation\u2014and something he took to leadership, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cWe took this bill to leadership. Not the other way around. We are the ones who asked them to bring this on the floor,\u201d Kaveney said.\n\nMembers were not provided the new text of the bill before they were asked to vote on it, either\u2014something that should infuriate Americans, Gohmert said.\n\n\u201cI checked with the clerk before I left the House floor yesterday to see if there were any copies that were made available for members with these new changes on there,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nThe clerk said that they had to make the changes on their own copy but if someone wanted them to make them a copy, they\u2019d certainly make them a copy\u2014but they\u2019d have to leave the floor and go into an adjoining office and make a copy. But the copies that were available did not have these changes in there. If you wanted to see this, you\u2019d have to do it one of two ways\u2014you\u2019d have to know to go the Rules Committee website and download what they actually approved for the House floor very late Wednesday night. The only other way would be to go to the Clerk\u2019s desk there right below the Speaker\u2019s and say you would like a copy not of 5759, but of the amendment in the nature of a substitute. If you asked for the bill, you would get 5759\u2014which we did not vote for. But if you asked for the amendment in the nature of the substitute, you would get the newly penciled language.\n\nWhen asked if this is getting into \u201cyou have to pass it to find out what\u2019s in it\u201d territory\u2014the famous line from then Speaker Nancy Pelosi about Obamacare\u2014Gohmert said, \u201cthat\u2019s what concerns me.\u201d Gohmert said this bill and the recent National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which was packed with legislative pork and federal land grab provisions, are violations of Republicans\u2019 promises to the American people in the wake of Jonathan Gruber\u2019s Obamacare passage.\n\n\u201cThere were not three days for members to review this language,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nThere were not three days to review the NDAA, and I voted against the NDAA because we didn\u2019t know everything that was in it. That\u2019s a big bill and it of course it is very important\u2014and I didn\u2019t have time to read it. It was again provided to Rules Committee the night before, and yes I understand that much of it was work was that done by our Appropriations Committee. I get that. I understand that. But it was not available in sufficient time for anybody who did not help write it to pick it up and read it start to finish before they voted on it. That\u2019s something we promised in 2010: If you give us the majority, we\u2019re going to read the bills and we\u2019re going to give sufficient time for people to read the bills. But as I talked to people on the House floor yesterday and I asked: \u201cDid you read this exception that got added to the Yoho bill?\u201d Most of the people did know there was an exception. [They said,] \u201cno, I\u2019ve read it; there wasn\u2019t an exception.\u201d Well, yes there was an exception. My staff had printed it out for me from the Rules Committee\u2019s website of what they actually approved to go to the floor. I was wanting an actual copy to be made available for members on Thursday, but there were no such copies of the amendment in the nature of a substitute made available to members.\n\nDuring the Rules Committee hearing at which Chairman Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) made the changes to the original Yoho bill via the amendment in the nature of a substitute on behalf of McCarthy and Boehner, Sessions made a crucial mistake during a back-and-forth with amnesty advocate Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL).\n\nIn the hearing, Pete Sessions said that House Republicans \u201cintend to push a bill\u201d in the next Congress that would in effect create a legal open borders situation \u201cthat would operate under the activity of trying to do under rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we would do in the House, move to the Senate, move to the President \u2013 and Mr. [Bob] Goodlatte [the Judiciary Committee chairman] is committed in his job to do the right thing and to work with the Administration,\u201d Pete Sessions said. \u201cBut that, even in our wildest dream, would not be to remove any person that might be here unless they were dangerous to this country and committed a crime; and we would not even \u2013 that was never even in a plan that I thought about.\u201d\n\nA moment later, Pete Sessions further described his plans as pure open borders where anyone who wants to come to America to take U.S. jobs from anywhere in the world can do so. \u201cI\u2019m going to use my assets and resources in the new year to work with this Congress, including [Democratic Rep. Jared] Polis [of Colorado], to have a well understood agreement about what the law should be, and how we as communities, and farm communities, and tech communities create circumstances where we can have people be in this country and work, and where not one person is quote \u2018thrown out\u2019 or \u2018deported;\u2019 where we do keep families together, but what we do is we do so under a rule of law of an understanding,\u201d Pete Sessions said.\n\nPete Sessions, a top ally of Speaker Boehner\u2019s who runs the Rules Committee which has enormous power over the legislative process in the House by setting the terms of debate of legislation on the House floor, survived a primary challenge earlier this year from conservative Republican Katrina Pierson. Pierson, a Tea Party activist and first-time congressional candidate, got into the race a bit late and didn\u2019t have a ton of money\u2014and despite a drubbing in the liberal media over some things from her past, managed to garner 36 percent of the vote in the primary.\n\nVideos that broke via Breitbart Texas in the days right before the primary showed Pete Sessions supports amnesty for illegal aliens so he can \u201caccommodate\u201d them, something Pierson hammered him over. Pierson told Breitbart News in response to Sessions\u2019 latest pro-amnesty and open borders comments during the recent Rules Committee hearing to push through Yoho\u2019s bill that she\u2019s considering another run against him in 2016\u2014something that, assuming she has the funding up front, she could give Sessions a much more organized run for his money this time around.\n\n\u201cIf we have a country left come 2016, and Pete Sessions is still in office, I may consider another run,\u201d Pierson said in an email.\n\nThe plan Pete Sessions said he\u2019ll be backing with all his power seems to be emerging in the House. Reuters on Sunday published an exclusive report detailing how GOP leadership is coalescing behind a plan amounting to amnesty for millions of illegal aliens; it would first start with a border security bill but \u201cmay lead to other steps the House of Representatives could contemplate to repair parts of U.S. immigration law.\u201d\n\nIngraham suggested on her radio program on Friday that Pete Sessions\u2019 stance for open borders as he laid out during that Rules Committee hearing is an indication he may be doing consulting work for Central American nations seeking to send more of their citizens to the United States legally or illegally.\n\n\u201cIs Pete Sessions working with Guatemala and Honduras to bring more people into the country?\u201d Ingraham asked. \u201cYou might as well be. He\u2019s putting a welcome mat for anyone who wants to come into this country illegally today.\u201d\n\nIngraham challenged Pete Sessions to come on her program to discuss his immigration stance, \u201cto see if he\u2019ll have a conversation with me about what they\u2019re planning to do with this immigration reform, what they\u2019re planning to do to sell out American worker.\u201d\n\nWhat House leadership is planning to introduce early this coming week, and to push for a vote on sometime this week, is a plan that funds all of government except for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the end of the 2015 fiscal year in September. It splits DHS funding off into a shorter term bill that ends sometime in March, giving off the impression that the new Republican U.S. Senate and emboldened House GOP majority will fight the funding for Obama\u2019s amnesty then.\n\nEven so, Boehner has not pledged he will fight it then\u2014and most conservatives believe that he will avoid the battle at that time especially after what Boehner\u2019s allies did to get the Yoho bill passed\u2014and the lengths to which Boehner\u2019s lieutenants are going to mislead the Republican conference and the American people about the nature of blocking funding for Obama\u2019s amnesty.\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee chairman Rep. Hal Rogers (R-KY) has been chief among those using the factually incorrect argument that Congress can\u2019t block funding for Obama\u2019s amnesty because the agency that is handling it, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), is funded primarily by fees. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) thoroughly debunked Rogers\u2019 claims that Congress can\u2019t block this funding because of the fee-based structure of USCIS in a report compiled for incoming Senate Budget Committee chairman Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL). But Rogers continues to peddle the falsehood in public more than a week after CRS proved him wrong, telling Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram for an article published late last week that Congress can\u2019t block the funding.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more that I would like to do than defund USCIS,\u201d Rogers claimed to Pergram. \u201cI wish I could but we have to find another way to do what we want to do.\u201d\n\nIngraham has vowed to seek a suitable primary challenger to Rogers in this upcoming election cycle, something that the United Kentucky Tea Party says they\u2019re working on looking for\u2014broken exclusively by Breitbart News then subsequently highlighted by the New York Times. The vows to seek a Rogers primary challenger come after a Breitbart News investigation which discovered his campaign contributor General Dynamics is seeking the contract to print all the work permits, Social Security cards, and other documents Obama plans to give illegal aliens under the executive amnesty, and that the company expects to do so at a facility inside Rogers\u2019 congressional district in Corbin, Kentucky, should it get the contract.\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) is quoted opposite Rogers in Pergram\u2019s piece, noting that Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Reince Priebus promised to block the funding for Obama\u2019s amnesty if voters delivered the GOP the U.S. Senate majority, as they did, and that Boehner\u2019s team said they would fight Obama\u2019s amnesty \u201ctooth and nail.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cRepublican National Chairman Reince Priebus said we were going to do everything we can to fight the president. The Speaker and his spokesman said we were going to fight it \u2018tooth and nail. To defund would be fighting tooth and nail. I can understand going home and saying we tried and it didn\u2019t work. But we have to at least try.\u201d\n\nGohmert said that what the House should do is pass a short-term Continuing Resolution\u2014killing the omnibus appropriations bill altogether\u2014with the language blocking Obama\u2019s amnesty in it. That\u2019s something Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT), the incoming chairman of the Senate Steering Committee, has pushed for too.\n\n\u201cI think we ought to do a short-term CR but include the defund language in it,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we ought to do next week. And when I say \u2018short-term\u2019 I don\u2019t mean March. As you know, the president\u2019s already got a facility in Virginia and is hiring a thousand people to start issuing those permits. This can\u2019t wait until March. We have to do this now. And I do want to mention if this president worked as diligently and faithfully on helping our veterans and helping those trapped in Benghazi as he has rushing in to getting these permits issued for people illegally here, this country would be a lot better off.\u201d\n\nThe Yoho bill was designed to let Republicans \u201cvent their frustrations with President Obama\u2019s unilateral move,\u201d The Hill\u2019s Cristina Marcos wrote, with the goal being it will allow Boehner to tamp down opposition to the omnibus bill from within his own party. Rep. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) said it would less expensive and just as effective for House Republicans to \u201csend the president a Hallmark card saying we don\u2019t like your immigration ideas.\u201d\n\nBoehner knows he may need Democrat votes to pass the omnibus spending bill, and, according to several reports last week, his leadership team met with top Democrats including House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer\u2014Pelosi\u2019s right-hand man\u2014to work out a deal to get Democrats to back the plan. But with this development\u2014that Boehner and his allies substantively altered the cover vote bill in a way that helps the legal argument for Obama\u2019s amnesty\u2014there may be enough Republican opposition that develops in the coming days to derail Boehner\u2019s plans once again.\n\nGohmert notes there are quite a bit of similarities between this fight right now and the fight right before the August recess in the House over whether to send Obama more money for the border crisis or whether to block funding for his first executive amnesty, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\n\u201cThis reminds me of what happened this summer when we had a good group of Republicans who put together the points that we believed in, the principles that we believed in about border security and immigration,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nThey put together some very good principles that we all as Republicans in the House agreed on. Then the Speaker assured everybody that we had a bill getting drafted up that incorporated those principles. I asked to get the name or names of those who were drafting the bill to encapsulate those principles and I was not given the name or names. I expressed concern that it might be the person that Mr. Boehner hired from John McCain\u2019s office who had worked on amnesty for John McCain. I was called down for that. But I knew that the Judiciary Committee which has general oversight over immigration did not do the bill. I knew that the immigration subcommittee did not do the bill. And so I never could find out who actually drafted it. And so they had a Whip Team going around asking people, asking Republicans, \u201cwill you vote for the new border bill that encapsulates all our principles that we agreed to unanimously?\u201d Well, they whipped the bill without anyone ever seeing the bill.\n\nBecause members were telling leadership they would support the border crisis principles\u2014but were unclear what was in the actual legislation\u2014leadership\u2019s plan fell apart hours before the vote. It was Scalise\u2019s first massive failure as Majority Whip because leadership thought they had the votes to pass the bill but, at the last minute, had to cancel the scheduled vote and keep Congress in for an extra day before the August recess.\n\n\u201cSo they had a good whip count on Tuesday of the last week of July without anyone ever seeing the bill\u2014and I didn\u2019t get it until Tuesday night, my staff got it that afternoon,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nI read it that Tuesday night and finished about 2 a.m., then laid down and got back up at 5 a.m. and re-read it and knew that it was as bad as I thought it was the first time I read it. Wednesday was all about trying to let our members know that this bill does not encompass our principles. In fact, it does just the contrary. Once enough people were able to look at it, they said, \u201cwait, I can\u2019t support this. I didn\u2019t agree to that.\u201d Then the Speaker went from having the votes to pass to not having the votes to pass it. We were able to back off and sit down and a number of us cleaned up the parts that were de facto amnesty. By Friday night around 10 p.m., we were able to pass a decent border bill. But this seems a little bit along those same lines\u2014that \u201cgee, we\u2019re going to get people to commit to pass a bill without ever seeing what it is that we\u2019re going to pass.\u201d\n\nAfter the House got together around the conservative bill\u2014from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)\u2014the Democrats melted down entirely on the House floor. The sergeant-at-arms had to remove an unhinged Pelosi, who chased Rep. Tom Marino (R-PA) across the floor of the House, wagging her finger in his face in anger.\n\nYoho\u2019s office even says his bill wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\u201cRep. Yoho would absolutely support legislation that goes after funding,\u201d Yoho\u2019s spokesman Kaveney said. \u201cAgain, we are simply tackling this from a different angle. Everyone was talking about funding. Rep. Yoho wanted to try something different. In addition to, not instead of.\u201d\n\nWhile it remains to be seen what exactly will go down, Gohmert said the Democrats will likely come even more unhinged than Pelosi\u2019s midsummer performance if Republicans buck Boehner\u2019s CR-omnibus strategy next week.\n\n\u201cIf we do what we should next week, and stand firm on our convictions, we might get to see former Speaker Pelosi chase Tom Marino and maybe someone else up the aisle,\u201d Gohmert joked at the end of the interview.\n\nIn the meantime, Senator-elect Tom Cotton (R-AR)\u2014currently a House GOP member\u2014is urging Americans to burn down Congress\u2019s phone lines in the effort to blow up Boehner\u2019s plans to back Obama\u2019s amnesty.\n\n\u201cCall your Congressman and call your Senator,\u201d Cotton said on Ingraham\u2019s radio program on Friday.\n\nI assure you having been in the Congress that Congressmen and Senators listen when the people they serve, their bosses, are calling them and asking them to vote in a certain way.

In 2007, there were reports that the Capitol switch board actually stopped working because so many people called, and asked their Senators and Congressmen to stop an amnesty bill going through at the time, and it stopped. And it helped in 2013 when the House was on the verge of considering something like the Gang of Eight bill in the Senate, so I would encourage you to call your Senator, call your Congressman next week and in the new year.\n\nAnd on Fox News on Sunday, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)\u2014the incoming chairman of the Budget Committee\u2014said that \u201cthere is no way\u201d any members of the House or Senate will be able to actually read \u201cthis huge bill\u201d when leadership introduces it. Leadership has been keeping the omnibus secret until now and, still as of Sunday evening, hasn\u2019t introduced it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be thousands of pages passed maybe Monday night in the House,\u201d Sessions said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive: House GOP Leaders Trick 216 House Republicans into Accidentally Supporting Obama's Executive Amnesty", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive: House GOP Leaders Trick 216 House Republicans into Accidentally Supporting Obama's Executive Amnesty", "title": "Exclusive: House GOP Leaders Trick 216 House Republicans into Accidentally Supporting Obama's Executive Amnesty - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/boehner-door-walking-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-11-03T13:07:05-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/07/exclusive-house-gop-leaders-trick-216-house-republicans-into-accidentally-supporting-obama-s-executive-amnesty/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive: House GOP Leaders Trick 216 House Republicans into Accidentally Supporting Obama's Executive Amnesty", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/boehner-door-walking-ap.jpg", "title": "Exclusive: House GOP Leaders Trick 216 House Republicans into Accidentally Supporting Obama's Executive Amnesty - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-12-07T16:00:41-07:00", "categories": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-11-03T13:07:05-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe11\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere\u2019s going to be thousands of pages passed maybe Monday night in the House,\u201d Sessions said.\n\u201cI was a cosponsor of the original Yoho bill.\nGohmert said that this addition gives President Obama a foot in the door for a legal argument justifying executive amnesty.\nIn 2007, there were reports that the Capitol switch board actually stopped working because so many people called, and asked their Senators and Congressmen to stop an amnesty bill going through at the time, and it stopped.\n5759 out there\u2014and they were the short page and a half bill that Representative Yoho had originally filed."}
