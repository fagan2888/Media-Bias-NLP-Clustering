Bloomberg has the money and the opportunity; we know he wants a seat at the policy table.\n\nIn a recent piece, The New York Times says that the former New York City mayor is involving himself in the editorial activities of Bloomberg LP. The Grey Lady sounds concerned, and rightly so. Just as Mr. Bloomberg won unlikely election as mayor of a heavily Democrat city by skipping through the political middle, he could also steer Bloomberg\u2019s news operation in between the left-leaning Times and right-sided Dow Jones, ending up where a great many Americans reside. It would be a fitting and satisfying next step for the successful financier and politician, who is clearly not ready to retire.\n\nThe Times is vulnerable to a well-heeled competitor \u2014 and especially one well established internationally, online and on television \u2014 the latter a forum the NYT has never successfully penetrated. Bloomberg, a private company, racked up more than $8 billion in revenues last year, and earned nearly $3 billion in profit. That\u2019s compared to a little more than $2 billion in revenues for the Times, and about $150 million in profit. While the vast majority of Bloomberg sales (and nearly all its profit) comes from its data terminal business, which is currently in stall mode, those gizmos favored by Wall Street traders have funded the growth of a substantial news organization.\n\nHow substantial? In a recent piece by Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan, Executive Editor Jill Abramson extols the paper\u2019s \u201chuge\u201d 1,250-person newsroom staff, noting that it is twice that of the Washington Post's. Bloomberg\u2019s news division has more than 2,000 editorial employees.\n\nBut, it\u2019s not all about numbers. It is also about positioning. The New York Times has become more liberal over time, derided on the right these days as a virtual mouthpiece for the Obama White House. The paper has not endorsed a Republican for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956; the nod has gone to the Democrat candidate in every election since.\n\nIt\u2019s not just those on the right that see the paper as tilting left \u2014 former ombudsman Daniel Okrent wrote a farewell piece in 2004 describing the paper as slanted liberal, especially on topics like gay marriage. As he said, rather gingerly, \u201cOn a topic that has produced one of the defining debates of our time, Times editors have failed to provide the three-dimensional perspective balanced journalism requires.\u201d He noted that the paper unintentionally tends to \u201ctell only the side of the story your co-religionists wish to hear,\u201d but adds that \u201cnegligence doesn't have to be intentional.\u201d\n\nAnother departing public editor, Arthur Brisbane, made a similar confession as he exited the paper a year and a half ago. He admitted \u201cthe hive on Eighth Avenue is powerfully shaped by a culture of like minds,\u201d a \u201ckind of political and cultural progressivism\u201d that leads to \u201cdevelopments like the Occupy movement and gay marriage\u201d being treated \u201cmore like causes than news subjects.\u201d And, this is from the inside.\n\nRelated: The Media Got the Pope\u2019s Comments on Capitalism Wrong\n\nThe Times\u2019 progressivism doesn\u2019t match up well with attitudes of most Americans. The Left celebrated a recent Gallup poll showing an all-time high in the number of people identifying themselves as liberal. The record made headlines and overshadowed the reality; only 24 percent of those surveyed call themselves liberal, way below the 38 percent that call themselves conservative and the 34 percent who are self-proclaimed moderates. Liberalism may have inched up, and is surely running high in New York City, but it\u2019s still a distinct minority across the country.\n\nA minority that The Times taps into, leaving the vast political middle of the country open for grabs \u2014 an opportunity Mr. Bloomberg may intend to seize. The Times reports that instead of taking vacation, the former mayor has been showing up at 7:30 am editorial meetings of Bloomberg LP, apparently expressing opinions about which stories interested him.\n\nThe Times claims that employees of Bloomberg LP are \u201cworried\u2026that the division\u2019s editorial independence could be called into question.\u201d The piece scolds that \u201cGenerally, the owners of news organizations try to avoid any appearance of influencing coverage, particularly when they have political affiliations.\u201d\n\nIs it Bloomberg employees who are wary, or is it the editorial staff of The New York Times? Hard to know, since, as is its custom these days, The Times quotes an employee who \u201cspoke on the condition of anonymity.\u201d Adding a little zest, the writer notes that at a recent meeting between Mike, as he is called, and the staff of BusinessWeek, someone asked if he might be interested in buying The New York Times. Mr. Bloomberg joked that he would not, \u201cpartly because he would not be able to influence the coverage.\u201d He\u2019s got that right; hives are not welcoming.\n\nShould Mike take a hands-off approach to his eponymous news operation? It\u2019s hard to see why he should. Mike Bloomberg has built a multi-billion business, and has served three terms as a much-respected mayor of New York City. Surely his views are as reasonable and informed as those of The Times\u2019 Executive Editor Jill Abramson, who has never worked outside the media sphere and who spent an entire year writing about the \u201cchallenges and satisfactions\u201d of raising her Golden Retriever puppy.\n\nThe integrity of a news operation stems not from the background of the people directing the gathering and reporting of news, but rather from their objectivity. Mr. Bloomberg doubtless carries his views on gun control and sugary beverages into his newsroom visits; if he bends Bloomberg News in a particular direction \u2014 that will be par for the course these days.\n\nThe media is not objective. In a Pew poll, some 76 percent of those surveyed said that news organizations \u201ctend to favor one side\u201d and 58 percent described those outfits as politically biased. More generally, two-thirds of the country thinks that the media covers trivial stories, and is chronically inaccurate. There is indeed an opportunity here; to the dismay of The New York Times, and other competitors, Mr. Bloomberg may well seize it.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Is Mike Bloomberg the next William Randolph Hearst, a tycoon who mixes media and polit", "title": "Will Bloomberg Challenge The New York Times?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/01/22/Will-Bloomberg-Challenge-New-York-Times", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/Bloomberg%20at%20City%20Hall.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/01/22/Will-Bloomberg-Challenge-New-York-Times", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/Bloomberg%20at%20City%20Hall.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Is Mike Bloomberg the next William Randolph Hearst, a tycoon who mixes media and polit", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b11\"", "article_summary": "In a recent piece, The New York Times says that the former New York City mayor is involving himself in the editorial activities of Bloomberg LP.\nThere is indeed an opportunity here; to the dismay of The New York Times, and other competitors, Mr. Bloomberg may well seize it.\nThe New York Times has become more liberal over time, derided on the right these days as a virtual mouthpiece for the Obama White House.\nMr. Bloomberg joked that he would not, \u201cpartly because he would not be able to influence the coverage.\u201d He\u2019s got that right; hives are not welcoming.\nMr. Bloomberg doubtless carries his views on gun control and sugary beverages into his newsroom visits; if he bends Bloomberg News in a particular direction \u2014 that will be par for the course these days."}
