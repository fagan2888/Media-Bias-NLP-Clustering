Several of the candidates missed their cues to get on stage and head to their podiums, creating a traffic jam in the wings.\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson paused after his name was called, and soon was joined by Trump backstage. Marco Rubio did hear his cue, and gently pushed his way past to get in front of the cameras.\n\nThe Trump-Carson backup resolved, the candidates took their places. Then someone noticed Ohio Gov. John Kasich hadn't been called.\n\n\"The applause \u2014 you couldn't hear; we couldn't hear, either. That's a good sign for the excitement this evening,\" the moderator air-guitared as the candidates got settled. \u2014 Celeste Katz\n\n2. Cruz and Carson tussled over the Cruz campaign's \"dirty tricks\" in Iowa.\n\nCruz and Carson sparred over the Cruz campaign's decision to transmit the message on Iowa caucus night that Carson was set to withdraw from the race and that the retired neurosurgeon's supporters should caucus for Cruz. Carson, of course, has yet to quit the race. Asked about the controversy by moderator David Muir, Carson noted that the candidates were meeting on the 105th anniversary of Ronald Reagan's birth, and that the 40th president's \"11th commandment\" was \"not to speak ill of another Republican.\" \"So I'm not going to use this opportunity to savage the reputation of Sen. Cruz,\" Carson went on. \"But I will say that I was very disappointed that members of his team thought so little of me that they thought that after having hundreds, if not thousands of volunteers and college students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause, one even died, to think that I would just walk away 10 minutes before the caucus and say, forget about you guys \u2014 I mean, who would do something like that?\" Source: YouTube Resorting to such tactics, Carson continued, \"gives us a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics.\" Cruz used the opportunity to apologize \u2014 and explain himself. \"When this transpired, I apologized to him then and I do so now,\" the Texas senator said. \"Ben, I'm sorry.\" Cruz went on to say that his campaign chose to tell Iowans Carson was withdrawing based on media reports that Carson was to take a break from campaigning after the caucuses. \"Ben's campaign [later] put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign,\" Cruz said. \"I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it, I wish that they had. That's why I apologized.\" \u2014 Luke Brinker \"Ben's campaign [later] put out a statement saying that he was not suspending his campaign,\" Cruz said. \"I wish that our campaign staff had forwarded that statement. They were unaware of it, I wish that they had. That's why I apologized.\" \u2014\n\n3. Rubio came under fire from Christie for his accomplishments in the Senate. After Sen. Marco Rubio made remarks talking about how the length of time spent in Washington shouldn't be overvalued, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie went for his jugular. Source: YouTube \"You have not be involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable. You just simply haven't,\" Christie said. \"And the fact is \u2014 when you talk about the Hezbollah sanctions act that you list as one of your accomplishments, you weren't even there to vote for it. That's not leadership. That's truancy.\" When Rubio struck back at Christie's record as governor of New Jersey, mentioning how the state's credit rating has been downgraded repeatedly during his tenure, Christie accused Rubio of repeating overly rehearsed debate remarks. \"This is what Washington, D.C., does: the drive-by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorized 25-second speech that is exactly what his advisers gave him,\" Christie said. \"Marco, the thing is, when you're president of the United States, when you are a governor of a state, that memorized speech doesn't solve one problem for one person.\" Christie then went on to repeatedly push the point that Rubio's responses as being scripted and meant to distract attention from a senate record lacking major legislative accomplishments. \u2014 Zeeshan Aleem 4. The candidates reacted to the launch of a North Korean missile. Source: Mic/Getty Images With the debate taking place shortly after a reported rocket launch by North Korea, the candidates were given the opportunity to say how they would respond to the incident as commander-in-chief. Cruz would not commit to launching a pre-emptive strike on North Korea's launch pad, saying he'd need to be more fully briefed by intelligence agencies, although he did use the occasion to slam the Obama administration's nuclear deal with Iran, arguing that it pointed to the danger of emboldening bad actors. Rubio said that existing U.S. procedures ensured any \"errant\" missile could be shot down before it posed a threat to the U.S. or its allies, while Kasich vowed to be \"tough\" and said he would support North Korean foe Japan in taking action to shoot down a missile. Meanwhile, Bush railed against the Obama administration's foreign policy as a failure, saying that he would support the use of preemptive strikes if necessary. Trump broke with the pack, arguing that it was the duty of China, a North Korean ally, to resolve the problem. \u2014 Luke Brinker 5. Cruz offered some inflated statistics to argue how easy it would be to deport undocumented immigrants. When Cruz was asked to explain the practicality of deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, who number around 11.3 million in the U.S., he made reference to his \"11-page, single-spaced\" policy document on the matter. But when he described deportations under previous presidents, he employed some misleading statistics. Source: JEWEL SAMAD/Getty Images \"I would note that in eight years, Bill Clinton deported 12 million people, in eight years, George W. Bush deported 10 million people, enforcing the law. We can do it,\" Cruz said. But the real numbers aren't quite so large. According to a fact check by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, there are two ways to measure how unauthorized immigrants leave the country, and by both measures, Cruz's numbers are off. In terms of \"removals\" \u2014 compulsory and confirmed departure of unauthorized immigrants based on order of removal, there were about 681,000 people removed during Clinton's time in office and about 1.65 million during Bush's tenure. There are also \"returns\" \u2014 confirmed movement out of the U.S. not based on an order of removal. \"In other words, a return occurs when an apprehended immigrant leaves the U.S. voluntarily before being ordered to do so through a formal removal proceeding,\" according to the Annenberg fact check. But by this definition, still the numbers are smaller than Cruz's \u2014 around 9.7 million returns during Clinton and 7.5 million under Bush. \u2014 Zeeshan Aleem 6. On health care, Trump said he would keep people from \"dying on the streets\" as president.\n\n\"We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better, and there are so many examples of it, and I will tell you part of the reason we have some people laughing [is] because you have insurance people that take care of everybody up here. The only one they're not taking care of is me,\" Trump said. Trump didn't actually go into any details on how he'd replace the Affordable Care Act, however, opting for a more menacing theme instead. \"There will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying, and as a Republican, I don't want that to happen. We're going to take care of people that are dying on the street, because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else, and we're going to take care of those people,\" Trump expounded. \"And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree: You're not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street, in any city in this country.\" \u2014 Celeste Katz 7. Rubio trotted out a tired myth about how the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world. Rubio blamed wage stagnation in the economy on tax rates in the U.S., but in order to make the point he rolled out a common conservative myth about how the corporate tax code works. \"We have an economy today that is not creating jobs that pay enough, and one of the reasons why is because we have one of the most expensive business tax rates on the planet,\" Rubio said. The reality is that while the U.S. does have a very high statutory corporate income-tax rate, due to a special combination of corporate subsidies, loopholes, benefits and the relative size of the economy, the effective rate is in fact similar to the the rest of the developed world. Setting aside the fact that Rubio's intention of connecting wage stagnation to corporate tax rates was not clearly argued, the claim that a high corporate tax rate in the U.S. is uniquely damaging to the business world's ability to retain profits just isn't true. \u2014 Zeeshan Aleem 8. Trump doubled down on bringing waterboarding back, which Cruz said isn't torture.
