Gattuso and Diane Katz noted. \u201cPrescriptive\u201d rules increase burdens on individual or private-sector activity.\n\nThe 184 prescriptive rules introduced by the Obama administration since 2009 is estimated to be nearly $80 billion a year, \u201calthough the actual cost of this massive expansion of the administrative state is obscured by the large number of rules for which costs have not been fully quantified,\u201d they wrote.\n\nWashington\u2019s hidden tax: $1.9 trillion to comply with federal rules and regulations. http://t.co/HA7w6SKX7U \u2014 Steve Forbes (@SteveForbesCEO) May 12, 2015\n\n\"This appears to be unparalleled with any prior administration, and that total dollar figure is from about 184 major rules,\" Katz told OneNewsNow.com. \"Now, I caution that that $80 billion figure is a pretty low estimate because the administration has failed in many rules to actually calculate the cost as they're supposed to do.\"\n\nThere are still an additional 126 economically federal rules and regulations in the pipeline, such as \u201cdirectives to farmers for growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables; strict limits on credit access for service members; and, yet another redesign of light bulbs,\u201d Gattuso and Katz wrote.\n\nThe authors looked through the Government Accountability Office\u2019s Federal Rules Database , and discovered that the Obama administration has issued twice as many major, prescriptive rules in its first six years as the 76 that George W. Bush administration did during the same time period. The costs of Obama\u2019s regulations \u2012 an estimated $7.4 billion \u2012 were cheaper than Bush\u2019s \u2012 about $8.9 billion \u2012 but they noted that the cost calculations were incomplete for a dozen of the rules created in 2014. On top of the annual costs, there were also one-time implementation costs for the federal regulations, bringing the Obama administration\u2019s total bill to $17 billion.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which regulates securities and the banking system, and the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, were the biggest reasons for the increasing red tape coming out of Washington, DC, according to Gattuso and Katz.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) took a different approach to study the federal regulatory state. The libertarian think tank\u2019s annual \u201cTen Thousand Commandments\u201d report surveys the size, scope and cost of federal regulation, as well as how the federal government affects US consumers, businesses and the overall economy.\n\nFederal regs are hidden tax; cost U.S. $2 trillion in lost productivity http://t.co/89UFr4q7CR@WashTimes@ceidotorgpic.twitter.com/eHXNWCrxng \u2014 Jennifer Harper (@harperbulletin) May 12, 2015\n\nThe CEI report \u201cshines a light on the large, growing 'hidden tax' of America\u2019s regulatory state,\u201d the think tank said in a statement. It added up what the regulations cost the US in terms of economic productivity and higher prices, which totaled an estimated $1.88 trillion in 2014, or 11 percent of the US gross domestic product of $17.4 trillion.\n\n\u201cIf it were a country, US regulation would be the world\u2019s tenth-largest economy, ranking behind Russia and ahead of India,\u201d CEI Vice President for Policy Wayne Crews, the author of the study, wrote.\n\nThe costs were significant on American households, too, which shelled out nearly $15,000 last year \u2012 or about 29 percent of the average family\u2019s budget of $51,100 \u2012 due to federal regulations.\n\nThese rules come about after Congress passes laws, leaving the details up to the various federal administrations, which then create the regulations. Crews believes that the legislative branch should require expedited votes on economically significant or controversial rules before they go into effect, creating a principle of \u201cno regulations without representation.\u201d\n\n\"Congressional rather than agency approval of regulations and regulatory costs should be the goal of reform. When Congress ensures transparency and disclosure and finally assumes responsibility for the growth of the regulatory state, the resulting system will be one that is fairer and more accountable to voters,\" Crews wrote in the report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans are increasingly trapped by the Obama administration\u2019s bureaucratic red tape, and it\u2019s costing the economy billions of dollars, according to two new reports from right-leaning think tanks.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "Americans are increasingly trapped by the Obama administration\u2019s bureaucratic red tape, and it\u2019s costing the economy billions of dollars, according to two new reports from right-leaning think tanks.", "title": "Red tape and hidden taxes: Federal regulations cost US economy billions", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/3f/14/10/00/heritage-cei-federal-regulations-reports.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/258369-heritage-cei-federal-regulations-reports/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "Americans are increasingly trapped by the Obama administration\u2019s bureaucratic red tape, and it\u2019s costing the economy billions of dollars, according to two new reports from right-leaning think tanks.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/3f/14/10/00/heritage-cei-federal-regulations-reports.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) took a different approach to study the federal regulatory state.\nWashington\u2019s hidden tax: $1.9 trillion to comply with federal rules and regulations.\nOn top of the annual costs, there were also one-time implementation costs for the federal regulations, bringing the Obama administration\u2019s total bill to $17 billion.\n\u201cPrescriptive\u201d rules increase burdens on individual or private-sector activity.\nThese rules come about after Congress passes laws, leaving the details up to the various federal administrations, which then create the regulations."}
