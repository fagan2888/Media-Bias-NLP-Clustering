GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS: One investment jargon that always gets me is “proprietary” techniques or strategies. Whenever I see it my antenna goes up to be even more cautious for hidden and high fees that usually accompany underperforming investments. It is better to steer clear to avoid unpleasant surprises. If you don’t understand it, you should not invest in it. With so-called proprietary techniques you are not even being allowed the courtesy of understanding it, which I find absurd by itself.

Another one is “absolute return” funds. Isn’t it great to never lose any money by having these managers work their magic, often with (you guessed it) “proprietary” techniques to always produce positive returns? Well, the record has been mixed.

Perhaps it has to do with the fact that these funds have high fees and are tax-inefficient due to their frequent trading. I see these funds as mostly marketing creations that preyed on investors’ fears that the world is about to end again like it almost did back in 2008. Let’s see how many of these funds are still around five years from now.
