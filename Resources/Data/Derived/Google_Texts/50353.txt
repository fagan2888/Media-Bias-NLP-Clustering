Spotlight on… Russell Westbrook, guard, Thunder

When: Two weeks ago, Russell Westbrook returned to the Oklahoma City Thunder’s lineup after missing 14 games because of a hand injury. He wasted no time having an enormous impact on the Thunder’s future. His big week for the evaluation period of Dec. 6-12 makes him The Denver Post’s NBA player of the week.

What’s up: In four games, the UCLA product averaged 27.5 points, 7.3 rebounds, 7.0 assists and 1.5 steals. He shot 52.6 percent from the field, and had a plus-9.0 rating. Led by Westbrook — and Kevin Durant — the Thunder won all four games.

Background: Staying on the court this season had been a struggle for Westbrook, who started the season having overcome a knee injury but then suffered a broken hand just minutes into the second game. A month later, he returned. Now he looks as strong, quick and explosive as the NBA has known him to be.

Dempsey’s take: One of the funnier moments of Oklahoma City’s season occurred Thursday, before a game against Minnesota, when Thunder coach Scott Brooks was briefed on the comparisons of Westbrook and Timberwolves rookie Zach Lavine. “I used to have to defend him,” Brooks said of West- brook. “Now, everyone wants to be Russell.” Westbrook has been on fire since returning to the court. He has always been the ultimate blend of speed and size at point guard.
