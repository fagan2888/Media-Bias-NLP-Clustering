So it\u2019s resorted to a form of Calvinball, attempting to change the rules mid-stream to escape its predicament.\n\nRelated: Argentina Defaults for Second Time in 12 Years\n\nThe thing is, Argentina is kind of allowed to play Calvinball; it\u2019s a side benefit of being a country. By definition, sovereign nations get to make up their own laws and even alter them on a whim. If they don\u2019t want to obey the dictates laid down by other countries or international norms, there\u2019s only so much the international community can do about it.\n\nWhich is why expecting U.S. courts to unilaterally delineate Argentina\u2019s payment schedules was predictably impossible. They should have never inserted themselves in the first place into what is little more than a hedge fund\u2019s moneymaking scheme. And Argentina\u2019s response, however unorthodox and bizarre, might even help the U.S. economy, in a cock-eyed way.\n\nHere\u2019s the story so far: Due to fiscal mismanagement, Argentina defaulted on its debt obligations in 2001. The successor government negotiated a deal, where bondholders would take a significantly reduced payment. About 92 percent of the country\u2019s creditors accepted this as the least-worst result, and Argentina has not missed a payment to them since then.\n\nRelated: Argentina Aims to Skirt U.S. Law\n\nHowever, a few rogue hedge funds, led by Paul Singer\u2019s Elliott Capital Management, started buying up Argentine debt at a severe discount, in a bid to make some easy cash by using U.S. courts to force Argentina to pay full value on the bonds. This activity is properly described as the work of \u201cvulture funds,\u201d who hover over failing companies or countries and try to profit off their suffering.\n\nAfter years of legal wrangling, the vultures found a judge willing to enforce their terms. Judge Thomas Griesa ordered Argentina\u2019s bond trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, to withhold payment to the bondholders that accepted the deal until the vulture funds got paid. The Supreme Court declined to take the case, letting Griesa\u2019s ruling stand. Failing to reach agreement with the vultures and unable to pay its bondholders, Argentina slipped into default on July 31.\n\nArgentine President Christina Fernandez Kirchner then made the startling announcement that she would ask the country\u2019s legislature to approve a scheme to fire Bank of New York Mellon and service debt through a local account at Banco de la Naci\u00f3n in Buenos Aires. This way, debt payments would not be governed by U.S. law and not subject to the court order. Bondholders who want their money, in effect, would have to go to Argentina and get it. They would have to voluntarily swap their bonds issued under U.S. law with the new Argentine bonds, which the government could pay immediately.\n\nAn ocean of questions accompanies this scheme. First of all, Bank of New York Mellon would have to agree to cancel the old bonds when bondholders agree to the new terms; otherwise you would have two sets of bonds floating around. Given Bank of New York Mellon\u2019s obligations under U.S. law, Judge Griesa (who has already described the debt swap as illegal) could hold them in contempt for abetting a countermand of his ruling. In fact, the bondholders may be liable to a charge of violating the judge\u2019s order if they try to collect their payments in Argentina.\n\nRelated: The Perfect Storm Rocking World Markets\n\nThe fact that prices on Argentine bonds collapsed, for the first time since default, upon the announcement, testifies to the deep skepticism over it.\n\nThis may all may be a political move by Kirchner to dare her opponents to vote against the plan, effectively aligning themselves with an unpopular U.S. ruling and an even more unpopular vulture fund. But the larger message from the Argentine government is that it will plainly not accede to the demands of another country\u2019s court and hand over full-value payment to the vulture funds. Argentina believes that payment would make it liable to future claims from all of its bondholders for more money. Already the country has no presence in international debt markets, so it cannot operate as leverage. And it sees fighting the order as a better option for its nation and its economy than agreeing to it.\n\nU.S. courts, as well as the plaintiffs, don\u2019t have much recourse to deal with such defiance. They do not have control over how another country manages its affairs. As proof of the frustration, a group of Wall Street banks have attempted to buy out Elliott and its colleagues, with the idea of negotiating with Argentina to settle the matter. Elliott has overplayed its hand against an opponent who doesn\u2019t much care about the consequences.\n\nThat\u2019s why Judge Griesa should never have gotten involved. As Georgetown law professor Adam Levitin explained weeks ago, Griesa bungled into this case without having any way to bind Argentina to his dictates. Griesa can actually only make the situation worse, by preventing payment; he cannot mandate it, as long as Argentina doesn\u2019t want to pay. The bonds may be governed by U.S. law \u2013 but Argentina is not. Courts should and typically do shy away from such intractable situations, especially when they\u2019re intervening on behalf of a vulture fund that fully knows the risks of trying to extract profits from distressed debt.\n\nThere\u2019s a larger lesson here. Under Judge Griesa\u2019s precedent, no bondholder would have any incentive to accept less than full payment no matter the situation, a crippling scenario for sovereigns or even corporations trying to survive the process of renegotiating their debt. Bankruptcy and debt renegotiation are normal alternatives that would be cut off if any creditor can simply get a judge\u2019s ruling to force payment.\n\n\u201cNo credit system has ever functioned with zero default,\u201d explains Jayati Ghosh, economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in India. \u201cThe ruling actually negates the basic principles upon which all credit markets function.\u201d\n\nBut if vulture funds like Elliott face huge problems with trying to get sovereign nations to pay up, even when they get a favorable legal ruling, maybe they won\u2019t see it as such a worthwhile enterprise. That would be positive. It would restore the primacy of debt renegotiation as a tool in all contracts. It would allow for markets to price risk with an interest rate instead of with whatever legal argument they can make.\n\nAnd as certainty beats uncertainty where payments are concerned, it makes for a better economy in the future. Creditors will feel more comfortable to lend if they know that they may take on some risk, but that they won\u2019t get their payments caught in a hedge fund-led game of cat-and-mouse.\n\nArgentina\u2019s gambit can reasonably be described as crazy. But sometimes, crazy can work wonders.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If Argentina were in a high-stakes chess match, the country\u2019s actions this week would", "title": "Why Argentina\u2019s Crazy Debt Gambit Could Make Sense", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/08/22/Why-Argentina-s-Crazy-Debt-Gambit-Could-Make-Sense", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08222014_Argentina_Kirchner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/08/22/Why-Argentina-s-Crazy-Debt-Gambit-Could-Make-Sense", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/08222014_Argentina_Kirchner.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ddayen"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "If Argentina were in a high-stakes chess match, the country\u2019s actions this week would", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f20\"", "article_summary": "Failing to reach agreement with the vultures and unable to pay its bondholders, Argentina slipped into default on July 31.\nThis activity is properly described as the work of \u201cvulture funds,\u201d who hover over failing companies or countries and try to profit off their suffering.\nJudge Thomas Griesa ordered Argentina\u2019s bond trustee, Bank of New York Mellon, to withhold payment to the bondholders that accepted the deal until the vulture funds got paid.\nHere\u2019s the story so far: Due to fiscal mismanagement, Argentina defaulted on its debt obligations in 2001.\nFor three weeks, Argentina has been in default, unable to pay the holders of its sovereign debt because of a U.S. District Court ruling."}
