Of late, Kreidler has been openly critical of the state\u2019s botched efforts to make repairs to the online insurance exchange.\n\nBut Kreidler remains a champion of the effort to make universal health care a reality, and Washington has taken some meaningful steps in that direction. The state has reduced the number of uninsured residents by roughly 38 percent since it expanded who is eligible for Medicaid and opened a new insurance marketplace in October 2013.\n\nShortly before the kick off of the second health-insurance open enrollment period on Saturday, we spoke with Kreidler about health-care reform. Here\u2019s what he had to say.\n\nThe case for greater transparency\n\nKreidler is undeniably a supporter of the health-care overhaul, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from publicly raising concerns about technology problems plaguing the state\u2019s online insurance exchange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do a disservice if I portray it as perfect,\u201d Kreidler said.\n\nWhile Kreidler oversees insurance issues for the state, a separate organization called the Washington Health Benefit Exchange runs the Healthplanfinder marketplace.\n\nSince the launch of the exchange more than a year ago, the site has struggled to resolve various technical troubles, the knottiest being the transfer of premium payment information. Consumers are paying their premiums, but the information and funds aren\u2019t always being accurately transferred to the insurance companies, so it appears the people are uninsured, creating a nightmare for affected patients, doctors and insurers.\n\n\u201cThis is something that should have been resolved early,\u201d Kreidler said. But the problem still wasn\u2019t fixed by the time the exchanges opened for enrollment on Nov. 15.\n\nA key to solving the problem, Kreidler said, is for the exchange to have a more robust system for tracking consumer complaints to help them identify systemic problems more quickly.\n\nBefore enrollment opened, the exchange said roughly 1,300 accounts had payment problems, but insurance companies have claimed it\u2019s more than 10 times that number. And from June to October, consumers lodged more than 500 complaints with the Office of the Insurance Commissioner regarding problems with their premiums, though the OIC is helpless to fix them.\n\n\u201cI feel very strongly that you have to be open and transparent and you can\u2019t sweep things like this under the rug,\u201d Kreidler said, \u201cor your credibility will be diminished.\u201d\n\nThe health of the exchange\n\nPutting some of the technical challenges aside, \u201cI\u2019m pleased with the success the exchange has had,\u201d Kreidler said. \u201cWe\u2019re still doing much better than anyplace else in the country. We\u2019re doing remarkably well.\u201d\n\nThe updated Healthplanfinder website should provide a better shopping experience for customers, he said, making it easier to compare plans and figure out which ones cover specific medicines and doctors. Customers can more readily see what their out-of-pocket expenses will be.\n\nBut it\u2019s essential that the website fix the remaining technical problems and reach sales goals to stay afloat. The exchange is required to be self-sustaining beginning in January, and its funding depends on selling enough plans through Healthplanfinder.\n\nHealth insurance plans are taxed, and for plans sold through the exchange, that money is given back to Healthplanfinder. Additionally, the exchange is charging insurance companies a $4 fee or \u201cassessment\u201d for each plan sold.\n\nIn addition to individual insurance plans, the exchange has for the first time a statewide marketplace for businesses employing 50 or fewer people, called Healthplanfinder Business. But only two insurance companies are offering plans through the exchange, and in most counties only Moda Health is selling coverage.\n\nBy the start of open enrollment, roughly 140,000 people had coverage through the exchange, and the agency hopes to sign up 85,000 more in the individual market by Feb. 15 when the enrollment period ends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still optimistic\u201d the exchange will continue growing and meet its goals, Kreidler said.\n\nA bigger stick in 2015\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires nearly all Americans to have insurance \u2014 and wields a penalty for those who do not. In 2014, the penalty was fairly modest: whichever was larger \u2014 1 percent of a household\u2019s adjusted income or a flat $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, up to a certain level.\n\nThis year the stick is bigger. Uninsured Americans in 2015 will be penalized 2 percent of their adjusted income or $325 per adult and $162.50 per child (there are some exceptions to who can be penalized). A single person earning $40,000, for example, would get hit with the 2 percent and owe nearly $600.\n\nKreidler expects the threat to start having a more meaningful effect.\n\n\u201cThere is a psychological part of this,\u201d Kreidler said. While insurance will still cost more than the penalty, at least people would be getting the benefits of coverage.\n\nPeople will think, \u201cI\u2019d rather get something for my money rather than just throwing my money away,\u201d he said. \u201cMore and more people will begin to recognize the benefits.\u201d\n\nLooming threats to the ACA\n\nThe Republican\u2019s success in the midterm elections and the announcement that the U.S. Supreme Court will consider a case challenging a key ACA provision are raising new questions about the future of the health-care overhaul.\n\nKreidler is less concerned about what the Republican lawmakers can do to unravel the act, but the Supreme Court troubles him.\n\nThe court earlier this month agreed to hear a case asserting that the ACA allows only state-run exchanges to provide tax subsidies that lower the cost of health insurance based on one\u2019s income. Only 13 states plus Washington, D.C., have state-run exchanges, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The remaining 37 are federally supported or facilitated, or a state-federal partnership.\n\nWhile Washington\u2019s Healthplanfinder is one of the state-run exchanges, that doesn\u2019t mean it would be insurance-business-as-usual should the court find the subsidies in federal exchanges illegal, Kreidler warned.\n\n\u201cOn paper it doesn\u2019t impact us, but in practice it does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have potentially very profound implications.\u201d\n\nWithout the subsidies to lower the monthly premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs for millions of Americans, it would be nearly impossible to enforce the requirement that nearly everyone needs to have insurance coverage. And if the insurance mandate dissolved, the whole market would be disrupted.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear when the system might become so entrenched \u2014 like Medicare or Social Security \u2014 that the public wouldn\u2019t stand for its dismantling from the court or Congress.\n\n\u201cThere have been some significant benefits with a reduction in the number of people who are uninsured, a decline in the amount of charity care in this country,\u201d Kreidler said. \u201cTo all of a sudden to throw a curve ball in this late stage, would be difficult for the court to do.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be going back to a system that had significant problems.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Washington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler grabbed national attention last year when he broke with President Obama's efforts to mollify a public upset by canceled insurance plans.
