A 2-year certification costs $169.\n\nThe group's president, Paul Teirstein, MD, chief of cardiology at the Scripps Clinic in San Diego, has been a critic of maintenance of certification (MOC).\n\nTeirstein recently penned a piece in the New England Journal of Medicine enumerating MOC's pitfalls. He is also the creator of two web-based anti-MOC petitions that thousands of physicians have signed.\n\nOther board members hail from Harvard, Columbia, the Mayo Clinic, the University of Massachusetts, and New York University.\n\nCommenters on the board's site are voicing support.\n\nBut Westby Fisher, MD, an interventional cardiologist in Evanston, Ill., and another vocal MOC critic, was more cautious. He noted that the NBPAS process does not meet Affordable Care Act requirements, which determine eligibility for physician incentive payments by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nApplication requirements for NBPAS certification include:\n\nPrevious ABMS certification\n\nA valid, unrestricted medical license in at least one U.S. state\n\nCompletion of at least 50 hours of continuing medical education in the past 2 years, or completion of 100 hours for physicians with lapsed certification\n\nActive hospital privileges for certain specialties (including interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, and critical care)\n\nHere are some previous installments of MOC Watch:\n\nThere's no sitting on the fence when it comes to revised maintenance of certification (MOC) rules. This blog gathers MOC-related news and opinion to foster discussion on what has happened since January 2014, when the American Board of Internal Medicine adopted the requirements -- and what is likely to happen in coming months.\n\nHave a tip or want to counter a point?
