Chris Christie’s advised Jersey voters to “elect a new President” in order to fix Obamacare.

“He’s just dead wrong on this,” the New Jersey governor said of Obama’s health care reform, addressing a crowd on Tuesday in Toms River, N.J., at his 112th town hall.

Most of the discussion at the event, Christie’s third of his second term, was dedicated to frustrations over the bureaucracy of Sandy relief, but at the end, the outspoken politician couldn’t help but deliver some straight talk on the Affordable Care Act.

Christie blamed Washington elites who are trying to act smart.

"It’s about being for what works and against what doesn't."

The Republican is returning to his roots with a marathon schedule of town halls, allowing him to engage face to face with Jersey voters amidst national attention on his Bridgegate scandal.

Jersey residents have so far abstained from grilling the governor over the scandal, instead sticking to state issues, though the Republican insisted “you’re free to ask me anything.”

Admitting that leading the Garden State can be tough at times, Christie told the crowd there’s “no job in the world I would rather have than this one.”
