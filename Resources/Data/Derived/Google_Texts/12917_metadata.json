Prime had said it would assume $300 million in pension liabilities and invest $150 million in capital improvements at the facilities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd with the Daughters chain losing $150 million a year on low reimbursement rates and labor costs, Prime officials called the deal \u201cfar and away the best offer for the hospitals.\u201d\n\nThat offer included a promise to keep the Daughters hospitals open at least another five years, assume $300 million in pension costs and a multimillion-dollar investment in the chain\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nBut it was a massive proposed transaction, and subject to Attorney General Kamala Harris\u2019 approval while drawing scrutiny from the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, which argued the sale was not in the workers\u2019 best interests. The union also leaned on past experience, when Harris in 2011 blocked attempts by Prime Healthcare to purchase Victor Valley Community Hospital in Victorville.\n\nThe saga had pitted two unions against each other. The California Nurses Association/National Nurses United had backed the sale to Prime Healthcare, while SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West opposed it but approved Harris\u2019 conditions, calling the long list \u201ca victory for community health.\u201d\n\nIn February, after consultant reviews, hours and hours of public meetings and thousands of public comments, Harris gave the sale a conditional OK.\n\nAmong those conditions was that they be carried out over 10 years.\n\nThey also included:\n\n\u2022For 10 years, must be certified to participate in the Medi-Cal and Medicare programs and have or maintain Medi-Cal managed care contracts at each of the facilities.\n\n\u2022 Invest $150 million in capital improvement expenditures at the facilities over the next three years.\n\n\u2022 Continue to provide charity care and community benefits at historical levels.\n\n\u2022 Assume and guarantee all pension obligations covering about 17,000 current and retired employees.\n\n\u2022 Revise its policies, tools, procedures, guidelines and training materials for its debt-collection practices to ensure it does not violate state and federal debt-collection laws and regulations.\n\nIn a two-page statement Tuesday, calling the conditions \u201conerous\u201d and \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Prime said maintaining all services for a decade was akin to running the chain the way Daughters had but \u201cexpect different results.\u201d\n\nThat couldn\u2019t be done, Prime officials said.\n\nHarris on Tuesday chided Prime in a statement, saying that the initial recommendations of the 10-year conditions came in December, and Prime was notified at the time.\n\n\u201cPrime is choosing to walk away from this transaction after publicly stating that it had no issue with the 10-year conditions and intended not to close any of the hospitals or end essential services,\u201d she said. \u201cBy walking away, Prime is confirming many of the concerns heard at multiple community meetings that the continuity of vital healthcare services in these communities is not a priority.\u201d\n\nIssai\u2019s chain now faces a difficult decisions, though on Tuesday he emphasized the brighter side.\n\nOptions include filing for Chapter 11, but Issai said after Daughters of Charity is released from its exclusivity with Prime, other buyers may be interested.\n\n\u201cOur assets and liabilities are better now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe picture looks slightly better.\u201d\n\nIssai would not discuss which health systems are considering buying them.\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act has helped Daughters of Charity make up some of the losses, particularly those in low-income areas, to recoup some payment, since many of the patients they see have since qualified for Medi-Cal, he said.\n\n\u201cCalifornia (Medi-Cal) reimbursements are low,\u201d he said. \u201cBut any reimbursement is better than none.\u201d\n\nAssemblyman Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood), said in a statement he believes there is a buyer for the hospitals.\n\n\u201cI look forward to engaging with all stakeholders to identify a buyer that will continue to provide much-needed patient care to our underserved communities,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bid was the largest hospital transaction ever reviewed by the California Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nBay Area News Group Staff Writer Tracy Seipel and Los
