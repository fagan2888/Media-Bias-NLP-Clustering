The Supreme Court was substantially more popular with those on the political left than those on the political right, according to polling ahead of last week’s historic decisions on gay marriage and health-case subsidies.

Ahead of Thursday’s decision that affirmed important parts of the Affordable Care Act and Friday’s making gay marriage a constitutional right, the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed strong positive feelings about the court among self-described Democrats, liberals and 2012 Obama-voters.

One especially sharp divide: The court had a strong net positive among liberal respondents – 51% positive vs. just 20% negative. But among conservatives, the feelings about the Court were essentially neutral – 30% positive and 30% negative.

The split carries through other partisan divides as well, including a difference between Republican primary voters (35% have positive feelings about the Court) and Democratic ones (49% have positive feelings).

A couple thoughts on what this means for 2016:

First, even before last week’s big rulings, conservatives weren’t terribly happy with the court– so Republican presidential candidates’ pitches on the importance of appointing conservative justices may have particular resonance with primary voters.

Second, justices don’t always vote in line with the politics of the president who appointed him or her — so you better get insurance. Thursday’s ACA breakdown was 6-3 tally, a tally that included two Republican appointees; the 5-4 2012 ruling upholding the ACA included one GOP appointee; as did Friday’s 5-4 ruling backing gay marriage.
