Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.) is going on the attack against primary challenger Weston Wamp the day after allegations surfaced about Wamp's campaign finances.

In a pair of TV ads shared first with The Hill, Fleischmann hits Wamp, the son of former Rep. Zach Wamp (R-Tenn.), over comments the 27-year-old venture capitalist made supporting a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and slamming him as a “showhorse” on the trail.

It’s a critical final stretch for the two ahead of their Aug. 7 rematch, with early voting beginning in the Volunteer State this weekend.

“Crisis,” which starts airing Friday on Knoxville broadcast and cable, begins with images of Central American children at the southern border, saying “Illegal immigrants [are] flooding into the U.S. while President Obama does nothing.

A second spot, “Work,” airing on Chattanooga broadcast and cable, slams Wamp’s unorthodox approach on the campaign trail, saying “some guys talk about why they’re so great” and “do silly things to get attention,” pointing to an RV he purchased for his campaign.

“These sort of fellas are showhorses. To fight Washington, we need a workhorse. We’ve got one in Chuck Fleischmann,” the narrator says. “Public service isn't about famous last names or looking cool — it’s about the country’s future.”
