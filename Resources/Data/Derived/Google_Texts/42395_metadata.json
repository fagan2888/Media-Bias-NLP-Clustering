Kay Hagan has her Republican opponent right where she wants him geographically \u2013 and, therefore, politically.\n\nThom Tillis is stuck at the state capitol trying to resolve a budget quarrel as speaker of the North Carolina House. It\u2019s a spot that helps Hagan emphasize Tillis\u2019 role leading a Republican-controlled state government that Democrats contend has gone overboard with conservative zeal by restricting access to abortion and the voting booth while cutting corporate taxes and slashing spending on schools.\n\nIf Tillis is worried by Hagan\u2019s portrayal, he doesn\u2019t show it. Drinking coffee this past week from a hand-grenade-shaped mug in his no-frills legislative office, he\u2019s got his own message in his campaign to take Hagan\u2019s Senate seat. \u201cObamacare,\u201d he said, \u201ccontinues to be a big problem.\u201d\n\nSimilar themes are playing out in other crucial Senate races, as voters have four months to decide which party will control the chamber in the final two years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. For Republicans, it\u2019s all about tying Democrats to Obama \u2013 especially to a health care law that remains unpopular with many Americans. And for Democrats, the election is about just about anything else, especially if they can steer attention away from Washington and federal matters.\n\nIt\u2019s a political strategy that sometimes gives the campaigns an inside-out feel, with veteran senators running as if they were first-timers without a Washington resume to defend or tout.\n\nDemocrat Mark Pryor has represented Arkansas in the Senate for two terms, yet one of his TV ads begins with a man saying, \u201cI remember when Pryor was attorney general.\u201d A woman adds that he pursued \u201cscam artists that were ripping off seniors.\u201d\n\nPryor was state attorney general more than a decade ago, and for just four years, compared to his nearly dozen in the Senate. His harkening back to that time points to his desire to make the election a choice between a famous name in Arkansas state politics and first-term Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican whom many view as less personable and engaging than Pryor.\n\nThe GOP strategy, in return, is straightforward. One TV ad has a young girl spelling Pryor\u2019s name as O-B-A-M-A.\n\nTraditionally emphasized by first-time campaigners, personal biographies are central to several other Democrats\u2019 re-election campaigns. Alaska Sen. Mark Begich has aired a TV ad with footage of him as a boy of about 10, when his father, Rep. Nick Begich, died in a plane crash. \u201cMark is clearly his father\u2019s son,\u201d says the narrator, Begich\u2019s wife, Deborah Bonito.\n\nAnd after 18 years in the Senate, Democrat Mary Landrieu is arguably the most accomplished member of her famous Louisiana political family. Still, she has aired an ad in which her father \u2013 former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu \u2013 says affectionately: \u201cWhen you have nine children, you\u2019re bound to have one who\u2019s hard-headed.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats might say the same about the GOP\u2019s strategy of bashing \u201cObamacare\u201d now that the Affordable Care Act is 4 years old. Not Tillis, who says Obama and Hagan exaggerated the extent to which people could keep their doctors and insurance plans. He calls it \u201cthe greatest example of a promise not kept.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s getting help with the message from Crossroads GPS, the political group run in part by Republican strategist Karl Rove, which is spending more than $3.5 million on television ads in North Carolina this summer. The group\u2019s latest ad attacking Hagan asks whether voters know she \u201ccast the deciding vote for Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea that this will be anything less than a referendum on Obamacare is wishful thinking,\u201d said Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C.\n\nThe amount spent on the Hagan-Tillis race \u2013 about $17 million and climbing \u2013 is among the nation\u2019s highest. It comes in a state that few can rival for political change in recent years, as Republicans ended a century of frustration by winning control of both legislative chambers and the governor\u2019s office in 2012.\n\nWhat came next is a \u201cconservative revolution\u201d that Tillis said he\u2019s proud of leading. Hagan and her fellow Democrats argue the Republicans went too far in a state so closely divided politically that Obama carried it in 2008 and lost it four years later. They believe a bump in teacher pay that Tillis promises lawmakers will enact this summer won\u2019t erase North Carolinians\u2019 memories of the deep cuts to education that Republicans passed last year.\n\nThat approach, said Rep. David Price, D-N.C., is Hagan\u2019s best chance to focus November voters\u2019 attention on something other than Obama. Her strategy \u201cis exactly what she should do,\u201d Price said, because Tillis \u201chas got that hung right around his neck.\u201d\n\nHagan, meanwhile, points to achievements close to home. They include her push to provide medical care to military families exposed to tainted water for decades at Camp Lejeune, the giant Marine Corps base in eastern North Carolina.\n\n\u201cKay Hagan,\u201d said veteran North Carolina GOP strategist Paul Shumaker, \u201cis hoping the sins of Raleigh are much bigger than the sins of Washington.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For Republicans, it's all about tying Democrats to Obama - especially to a health care law that remains unpopular with many Americans.
