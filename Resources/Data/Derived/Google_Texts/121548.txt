When asked [relevant exchange begins around 5:15] how Republicans counter the perception that they’re only good at opposing things, Jindal stated, “we’re for a lot of things. I’m the only one with a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare without a new entitlement plan. We’ve proposed a very bold tax plan that lowers taxes.”

Jindal was then asked about fellow GOP candidate Donald Trump’s plan, to which Jindal responded, “his plan is for government to pay for everybody’s healthcare. And the problem with that is government then tells you what to eat, how to live your life.”
