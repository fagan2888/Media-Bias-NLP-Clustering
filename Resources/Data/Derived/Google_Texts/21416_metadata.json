She said some work remains to be done outside on the project.\n\nMarling said the university wants, and needs, more residence halls, including expanding to the Gainesville campus.\n\nBut that requires approval from the Board of Regents and years of planning work. While she said some master planning is under way, a timeline for future building has not been set. There are no \u201cimmediate plans\u201d for other housing projects, she said.\n\nThe University Commons is a new venture, a public-private partnership with the Corvias Group, she said.\n\nShe said it required approval from the Board of Regents and a lease between UNG and the company. The university owns the land and leases it for 60 years to the company. Corvias owns the building and operates it, Marling said.\n\nMarling noted the agreement with Corvias is the first one of its kind. \u201cWe were the first round,\u201d she said.\n\nStudents will pay their residence bills to Corvias, she said. The company does the maintenance and UNG will \u201cstaff the buildings.\u201d\n\nThe new buildings are \u201csuite style\u201d with two bedrooms and a common area, she said.\n\nMarling said Corvias also operates Owen Hall on the UNG campus, taking it over in July 2015.\n\nUNG has had a policy requiring students to live in residence halls until they get 60 credit hours, which is through their sophomore year. However, \u201cwe have not had the capacity to meet that internal policy. \u2026. Students have been given waivers.\u201d\n\nEven with the new buildings, UNG will not be able to accommodate all the freshmen and sophomores in residence halls, she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/115974/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2016/03/29/UNG4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A new residence hall for the University of North Georgia\u2019s Dahlonega campus should be ready for students when school starts for the 2016-17 year.", "title": "New UNG dorm should be ready for fall semester"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "New UNG dorm should be ready for fall semester"}, "article_summary": "Students have been given waivers.\u201dEven with the new buildings, UNG will not be able to accommodate all the freshmen and sophomores in residence halls, she said.\nUNG has had a policy requiring students to live in residence halls until they get 60 credit hours, which is through their sophomore year.\nMarling said the university wants, and needs, more residence halls, including expanding to the Gainesville campus.\nShe said it required approval from the Board of Regents and a lease between UNG and the company.\nA new residence hall for the University of North Georgia\u2019s Dahlonega campus should be ready for students when school starts for the 2016-17 year."}
