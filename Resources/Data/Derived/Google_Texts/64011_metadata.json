It also states there were 1,007 overdose fatalities in 2013, compared to 1,004 identified in the 2012 report.\n\nAs recently as 2011, only 3 percent of the 1,023 overdose deaths in Kentucky were attributed to heroin.\n\nSPECIAL REPORT: Read about the heroin problem, treatment and legislative efforts\n\nThe Courier-Journal reported on the same trend in May as part of continuing coverage on the state's drug problems. Experts pointed out that the numbers may actually underestimate heroin overdose mortality, since many deaths ascribed to morphine are likely overdoses from heroin that has metabolized in the victim's body.\n\nThe newspaper investigation also found that the number of heroin trafficking charges in Louisville went from a single inmate in 2011 to 53 in 2012 and 71 in 2013, and 100 from January to May this year. And it found that heroin addicts are straining agencies across Kentucky, filling jails, courts and treatment centers.\n\nAll of this has been fueled by a state crackdown on prescription drug abuse \u2013 although state officials said that's not the sole factor and they have no intention of curbing their battle against pill abuse.\n\nOf the overdose deaths autopsied by the Kentucky Medical Examiner's Office in 2013:\n\nMorphine was the most detected controlled substance in overdose deaths, present in 43.49 percent of all autopsied cases.\n\nAlprazolam was next at 34.76 percent, followed by 6 monoacetylmorphine (heroin) at 31.9 percent, hydrocodone at 24.79 percent, and oxycodone at 19.94 percent.\n\nDr. Tracey Corey, Kentucky's chief medical examiner, noted that many of the cases reported as morphine may in fact involve heroin.\n\nThe youngest overdose fatality was 18 years old, and the oldest was 78 years old.\n\nThe numbers, contained in the 2013 Overdose Fatality Report, were compiled from the Kentucky Medical Examiner's Office, the Kentucky Injury Prevention & Research Council and the Kentucky Office of Vital Statistics. The report was mandated under by state legislation passed in 2012.\n\nLast year's report reflected Kentucky residents who died of a drug overdose regardless of where the death occurred; this year's report counts overdose deaths that occurred in Kentucky, regardless of where the decedent was from.\n\nThe law also mandated more stringent reporting requirements for deaths caused by overdose, which went into effect midway through 2012. As a result, drug policy leaders had anticipated that numbers for 2013 \u2013 the first full year of the more rigorous standards \u2013 would be significantly higher.\n\n\"I'm encouraged that even with the more demanding reporting stipulations, we appear to be holding steady, which tells me we may have crested in terms of overdose deaths,\" Van Ingram, executive director of the Office of Drug Control Policy, said in the agency's news release.\n\nIngram said the report contains known overdose deaths as of mid-July, 2014, and that a small number of overdose deaths for 2013 may still be reported as death certificates from county coroners are turned in to the Office of Vital Statistics. For comparison purposes, the 2012 Overdose Fatality Report indicated 1,004 deaths; by the end of 2013, the final number of overdose deaths for 2012 was 1,070.\n\nOther findings\n\n\u2022 Jefferson County had the most overdose deaths of any county, with 191.\n\n\u2022 The largest increase in overdose fatalities occurred in Fayette County, with 86 deaths in 2013 compared to 74 in 2012.\n\n\u2022 The largest decrease occurred in Campbell County, with 22 fewer fatalities in 2013 than in 2012 (33 vs. 55, respectively).\n\nTop heroin ODs\n\n\u2022 Jefferson County, 105\n\n\u2022 Fayette County, 35\n\n\u2022 Kenton County, 34\n\n\u2022 Boone County, 22\n\n\u2022 Campbell County, 16\n\nHighest rates\n\nOverdose deaths in many Eastern Kentucky counties, when compared by 100,000 population, 2013 data, showed high rates. The top 6 counties by overdose deaths per 100,000 people for 2013 include:\n\n\u00bb Bell County \u2013 93.2 per 100,000\n\n\u00bb Clinton County \u2013 49.3 per 100,000\n\n\u00bb Breathitt County \u2013 44.3 per 100,000\n\n\u00bb Floyd County \u2013 43.9 per 100,000\n\n\u00bb Perry County \u2013 42.8 per 100,000\n\n\u00bb Harlan \u2013 42.1 per 100,000\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1ndwfnn", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Heroin overdose deaths in Kentucky continued to surge in 2013 though the number of all drug overdose fatalities stayed steady, according to a report issued Thursday by the Office of Drug Control Policy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Heroin overdose deaths in Kentucky continued to surge in 2013 though the number of all drug overdose fatalities stayed steady, according to a report issued Thursday by the Office of Drug Control Policy.", "title": "Heroin deaths keep rising in Kentucky", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/08/02/heroin-deaths-keep-rising-kentucky/13504281/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Heroin overdose deaths in Kentucky continued to surge in 2013 though the number of all drug overdose fatalities stayed steady, according to a report issued Thursday by the Office of Drug Control Policy.", "creator": "@courierjournal", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b127ef6bdeca0a7997ada31f1919c35b81de662/c=354-0-1769-1415&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/drugsheroin.jpg", "title": "Heroin deaths keep rising in Kentucky", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d2e7a85b4bd063ace2090d89aef4eda2bd238488/c=530-0-1591-1415/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/drugsheroin.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a558841cd04604e9c406ed906d857f468d720123/c=354-0-1769-1415/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/drugsheroin.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/783f79c3c51247259b4a1260c31b76e17fb630a5/c=118-0-2005-1415/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/drugsheroin.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/98e708b1a7434219c8813e5d7127d62cc2e72c14/c=0-110-2122-1304&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/drugsheroin.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-02T03:12:35.923000-04:00", "shorthed": "Heroin deaths keep rising in Kentucky", "articleid": 13504281, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff08101970c9b392424972bf0f5861a9adca4d8f/c=0-110-2122-1304/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/drugsheroin.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ffc67a26470f393546dbef23c1b70abee17b3153/c=663-0-1459-1415/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/08/02/drugsheroin.jpg"}, "author": "From staff and Kentucky Press News Service reports", "title": "Heroin deaths keep rising in Kentucky", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea0c\"", "article_summary": "As recently as 2011, only 3 percent of the 1,023 overdose deaths in Kentucky were attributed to heroin.\nOf the overdose deaths autopsied by the Kentucky Medical Examiner's Office in 2013:Morphine was the most detected controlled substance in overdose deaths, present in 43.49 percent of all autopsied cases.\nThe numbers, contained in the 2013 Overdose Fatality Report, were compiled from the Kentucky Medical Examiner's Office, the Kentucky Injury Prevention & Research Council and the Kentucky Office of Vital Statistics.\nExperts pointed out that the numbers may actually underestimate heroin overdose mortality, since many deaths ascribed to morphine are likely overdoses from heroin that has metabolized in the victim's body.\nFor comparison purposes, the 2012 Overdose Fatality Report indicated 1,004 deaths; by the end of 2013, the final number of overdose deaths for 2012 was 1,070."}
