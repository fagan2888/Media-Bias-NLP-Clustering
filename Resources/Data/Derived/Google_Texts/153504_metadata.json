We lost five to 10 centimeters of snow over the last couple of hours. Incredible how fast it goes.\u201d\n\nTemperatures were expected to drop again, but another storm has been forecast for Sunday afternoon, prompting FIS to bring forward the starting time of the super-G by 15 minutes to 11 a.m. (1000 GMT).\n\nAn even earlier start wasn\u2019t possible due to other televised events, including the opening run of a men\u2019s World Cup slalom in Adelboden, Switzerland.\n\nAn overnight storm blew away parts of the safety fencing along the course and ruined booths for TV and radio commentators as well as a temporary stage for the winner\u2019s ceremonies, public bib draws and concerts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty brutal,\u201d Skaardal said. \u201cThe storm came in at 5.30 a.m. and destroyed everything within two hours. The local organizers are very motivated to fight for Sunday\u2019s race. We have to build up everything again and must see what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nThe super-G could be Lindsey Vonn\u2019s next chance to match the all-time record of 62 women\u2019s World Cup wins by Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria.\n\n\u201cFinally I figured out this downhill course and we have a wind storm\u2026 ugh. Race is canceled. (hashtag)badtime,\u201d Vonn tweeted. \u201cHopefully (Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo) can pick up the canceled DH from today. Would really love another race there. One of my favorites!\u201d\n\nSimilar storms occurred when the World Cup last visited Bad Kleinkirchheim in 2012.\n\nThe safety netting along the course was blown away, prompting the cancellation of the final training run though the races went ahead as planned.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Strong winds cancel women\u2019s World Cup downhill in Austria", "title": "Strong winds cancel women\u2019s World Cup downhill in Austria", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/10/strong-winds-cancel-womens-world-cup-downhill-in-austria/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110_115955_world-cup.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110_115955_world-cup.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-10T11:55:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:12:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One of my favorites!\u201dSimilar storms occurred when the World Cup last visited Bad Kleinkirchheim in 2012.\nAn even earlier start wasn\u2019t possible due to other televised events, including the opening run of a men\u2019s World Cup slalom in Adelboden, Switzerland.\nBAD KLEINKIRCHHEIM, Austria \u2014 Organizers were rebuilding the infrastructure at a women\u2019s World Cup course after a storm destroyed the finish area and the safety fencing, forcing the cancellation of a downhill on Saturday.\n\u201cUnfortunately the chance is quite big we won\u2019t succeed,\u201d FIS women\u2019s race director Atle Skaardal said.\nWe have to build up everything again and must see what\u2019s possible.\u201dThe super-G could be Lindsey Vonn\u2019s next chance to match the all-time record of 62 women\u2019s World Cup wins by Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria."}
