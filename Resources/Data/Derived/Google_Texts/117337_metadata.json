The aim of the treaty is to get countries to agree to policies that reduce their emissions over greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. The goal of the reductions is to prevent global average temperature from rising by more than 2.0 degrees higher than the pre-industrial average. Average global temperature is now about 0.8 degrees Celsius higher.\n\nAs part of the process, each country has been asked to submit their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) to future greenhouse gas emissions cuts. The Obama administration pledged earlier this year that the United States would reduce its emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. At the end of October, the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) released its Synthesis Report analysis of those INDCs. The report concluded that when summed together, they will not put humanity on the track toward fulfilling the 2 degree Celsius threshold.\n\nIn new study, \"Impact of Current Climate Proposals,\" published today in the journal Global Policy, Bjorn Lomborg, head of the Copenhagen Consensus Center think tank, adds up all of the INDCs to see what their overall effect on the future trajectory of man-made global warming would be. The answer: Minuscule.\n\nFrom the abstract:\n\nThis article investigates the temperature reduction impact of major climate policy proposals implemented by 2030, using the standard MAGICC climate model. Even optimistically assuming that promised emission cuts are maintained throughout the century, the impacts are generally small. The impact of the US Clean Power Plan (USCPP) is a reduction in temperature rise by 0.013\u00b0C by 2100. The full US promise for the COP21 climate conference in Paris, its so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) will reduce temperature rise by 0.031\u00b0C. The EU 20-20 policy has an impact of 0.026\u00b0C, the EU INDC 0.053\u00b0C, and China INDC 0.048\u00b0C. All climate policies by the US, China, the EU and the rest of the world, implemented from the early 2000s to 2030 and sustained through the century will likely reduce global temperature rise about 0.17\u00b0C in 2100 (emphasis added). These impact estimates are robust to different calibrations of climate sensitivity, carbon cycling and different climate scenarios. Current climate policy promises will do little to stabilize the climate and their impact will be undetectable for many decades.\n\nIn the accompanying press release Lomborg states:\n\n\u201cParis is being sold as the summit where we can help \u2018heal the planet\u2019 and \u2018save the world\u2019. It is no such thing. If all nations keep all their promises, temperatures will be cut by just 0.05\u00b0C (0.09\u00b0F). Even if every government on the planet not only keeps every Paris promise, reduces all emissions by 2030, and shifts no emissions to other countries, but also keeps these emission reductions throughout the rest of the century, temperatures will be reduced by just 0.17\u00b0C (0.3\u00b0F) by the year 2100.\n\nWhen releasing the UNFCCC's analysis of the INDCs, U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres declared:\n\n\u201cThe INDCs have the capability of limiting the forecast temperature rise to around 2.7 degrees Celsius by 2100, by no means enough but a lot lower than the estimated four, five, or more degrees of warming projected by many prior to the INDCs.\"\n\nLomborg counters:\n\n\u201cThat entirely misrepresents the world\u2019s options. The 2.7\u00b0C comes from the International Energy Agency and essentially assumes that if governments do little in Paris and then right after 2030 embark on incredibly ambitious climate reductions, we could get to 2.7\u00b0C. That way of thinking is similar to telling the deeply indebted Greeks that just making the first repayment on their most pressing loans will put them on an easy pathway to becoming debt-free. It completely misses the point. Figueres\u2019 own organization estimates the Paris promises will reduce emissions by 33Gt CO\u2082 in total. To limit rises to 2.7\u00b0C, about 3,000Gt CO\u2082 would need to be reduced \u2013 or about 100 times more than the Paris commitments (see figure below). That is not optimism; it is wishful thinking.\"\n\nWhat should be done to address the problem of man-made global warming? Lomborg asserts:\n\n\u201cInstead of trying to make fossil fuels so expensive that no one wants them \u2013 which will never work \u2013 we should make green energy so cheap everybody will shift to it.\"\n\nFor more background, I reported that the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan that aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions from the electric power generation sector by 32 percent by 2030 would reduce warming in 2100 by -0.015 degrees Celsius. See also, my article, \"Not-Ready-For-Prime-Time Renewable Energy Technology\" in which I calculated that it would cost by 2030 nearly $10 trillion to replace all fossil fuel energy in the United States using current versions of renewable technologies.\n\nNote: I will be publishing daily dispatches from the Paris climate conference starting the second week of December.\n\nDisclosure: The Copenhagen Consensus Center paid my travel expenses to report on one of its conferences. The Center had absolutely no say in my reporting and writing on the conference.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Paris Greenhouse gas cut promises will have minuscule effect on future temperatures", "title": "Paris Climate Conference Greenhouse Gas Cuts: Almost No Impact on Global Warming", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/11/10/paris-climate-conference-greenhouse-gas", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14471145739006.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14471145739006.jpg", "description": "Paris Greenhouse gas cut promises will have minuscule effect on future temperatures", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Paris Climate Conference Greenhouse Gas Cuts: Almost No Impact on Global Warming"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Technological Progress", "published_time": "2015-11-10T14:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ronald-bailey"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34f4\"", "article_summary": "Note: I will be publishing daily dispatches from the Paris climate conference starting the second week of December.\nThe full US promise for the COP21 climate conference in Paris, its so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) will reduce temperature rise by 0.031\u00b0C.\nFrom the abstract:This article investigates the temperature reduction impact of major climate policy proposals implemented by 2030, using the standard MAGICC climate model.\nCurrent climate policy promises will do little to stabilize the climate and their impact will be undetectable for many decades.\nAverage global temperature is now about 0.8 degrees Celsius higher."}
