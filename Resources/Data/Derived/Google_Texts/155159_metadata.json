Suddenly, everybody loves Wyden\n\nLeadership has its privileges.\n\nSince taking over the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year, Ron Wyden has not only quickly become one of the chamber\u2019s most influential members. He\u2019s also raising a lot more cash.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFundraising records show he\u2019s raised $1.7 million so far this election cycle, which is more than twice as much as during the previous two years and 70 percent more than he raised in the same period during his previous term in office.\n\nHis money increasingly comes from across the country, with health care interests that have little connection to Oregon crowding the list of his top donors. Wyden\u2019s panel has oversight over some of the hottest issues in Congress, from health care to taxes to transportation financing.\n\n( PHOTOS: Who\u2019s leaving Congress?)\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s billions upon billions at stake, so everybody wants to make sure Ron Wyden is their new best friend,\u201d said Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at the Sunlight Foundation.\n\nAlmost half of Wyden\u2019s top 20 donors are in the health care industry, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics \u2014 a reflection of his panel\u2019s broad authority over Medicare, Obamacare and Medicaid, not to mention the tax provisions that subsidize insurance coverage for millions of Americans.\n\n( Sign up for POLITICO\u2019s Morning Tax tip sheet)\n\nBlue Cross/Blue Shield leads the list of top 20 donors, which also includes biotech giant Amgen, American Health Care Association, Adventist Health Systems, DaVita HealthCare Partners and Hospital Hermanos Mel\u00e9ndez, a hospital in Puerto Rico.\n\nA number of names have also pushed onto the list, the data show, including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Darden Restaurants \u2014 which includes Olive Garden and Red Lobster \u2014 as well as Dow Chemical and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.\n\nOther big donors who\u2019ve previously supported the Oregon Democrat include Google, Berkshire Hathaway and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance.\n\nMany of the donations came as lawmakers debated postponing scheduled cuts in government payments to doctors. For many health care companies, the worrisome question was where senators would find the savings to prevent the bill from adding to the deficit. In the latest round, they ultimately cut payments to skilled nursing facilities, clinical labs and others.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full finance policy coverage)\n\nMany also coincided with the panel\u2019s consideration reviving a host of temporary tax breaks, including special depreciation write-offs for restaurants, provisions making it easier for multinational companies to move money among foreign subsidiaries and a tax credit for businesses\u2019 research programs.\n\nWyden spokesman Keith Chu declined comment.\n\nFew lawmakers have become more influential in the 113th Congress more quickly.\n\nJust a couple years ago, Wyden was a backbencher, patiently waiting to climb the ladder of seniority. He finally took over the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last January, the first panel Wyden had run in what by then had been a 17-year Senate career.\n\nA wave of retirements among his colleagues then cleared the way for him to take over the Finance panel, arguably the chamber\u2019s most powerful committee, with jurisdiction also over pensions, trade and myriad other issues.\n\n\u201cThe Finance Committee in general is a cash cow when it comes to campaign contributions,\u201d said Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics. \u201cAnd being chairman of the committee, that certainly packs a punch because he has so much influence over a lot of issues.\u201d\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev is concerned about alcohol excise taxes as well as tax reform, according to its lobbying disclosure reports. Darden Restaurants is focused on a package of expired tax breaks that includes more generous depreciation rules for restaurants. Dow Chemical lobbied on international tax issues.\n\nRestaurants in general are also staunchly opposed to the provision in Obamacare that requires employers to offer health insurance to their workers if they work 30 hours per week or pay a penalty.\n\nWyden\u2019s quick ascent left many on K Street scrambling to get to know a lawmaker they had often ignored, said one lobbyist.\n\n\u201cA lot of them didn\u2019t even know him,\u201d the lobbyist said. \u201cNow people are trying to get to know him, to get their names in front of him.\u201d\n\nWyden\u2019s newly found influence is only beginning to become evident by his campaign contributions. It wasn\u2019t clear he would take over the panel until December, and he did not formally receive the gavel until February while the latest campaign fundraising records run only through March.\n\nAnd it\u2019s clear he has a long way to go to replicate the fundraising prowess of his predecessor, Max Baucus, who left to become ambassador to China. Baucus parlayed his chairmanship, as well as good relations with the business community and a constellation of former aides on K Street, into a formidable money-raising operation.\n\nBut Wyden doesn\u2019t face reelection until 2016, and senators\u2019 fundraising is highly cyclical, typically dipping after an election before ramping up again as they prepare to again face voters.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "His leadership role in the Senate Finance Committee has made him new friends.", "title": "Suddenly, everybody loves Wyden", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/ron-wyden-campaign-donors-107629.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/26/140326_wyden_gty_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Senate,2014 Elections,Ron Wyden", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "His leadership role in the Senate Finance Committee has made him new friends.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Wyden\u2019s panel has oversight over some of the hottest issues in Congress, from health care to taxes to transportation financing.\nSince taking over the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year, Ron Wyden has not only quickly become one of the chamber\u2019s most influential members.\nFor many health care companies, the worrisome question was where senators would find the savings to prevent the bill from adding to the deficit.\n\u201cThe Finance Committee in general is a cash cow when it comes to campaign contributions,\u201d said Viveca Novak, a spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics.\nHe finally took over the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last January, the first panel Wyden had run in what by then had been a 17-year Senate career."}
