Kathy Castor, a Democrat from Tampa, warned local \u201cnavigators\u201d Wednesday not to rest on their laurels.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to hit it out of the park this year,\u201d she told health care workers and reporters at a news conference aimed at spreading word of next year\u2019s open enrollment period. \u201cTogether by Feb. 15, we\u2019re going to beat that number of 1 million enrolled in Florida and do even better, and make sure our families have the financial security they deserve.\u201d\n\nEnrollment in policies offered on the Health Insurance Marketplace begins Saturday and runs for three months. Melanie Hall, executive director of the Family Healthcare Foundation, said navigators have two goals \u2014 reach out to the uninsured to help them enroll for the first time and make sure that the 1 million now covered review and renew coverage.\n\nNavigators have organized many enrollment events to provide help; (813) 995-1066 is the number to call for a schedule or enrollment advice.\n\nHall said one of the chief reasons given by those who failed to enroll was they couldn\u2019t afford insurance. \u201cWe have a really important message: There is financial help available,\u201d she said.\n\nIn fact, Hall noted that 91 percent of the 1 million who enrolled in Florida received financial help and pay an average premium of $68 a month.\n\nTampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, a backer of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, served as head cheerleader at Wednesday\u2019s news conference.\n\n\u201cThe basic, fundamental premise that people are entitled to decent health care benefits all of us,\u201d Buckhorn said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go register another million.\u201d\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 12 Nov 2014 16:47:09 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 The advisers helping local residents enroll in health insurance made available under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act say Year 1 was a pretty good one: 7 m", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The advisers helping local residents enroll in health insurance made available under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act say Year 1 was a pretty good one: 7 m", "title": "Castor, Buckhorn encourage new Obamacare signups", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/health/medical-news/castor-buckhorn-encourage-new-obamacare-signups-20141112/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141112/ARTICLE/141119738/AR/0/AR-141119738.jpg", "height": 2662}, "updated_time": "2014-11-12T16:47:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 The advisers helping local residents enroll in health insurance made available under President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act say Year 1 was a pretty good one: 7", "title": "Castor, Buckhorn encourage new Obamacare signups", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141112/ARTICLE/141119738/AR/0/AR-141119738.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-11-12T16:47:09Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-11-12T16:47:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd554\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe basic, fundamental premise that people are entitled to decent health care benefits all of us,\u201d Buckhorn said.\n\u201cWe have a really important message: There is financial help available,\u201d she said.\nTampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, a backer of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, served as head cheerleader at Wednesday\u2019s news conference.\nBut U.S. Rep.
