He is beloved by fans of the show for his sardonic contrarian takes, his hilarious takedowns of both Chris Brown and Stephen Colbert, and despite his self-avowed libertarian streak, his refusal to be pigeon-holed into tribalist thinking.\n\nLevy spoke with Reason TV's Anthony L. Fisher about Red Eye's unique place in the news and comedy worlds, the diverse politics of the show's panelists, guests that go \"too far,\" and how the show will continue to evolve now that original Red Eye host Greg Gutfeld has left to host his own weekend show on Fox News Channel.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "\"Red Eye's Andy Levy on News, Satire, and Political Correctness\": Produced by Anthony L.
