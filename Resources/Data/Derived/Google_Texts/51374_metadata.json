He is joining the practice of Dr. James M. Ford, a longtime community physician in Wrens whose practice Medical Associates has assumed.\n\nLiving 15 minutes away in McDuffie Coun\u00adty, Molitor said he considers it part of his community.\n\n\u201cThat was a governing factor for my ever entering medicine is to be of service to the community in which I live rather than simply someone who travels to a place to make work,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are a lot of factors, financial and regulatory, that can interfere in the physician-patient relationship, but Molitor said his hope is that it can still be sustained.\n\n\u201cThe hope is that physicians who appreciate patients as people will continue to have enough influence that folks will feel like they are indeed receiving care and not simply receiving services,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter nine years in private practice in Augusta, Thomae said she was looking to do more as well.\n\n\u201cI have always liked to work in areas where people need the care,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I was lacking was that population that really needs the care and there really isn\u2019t a lot for them.\u201d\n\nHer joining the center will allow greater focus on women\u2019s health \u201cto address some of the issues\u201d the center wants to address, said CEO Janice Sherman. That will include prenatal care and the center is working on, finding a provider to do the actual deliveries, she said.\n\nThomae, who will work part-time in Wrens, said prenatal care has been a problem despite the resources in Augusta.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting better as far as prenatal care, but there\u2019s still a lack of it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might see more in Wrens, in the rural areas, where they start their prenatal care late because they don\u2019t know where to get their Medi\u00ad\u00adcaid, they don\u2019t know where to sign up, they don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "When Dr. Michael Molitor and Maria Thomae decided to join Medical Associates Plus at Belle Terrace, it was to return to the kind of care they wanted to give in health care.", "title": "New providers want to serve at center", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2014-06-01/new-providers-want-serve-center", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/13408023.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ce0\"", "article_summary": "Molitor, a family practice physician, will serve the community health center in Wrens and Thomae, a women\u2019s health nurse practitioner, will help it provide women\u2019s services and eventually prenatal care.\nThat will include prenatal care and the center is working on, finding a provider to do the actual deliveries, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting better as far as prenatal care, but there\u2019s still a lack of it,\u201d she said.\nThomae, who will work part-time in Wrens, said prenatal care has been a problem despite the resources in Augusta.\nHe is joining the practice of Dr. James M.
