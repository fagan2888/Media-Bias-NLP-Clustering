In general, regulators can\u2019t tell carriers what to do with the premiums they collect; all they can do is reject proposals to charge excessive amounts.\n\nWhile carriers say the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provisions expose them to greater risk because they can no longer refuse coverage to people with preexisting conditions or limit coverage to women of childbearing age, the ACA established several programs specifically designed to shield plans from unknown risks. The act also subsidizes premiums for low- and moderate-income earners in order to broaden the risk pool and encourage young healthy people to buy insurance.\n\nThe surplus report will be distributed to advocates who review premium rates in their states and often push for more effective rate review processes. Consumer Reports is urging policymakers and regulators, including Health and Human Services officials, to rethink how surpluses are evaluated in the context of rate hike requests and consider establishing maximum ceilings for surplus funds, not just minimum levels, and laws that allow regulatory agencies to deny rate increases or require spending down excess surpluses.\n\n\u2014Roni Caryn Rabin", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, health insurance, health plan, health care costs, premiums, obamacare, health reform, Affordable Care Act", "Title": "A Hidden Reason Your Health Care Costs Are Going Up - Consumer Reports", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2015/06/a-hidden-reason-your-health-care-costs-are-going-up/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/health/CRO_Health_Health_Insurance_Form_11-14.png", "type": "article", "title": "A Hidden Reason Your Health Care Costs Are Going Up - Consumer Reports"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2015-06-22T19:15Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2015-06-22T19:11Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: A Hidden Reason Your Health Care Costs Are Going Up - Consumer Reports", "keywords": "health, health insurance, health plan, health care costs, premiums, obamacare, health reform, Affordable Care Act", "contenttag": "Health Reform", "description": "A Consumer Reports analysis finds that many nonprofit health insurance companies stockpile huge surpluses, which could result in higher premiums for their costumers."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca58\"", "article_summary": "Health insurance premiums are meant to cover claims, needed services, and to build up a reasonable surplus, Mendelsohn explains.\nThe surplus report will be distributed to advocates who review premium rates in their states and often push for more effective rate review processes.\nIn general, regulators can\u2019t tell carriers what to do with the premiums they collect; all they can do is reject proposals to charge excessive amounts.\nThe act also subsidizes premiums for low- and moderate-income earners in order to broaden the risk pool and encourage young healthy people to buy insurance.\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t seen any evidence that these huge surpluses benefit consumers.\u201dGovernmental agencies can review insurance rates and premium hikes in some states, but they have limited authority to restrict stockpiling or to order insurers to spend down those surpluses."}
