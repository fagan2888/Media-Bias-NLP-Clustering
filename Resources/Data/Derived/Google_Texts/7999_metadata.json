As this political cycle seems determined to prove, however, they do create a lot of political idiocy. And that side effect extends to both parties, and especially the media.\n\nThe issue goes back to 1998 and a now-discredited study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, published in the British medical journal The Lancet, which claimed to have found a causal link between a preservative found in vaccines (thimerasol) and autism. Vaccination skeptics began demanding an end to vaccination requirements for schools, while drug manufacturers withdrew thimerasol from most vaccines, many of which never had it in the first place, according to the FDA.\n\nRelated: Christie\u2019s Vaccine Comment Alarms Health Care Pros\n\nThe rates of autism diagnoses didn\u2019t change even with the withdrawal of thimerasol; in fact, they actually went up. Researchers immediately began to study Wakefield\u2019s hypothesis, but could not duplicate his outcomes. In part, this was because the study itself was flawed, with only twelve subjects handpicked by its author, which prompted many to wonder why Lancet had published it at all.\n\nBMJ, another British medical journal, later determined that Wakefield had misrepresented and altered the data in the small sample in order to support his vaccination-skeptical conclusions. Lancet had already withdrawn the report at that point, but received even more criticism for its decision to publish it in the first place after the fraud was exposed.\n\nNevertheless, vaccine skepticism continues fueled in part by ignorance of the data and high profile celebrity campaigns, such as the efforts of Jenny McCarthy. The skepticism does not fit neatly along political lines -- vaccination skeptics run the gamut from the fringes of the anti-government right to the fringes of the progressive left.\n\nIn the midst of a whooping-cough outbreak in California last summer, the local Malibu newspaper noted that its community \u2013 hardly a bastion of conservative thought \u2013 had vaccination rates usually seen in third-world nations. Not a single one of its schools meet the 90 percent threshold considered the minimum by public health officials to prevent outbreaks.\n\nRelated: Obama Cuts Vaccine Program, Despite Measles Outbreak\n\nFor the past few days, though, the media has treated this like a strictly Republican issue. It started with a comment from Chris Christie while traveling in London this weekend that government should \u201cbalance\u201d between the need to vaccinate and the beliefs of parents. The governor of New Jersey later clarified that he meant a balance on which vaccines should be urged and not vaccination itself, but the media latched onto the meme like a virus on a host.\n\nSenator Rand Paul, a medical doctor himself (specializing in ophthalmology), was the next target. When asked, Paul stated that most vaccines should be voluntary except for a few core deadly diseases, calling those \u201ctimes in which there can be some rules.\u201d Later, though, he suggested the kind of causation that the discredited Wakefield study alleged by saying he\u2019d heard of \u201cprofound mental disorders\u201d in children after immunizations.\n\nSuddenly, the anti-vaccination stand was a uniquely Republican problem, and the media spent most of this week chasing down potential presidential contenders demanding to know their thoughts on immunization.\n\nThat\u2019s a curious take from an incurious media. Seven years ago, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton pandered to the anti-vaxxers in their own coalitions. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen just a skyrocketing autism rate,\u201d Obama said at a campaign rally in April 2008. \u201cSome people are suspicious that it\u2019s connected to the vaccines. This person included. The science right now is inconclusive, but we have to research it.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Cuts Vaccine Program, Despite Measles Outbreak\n\nClinton tried to steal a march on Republicans with a late-night tweet asserting that \u201cthe science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let\u2019s protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest\u201d. What Grandma Hillary didn\u2019t mention was her own 2008 position, captured at the time by The American Prospect. \u201cI am committed to make investments to find the causes of autism,\u201d Clinton wrote in a questionnaire from an autism activist group, \u201cincluding possible environmental causes like vaccines.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the media has preened over the last few days about \u201csettled science\u201d while not taking a very close look at their track records. Jon Stewart spent Tuesday night railing at Paul, Christie, and the \u201cmindful stupidity\u201d of \u201cscience-denying affluent California liberals,\u201d without noting that Stewart himself offered his platform to Robert F. Kennedy Jr in 2005 to promote the same kind of science denial from an affluent Massachusetts liberal.\n\nThe Washington Post, where Ruth Marcus cast this issue as a Republican episode of science denial, had just one week earlier offered an explainer that the problem wasn\u2019t entirely limited to the left.\n\nThe policy positions staked out by Christie and Paul are also virtually indistinguishable from the White House, too. Both urged parents to vaccinate, but didn\u2019t endorse a governmental mandate requiring it. That\u2019s precisely what the White House says, too, according to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cThe President believes it shouldn\u2019t require a law for people to exercise common sense and do the right thing,\u201d Earnest replied on a question specifically asking about the measles vaccine and the state-based regulations that allow parents to opt out for personal and/or religious beliefs.\n\nIn other words, most of the \u201cnews\u201d along these lines is actually not news at all. It\u2019s reminiscent of the way the media blew up the non-issue of contraception into a \u201cwar on women\u201d in the 2012 cycle. Few are willing to force parents to vaccinate, while every potential candidate believes that vaccinations \u2013 especially the core vaccinations \u2013 are safe and necessary. Perhaps at some point we can get back to issues that truly matter in the next presidential race, such as national security policy, federal spending, and the economy, rather than chase media-created rabbits down non-existent holes.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As the CDC and the rest of the medical community has repeatedly stated, vaccines do no", "title": "How a Discredited Report Turned Parents Into Anti-Vaxxers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/02/05/How-Discredited-Report-Turned-Parents-Anti-Vaxxers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/09072011_Stealth_Vaccine_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/02/05/How-Discredited-Report-Turned-Parents-Anti-Vaxxers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/09072011_Stealth_Vaccine_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@EdMorrissey", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As the CDC and the rest of the medical community has repeatedly stated, vaccines do no", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Few are willing to force parents to vaccinate, while every potential candidate believes that vaccinations \u2013 especially the core vaccinations \u2013 are safe and necessary.\nAs the CDC and the rest of the medical community has repeatedly stated, vaccines do not cause autism or brain damage.\nSeven years ago, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton pandered to the anti-vaxxers in their own coalitions.\nRelated: Obama Cuts Vaccine Program, Despite Measles OutbreakFor the past few days, though, the media has treated this like a strictly Republican issue.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen just a skyrocketing autism rate,\u201d Obama said at a campaign rally in April 2008."}
