In return for protection against the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s drug price dealings, Big Pharma agreed to back Obamacare by offering an $80 billion expansion in Medicaid discounts.\n\nAt the time, Big Pharma and other leading pharmaceutical giants were given concessions that now appear to have expired. That is, unless congressional budget committees decide to scrape off the changes proposed by the president.\n\nAccording the The Wall Street Journal, Obama\u2019s pharmaceutical partners may not have been entirely aware of the pact\u2019s short shelf life:\n\nThe news is that Mr. Obama\u2019s new budget proposal for 2016 reneges on the quid pro quo that some of the dumber drug makers cut in return for supporting ObamaCare in 2009. That transaction was supposed to buy political protection against the left-wing wish list of price controls, weakened patents and other extortion that Mr. Obama now endorses in his budget.\n\nAs reports on the hike in prices of a series of cancer drugs hit the news, the pharmaceutical industry is faced with two other major losses: cuts to extended patent terms and hospital-administered medicine payment rates.\n\nObama\u2019s newly-proposed patent terms would cut the 12-year long intellectual property protection to seven years. It would also require companies to accept a slash in payment rates for hospital-administered medicines. Both measures harm Big Pharma\u2019s current gains.\n\nAccording to WSJ, Obama\u2019s new proposal would even expand government discounts currently available to Medicaid and transfer them to the Medicare prescription benefit. However you slice it, Obama\u2019s new budget proposal leaves Big Pharma with little to no control over their drugs\u2019 prices.\n\nUnfortunately for Americans, the president\u2019s solution to the issue might prove worse than the poison. Why? Because competition is the first to suffer the consequences of price control.\n\nOnce government acts to keep prices immune from circumstantial changes, prices no longer provide accurate market signals to producers and consumers. Without accurate market signals, producers are unable to dedicate resources to the development of new products. As a result, innovation stagnates. Once direct price controls are put in place, pharmaceutical innovation will be the first to feel the crippling effects.\n\nThe more the president promises to intervene to remedy the consequences of his own health care law, the harder it may become for patients, especially those who cannot afford expensive health care coverage.\n\nThis mess shows the consequences of allowing bureaucrats to dictate how you do business by cutting special deals with government. If we are willing to allow the market to heal so that patients benefit, government must allow industries to compete. But for that to happen, the dissolving special deals between government and industry leaders shouldn\u2019t be replaced by more centralization.\n\nThe American consumer can only be put first when the debate is focused on ending monopolies created by government and industry leaders.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "By the looks of Obama's new budget proposal, his pharmaceutical partners may not have been entirely aware of their pact's short shelf life.", "title": "Obama's waning pact with Big Pharma fosters greater centralization - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/shutterstock_12149896.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-09T14:04:01+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/198730/big-pharma-obama-budget/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "tag": "Big Pharma,Budget and Spending,Health Care,ObamaCare,pharmacy", "published_time": "2015-02-09T14:01:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-09T14:04:01+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "By the looks of Obama's new budget proposal, his pharmaceutical partners may not have been entirely aware of their pact's short shelf life.", "title": "Obama's waning pact with Big Pharma fosters greater centralization - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/02/shutterstock_12149896.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "By the looks of Obama's new budget proposal, his pharmaceutical partners may not have been entirely aware of their pact's short shelf life."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd294\"", "article_summary": "However you slice it, Obama\u2019s new budget proposal leaves Big Pharma with little to no control over their drugs\u2019 prices.\nAt the time, Big Pharma and other leading pharmaceutical giants were given concessions that now appear to have expired.\nIn return for protection against the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s drug price dealings, Big Pharma agreed to back Obamacare by offering an $80 billion expansion in Medicaid discounts.\nBy Alice Salles | Watchdog ArenaIf there\u2019s one line item President Obama\u2019s budget actually trims, it is the special deal between Washington and major pharmaceutical companies.\nAccording to WSJ, Obama\u2019s new proposal would even expand government discounts currently available to Medicaid and transfer them to the Medicare prescription benefit."}
