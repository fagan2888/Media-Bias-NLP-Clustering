Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the officer who took control of the F-35 program last year. He added that the planes are necessary, however, to keep pace with the technology being developed by U.S. rivals Russia and China.\n\n\u201cI don't see any scenario where we are walking back away from this program. We're going to buy a lot of these airplanes,\u201d said Bogdan.\n\nDOD is so far down the F-35 rabbit hole, both in terms of technology and cost -- $400 billion for 2,400 planes -- that it has no choice but to continue with the program. Still, it\u2019s not too far gone to send a message to the plane\u2019s manufacturer, Lockheed Martin.\n\nRelated: Pentagon's $1.5 Trillion Jet Punches Back\n\nA report in The Washington Post about DOD\u2019s 2015 fiscal request says the Pentagon needs funds to purchase two of the Navy\u2019s version of the plane, six of the Marines,\u2019 and 26 of the Air Force\u2019s model. It\u2019s a sizable order, but it\u2019s actually eight planes less than the 42 originally expected.\n\nIn the scheme of things, eight fewer jets among an order of 2,400 is not a big drop. But the timing of the leak to the Post, as well as the admonishment to Lockheed on \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d is hard to dismiss as mere coincidence.\n\nLockheed did not comment on camera on the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report.\n\nRelated: 719 New Problems for the $1.5 Trillion F-35 Fighter\n\nLockheed and DOD have been squabbling over F-35 problems for years. In October, a DOD Inspector General report found 719 problems with the plane and said \u201cLockheed's failure to make sure subcontractors' work was not up to snuff.\u201d\n\nLockheed countered that the problems were not new and that they were \u201cbased on data that's more than 16 months old and [a] majority of the Corrective Action Requests identified have been closed.\u201d\n\n\u201cProducing quality products is a top priority for the F-35 program, and Lockheed Martin and its suppliers strive every day to deliver the best aircraft possible to our customers,\" Lockheed said in a statement at the time. \u201cWhen discoveries occur, we take decisive and thorough action to correct the situation. Our commitment is to deliver the F-35's world class Fifth Generation fighter capabilities to the warfighter on time and within budget.\u201d\n\nIt seems as if DOD is attempting to send another message with Sunday night\u2019s broadcast and the news that orders are expected to be cut in 2015. This isn\u2019t just a cost issue any more, either \u2013 DOD needs the plane to work in order to maintain air superiority.\n\nUnfortunately, the Pentagon is stuck with the F-35, for better or worse, so Lockheed doesn\u2019t really have an incentive to deliver a state of the art plane in working order. DOD is stuck with the contract regardless.\n\nIf Lockheed cares about national security, it might want to get the plane working soon. China and Russia are in the plane\u2019s jet contrails and catching up fast.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On", "title": "DOD Is Stuck with a Flawed $1.5 Trillion Fighter Jet", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/18/DOD-Stuck-Flawed-15-Trillion-Fighter-Jet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162011_F35_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/02/18/DOD-Stuck-Flawed-15-Trillion-Fighter-Jet", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02162011_F35_article.jpg", "creator": "@davidcfrancis", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: 719 New Problems for the $1.5 Trillion F-35 FighterLockheed and DOD have been squabbling over F-35 problems for years.\n\u201cLong gone is the time when we're going to pay for mistake after mistake after mistake,\" said Lt.
