We\u2019re getting screwed on this one. \u2026 We just found out on Twitter a half hour ago that the station is being taken off the air. We were not told about this ahead of time.\u201d\n\nMr. Finfer learned from reporter Robert Feder who happened to tweet out the news during the show.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Mr. Finfer said. \u201cYou would assume you tell the employees before the media. You assume they have the common courtesy to let some hosts on the air know that something might be coming so you don\u2019t find out when you\u2019re coming back from a commercial break. I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing. I\u2019ve heard of of some pretty crappy things in this business. You talk to radio people you\u2019ll hear awful stories about the way they\u2019ve been treated. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever heard anything like this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had respect for our bosses until about five minutes ago,\u201d Mr. Finfer lamented. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even come in the room yet to say anything \u2026 now we have to sit here and do a show for an hour and forty minutes? How are we supposed to do that? I never ever had management treat me this way.\n\n\u201cAre they even human?\u201d he asked.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hosts of a Chicago sports radio show took the opportunity to skewer their employers Thursday after learning on-air that the station is folding and they're out of jobs.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The hosts of a Chicago sports radio show took the opportunity to skewer their employers Thursday after learning on-air that the station is folding and they\u2019re out of jobs.", "title": "Chicago sports radio hosts skewer station after learning they\u2019re fired on air", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/23/chicago-sports-radio-hosts-skewer-station-after-le/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/23/quigs-finfer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/23/quigs-finfer.jpg", "description": "The hosts of a Chicago sports radio show took the opportunity to skewer their employers Thursday after learning on-air that the station is folding and they're out of jobs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Chicago sports radio hosts skewer station after learning they\u2019re"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Ben Finfer"}, "article_summary": "The hosts of a Chicago sports radio show took the opportunity to skewer their employers Thursday after learning on-air that the station is folding and they\u2019re out of jobs.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a live show here,\u201d Mr. Finfer said on the air, Sporting News reported.\nI\u2019ve heard of of some pretty crappy things in this business.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Mr. Finfer said.\nI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever heard anything like this.\u201d\u201cI had respect for our bosses until about five minutes ago,\u201d Mr. Finfer lamented."}
