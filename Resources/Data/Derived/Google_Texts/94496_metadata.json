The money to replace the pipes came from a capital improvement fund paid for by the utilities' customers through their water rates.\n\nThe program is scheduled to be completed next year.\n\n\"We started asking about lead, and what is the safe level of lead, and there isn't one, especially for kids,\" the mayor said. \"So we said the prudent thing to do is to improve the testing and start getting these lead pipes out. Get the lead out.\"\n\nNow Lansing is trying to help Flint follow their lead to \"get the lead out,\" Bernero said. \"Because we've done it in Lansing, we've sent our crews over to Flint.\"\n\nHe said that, along with Flint Mayor Karen Weaver, they've designed a lead pipe replacement plan \"where we think it can be done in a year, with about 30 crews and $55 million dollars.\" He added that pipe replacement could cost as little as \"3 to 4 thousand dollars a home.\"\n\nBernero explains that's because instead of digging a huge trench from the street to each home, \"we perfected a system of threading instead of trenching.\" That involves digging a hole by a house, then pulling up the lead pipes as copper pipe is pulled through.\n\n\"You thread it through like you would thread a needle. And it cut the time and money in half to replace these pipes,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "As Flint, Michigan's water disaster continues, a blueprint to fix the city's lead contamination is being floated from the state's capital city.", "author": "Trent Gillies", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "As Flint's water disaster continues, a blueprint to fix the city's lead contamination is being floated from the state's capital city.", "title": "Lansing Mayor: Fixing Flint would only cost this much", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/flints-crisis-can-be-fixed-with-55m-in-new-pipes-lansing-mayor.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/01/20/103319761-504801858.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Flint's water disaster continues, a blueprint to fix the city's lead contamination is being floated from the state's capital city.", "title": "Flint's crisis can be fixed with $55M in new pipes: Lansing mayor", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/22/flints-crisis-can-be-fixed-with-55m-in-new-pipes-lansing-mayor.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/01/20/103319761-504801858.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@trentCNBC", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "On The Money, Politics, Environment, On The Money, Government Agencies, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-04-24T09:00:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "On The Money", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T09:45:52-0400", "tag": "Government Agencies"}, "pageNodeId": 103572246, "news_keywords": "Flint, water crisis, lead pipes, water contamination, Lansing, Verg Bernero, Rick Snyder, environmental justice,"}, "article_summary": "\"So we said the prudent thing to do is to improve the testing and start getting these lead pipes out.\nThat involves digging a hole by a house, then pulling up the lead pipes as copper pipe is pulled through.\nInstead, Bernero said, they got \"rather vague\" answers about lead levels.\nAnd it cut the time and money in half to replace these pipes,\" he said.\nThe money to replace the pipes came from a capital improvement fund paid for by the utilities' customers through their water rates."}
