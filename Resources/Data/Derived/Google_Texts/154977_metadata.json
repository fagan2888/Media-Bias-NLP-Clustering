And I think a lot of young adults and African-Americans as well are afraid because they are not even educated about it.\"\n\nLeBron did not seem to be fazed when asked about how he felt advocating for something that has been so controversial.\n\n\"I mean, I can't worry about that,\" James said. \"Especially who I am. I mean, I know that everything that I do is going to be bigger than what it should be or blown out of proportion. But what I believe in and the people that I support is what it's all about. So I can sleep comfortably at night.\"\n\nWhat do you think about the video he did and what he said? Do you think he should have just stayed out of the political realm or was it a good move?
