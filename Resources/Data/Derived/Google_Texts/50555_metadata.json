Burrell said people who get those subsidies will have to fill out a new tax form, Form 1095-A, to reconcile the aid they got.\n\nFor the last several months, Republicans have cited evidence indicating that people may have received too much in subsidies, which could mean some taxpayers end up owing more in taxes than they otherwise anticipated.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew said the situation may differ from taxpayer to taxpayer, but said the administration would work to clarify all questions as much as possible.\n\n\u201cA fraction of taxpayers will take different steps, like claiming an exemption if they could not afford insurance or ensuring they received the correct amount of financial assistance,\u201d Lew said. \u201cA smaller fraction of taxpayers will pay a fee if they made a choice to not obtain coverage they could afford.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are working to ensure that whatever their experience, consumers can easily access clear information since this is the first year they will see certain changes to their tax returns,\u201d he said.\n\nBoth Burwell and Lew provided links to information that is already out there to help taxpayers comply. The IRS has released a packet of information, and HHS has released \u201c3 Tips About Marketplace Coverage & Your Taxes,\u201d and a separate paper on how your taxes might be affected if you don\u2019t have health coverage.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration acknowledged Thursday that Obamacare will complicate some people's federal tax forms, and said it is preparing to offer a range of resources to help people get through the upcoming tax filing season.  \"Starting this year, consumers will see some changes to their tax returns,\" the...", "title": "Gov\u2019t Admits Obamacare Will Make Taxes More Complicated", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/01/08/govt-admits-obamacare-will-make-taxes-more-complicated/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-08-at-4.54.26-PM-620x451.png", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "irs, obamacare", "sailthru.tags": "government, irs, obamacare, taxes, the-furnace, the-furnance, author-pete-kasperowicz, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 211, "gplus-count": 2, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/914039", "categories": "irs,obamacare,taxes,the-furnance,government,the-furnace", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 67, "description": "The Obama administration acknowledged Thursday that Obamacare will complicate some people's federal tax forms, and said it is preparing to offer a range of resources to help people get through the upcoming tax filing season.  \"Starting this year, consumers will see some changes to their tax returns,\" the...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "The Obama administration acknowledged Thursday that Obamacare will complicate some people's federal tax forms, and said it is preparing to offer a range of resources to help people get through the upcoming tax filing season.  \"Starting this year, consumers will see some changes to their tax returns,\" the...", "title": "Gov\u2019t Admits Obamacare Will Make Taxes More Complicated", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/01/08/govt-admits-obamacare-will-make-taxes-more-complicated/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-08-at-4.54.26-PM-620x451.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 451}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2015-01-08T16:58:30+00:00", "twitter-count": 99}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd661\"", "article_summary": "HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said millions of people have bought health care through Obamacare marketplaces, and said the \u201cvast majority\u201d received tax credits.\nBoth Burwell and Lew provided links to information that is already out there to help taxpayers comply.\nThe IRS has released a packet of information, and HHS has released \u201c3 Tips About Marketplace Coverage & Your Taxes,\u201d and a separate paper on how your taxes might be affected if you don\u2019t have health coverage.\n\u201cStarting this year, consumers will see some changes to their tax returns,\u201d the Department of Health and Human Services said Thursday.\nBurrell said people who get those subsidies will have to fill out a new tax form, Form 1095-A, to reconcile the aid they got."}
