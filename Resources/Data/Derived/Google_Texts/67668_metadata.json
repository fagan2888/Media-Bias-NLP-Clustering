Mexican manufacturers of illegal marijuana bricks have driven down prices as residents in California, Colorado, and Washington state now have safe access to reasonably affordable medical marijuana and/or recreational cannabis. \u201cTwo or three years ago, a kilogram [2.2 pounds] of marijuana was worth $60 to $90,\u201d a Mexican marijuana grower told NPR news in December 2014. \u201cBut now they\u2019re paying us $30 to $40 a kilo. It\u2019s a big difference. If the U.S. continues to legalize pot, they\u2019ll run us into the ground.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the quality of marijuana has increased as (legal) American production of cannabis has forced Mexican and Caribbean producers to effectively up their game to compete with superior American products.\n\nMexican drug cartels are extremely powerful and extremely violent. Anything that cuts into their main source of income is a net positive for society. Marijuana will always exist and will always be consumed regardless of legal status--and it makes more sense to keep things domestic and keep money out of the hands of cartels.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consequences. .05/27/2016 8:52:29AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Consequences.", "title": "It Turns Out Legalizing Marijuana Really Cut Into Mexican Drug Cartel's Profits", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/08/it-turns-out-legalizing-marijuana-really-cut-into-mexican-drug-cartels-profits-n2130350", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/59/f810585f-4f3e-4b1c-96ab-0b6cdf2fb2cc.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Consequences.", "title": "It Turns Out Legalizing Marijuana Really Cut Into Mexican Drug Cartel's Profits", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/03/08/it-turns-out-legalizing-marijuana-really-cut-into-mexican-drug-cartels-profits-n2130350", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/59/f810585f-4f3e-4b1c-96ab-0b6cdf2fb2cc.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "It Turns Out Legalizing Marijuana Really Cut Into Mexican Drug Cartel's Profits , Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTwo or three years ago, a kilogram [2.2 pounds] of marijuana was worth $60 to $90,\u201d a Mexican marijuana grower told NPR news in December 2014.\nMexican manufacturers of illegal marijuana bricks have driven down prices as residents in California, Colorado, and Washington state now have safe access to reasonably affordable medical marijuana and/or recreational cannabis.\nThe U.S. Border Patrol has released 2015 data showing that the number of marijuana seizures throughout the southwest U.S./Mexico border has fallen to the lowest level in a decade, the Washington Post reports.\nMexican drug cartels are extremely powerful and extremely violent.\nMarijuana will always exist and will always be consumed regardless of legal status--and it makes more sense to keep things domestic and keep money out of the hands of cartels."}
