Both sides have offered conditional support for the approach, justices noted.\n\n\u201cThe parties on remand should be afforded an opportunity to arrive at an approach going forward that accommodates petitioners\u2019 religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by petitioners\u2019 health plans receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage,\u201d justices said in a per curiam opinion.\n\n\u201cAlthough there may still be areas of disagreement between the parties on issues of implementation, the importance of those areas of potential concern is uncertain, as is the necessity of this court\u2019s involvement at this point to resolve them,\u201d the opinion said.\n\nThe court added that it was not taking any position on the merits of the case brought by faith-based nonprofits that oppose a process for opting out of the mandate. The nonprofits object to the process because it can result in alternate access to contraception being arranged for employees through the employer\u2019s health insurance plan.\n\nUnder the court\u2019s proposed compromise, some religious nonprofits could omit contraception coverage. There would not be any obligation to opt out of the mandate formally, and responsibility would fall on the insurer to arrange separate access to birth control.\n\nIt is highly unusual for the Supreme Court to act as a mediator between legal adversaries. But with the court split 4-4 between liberals and conservatives, there was not majority support for a ruling on claims brought under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nIn a concurring opinion, Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned the circuit courts not to interpret the court\u2019s per curiam opinion or proposed compromise as a reflection of its views on the merits. They also noted that any compromise still faces significant obstacles, such as whether contraception-only insurance plans should be established.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s opinion does only what it says it does: \u2018affords an opportunity\u2019 for the parties and courts of appeals to reconsider the parties\u2019 arguments in light of petitioners\u2019 new articulation of their religious objection and the government\u2019s clarification about what the existing regulations accomplish, how they might be amended, and what such an amendment would sacrifice,\u201d the concurring opinion said.\n\nNonetheless, the challengers are encouraged by the decision.\n\n\u201cThere is still work to be done, but today\u2019s decision indicates that we will ultimately prevail in court,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, an attorney for Catholic nonprofit Little Sisters of the Poor, one of many challengers.\n\nSupporters of the contraception mandate were more subdued. But they still expressed optimism. The National Women\u2019s Law Center said in a statement that it is \u201cconfident that the government\u2019s birth control accommodation once again will prevail.\u201d\n\nThe cases are Zubik et al. v.
