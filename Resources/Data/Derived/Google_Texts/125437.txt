"The people that threw the rocks through my windows were kids basically. They're out causing havoc, they're causing trouble—there's definitely a bad element out there but that doesn't speak for this city," he said. "It's sad to see this bad element communicate this message with our name on it."

For their part, local politicians are imploring the community to cease with the violence.

"What happened in Ferguson last night was not a 'peaceful protest.' It was criminal, and was nothing that our community can—or will—tolerate. I strongly condemn the violence, Most people living in the region, including protesters, condemn the violence," St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay wrote in a Tuesday Facebook post. "It will not change minds and real change will not happen unless everyone wants it and works together. Violence is as antithetical to change as racism."
