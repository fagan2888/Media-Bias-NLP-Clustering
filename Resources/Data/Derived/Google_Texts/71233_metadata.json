Falwell, whose father was an icon of the religious Right, was on stage to strengthen Trump\u2019s support among the crucial evangelical vote that makes up about half of the Iowa Republican caucus vote.\n\nThe topic of the rally wandered \u2014 as is Trump\u2019s tendency \u2014 with Trump occasionally finding himself delivering tangents from tangents from tangents. The thrust of Trump\u2019s message was clear, though: the country is currently in shambles, and \u201cWe\u2019re going to be great again,\u201d as the billionaire put it.\n\nFalwell, and to a lesser degree Trump, hit many conservative notes before the Republican crowd \u2014 protecting gun rights, building a wall along the Mexican border, cutting federal spending, and defending of religious conservatives.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t a standard conservative appeal. Trump went on at length about his efforts to build ballroom at the White House. He praised China\u2019s economic policies.\n\nThe crowd reflected Trump\u2019s non-ideological strain. Brian and Ann Jacobsen both voted for Obama in 2008. \u201cWe believed him,\u201d Mr. Jacobsen said. \u201cHere we are eight years later, and we\u2019re worse off.\u201d\n\nMrs. Jacobson, on board for Trump now, said her final two were Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nCurt Strathman is also a former Obama voter. He doesn\u2019t want Obamacare repealed, but just \u201cfixed,\u201d so as to more aggressively contain health-care costs. Today he was out for Trump.\n\nFalwell pointed out that Trump is \u201cpulling voters from the Democratic Party \u2026 from many walks of life that don\u2019t normally vote Republican\n\nWhile candidates like Rubio and Cruz work at projecting conservatism, Trump simply projects confidence. Getting Mexico to pay for the border wall, he said, \u201cIt will be, trust me, very very easy \u2014 very easy.\u201d\n\nHalf of Trump\u2019s appeal is simply his declaration that the state of the union is not strong. Of his own campaign, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a story about people who are fed-up. You can call it anger.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just want to see great government. We want to see security. We want to see the country rich again.\u201d\n\nThe living-room-chair format was odd, and Falwell\u2019s sleepy delivery combined with the formality of the Orpheum theater to make the rally more low-energy than a typical Trump affair. Still, the crowd regularly erupted into cheers, particularly over Trump\u2019s predictions of victory.\n\nTimothy P.
