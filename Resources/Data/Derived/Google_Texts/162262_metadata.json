It comes on the heels of a recent decision by the state\u2019s Executive Board to reject a request to release a Florida man early from prison, who fired a warning shot and received a 20 year prison sentence.\n\nListen to the story!\n\nThe Bill\n\nEver heard of a gun-related bill that could bring together the NRA, state attorneys, public defenders, police chiefs, the sheriffs association, among other stake holders?\n\nWell, there is such a bill by Sen. Aaron Bean (R-Jacksonville) that recently passed its first Senate committee.\n\n\u201cAll of these groups lined up and said, \u2018this is going to bring common sense,\u201d said Bean. \u201cThis is a great way to do it, and hopefully, we won\u2019t hear of these tragic stories of people who have never been in trouble with the law before, sentenced to 10 years in prison.\u2019 So, hopefully, we\u2019ll fix that and address that and go forward. We passed our first committee. So, we\u2019re pretty jacked up.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s talking about a bill that now eliminates 10-20-Life as a penalty for aggravated assault cases. Originally, it gave judges discretion in all cases associated with the minimum mandatory sentence.\n\nRep. Neil Combee\u2019s (R-Polk City) bill has not had a first hearing in the House, but he says he can\u2019t wait to make that change to his bill.\n\n\u201cWonderful news that we\u2019re going to be able to remove aggravated assault from 10-20-Life statute, which is what I tried to do back in 2013, and I just couldn\u2019t get enough folks comfortable or interested. But, now it seems like a lot of folks are interested in doing that,\u201d said Combee.\n\nHe says he\u2019s inspired to file the bill because of the disparity of some cases. For example, Combee says he\u2019s known cases where a person can serve two years of a three-year prison term for aggravated robbery with a firearm. Then, there\u2019s other cases, like Orville Lee Wollard\u2019s, charged with aggravated assault.\n\n\u201cYou look at a case like Lee Wollard, who is sitting in prison today,\u201d added Combee. \u201cHe fired a gun in his home, which he says was self-defense. He wouldn\u2019t accept a plea deal, and consequently, the judge had no choice but to impose the mandatory 20-year sentence on him.\u201d\n\nBoth Sides Tell Their Story\n\nWollard\u2019s case was recently before Florida Executive Clemency Board led by Governor Rick Scott. Wollard\u2019s daughter Sarah is among those who spoke on his behalf.\n\nShe says she wasn\u2019t always a model daughter, doing drugs, having amber alerts called on her because her parents didn\u2019t know where she was\u2014which she attributes to the negative influence of her boyfriend at the time.\n\n\u201cThe day that my dad shot the hole into the wall, me and my boyfriend were having an argument in my room,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cHe had caught me hanging out with one of my ex-boyfriends, and got mad, and called me a whore. And, in return, he punched me on the side of my face, hard enough to knock me into the wall, causing my vision to go blurry for a couple days afterwards, causing a really loud thud afterwards.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing the thud, she says her mother and sister then got her dad to see if he could intervene.\n\n\u201cAnd, my dad told him that he needed to leave several times and he wasn\u2019t going to let him hurt me anymore,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd, my boyfriend just kind of didn\u2019t take it seriously, and started to walk towards him. And, my dad said again, \u2018you have to have. You have five seconds to leave.\u2019 My boyfriend just kind of looked at him and smirked and thought it all was a big joke. So, my dad pointed the gun at the wall, and shot into it, which was a few feet away from my boyfriend.\u201d\n\nShe says she and her boyfriend later got the ball rolling on trying to get emancipated from her parents, by talking to police about the incident about a week later.\n\n\u201cSince 2008, I\u2019ve lived with the guilt every day that because of my selfishness, for wanting to be emancipated and just wanting to be independent, that my dad has now spent seven years in prison, which is a life that he\u2019s never going to be able to get back. And, I know that I was a horrible daughter back then, and that I can\u2019t change anything, but what I can do is now take responsibility and tell the truth in the hope that he won\u2019t have to spend the next 13 years there,\u201d Sarah continued.\n\nBut, Polk County State Attorney Jerry Hill says the family\u2019s version of the events is far from the truth. After showing pictures of the hole in the wall, he also showed pictures of a bag strap that appears like a bullet hole went through the strap.\n\nHill says it\u2019s the bag Sarah\u2019s boyfriend grabbed, right before he was about to leave, before Wollard fired the shot.\n\n\u201cI simply would suggest to you that this defendant is not the poster child,\u201d said Wollard. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t defending himself. He wasn\u2019t defending family. This victim was gone. It was unnecessary, and I suggest it\u2019s not a murder charge, by probably three or four inches.\u201d\n\nAnd, the Governor denied clemency for Wollard.\n\nWill The Bill Be Retroactive?\n\nStill, Sen. Rob Bradley (R-Fleming Island) says regardless of the bill\u2019s inspiration, the merits of the bill itself are sound. He\u2019s the one who got all the parties to agree on narrowing the bill.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re saying is that it\u2019s appropriate in certain cases for a judge to take a guilty verdict, and when it comes time to sentence the individual, not be hamstrung by a law that says 20 years is the only appropriate sentence for this individual, if the individual has no prior record, if no one was hurt, these are all mitigating factors that it\u2019s appropriate, I think, for a judge to consider when determining what is a just sentence. That doesn\u2019t mean the individual is innocent. That doesn\u2019t mean the individual doesn\u2019t deserved to be punished. That just means that 20 years may not be an appropriate proportional sentence for the crime that was committed.\u201d\n\nThe bill if it became law would take effect immediately. But, what about those who have already been sentenced under the statute, like Wollard? Bradley says while he\u2019s not working on legislation on behalf of any one individual, he says it\u2019s worth a discussion to look into cases that previously happened.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to have that discussion about whether it would be retroactive,. But, this a dialogue that we need to have with our friends in the House,\u201d said Bradley. \u201cThis is a dialogue we need to have with the Governor to see where our partners are comfortable.This is not meant to be a commentary on any particular cases that have happened recently. This is something that we\u2019ve talked about, at least, since my three years in the Senate.\u201d\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Florida lawmakers are hoping to continue moving a bill forward aimed at changing Florida\u2019s minimum mandatory sentencing rules.
