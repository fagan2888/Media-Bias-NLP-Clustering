Vernon, and Mason) and in Falls Church City, I hear: \u201cWe\u2019re pulling for you! You have our vote!\u201d\n\nIn Arlington and Alexandria, it\u2019s been: \u201cRUN BILL, RUN !\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve campaigned across the 8th district, voters have not just cheered us on, but have asked questions about where I stand on issues of vital importance to them. I answer just like I\u2019ve governed as mayor of Alexandria since 2003. I have the integrity, skills, honesty and humbleness to be the Congressman.\n\nI believe that EVERYONE should have the opportunity to succeed in our society. For more than 40 years, I have served my community \u2014 working as an elected official, as a businessman and with non-profit organizations. I grew up in public housing in Alexandria, then became the first in my family to attend college. I want more of our children to have the same educational opportunities I had. In Congress, I plan to continue the fight to educate our youth, pushing to make student loans more affordable and addressing the income disparities. Today, women make less than 77 cent for each dollar a man earns. I\u2019ll also take on Tea Party Republicans who want to cut education funding.\n\nI believe in a living wage for Northern Virginians. I passed Virginia\u2019s first living wage law. In Congress, I will support raising the federal minimum wage above $10 per hour.\n\nI believe in our small businesses. I\u2019ve led efforts in Alexandria to help small businesses secure the capital they need to thrive. In Congress, I will work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to help more entrepreneurs launch businesses in Virginia. I personally know the struggles of what a small business goes through. As Founder, President and CEO of William D. Euille and Associations \u2014 a contracting firm \u2014 not only did I employ people but I provided job readiness training and well as employ veterans.\n\nI believe in and will continue to defend a woman\u2019s right to determine her own medical care. As a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act, I will also work to make sure everyone has access to quality health care. I will not allow the Tea Party to undermine a woman\u2019s right to determine what happens with her own body. She must have full control over her own reproductive rights.\n\nI believe that everyone in our country is equal under the law. In Congress, I will push for legislation to ensure marriage equality and equal treatment for same-sex couples.\n\nI am running for Congress to continue the great work of my life, serving my community. For more than 40 years, I have worked as a public servant, as a businessman and with non-profit organizations. As mayor of Alexandria since 2003, I am the only candidate who has continuously worked to serve the entire region of Northern Virginia on issues important to all of us.\n\nI am the candidate who is ready to represent the 8th Congressional District on Day One.\n\nI ask for your vote on June 10th. Together, let\u2019s work to make sure everyone is part of our success in Northern Virginia. Send me because I care. Send me to Capitol Hill because I know how to get bills passed and finally send me because we are a great diverse district whose voices will be heard in Congress by electing me.", "article_metadata": {"city": "Arlington", "description": "Last week, we asked the candidates for the Democratic nomination in the 8th District congressional race to write a sub-750 word essay describing why Arlington", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "ARLnow.com - Arlington, Va. - Breaking News, Opinions & Community Happenings", "description": "Last week, we asked the candidates for the Democratic nomination in the 8th District congressional race to write a sub-750 word essay describing why Arlington residents should vote for them in the June 10 primary.\r\n\r\nHere is Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille's unedited response:\r\nSince I announced I", "title": "Bill Euille: Why You Should Vote for Me", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.arlnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Bill-Euille.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-05T12:06:16+00:00", "url": "https://www.arlnow.com/2014/06/05/bill-euille-why-you-should-vote-for-me/", "type": "article"}, "country": "USA", "State": "Virginia", "keywords": "bill euille,congress,election,primary,opinion,politics", "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-06-05T13:30:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-05T12:06:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8655\"", "article_summary": "Last week, we asked the candidates for the Democratic nomination in the 8th District congressional race to write a sub-750 word essay describing why Arlington residents should vote for them in the June 10 primary.\nIn Congress, I will work with the Small Business Administration (SBA) to help more entrepreneurs launch businesses in Virginia.\nYou have our vote!\u201dIn Arlington and Alexandria, it\u2019s been: \u201cRUN BILL, RUN !\u201dAs we\u2019ve campaigned across the 8th district, voters have not just cheered us on, but have asked questions about where I stand on issues of vital importance to them.\nHere is Alexandria Mayor Bill Euille\u2019s unedited response:Since I announced I was entering the race for Congress in January, I have received support and well wishes from voters in the 8th Congressional District.\nI am the candidate who is ready to represent the 8th Congressional District on Day One."}
