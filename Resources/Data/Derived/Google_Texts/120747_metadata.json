They pepper him with questions about sensitive topics like marijuana use, dating and pornography.\n\nUmar, 31, is a serious Islamic scholar who has studied the Quran in the Middle East, Europe and India \u2014 but he\u2019s also a native Californian, who is well-versed in social media and pop culture, and can connect with teens on their own terms.\n\nThat pedigree is rare \u2014 85 percent of fulltime, paid imams in the U.S. are foreign-born \u2014 but the demand for people like him is growing as American Muslim leaders look for ways to keep the religion relevant for young people in a secular country that cherishes freedom of expression.\n\nPHOTOS: Saudi woman's acclaimed film 'Wadjda' breaks down cultural barriers\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you hear in every mosque around the country now: \u2018We need someone who can connect with the youth.\u2019 And everyone is waiting for that person, like he\u2019s a superhero who can come and save the day,\u201d said Umar, who started his job nine months ago.\n\nWith a foot in both traditional Islam and U.S. pop culture, leaders like Umar are trying to help young Muslims embrace their American experience without letting go of Islamic traditions. It\u2019s part of a broader trend toward a more American style of congregational worship that includes everything from vibrant youth groups to health clinics to community service projects.\n\n\u201cThe demand for American-born imams is an articulation of something much deeper,\u201d said Timur Yuskaev, director of the Islamic chaplaincy program at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, which educates Islamic faith leaders.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a realization that assimilation is happening and it\u2019s going to happen. Now, how do we control it, how do we channel it?\u201d he said. \u201cThese congregations, if they do not provide the services that the congregants expect, then they will not survive.\u201d\n\nFor Umar, part of the strategy means confronting things like pre-marital sex, drugs and porn head-on \u2014 taboos in Islam but temptations that abound in America. Umar, a huge soccer fan, also bonds with his young charges over sports before gently steering the conversation back to faith.\n\n\u201cHe was just like us. He played sports, he studied for school just like us,\u201d said 17-year-old Tarek Soubra, recalling the day he met Umar. \u201cIt was, like, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s just like our friend.\u2019 It was really cool.\u201d\n\nThis informal approach is controversial with some Muslims, but those objections overlook the inevitable assimilation that\u2019s rapidly taking place, said Philip Clayton, provost at Claremont Lincoln University, which recently started a program for American Islamic leaders.\n\nMosques that remain insular, focus on ethnic identity and don\u2019t engage with the realities of being Muslim in America won\u2019t survive, he said. And the more engaged imams and mosques become, the less likely confused youth are to turn to radicalized forms of Islam, the way the Boston marathon bombing suspects did.\n\n\u201cI would say either American imams will learn how to be spiritual leaders of these young people or Islam will not flourish in the United States,\u201d Clayton said.\n\nStill, young Islamic leaders in the U.S. are clear that things like the five daily prayers, modest interaction between men and women, and bans on alcohol and pre-marital sex are inseparable from being Muslim. But in America, the application of those rules can look different.\n\nTeens go on co-ed field trips, for example, but chaperones are present. Mosques put on girls-only dances during high school prom season. And Islamic seminars for young adults take part in auditoriums divided down the middle by gender, said Nouman Ali Khan, 35, who founded Bayyinah, an Arabic institute in Dallas.\n\n\u201cThere are some guidelines in Islam that are there and they\u2019re not going to be compromised,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these things are unfairly assumed to mean that we\u2019re not social people and that we\u2019re not going to be successful in society.\u201d\n\nAbdelRahman Murphy, a 25-year-old assistant imam in Knoxville, Tenn., is striking that balance with his newly founded Muslim youth group called Roots. Kids play sports, battle it out in video-game playing contests or strut in a girls\u2019 Muslim fashion show with the tongue-in-cheek title \u201cCover Girl.\u201d\n\nMurphy, the son of an Egyptian immigrant mother and an Irish-American convert, was kicked out of a private Islamic middle school and strayed from the faith in high school \u2014 an experience he always keeps in mind.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t change what\u2019s inside the package, but we can repackage it,\u201d said Murphy, who tweets about college basketball and his faith.\n\nUmar\u2019s mosque, the Islamic Institute of Orange County, recently started monthly meetings that follow a game-show format, with two imams answering questions that teens text to an anonymous hotline. The organizers were shocked when there were questions about masturbation, drugs, porn, dating and drinking.\n\nThe sessions opened a much-needed dialogue about how to be successful as a Muslim and an American, said Samina Mohammad, who oversees the youth program.\n\nMohammad, 28, recently told a youth group how she secretly removed her head scarf on the way to school for two years because she loved her hair. Then, she attended a session for teens where, instead of lecturing about the importance of the head scarf, the imam compared a covered Muslim woman to a beautiful pearl hidden within an oyster.\n\n\u201cIt really hit home for me because I didn\u2019t understand that beauty was such a part of it,\u201d she said. \u201cI was trying to find my identity and I realized, \u2018Oh, he makes sense. That\u2019s what I need to do.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mustafa Umar, an imam in Southern California, is popular with the Muslim teenagers who attend his mosque.
