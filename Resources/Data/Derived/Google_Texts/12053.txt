Two men are dead after a shooting in Millville early this morning.

Panama City Police received a call around 2 a.m. Saturday morning from a neighbor about a disturbance at the hop n pop on the 13-hundred block of east 5th street.

When officers arrived, they found three men had been shot during an altercation.

Neighbors are in shock and say this is a quiet area.

"It's usually pretty quiet, but you never know what's going to happen,” said Greg Cornelison, Panama City resident.

"There's kids around here, this gas station is pretty popular,” said Dustin Robinson, Panama City Resident.

But officials say there have been a few incidents in the past.

"There's been some altercations there, it is one of the gas stations that stays open later there. Usually on Friday and Saturday night, there's a heavy volume of traffic,” said Sergeant Jon Morris, Panama City Police department.

Officials say 25-year old Marqueze Mcghee and 23-year old Xavier Buckler were both transported to bay medical center with life threatening injuries.

But shortly after arriving at the hospital they both died.

The third man involved, 26-year old Dalreco Franklin was treated and released with a gunshot wound to the leg.

"We're just looking for information left at the scene from what we understand. We believe the two individuals left the scene after this incident occurred."
