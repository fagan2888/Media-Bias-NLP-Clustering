Jeb Bush (R-FL), a potential candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, fielded a question from Alabama Republican Party chairwoman Terry Lathan asking what his first major action or order of business might be once he was elected.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAmong those priorities he cited included dealing with the regulatory \u201calphabet soup\u201d with a goal of reform in mind, undoing by executive order what his predecessor President Barack Obama had done through executive order that may have undermined the Constitution and to strengthen U.S. foreign policy by bettering our standing with our allies, which he cited to be Israel, Canada, Germany, our Latin American neighbors, Japan and Korea.\n\nBut he also went on to suggest that working across the aisle with Democrats would be a priority.\n\n\u201cThose three or four things would be the first things that I think are important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe final thing I would say, Terry, which may sound a little unorthodox is to actually talk to Democrats. It\u2019s extraordinary this president has no relationship with Republicans. There\u2019s no trust because our president doesn\u2019t believe that is a priority. You know, to fix big things, you have to do it in a bipartisan way. There\u2019s never been a time in American history where you jam it down the throats of the other party and expect a good result. Obamacare and Dodd-Frank \u2013 these are examples of horrible policy and it was done without any support of any single Republican. So if we weave a web of civility where you don\u2019t violate your principles by actually talking to people who don\u2019t agree with you \u2013 it\u2019s an essential part of restoring democracy in this country so we start fixing things.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeb Bush Cites Weaving a 'Web of Civility' with Dems Among Immediate Would-Be Presidential Priorities", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jeb Bush Cites Weaving a 'Web of Civility' with Dems Among Immediate Would-Be Presidential Priorities", "title": "Jeb Bush Cites Weaving a 'Web of Civility' with Dems Among Immediate Would-Be Presidential Priorities - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Bush527a.jpg", "height": 300}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/27/jeb-bush-cites-weaving-a-web-of-civility-with-dems-among-immediate-would-be-presidential-priorities/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeb Bush Cites Weaving a 'Web of Civility' with Dems Among Immediate Would-Be Presidential Priorities", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Bush527a.jpg", "title": "Jeb Bush Cites Weaving a 'Web of Civility' with Dems Among Immediate Would-Be Presidential Priorities - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "ALGOP, Jeb Bush,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Jeb Bush", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Jeb Bush", "published_time": "2015-05-27T21:18:12-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5ed\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn a conference call hosted by the Alabama Republican Party on Wednesday night, former Gov.\nJeb Bush (R-FL), a potential candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, fielded a question from Alabama Republican Party chairwoman Terry Lathan asking what his first major action or order of business might be once he was elected.\nObamacare and Dodd-Frank \u2013 these are examples of horrible policy and it was done without any support of any single Republican.\n\u201cThose three or four things would be the first things that I think are important,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe final thing I would say, Terry, which may sound a little unorthodox is to actually talk to Democrats."}
