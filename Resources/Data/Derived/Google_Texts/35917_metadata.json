Chris Christie called for funding to be taken away from cities that do not enforce federal immigration laws.\n\n\u201cThe laws on the books need to be enforced,\u201d said Christie, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president.\n\n\u201cPeople selectively decide to enforce the law. That\u2019s how we wound up with the murder we had in San Francisco. You can\u2019t just pick and choose the laws you want to enforce. The law is the law.\u201d\n\nChristie was referring to the recent death of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle, who was murdered allegedly at the hands of a man who has been convicted of seven felonies and deported from the U.S. five times.\n\n.@GovChristie talks Q&A with Iowans near the University of Northern Iowa campus #iacaucus pic.twitter.com/GmGFYtp0i8 \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) July 31, 2015\n\nChristie criticized the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, calling it \u201cawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the things contained in this agreement are a loss for the United States.\u201d\n\nHe urged Congress to say no to the deal.\n\nIn outlining his 12-point plan on entitlements, Christie said he is not okay with 71 percent of the federal budget being spent on entitlements and debt service.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the problem. Even with all that spending we\u2019re doing, our major entitlement programs are heading towards insolvency,\u201d Christie said.\n\nHe talked through two points of his plan. He said the retirement age needs to be raised by two years and social security and Medicare need to be fixed.\n\nIn the question and answer session of his appearance here, Christie said he supports defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cI am the first pro-life governor ever elected in the history of the state of New Jersey.\u201d\n\nChristie also called for an \u201cequal opportunity for every kid\u201d in education. He suggested longer school days and a longer school year.\n\nAnother issue he cleared up with the crowd: his views on climate change.\n\n\u201cI believe in climate change. And human beings contribute to it.\u201d\n\nChristie feels a market-based approach needs to be taken to address the issue. He does not feel that the issue can be dealt with by raising taxes on utility bills.\n\n.@GovChristie on marijuana and sanctuary cities: \u201cthe law is the law\u201d #iacaucus pic.twitter.com/5Lws7TbpyC \u2014 Leah Jessen (@_LeahKay_) August 1, 2015\n\nTalking more broadly about illegal immigration, Christie said he does not support building a wall across the entire southern border of the U.S. He said certain areas should have a wall, but only where it is \u201ceffective and needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need the national government to establish and maintain our national borders.\u201d\n\nHe said drones and cameras should be used to monitor the border. He sees value in E-verify for employers to ensure employees are legal citizens.\n\n\u201cWe want people to come to America legally.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaking at an Iowa sports bar, New Jersey Gov.
