Instead, he is raising more money and telling the same lies all over again, as he continues his push for mass amnesty and mass immigration.\u201d\n\nAnother subsection of the memo entitled \u201cAMERICAN WORKERS CAN\u2019T CUT IT\u201d states:\n\nIn a for-attribution interview with Ryan Lizza, two senior Rubio staffers expressed frustration that they couldn\u2019t get even more foreign workers crammed into the bill for their boss. They explained: \u2018There are American workers who, for lack of a better term, can\u2019t cut it.\u2019 Rubio\u2019s spokesman \u2014 now his campaign spokesman \u2014 also compared opponents of amnesty to slaveholders. More on that here.\n\nThe memo also documents the back-room deals involved in the bill. A subsection entitled, \u201cIMMIGRATION-FOR-PROFIT\u201d reports that \u201cRubio\u2019s lawyer, who wrote the bill, also enriched his clients through it.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cREFUGEES\u201d subsection notes: \u201cRubio\u2019s bill included language giving the President unprecedented power to expand refugee resettlement.\u201c\n\nThe \u201cFIANC\u00c9 VISAS\u201d subsection points out that \u201cRubio\u2019s bill opened the floodgates for fianc\u00e9 visas \u2014 and fianc\u00e9 children \u2014 an unprecedented security risk and another handout to the foreign immigration lobby.\u201d\n\nIn a subsection titled, \u201cDECEIVING LAW ENFORCEMENT,\u201d the memo states:\n\nRevealing Rubio\u2019s character, it is also worth recalling that during his introduction press conference, Rubio stood frozen like a statue as ICE officer, council President, and former Marine Chris Crane was removed from the room for trying to ask a question. Shameful. Crane would later testify: \u2018Never have I seen such contempt for law enforcement as I\u2019ve seen from the Gang of Eight.\u2019\n\nIn a section entitled, \u201cBACK TO HIS OLD WAYS,\u201d the memo notes that \u201cRubio is also the only candidate in the race still advocating citizenship for all illegal immigrants, and all that necessarily entails in terms of fiscal costs and chain migration. (Jeb\u2019s book did not call for universal citizenship, as Rubio does.) To this day, Rubio has not backed off a single policy in the Gang of Eight bill (see more here).\u201d\n\nThe conclusion of Schlafly\u2019s memo is posted here in full:\n\nThere is no single major distinguishing policy difference between Marco Rubio, John McCain or Lindsey Graham. They have the same trade policy, immigration policy and foreign policy. But on immigration most especially \u2014 the issue in which all four have invested the most \u2014 there is no daylight separating them. The difference, then, is one of persona, not policy. And in the arena of immigration, this translates into a vital difference. The biggest change from McCain-Kennedy, which could not get out of the Senate, and the Gang of Eight \u2014 which was nursed along by conservative pundits despite being to the left of Kennedy\u2019s bill \u2014 was the presence of Rubio. Rubio created the conditions necessary to produce a considerably more open borders bill: conservatives who were invested in the Rubio Brand provided no early pushback but accepted Kennedy\u2019s old talking points, and Rubio gave red state Democrats the political space necessary to support it. This is how it got 68 votes in the Senate. The stakes of course are raised considerably if Rubio is President or Vice President. Rubio would have a much, much better chance than Obama of getting an open borders bill through Congress \u2014 while Boehner could refuse to bring up Obama\u2019s mass immigration/amnesty bill for vote in 2014, Ryan would never refuse Rubio\u2019s bill. Rubio\u2019s presence, as it did with the Gang of Eight, would create the cover for both certain Republicans and all Democrats to get behind a far more open borders plan. Given that nearly every House Democrat sponsored the Gang of Eight House version (including Pelosi and Gutierrez), Ryan would not need to gather that many additional votes (House GOP leaders might have refused Obama\u2019s 2014 request for a vote but they would not refuse President Rubio\u2019s). All of which adds up to: there is likely no person in the United States of America in a better position to enact mass immigration legislation than a President Rubio \u2014 no one who could deliver more votes in both parties for open borders immigration. Senator Rubio is not Main Street\u2019s Obama, he is Wall Street\u2019s Obama: President Obama was a hardcore leftist running as centrist; Senator Rubio is a Wall Street globalist running as a tea party conservative. Unlike other legislation, the effects of bad immigration policy cannot be repealed. They are forever. The Republican party would never nominate a pro-Obamacare candidate, and it must be an even stronger maxim that it should not nominate any candidate who is committed to a policy of mass immigration. Rubio wrote the Obamacare of immigration policies: a bill that would have eviscerated the middle class, plunged millions into poverty, legalized the most dangerous aliens on the planet, overwhelmed our schools and safety nets, and done irreversible violence to the idea of America as a nation-state. Rubio is the candidate of open borders, Obamatrade and mass immigration, making one last attempt to pull off one big con.\n\nYou can read the entire memo here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Phyllis Schlafly Issues Rubio Betrayal Memo", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Phyllis Schlafly Issues Rubio Betrayal Memo", "title": "Phyllis Schlafly Issues Rubio Betrayal Memo", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Phyllis-Schlafly-Marco-Rubio.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-02-05T20:48:56-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/05/phyllis-schlalfy-issues-rubio-betrayal-memo/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Phyllis Schlafly Issues Rubio Betrayal Memo", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Phyllis-Schlafly-Marco-Rubio.jpg", "title": "Phyllis Schlafly Issues Rubio Betrayal Memo", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "fianc\u00e9 visas, gang of eight, Mark Levin, National Review, Phyllis Schlafly, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Marco Rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-02-05T18:50:26-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T20:48:56-07:00", "tag": "Sean Hannity", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "They have the same trade policy, immigration policy and foreign policy.\nSenator Rubio is not Main Street\u2019s Obama, he is Wall Street\u2019s Obama: President Obama was a hardcore leftist running as centrist; Senator Rubio is a Wall Street globalist running as a tea party conservative.\nRubio is the candidate of open borders, Obamatrade and mass immigration, making one last attempt to pull off one big con.\nUnlike other legislation, the effects of bad immigration policy cannot be repealed.\n\u201cRubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him,\u201d the memo states."}
