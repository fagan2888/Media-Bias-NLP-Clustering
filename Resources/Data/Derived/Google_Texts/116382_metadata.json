However, Clinton, who is locked in a neck and neck race with Bernie Sanders for the Nevada Caucus, may not know what to think about her election being touted by \u201cHookers 4 Hillary,\u201d a group of sex workers who ply their trade at the Moonlight Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel near Carson City, Nevada, and similar establishments, including the Alien Cat House located near Area 51.\n\nThe working girls based their endorsement on four main points.\n\nFirst, Hillary Clinton will protect Obamacare, which providing the ladies with health insurance for the first time. Apparently, this was not available before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, even though some of the ladies earn six figure incomes.\n\nSecond, Ms. Clinton has foreign policy experience. This section does not mention Benghazi of the Russian reset, but it does mention the Secret Service\u2019s Colombia prostitute scandal. The ladies want President Hillary Clinton to make sure that the agents \u201cbuy American\u201d from now on.\n\nThird, Clinton will protect federal agencies that safeguard public health, particularly sexually transmitted diseases, a significant concern for women in their line of work.\n\nFinally, Clinton will make sure that the country will not return to supply side economics and will make sure that the wealthy, including their boss Dennis Hoff, pay their fair share of taxes. They believe that only thus will potential customers have the discretionary income necessary to enjoy the services available at Nevada\u2019s legal brothels.\n\nThe ladies will campaign for Hillary Clinton as only they can, offering discounts and \u201cextra time\u201d to any customer who agrees to caucus for the candidate.\n\nIronically, most of the working girls now supporting Clinton supported libertarian leaving Ron Paul in 2012. Paul\u2019s economic philosophy is vastly different than that of Ms. Clinton, focusing on drastic tax and spending cuts. What caused the flip-flop is something that can best only be speculated about.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Election 2016,Democratic Party", "author": "Blasting News", "og": {"site_name": "Blasting News", "description": "The group of independent businesswoman offer special deals in Nevada for Clinton supporters", "title": "'Hookers 4 Hillary' support Ms. Clinton for president as only they can", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/news/2016/02/hookers-4-hillary-support-ms-clinton-for-president-as-only-they-can-00795253.html", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "http://static.blastingnews.com/media/photogallery/2016/2/18/main/candiate-hillary-clinton-credit-state-dept_608521.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 347}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The group of independent businesswoman offer special deals in Nevada for Clinton supporters...", "title": "'Hookers 4 Hillary' support Ms. Clinton for president as only they can", "url": "http://goo.gl/9cCbrK", "image": "http://static.blastingnews.com/media/photogallery/2016/2/18/main/candiate-hillary-clinton-credit-state-dept_608521.jpg", "creator": "@BlastingNews", "site": "@BlastingNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "follow", "revisit-after": "1 weeks", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The group of independent businesswoman offer special deals in Nevada for Clinton supporters"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbfbf\"", "article_summary": "Usually, a presidential candidate welcomes the endorsement of a group of \u2013 shall we say \u2013 independent businesswomen, especially if said candidate is Hillary Clinton.\nThe ladies want President Hillary Clinton to make sure that the agents \u201cbuy American\u201d from now on.\nFirst, Hillary Clinton will protect Obamacare, which providing the ladies with health insurance for the first time.\nThe ladies will campaign for Hillary Clinton as only they can, offering discounts and \u201cextra time\u201d to any customer who agrees to caucus for the candidate.\nPaul\u2019s economic philosophy is vastly different than that of Ms. Clinton, focusing on drastic tax and spending cuts."}
