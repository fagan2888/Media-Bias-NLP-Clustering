Encino Motorcars, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Encino, Calif., claims they are similar to sales personnel, employees and mechanics who handle parts.\n\nIt was inquired by Justice Stephen Breyer to know why service advisers are not treated like traditional employees like secretaries.\n\n\u201cI mean, apparently Congress thought that the mechanics themselves were special because they go out into agricultural areas or something in the middle of the night and fix a tractor, so they work irregular hours,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these people don\u2019t work irregular hours and they\u2019re not paid on commission.\u201d\n\nPaul Clement, Encino\u2019s attorney, said advisers are paid in commission partially, which is shared with other dealership employees.\n\n\u201cSo as a practical matter, it makes an awful lot of sense to exempt all of these people from the overtime rules,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all paid well. They\u2019re all paid above the minimum wage, which is, the exemption doesn\u2019t apply to anyways, and they all have a reason to work about 46 hours a week instead of 40 hours a week.\u201d\n\nIn 2011 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a interpretation from the Department of Labor that separated dealership employees from separated service advisers.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito questioned why employees who handle parts are included if service advisers are not.\n\nArguing on behalf of the service advisers that sued Encino Motorcars, Stephanos Bibas said part handlers are expressly named in the statute, serving as the mechanic\u2019s right-hand man or woman.\n\nBut it was Alito\u2019s concern as to why employees handling parts are covered though they are not engaging in any manual labor.\n\n\u201cYou have to explain why the line is drawn between that activity and the activity of the employees who are at issue here,\u201d said Alito.\n\nBilbas said service advisors are still an integral part of the process even though they are not repairing vehicles.\n\nSource: Justice weigh overtime pay for auto service advisers at dealerships\n\nPhoto credit: www.autotrainingcentre.com\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court weighs auto service advisers overtime pay at dealerships, discussing whether service advisers at car dealerships should be exempt.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Eric Needs", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "Supreme Court weighs auto service advisers overtime pay at dealerships, discussing whether service advisers at car dealerships should be exempt.", "title": "Supreme Court Weighs Auto Service Advisers Overtime Pay - Legal Reader", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/woman-speaking-to-mechanic-near-vehicle.jpg", "url": "http://www.legalreader.com/supreme-court-weighs-auto-service-advisers-overtime-pay/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 1598871133679697}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thelegalreader", "section": "News & Politics", "published_time": "2016-04-24T23:49:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Supreme Court weighs auto service advisers overtime pay at dealerships, discussing whether service advisers at car dealerships should be exempt from overtime pay under federal labor laws.\nSource: Justice weigh overtime pay for auto service advisers at dealershipsPhoto credit: www.autotrainingcentre.comJoin the Discussion\nIt was inquired by Justice Stephen Breyer to know why service advisers are not treated like traditional employees like secretaries.\nJustice Samuel Alito questioned why employees who handle parts are included if service advisers are not.\nArguing on behalf of the service advisers that sued Encino Motorcars, Stephanos Bibas said part handlers are expressly named in the statute, serving as the mechanic\u2019s right-hand man or woman."}
