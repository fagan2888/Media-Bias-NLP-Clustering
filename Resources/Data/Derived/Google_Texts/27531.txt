An 11-year-old girl from Massachusetts is battling a rare disease, but she's getting by with a little help from her service dog George. Facebook

Fifth grader Bella Burton, 11, doesn't go anywhere without her 131-pound Great Dane service dog named George.

The New York Daily News reports the two have been together since Bella's Morquio syndrome (MS) forced her to use crutches or a wheelchair to get around last year. MS "is a rare inherited birth defect that is estimated to occur in one of every 200,000 births," The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia finds, with the condition generally marked by a lack of enzymes to break down materials in the body's cells.

The disease impairs bone development the most, and most children with Morquio syndrome have trouble walking by the time they're Bellaâ€™s age.The Daily News added George's "size makes him a perfect friend to lean on."

"I love him," Bella said. "He likes to play. He helps me walk."

Bella and George have amassed over 10,000 fans on their Facebook page, which was set up after the dog moved in with the family 10 months ago. George is from the Ipswich-based Service Dog Project, where Great Danes are provided to those with mobility impairments.

"They were looking to see if a smaller dog came along, but he kind of picked her," Bella's mom said. "For us, keeping her up and keeping her active has been one of the big things, because the more she's active the better it is for her condition."
