And KSDK-TV reported that sources said Mr. Jackson \u201cwas warned about a plot\u201d by federal authorities, but \u201cnot given a lot of detail.\u201d\n\nFederal authorities said they have recordings of the suspects\u2019 conversations related to their plots.\n\nThe New Black Panthers, meanwhile, disdained the charges and accusations as \u201ctrumped up and baseless\u201d and \u201ctotally unfounded,\u201d the New York Daily News reported.\n\nBoth Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Davis pleaded not guilty to all charges earlier this week. Police say they could face more charges in the days to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "St. Louis-area media outlets are reporting that two New Black Panther Party men were plotting to use the Ferguson chaos that was projected post-grand jury ruling as a shield to kill Police Chief Tom Jackson and prosecutor Bob McCulloch.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "St. Louis-area media outlets are reporting that two New Black Panther Party men were plotting to use the Ferguson chaos that was projected post-grand jury ruling as a shield to kill Police Chief Tom Jackson and prosecutor Bob McCulloch.", "title": "New Black Panthers accused of plot to kill Bob McCulloch, Tom Jackson", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/28/new-black-panthers-accused-of-plot-to-kill-bob-mcc/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/28/ap110210039761.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/28/ap110210039761.jpg", "description": "St. Louis-area media outlets are reporting that two New Black Panther Party men were plotting to use the Ferguson chaos that was projected post-grand jury ruling as a shield to kill Police Chief Tom J", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "New Black Panthers accused of plot to kill Bob McCulloch, Tom Jackson"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
