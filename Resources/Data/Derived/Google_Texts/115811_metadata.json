Is the child car seat sitting squarely on the seat of the car?\n\nMost of the base of the child car seat should be flat on the seat, sitting squarely and evenly. It shouldn't be riding up, which can sometimes happen if the seatbelt is too short.\n\n2. If the seat is rearward facing, is the handlebar in the correct position?\n\nFor some rearward-facing child car seats, the handlebar may need to be in a certain position, usually upright or fully back, as it can offer added 360 degree protection if your vehicle turns over in a crash. Look at your child car seat's instruction manual to find out where yours should be.\n\n3. Is the seatbelt secure and untwisted?\n\nIf your child car seat is secured with a seatbelt, this must be tight so the seat doesn't move. To test this, try pushing down on the seat where your baby's head would be if the seat is rearward facing, and pulling on the harness if it's forward facing - you shouldn't be able to move the seat. The seatbelt mustn't be twisted anywhere around the seat.\n\n4. Is the seatbelt following the correct red or blue route guides?\n\nNot having the seatbelt securely fitted into the route guides will weaken the seat's protection. Check it\u2019s right \u2013 red guides for forward-facing seats, blue guides for rearward-facing seats\n\n5. Is the seatbelt buckle in the right place?\n\nThe seatbelt buckle must not bend around the child car seat as this could cause it to fail in a crash. Only the seatbelt should be in contact with the frame of the child car seat.\n\n6. For Isofix seats, do the visual indicators show it is fitted correctly?\n\nVisual indicators should show you that the seat is correctly clipped into the car, for example sections may turn from red to green. Check the instructions to see what this should look like for your seat.\n\n7. Is your Isofix drop down foot securely on the floor, and/or is the top tether firmly attached?\n\nIf you have an Isofix car seat, you will have either a drop-down foot or a top tether or both. With the foot, you must ensure it sits firmly on the floor and isn't lifting the seat up. It also mustn't sit on underfloor storage as this could make it less effective in a crash.\n\nThe top tether must go over the back of the seat and clip into the dedicated mounting point - be careful not to attach it to luggage hooks.\n\n8. Have you removed any thick clothes?\n\nThick clothes like bulky winter jackets, could make the harness less effective.\n\n9. Are the shoulder pads level with your child\u2019s shoulders and is the harness not too tight or loose?\n\nThe shoulder pads of the harness should be as level with your child's shoulders as possible and the harness shouldn't be too tight or loose - make sure you can get two fingers between the child\u2019s collar bone and the harness and there is no slackness.\n\n10. Is the seatbelt across their shoulder and hips?\n\nIf you have an older child strapped into their car seat with the seatbelt, this should sit on their shoulder. It shouldn't cut into their neck or sit lower down on their arm. The lap part of the seatbelt should sit across their hips, not their tummy.\n\nSee our video on how to fit a child car seat for more information on what you should and shouldn't do when fitting you car seat.
