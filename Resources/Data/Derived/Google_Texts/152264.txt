A deputy was seriously injured after a two-vehicle rollover crash in Immokalee on Sunday morning.

The crash happened in the 1000 block of New Market Road W. near Lee Street around 6:30 a.m.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers say a Nissan Altima, driven by 32-year-old Vanessa Wagenman, was fleeing from the Collier County Sheriff's Office.

The Altima was going northeast on Lee Street approaching New Market Road. At the same time, a Collier County Sheriff's Office patrol car was traveling northwest on New Market Road approaching Lee Street.

The Altima failed to stop at a stop sign on Lee Street and crashed into the patrol car. The patrol car flipped and ended up on its roof. The Altima continued to go north and crashed into a brick wall.

The female deputy was seriously injured. We're told she was airlifted to the hospital.

Wagenman suffered minor injuries. She was taken to North Collier Hospital.

Charges are pending.
