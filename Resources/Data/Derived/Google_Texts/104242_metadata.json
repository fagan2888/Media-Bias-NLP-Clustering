Ted Cruz is one of those people who constantly wrestles with the Constitution \u2014 and always wins.\n\nIn his latest declaration to mount the barricades in defense of the Constitution, the Texas senator said he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d filibuster any nominee the president puts forward to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\n\u201cThe Senate\u2019s duty is to advise and consent,\u201d Mr. Cruz told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re advising that a lame-duck president in an election year is not going to be able to tip the balance of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nNow, I am one of those people who believes the death of Justice Scalia very well may be the tipping point in America where the high court finally, fully and irreversibly embraces anti-constitutional lawlessness. There are examples of disdain for the Constitution throughout history, and especially in the past half-century. But a court without Justice Scalia today will have nothing but hostility for the Constitution. It will exude from every decision of every case.\n\nBut how does someone like Mr. Cruz make such a stupid, lazy, self-serving \u2014 and, I would argue, unconstitutional \u2014 threat such as declaring he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d filibuster any nominee the president puts forward? He is saying that, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will refuse to even consider any nominee President Obama makes. Isn\u2019t he essentially saying that he is refusing to perform his constitutional responsibility to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d?\n\nAnd then he goes on to say that by refusing to do his job, he and the Senate are advising the president that a \u201clame-duck\u201d executive is not allowed to \u201ctip the balance of the Supreme Court\u201d in an election year. Not sure where he found that little nugget, but it isn\u2019t in the Constitution. It sounds like something Sen. Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, would say talking about the \u201cideological balance\u201d of the Supreme Court.\n\nThe only difference now between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Schumer is that Mr. Schumer and his dastardly Democrats always win, and Mr. Cruz and his hapless Republicans always lose. Remember Mr. Cruz\u2019s gallant vows to \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d with a filibuster on the Senate floor?\n\nWith Justice Scalia\u2019s replacement, the stakes are even higher. And it is an area where Republicans have an even greater record of losing. This is because, for 40 years of judicial nomination fights, Republicans bring their very best rules and strategies of checkers to play high-stakes games of chess against Democrats.\n\nDemocrats are so successful in this area, they actually have Republicans on the defensive over nominees who simply believe that the Constitution means just what it says and that it is only a \u201cliving document\u201d through the constitutional amendment process.\n\nBut let\u2019s forget for the moment how constitutionally spurious Mr. Cruz\u2019s threat is that he will refuse to consider any nominee. Let\u2019s just focus on the strategic sense of the very public threat he has made.\n\nBy declaring upfront that he will reject any nominee, Mr. Cruz lays the groundwork for President Obama and Democrats to make an absolute mockery of any filibuster that Republicans do ultimately mount. Since they were going to do it anyway, it obviously has nothing to do with the radical nature or lack of merits of the eventual nominee, the Democrats can rightly argue.\n\nIn addition to neutering the effectiveness of a filibuster, Mr. Cruz is essentially baiting the president into putting forth the most insanely radical nominee he can conjure up. And, given the Republicans\u2019 record for winning these fights \u2014 and especially Mr. Cruz\u2019s record \u2014 we innocent citizens can all but guarantee that whatever judicial nut job Mr. Obama sends over will eventually be the one who replaces the great Antonin Scalia.\n\nSo why, exactly, would Mr. Cruz make such a reckless threat at this crucial moment in America? Would it have anything to do with the fact that he happens to be running for president right now and desperately needs to stir up votes in South Carolina this weekend?\n\nEarlier I said Mr. Cruz always loses while Mr. Schumer always wins. I should be more precise. Actually, Ted Cruz always wins. Personally, anyway. It is Republicans and conservatives who always pay the price and lose.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com.
