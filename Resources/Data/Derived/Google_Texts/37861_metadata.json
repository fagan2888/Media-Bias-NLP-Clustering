Covered in shoe grease, like a pair out of Dickens, they looked bored with shining shoes.\n\nAssad, the smaller of the two, was missing a few teeth, and sweating in a threadbare sweater in the heat. Abdullah, taller but with a baby-face just as sweet, had a scar on his cheek that I mistook for a falling tear.\n\n\u201cDo you want to take some photos with my iPad?\u201d I asked in Arabic, hoping to give them a break from the usual routine. To my surprise, Abdullah took the iPad in his hands and pointed it at the sky \u2014 infatuated with the interplay of branches and clouds.\n\nWhen a low-flying airplane trespassed into the frame, the boys flinched and screamed.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Assad explained, \u201cbut when we see planes in Syria, they drop bombs.\u201d\n\nArms flapping, heads bent back, Assad and Abdullah began to show me how a body shakes when it\u2019s being struck with bullets. In a slow-moving dance, as if in a trance, they morphed into missiles hitting buildings and snipers shooting machine guns.\n\n\u201cWhen my uncle got his leg blown off in Syria, he was hopping like this,\u201d Assad said, hopping on one leg.\n\nWatching them act out the horrors of their hometown, I tried to think of how I might help.\n\n\u201cIf you could make any wish,\u201d I asked, \u201cwhat would it be?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo go to school!\u201d they said, telling me all about their school in Syria, which was blown to bits in the war. Since I knew that enrolling them in a Lebanese school would be impossible, I tried thinking of alternative ways for them to learn.\n\nSeeing their joy in taking photos with my iPad, I proposed we try making some art together with photography, performance and film \u2014 patterned on a program I used to run at Brown University for at-risk Providence youth. Since Assad and Abdullah couldn\u2019t take time off of work, we agreed to meet on the run \u2014 in between office hours and shoe shines.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with a play called \u2018Waiting for Godot,\u2019\u201d I said. After I explained to them the plot of the play \u2014 two guys waiting for a third who never comes \u2014 the boys laughed, and noted the play\u2019s parallel to their own lives lived in limbo.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it,\u201d Abdullah said, checking an imaginary watch on his wrist, and asking when Godot was going to show. Within minutes, they transformed before my eyes into Vladimir and Estragon. Didi and Gogo. A pair of Syrian street kids, vamping as tramps.\n\nRehearsing \u201cGodot,\u201d though, was just the beginning. Soon, they were playing different characters from their daily lives. The alcoholic landlord threatening to evict them. The policeman confiscating their shoe-shine kits. The shopkeepers chasing them away. When I took them on their first boat ride, Assad stood up in the boat, and declared, \u201cI am Samuel Beckett!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Abdullah replied, \u201cI am Samuel Beckett!\u201d\n\nWhenever we meet on the street, we shine each other\u2019s shoes. Take photos of graffiti. Stroll the Corniche. Some days, I teach them Chinese. Ni hao. Other days, Indonesian. Terima kasih. Foreign phrases I don\u2019t expect them to remember, but it helps to pass the time. Our only pedagogy is spontaneity \u2014 it has to be.\n\nOn curbs around Beirut, the boys view photos of my travels around the world. Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Iran. To them, my Ivy League credentials are of no account. All they want is a teacher \u2014 and any teacher will do.\n\nOn weekends, we venture outside of Beirut for a change in scenery. In the mountaintop town of Harissa, we climbed a 15-ton bronze statue of the Virgin Mary overlooking the sea. At El Rancho, a dude ranch in the hills, we encountered Lebanese cowboys and teepees. Perhaps because of my family\u2019s Native American history, I struggled in Arabic to explain the concept of a cowboy.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to shoot any guns,\u201d Assad said. He\u2019d seen enough real shooting in Syria. Instead, he wanted to take one of the ranch\u2019s horses for a ride.\n\n\u201cThis reminds me of my horses back home!\u201d Assad said from his saddle, with a smile as wide as the corral.\n\n\u201cHow many horses do you have in Syria?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cNone anymore,\u201d he said, \u201cthey all died in the war.\u201d Cows, cats, dogs, donkeys, butterflies, pigeons, and worms. All of his beloved animals, he said, were dead.\n\nWhen it came time for us to walk to the exit, Assad took a detour to the saloon, and picked up a BB gun. With his eyes closed, he tried hitting the target. Bang, bang, bang.\n\nIt\u2019s little surprise that their favorite word is majnoon. Syria majnoon. Syria is crazy. Lubnan majnoon. Lebanon is crazy. Polis majnoon. The police are crazy. Koolo majnoon. Everyone is crazy.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I don\u2019t have kids of my own that I enjoy spoiling these kids rotten. Maybe it\u2019s because I was adopted that I tend to look out for children whose parents are struggling or far away. Maybe it\u2019s because I am far from home myself that I feel unsettled too \u2014 we are strangers together in a strange land.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was a professor far from home.
