One local church is taking a look back at all the history African Americans have accomplished.

The Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Collinsville put on its annual black history program Sunday afternoon. Church members sang, spoke and acted out scenes from history. The program's speaker was Derrick Johnson, the state president for the Mississippi NAACP. Church members say the main message they want to get out is African American achievement.

"Just to be so proud of themselves and what they have done," program coordinator Marion Sam says. "The imprint they have done in society. It's not heard a whole lot. But we're hoping we can get the message out. "

Sam describes the annual program as a celebration.
