Focusing on that question will allow us to move beyond our endless squabble over how many people have an insurance card in their wallet.\n\nThe obsession with coverage, on both sides of the aisle, has diverted us from the more important questions: How good is the care that those cards provide? How much health does that care produce? And how much more health could we produce if we allowed healthcare to innovate in the way that information technology has done so spectacularly?\n\nThese questions are the focus of my recent study, \u201cFortress and Frontier in American Health Care,\u201d published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. A 4-page summary is here.\n\nIf an encomium matters to you, Jeffrey Flier, dean of the Harvard School of Medicine, just tweeted this about my paper: \u201cLong read, must read - if you are interested in health and health reform. What we should be talking about.\u201d\n\nOnce we shift our focus away from insurance cards and toward innovation, new worlds open up.\n\nThe study argues that the usual right-left divide in healthcare policy is an expensive and deadly red herring, stranding us between an unworkable Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and a stack of thin-broth repeal-and-replace proposals. It argues that the real distinction between healthcare and information technology over the past quarter-century was that the two industries were governed by radically different worldviews, \u201cthe Fortress and the Frontier,\u201d each enjoying a broad bipartisan consensus at the federal and state levels.\n\nHealthcare existed in the Fortress, where public policy has two overarching goals. First is to imagine every horrid thing that can happen in healthcare and to devote massive resources to preventing those hypothetical adverse events. Second is to build a legal and regulatory structure that protects established insiders from outside innovators who might threaten their turf.\n\nDuring these same years, information technology flourished on the Frontier. Consumers and producers were allowed to take significant risks. And outsiders like Steve Jobs were free to challenge and defeat insiders like IBM.\n\nMy study summarizes the results through a thought experiment. Imagine taking a time machine back to 1989. Tell a crowd about the advances in medicine over the past 25 years: statins, new vaccines, face transplants. Very likely, they\u2019ll be pleased but not particularly shocked. They\u2019ll be most surprised, perhaps, by the unraveling of the human genome, but I would argue that\u2019s more IT than it is healthcare.\n\nIn contrast, tell the 1989 crowd about the changes in IT: iPads, smartphones, Kindle, YouTube, Siri, Skype, Google, Google Translate, iTunes, bitcoin. Tell them how many of these services come for free or a small price. They will gasp in disbelief.\n\nThe reaction to this thought experiment is often a reflexive assertion that healthcare and IT are worlds apart ethically\u2014that healthcare is about life, death, pain, and suffering, while IT is just machines on a desk or in a pocket. But I argue that IT conveys life, death, pain, and suffering just as much as healthcare does.\n\nOn the downside, IT provides new and terrifying modes of financial fraud, stalking, bullying, destruction of reputations, identity theft, and privacy violations. Failures of telemetry can be devastating in a hospital or on an airliner. Cellphones and the Internet were crucial elements of improvised explosive devices in Iraq and the devastation of 9/11. Conversely, they have given us previously unimaginable ways to save lives (e.g., hospital telemetry, OnStar, GPS-driven 911 services).\n\nOnce we shift our focus away from insurance cards and toward innovation, new worlds open up, as do new public policy questions that do not fall neatly into a left-versus-right pigeonhole. Note that in 25 years, IT has moved from the province of the wealthy to (borrowing a term from healthcare policy) universal coverage. Third World village children now carry smartphones whose power is beyond the world\u2019s supercomputers from a generation ago.\n\nWe need to make healthcare as innovative in the next 25 years as IT has been in the past 25 years.\n\nNotice, too, that attaining universal coverage in IT did not involve decades of partisan rancor or a gigantic bureaucracy to oversee innovation. The iPad and smartphone were not victories for the left or right. They did not, by and large, come from old, established IT firms. The substantial dangers that they posed to people were dealt with quickly and efficiently as real problems arose.\n\nShift the healthcare policy in this direction, and lots of near-term bipartisan initiatives present themselves. For what it\u2019s worth, my study offers a few dozen places where policymakers can begin building these political bridges. These initiatives would help shift us toward a new goal for healthcare policy: \u201cto provide better health to more people at lower cost, year after year.\u201d To make that goal a reality, we need to make healthcare as innovative in the next 25 years as IT has been in the past 25 years.\n\nRobert F.
