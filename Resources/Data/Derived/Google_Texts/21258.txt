Mike Huckabee is offering supporters a truly remarkable piece of campaign swag: In exchange for a donation, they can take their guns and shoot up a target marked with the word ‘Obamacare’!

“Let’s show President Obama we believe in the Constitution and the 2nd Amendment – not gun control,” Huckabee’s fundraising page says. “We stand opposed to his executive order AND his out-of-control Washington policies.”

“Donate $25 and receive a pack of three targets for your next trip to the range.”

In addition to the Obamacare target pictured above (which depicts the president’s name and the “O” campaign logo) Huckabee is also offering donors the chance to shoot Common Core education standards — which are not Obama’s policies at all, but began as an initiative of the states to synchronize their school curricula. (Obama has supported Common Core, and created financial incentives to adopt it. And so the right wing has turned it into another bogeyman.)

And there is also the large and complicated federal tax code, which Huckabee wants to replace with a regressive national retail sales tax as the federal government’s primary source of income.

It’s perhaps worth noting that if some hypothetical Huckabee supporter were to use these targets but then suffer an injury — perhaps due to a lack of proper education in the physical sciences — their medical aid would be protected by Obamacare, which might in turn help them to get a tax refund.
