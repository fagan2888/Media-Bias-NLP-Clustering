(Photo: Gannett )\n\nYou probably carry your laptop in a padded backpack mainly for protection and convenience. But what happens when you are strolling across town en route to a meeting, and it unexpectedly starts to pour? If you\u2019re toting STM\u2019s Drifter laptop backpack, all you have to do is unzip the pouch on the bottom of the backpack, pull out its prepacked \u201craincoat\u201d and slip it over the bag. Designed with an assortment of pockets and compartments, the bag can hold a variety of items. It costs about $140.\n\nSmall speaker, big sound\n\nBusiness travelers can lead divided lives: Many like to chill out in their hotel rooms by listening to music via a Bluetooth-enabled speaker before jumping on a conference call. If they have packed the slender, square-shaped Esquire from Harman Kardon, they can do both. Slim enough to tuck into a bag, yet powerful enough to fill a room with big sound, the Bluetooth wireless speaker can easily move from home to the office to an impromptu party. Crafted with a leather panel and an aluminum finish, the two-way speaker includes a built-in phone conference system, noise-canceling technology, dual drivers and a bass port. Its built-in lithium-ion battery delivers about 10 hours of audio on a full charge. Priced at about $225, it ships with a zip-up pouch, a USB cable and a three-port USB adapter.\n\nCharging made easy\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t think of yourself as power hungry, but you are. Consider Ventev\u2019s Powercell 6000+, a portable 6,000 mAh Li-ion battery and wall charger that can charge two devices at the same time. It costs about $75. On the go? Ventev\u2019s Dashport r2240 dual-port rapid car charger also can do double duty. Equipped with two universal USB ports, it can charge two items, such as a tablet and smartphone, simultaneously. It costs about $30.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1pZbwIp", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "STM\u2019s Drifter laptop backpack has a prepacked \u201craincoat\u201d to slip over the bag.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "STM\u2019s Drifter laptop backpack has a prepacked \u201craincoat\u201d to slip over the bag.", "title": "New Tech: Laptop backpack makes rain less of a pain", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/tech/2014/06/15/stm-drifter-laptop-backpack-rain/10514985/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "STM\u2019s Drifter laptop backpack has a prepacked \u201craincoat\u201d to slip over the bag.", "creator": "@DMRegister", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/070cc43d076ced1e0d5fd432c31af04057df5c59/c=163-0-1337-1174&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/stmlaptopbag.jpg", "title": "New Tech: Laptop backpack makes rain less of a pain", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "tech", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8634d509fe996696c55ccc418544c8f3d8099f52/c=310-0-1190-1174/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/stmlaptopbag.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79e24cd84ed61312bea011933da6d8398988d01c/c=163-0-1337-1174/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/stmlaptopbag.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/31ab56da18c6c8b3fe269cb3a2623409b7b66f09/c=0-24-1500-1149/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/stmlaptopbag.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7d3fd5814829dcf5c4e40751a425f823c9a3f1f/c=0-165-1500-1009&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/stmlaptopbag.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-06-14T23:13:57.300000-05:00", "shorthed": "Laptop backpack makes rain less of a pain", "articleid": 10514985, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8602e231de79bc9c9c8819692b15000cf1ad90a3/c=0-165-1500-1009/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/stmlaptopbag.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/de62b615c9d5b7884434efad7891bb865dc6db1d/c=420-0-1080-1174/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/06/14/stmlaptopbag.jpg"}, "author": "Deborah Porterfield,", "title": "New Tech: Laptop backpack makes rain less of a pain", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc344\"", "article_summary": "STM\u2019s Drifter laptop backpack features a pull-out \u201craincoat\u201d that slips over the bag.\nIf you\u2019re toting STM\u2019s Drifter laptop backpack, all you have to do is unzip the pouch on the bottom of the backpack, pull out its prepacked \u201craincoat\u201d and slip it over the bag.\n(Photo: Gannett )You probably carry your laptop in a padded backpack mainly for protection and convenience.\nBut what happens when you are strolling across town en route to a meeting, and it unexpectedly starts to pour?\nPriced at about $225, it ships with a zip-up pouch, a USB cable and a three-port USB adapter."}
