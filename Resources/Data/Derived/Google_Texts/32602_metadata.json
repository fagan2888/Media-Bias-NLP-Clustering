Conference attendees could also choose a none-of-the-above option or write-in another choice.\n\nPaul, the expected winner of the contest, said in a statement that he was 'humbled by the enthusiastic support and encouragement' he received from 'constitutional conservatives' who propelled him to victory.\n\n'The Constitutional Conservatives of our party have spoken in a loud and clear voice today,' he said. 'I plan on doing my part and I hope you will join me as I continue to make the GOP a bigger, better and bolder party.'\n\nSCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul has won the Conservative Political Action Conference straw poll, defeating 16 other potential Republican presidential candidates\n\nROCK THE VOTE: Conservatives could vote over a three-day period for their favorite politician in advance of the 2016 Republican primary season\n\nFIELD OF SEVENTEEN! The GOP's deep bench showed up in the straw poll, with nearly a dozen and a half potential candidates' names showing up on a digital ballot\n\nA surging Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took second place with 21.4 per cent, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\nCruz's 11.5 per cent was just one-tenth of a point better than Carson's showing. Cruz placed second in 2014.\n\nBush's received 8.3 per cent of the votes. His name was announced first as the 5th-place finisher on Saturday at the event's closing session, drawing a cascade of boos from activists who had remained to hear the results.\n\nWhen voters were asked to pick their top two candidates, Paul's lead shrank to just 2 percentage points.\n\nThe poll numbers, based on 3,007 votes, are not thought to be a solid indicator of how the Republican Party will vote next year in primary elections and state caucuses that determine who the presidential nominee will be.\n\nThat's because CPAC is a gathering of hard-core conservatives and libertarian-leaning Republicans, not the GOP's more moderate center.\n\n2015 CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS 25.7% Sen.

George Pataki 1.0% Undecided 0.7% Other\n\nAnd the age group at the three-day homage to limited government, military strength and conservative social values skews very young. Fully 50 per cent of the voters were age 25 or under, including 3 per cent who are not yet 18.\n\nCollege Republican groups led delegations from more than a dozen states, and organizations focused on recruiting so-called millennial voters into the Republican fold were everywhere.\n\nDuring one presentation from the main stage on Saturday a few hours before the poll's results were announced, journalist Robert George asked about 800 audience-members to raise their hands if they were born after 1989 \u2013 the year President Ronald Reagan left office.\n\nMore than half of the crowd shot hands into the air.\n\nWhile nearly all the CPAC attendees who Daily Mail Online spoke positively of Paul, it was young college students, who will have their first opportunity to legally vote for the nation's leader next year, who aggressively supported the freshman lawmaker.\n\n'He's the one candidate who consistently stands for liberty, for the Constitution,' Joey Brown, a student at the University of Hawaii, said.\n\nBrown and Jesus Rodriguez, a New Jersey resident who attends school in Washington, D.C. at George Washington University, both cited concerns over 'privacy' as reasons they were supporting Paul.\n\nConservatives, Brown said, 'should take more of a position like Rand Paul is, on protecting civil liberties.'\n\n'I think that is where the country is going, especially our millennial, younger generation,' he said. 'We, overwhelming, I think as a collective are opposed to this type of NSA surveillance.'\n\nPollsters for CPAC did not release a breakdown by age of survey-takers. A question asking voteres about 'the collection of phone data on U.S. citizens by the National Security Agency for the purpose of preventing terrorist attacks and tracking those who may have links to terrorism' was widely opposed, however.\n\nA combined 65 percent of attendees who took the straw poll said there were very or somewhat against such measures. Just 32 percent said the opposite.\n\nRodriguez said Paul's criminal justice reform work also 'resonates' with him.\n\nIn the 'minority communities and urban communities where I come from,' he said, 'people from lower income seem to have an unfair deal with drug crimes.'\n\nSentencing reforms are needed, he said, so that the 'average person' receives a misdemeanor for drug crimes rather than decade in prison.\n\nRodriguez said he thought Paul gave the best speech of CPAC. Other Paul backers were less enthused by his performance, however.\n\nJeffery Corey, a managing partner of the TriCoast Group, an organization that finds and trains black Republicans to run for office, said he too favors Paul because of his engagement in minority communities.\n\nBut Corey said Paul's speech was just 'OK' and he left the conference leaning toward Walker, whom he'd had his eye on, as well, prior to the three-day bonanza.\n\n'As a businessman, I appreciate what he did to try to turn his state around,' Corey said.\n\nDespite hailing from Baton Rouge Louisiana, Corey said he wouldn't be supporting his state's governor, Bobby Jindal, if he runs for higher office, saying he's simply not 'excited' by the executive, who's second term will come to an end next January.\n\nFellow conference-goers appeared to share Corey's opinion. Jindal finished near the bottom of the pack, with less than one percent of the total vote.\n\nRand Paul has attracted a dedicated following of libertarian-minded millennials, the group who put him atop the CPAC straw poll for the third year running\n\nAccording to representatives for CPAC, 20 per cent more votes were cast this year than in last year's straw poll, indicating a renewed interest in presidential politics as 2016 draws near.\n\nThe field was smaller than in 2014, when 25 names were included.\n\nThe CPAC event has been holding straw polls since 1973 but records exist only for 20 of those years, since it wasn't always an annual feature of the conference and was originally held only in election years.\n\nThe winners went on to become GOP presidential nominees in the ensuing national elections just 20 per cent of the time.\n\nRonald Reagan won in 1976, 1980 and 1984. Mitt Romney, who lost to Barack Obama in 2012, won three years in a row from 2007 to 2009, and then again in 2012.\n\nBut in the two years in between, then-Texas Rep. Ron Paul \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul's father \u2013 captured the imagination of a libertarian-leaning crowd and beat him.\n\nThe younger Paul had already won in both 2013 and 2014.\n\nIn 2005 and 2006 as conservatives looked ahead to the end of the George W. Bush presidency, they chose New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and Virginia's then-Senator George Allen as their standard-bearers.\n\nBush won only in 2000, the year he was first elected president.\n\nThat, plus Romney's straw-poll win in 2012 and Reagan's in 1980 and 1984, suggest that election-year measurements are more meaningful than those held far in advance of crunch-time.\n\nIt will be more than 11 months before Republicans begin to choose their nominee.\n\nA surging Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took second place with 21.4 per cent, followed by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\n\nWalker's popularity at CPAC was juxtaposed with his unpopularity with union members back home in Wisconsin. Thousands of Wisconsin union workers rallied at their state Capitol Saturday to protest a 'right-to-work' proposal backed by Walker that would outlaw the mandatory payment of union dues\n\nPart of the dynamic that determines who triumphs in the CPAC poll involves candidates bringing in young supporters to stack the deck.\n\nBush, the former Florida governor who braved hecklers and occasional boos to deliver a moderate-leaning message to a packed ballroom on Friday, bused in a claque to cheer for him near the front of the audience but still finished just fifth.\n\nThat showing is respectable for him, however, as he was the only potential candidate who was jeered more than cheered during his main speaking slot.\n\nAnd his appearance at the conference, which attracted roughly 10,000 activists, according to organizers' estimates, may pay off in the long-run. Multiple attendees who talked to Daily Mail Online said they left CPAC less opposed to Bush's candidacy than they were when they arrived.\n\n'When I walked in there, I said I know I'm not voting for him, but he really changed my mind a little bit,' Suzy Mulligan of Fairfax, Virginia, said.\n\nMuch of Bush's troubled relationship with conservatives stems from his support of Common Core, a set of federal educational standards that are opposed by the right-wing of the Republican Party.\n\nThe polling company, inc. found that 58 percent of straw poll voters 'would never' vote for a Republican presidential candidate who condones the initiatives.\n\nSill, the policy has it's supporters. One of them, Falls Church, Virginia, resident Mark Dalessio, said he was endorsing Bush because 'he's standing his ground on Common Core' and 'not flip-flopping like some other candidates have been doing on the issue.'\n\nDalessio did not elaborate on whom he felt had behaved dishonorably but on Thursday New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was pummeled both on stage by interviewer Laura Ingraham and in the straw poll by voters, said he regretted the way the program was implemented in his state.\n\nChristie didn't give a full-throated apology for signing a bill to allow Common Core to become law in New Jersey. But he did suggest he did it in an attempt to attract additional federal funds 'during a really difficult fiscal time.'\n\n'Unlike other people who just get to talk about this stuff, we actually have to do it,' Christie said.\n\nCruz's 11.5 per cent, third place showing was just one-tenth of a point better than Carson's. Cruz placed second in 2014 but his backing has decreased significantly over the last 11 months. Hes fallen to back of the pack in polls of likely Republican voters in early primary states\n\nCruz supporters cheer for the Texas senator during the weekend powwow, held this year at the Gaylord National Conference Center at the National Harbor in Maryland, just down the river from neighboring Washington, D.C.\n\nDaniella De Diego, a freshman at the University of Chicago, said she came with an open mind but 'saw a lot of promise' in Bush.\n\nAfter having an opportunity to see and hear him speak, the New York native said, 'he seems much more personable.'\n\n'You can tell that he's very intelligent. You can tell that he can appeal to Democrats and liberals, which I think is very important to the base right now.'\n\nShe noted that he's very 'controversial' to conservatives. 'But at the same time I think we need someone like him to really appeal to reason, to appeal to the other party...to keep the conservative principles alive, while sill understanding that we're in a new age.\n\n'We need to be able to revamp to become just more competitive globally,' she said.\n\nAnother possible candidate who's CPAC performance may lead to future momentum was former Hewlett Packard executive Carly Fiorina, who unsuccessfully fought election the U.S. Senate in California in 2010.\n\n'As a woman, I find her telling her own story very impressive,' Alexandria, Virginia, resident Terri Hauser, said.\n\nHauser declined to tell Daily Mail Online who she voted for in the poll but spoke favorably of Fiorina, the chairman of the American Conservative Union Foundation, the group responsible for the planning of CPAC.\n\n'I think it's very helpful for the party to have a woman's voice in the field,' Hauser said.\n\nSURPRISE: Jeb Bush, who was jeered more than cheered at the Conservative Political Action Conference, took fifth place in the poll\n\nBIG WINNERS: Mitt Romney (left) has won the CPAC straw poll 4 times and Ronald Reagan (right) won three times \u2013 both went on to become Republican presidential nominees\n\nDOWN TO THE WIRE: Voters at CPAC crowded in the final hours of Saturday's session to record their votes on touch-screens\n\nLibertarian-leaning advocacy groups like Young Americans for Freedom have turned out millennials in large numbers in recent years to vote for Sen. Paul.\n\n'Those who win the straw poll traditionally have delivered a strong performance at CPAC but also fill the room with people who believe in them,' GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, who is running the straw poll, told The Hill.\n\n'You can convert or persuade some in the audience, but it's also the legwork that's been done up to that moment in filling a room with your supporters.'\n\nThree politicians who finished near the bottom of the poll didn't speak at CPAC at all.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee's aides said he had other speaking engagements.\n\nSouth Carolina Lindsey Graham, derided in some conservative corners as 'Senator Graham-nesty' because of his past cooperation with President Obama's vision of immigration reform, was home in his district.\n\nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki is thought to be on the outside looking in, as a politician who hasn't organized staff or a fundraising apparatus that he would need to make a serious bid for the nomination next year.\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence, who delivered a keynote speech during CPAC's annual banquet Friday night, wasn't included on the ballot despite speculation that he's considering a run for the White House.\n\nNOT SO MUCH: (left to right) Rudy Giuliani, George Allen and Jack Kemp are past straw poll winners whose momentum later fizzled \u2013 although Kemp was a vice presidential nominee in 1996 with Sen. Bob Dole\n\nPAST SPOILER: Former Rep. Ron Paul, whose son is Sen. Rand Paul, has won the straw poll twice and used that mojo to propel him into the first tier of potential candidates in 2012\n\nONE TIME IS ENOUGH: President George W. Bush won the CPAC straw poll just once \u2013 in 2000 \u2013 but claimed the presidency nine months later\n\nIn addition to picking a presidential candidate, conference attendees were asked to classify themselves along ideological lines \u2013 choosing touch-screen options describing their 'deal-breaker' issues.\n\nApproval of gay marriage and support for abortion rights were among the positions that voters could declare would exclude a candidate from their consideration.\n\nBut Obamacare topped them all, with 42 per cent of voters saying the lack of a candidate's commitment to repeal the Affordable Care Act would rule him or her out.\n\nIn a separate portion of the poll, 74 per cent said they were 'pro-life,' and 82 per cent said a commitment to repeal of Obamacare was important to them.\n\nThey were also asked whether foreign policy, economic issues, social issues or 'moral' issues mattered most to them.\n\nJobs and the economy came out on top, followed by foreign policy. More than four in ten voters, a plurality of 41 per cent, said they believe marijuana should be legalized for both medical and recreational use, and taxed.\n\nThirty-nine percent chose a 'solid conservative record' as their top qualification for the next GOP nominee.\n\nThe Polling Company Inc. and WomenTrend conducted the poll.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Rand,Paul,comes,ahead,CPAC,straw,poll,picking,2016,momentum,red,meat,right,wingers", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2973747/Rand-Paul-comes-ahead-CPAC-straw-poll-picking-2016-momentum-red-meat-right-wingers.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "BUT -- Conservative Political Action Conference poll winners went on to become presidential nominees in the next election just 20 per cent of the time", "title": "Rand Paul comes out ahead in CPAC straw poll AGAIN", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2973747/Rand-Paul-comes-ahead-CPAC-straw-poll-picking-2016-momentum-red-meat-right-wingers.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/28/2627960600000578-0-image-a-36_1425161873765.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2973747/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2973747/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2973747, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Rand,Paul,comes,ahead,CPAC,straw,poll,picking,2016,momentum,red,meat,right,wingers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-02-28T22:18:42.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=David+Martosko,+US+Political+Editor", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-03-01T13:21:27.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Rand Paul comes ahead CPAC straw poll picking 2016 momentum red meat right wingers"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "BUT -- Conservative Political Action Conference poll winners went on to become presidential nominees in the next election just 20 per cent of the time", "title": "Rand Paul comes out ahead in CPAC straw poll AGAIN", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2973747/Rand-Paul-comes-ahead-CPAC-straw-poll-picking-2016-momentum-red-meat-right-wingers.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/02/28/2627960600000578-0-image-a-36_1425161873765.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2015/03/1418450360_4086340581001_rand-paul-1425150330486.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "BUT -- Conservative Political Action Conference poll winners went on to become presidential nominees in the next election just 20 per cent of the time"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda49e\"", "article_summary": "2015 CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS 25.7% Sen.
