Republicans signaled he won't have a smooth ride to Senate confirmation.U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying that Slavitt's nomination would receive \"thorough consideration.\" He advised Slavitt to remain focused on serving the 140 million Americans estimated by the CMS to receive insurance under its programs.\u201cThe head of the agency that oversees Medicare and Medicaid should be focused on what the American people expect him to do: administer these important programs, not allow his attention to be diverted instead to the implementation of some gigantic, unworkable healthcare law that hurts hardworking Americans,\u201d McConnell said, \u201cIt has long been clear that no one can successfully manage a law as unworkable as Obamacare.\u201dSlavitt previously worked as group executive vice president of Optum, a unit of UnitedHealth Group. He was one of the executives helping with the so-called tech surge to fix HealthCare.gov in the months after it launched. He also served as CEO at UnitedHealth's Ingenix unit. It's that history that concerns Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) who issued a statement within minutes of the announcement.\u201cMr. Slavitt's conflicted history in the medical services industry has produced mixed results and raised a number of serious concerns. As such, he will be expected to demonstrate that he is up to the challenge and capable of successfully leading the agency through the monumental tasks that lie ahead,\u201c Hatch said. \u201cMost importantly, Mr. Slavitt will need to answer a number of tough questions regarding his former employer and their relationship with the agency.\u201dHHS has previously issued an ethics waiver for Slavitt, who will have to recuse himself from matters involving UnitedHealth, including contracts and analytics work from the Lewin Group, a UnitedHealth unit. UnitedHealth is the largest carrier of Medicare Advantage plans.Providers, on the other hand, commended the nomination.Among them was American Hospital Association CEO Rich Umbdenstock, who said Slavitt \u201chas a deep understanding of the U.S. healthcare system and a commitment to improving patient care.\u201d\u201cWe believe Andy's proven leadership in the public and private sectors speaks to the ongoing contributions he will make at CMS,\u201d Umbendstock added.Chip Kahn, CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, urged the Senate to \u201cact swiftly to confirm Mr. Slavitt as the next CMS administrator so that America's critical healthcare programs will have the true benefit of a strong and experienced leader.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "President Barack Obama has nominated Andrew Slavitt as CMS administrator, the position he has held on an interim basis since Marilyn Tavenner stepped down in February.", "title": "Obama's CMS nominee Slavitt could face rough road to confirmation", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "President Barack Obama has nominated Andrew Slavitt as CMS administrator, the position he has held on an interim basis since Marilyn Tavenner stepped down in February.", "title": "Obama's CMS nominee Slavitt could face rough road to confirmation", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150709/NEWS/307099976", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150709/NEWS/307099976/AR/0/AR-307099976.jpg&maxw=1200&maxh=630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "President Barack Obama has nominated Andrew Slavitt as CMS administrator, the position he has held on an interim basis since Marilyn Tavenner stepped down in February.", "title": "Obama's CMS nominee Slavitt could face rough road to confirmation", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150709/NEWS/307099976/AR/0/AR-307099976.jpg&imageversion=thumbnail&maxw=240&maxh=240", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150709/NEWS/307099976", "published_at": "2015-07-09", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20150709/NEWS/307099976/AR/0/AR-307099976.jpg&maxw=360&maxh=240", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It's that history that concerns Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) who issued a statement within minutes of the announcement.\u201cMr.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying that Slavitt's nomination would receive \"thorough consideration.\"\nHe was one of the executives helping with the so-called tech surge to fix HealthCare.gov in the months after it launched.\nSlavitt's conflicted history in the medical services industry has produced mixed results and raised a number of serious concerns.\nRepublicans signaled he won't have a smooth ride to Senate confirmation.U.S."}
