NEW YORK — Carlos Beltran hit a grand slam and drove in five runs as the New York Yankees broke out to support improbable fill-in starter Esmil Rogers and beat the sloppy Cleveland Indians 10-6 on Friday night for their sixth win in seven games.

Derek Jeter tied Honus Wagner with his 3,430th hit in a five-run first inning against Trevor Bauer (4-7) and Beltran’s 11th career slam highlighted a five-run sixth. The Indians, who have the majors’ worst fielding percentage, prolonged both innings with errors in their fourth straight loss overall and seventh in a row in the Bronx.

The Yankees walked seven times in moving seven games above .500 (61-54) for the first time this season.

Picked up off waivers on July 31 after the Toronto Blue Jays cut him for the second time this season, Rogers (2-0) became the 12th player to make a start for New York.

Pitching in place of David Phelps (elbow inflammation), he allowed one run and four hits over five innings in his first start since Sept. 25 for Toronto and threw 88 pitches – 45 was his high this season coming in.

Rogers’ outing followed four fine starts by a makeshift rotation against the Detroit Tigers’ heralded staff. Three of those came from pitchers who made their first start for the Yankees in July: Brandon McCarthy, Chris Capuano and Shane Greene.

The Yankees took advantage of three walks by Bauer in the first inning. Beltran, Stephen Drew and Martin Prado had RBI singles and another run scored on second baseman Jason Kipnis’ throwing error.

Bauer was charged with five runs and six hits in 3 1-3 innings.

John Axford walked the bases loaded — one intentional — before Beltran connected to make it 9-2.

Yankees reliever Shawn Kelley walked in a run in Cleveland’s four-run seventh. Carlos Santana had a two-run double in the inning.
