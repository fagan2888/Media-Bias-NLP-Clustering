Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Sunday didn't want to touch the comments that have gotten Donald Trump into hot water in the past couple of days, but he did stress his own support for women."I'm not getting into this or that or he or she said. I'm just telling you that my perception of how it's worked in my lifetime, and I actively seek out and recruit women to be involved," Kasich said on CNN's "State of the Union." "Because, as I say, they make things better."Kasich, who was on the debate stage with Trump on Thursday, said he preferred not to address the controversy surrounding Trump's criticism of one of the debate moderators, Megyn Kelly. Trump got into a testy exchange with Kelly at the debate and later said she was so angry she "had blood coming out of her eyes, coming out of her wherever." Trump said Sunday he meant her nose, but critics claimed he was referring to menstruation."I think it's more important for me to tell you who I am and what I think than spend my time on the negative side of the street," Kasich told host Jake Tapper. "I just don't want to be there."
