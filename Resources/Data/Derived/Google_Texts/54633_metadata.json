CR: Definitely the day President Obama called to say he was about to announce that birth control would be covered for all women under their insurance plans, because it had been a hard-fought battle, long before I came to Planned Parenthood. We were fighting to make sure that insurance companies covered it and pharmacies would fill prescriptions. The fact that now, I believe, for your generation, all women will be able to get it without a fight, and they\u2019ll be able to get the best birth control, is an enormously important moment. It was a win for the movement.\n\nRichards is talking about the HHS Mandate requ, which Christian organizations and businesses have had to challenge all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. As Richards noted, abortion activists used their influence to force religious employers \u2013 including nuns \u2013 to pay for abortion-causing drugs in employee health plans through HHS.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor is the latest group asking the nation\u2019s highest court to ensure they do not have to comply with Obamacare\u2019s abortion mandate. The mandate compels religious groups to pay for birth control and drugs that may cause abortions. Without relief, the nuns would face millions of dollars in IRS fines because they cannot comply with the government\u2019s mandate that they give their employees free access to contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nSUPPORT LIFENEWS!

They want to force taxpayers to pay for abortions, too. When Planned Parenthood endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, Clinton promised the abortion group that she would overturn the Hyde Amendment and force taxpayer funding of abortions.\n\nThe abortion giant isn\u2019t hurting for money. Richards makes a whopping $590,928 salary for leading a business that aborts more than 300,000 unborn babies a year \u2013 more than any other group in the United States. Planned Parenthood gets about $500 million in taxpayer funding every year, too.\n\nAnd Richards is fighting hard to keep it that way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood CEO: My Proudest Moment is Forcing Christians to Pay for Abortion Drugs", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards seems to jump at every chance she gets to do an interview with a journalist who will flatter her abortion work.
