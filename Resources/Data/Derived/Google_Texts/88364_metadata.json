LOUIS \u2014 The people who spend two bucks for chili at the Courtesy Diner at Laclede Station Road here can\u2019t fathom why anyone would pay Hillary Clinton $225,000 to make a speech. Nor can they understand why the U.S. Senate is taking a 17-day break for Easter after spending much of their time last week fuming over the Supreme Court vacancy.\n\nOne way or another, people all over America are saying loudly and clearly this election year, Washington, D.C., and its enablers \u2014 the media, the political pros and Wall Street \u2014 don\u2019t understand us.\n\nThat\u2019s why, all over this slice of middle America, in Eastern Missouri, exasperated people got up before dawn on a cold, 37-degree morning recently to spend four hours in a line so long that from its end people couldn\u2019t even see the Peabody Opera House, where they would hear Donald Trump.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just Trump. In the next two days, other people nearby lined up to hear the \u201coutsider talk\u201d from Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Bernie Sanders, Ind.-Vt.\n\nThey share the same grievance. In 2016 America, the deepest divide is not between Democrats and Republicans. It\u2019s not even between conservatives and liberals. It\u2019s between Us and Them \u2014 the people versus the Establishment.\n\nIn dozens of interviews, in a cross-section of the country, the sentiments were the same.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re political bureaucrats who would like to control the people,\u201d said Sandy Garber, a St. Charles, Mo., real estate agent, when asked to define the establishment.\n\nJohn Hackmann, a Fairview Heights, Ill., retiree, labeled it a \u201cWashington cartel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just let the government do whatever they want,\u201d said Jim Walker, an Arnold, Mo., businessman.\n\nWhat is the establishment? Nationwide, eight in 10 people told a McClatchy-Morning Consult poll this month it includes members of Congress. Similar numbers cited the Democratic and Republican parties, political donors, Wall Street bankers and the mainstream media.\n\nThey split on whether Trump, a billionaire real estate developer who\u2019s thrived in the New York business world, was part of the establishment, but seven in 10 said Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton was.\n\nIn essence, the establishment lives and thrives in a small world that lives and works in New York and Washington, on Wall Street, in Big Media and in politics, connected by the high-speed Acela corridor and often by mutual self interest.\n\nMany, perhaps most, do care deeply about the common good though they are anything but common themselves. They hire each other and each other\u2019s children. They huddle at the same white tie and black tie dinners. And, they sometimes attend each other\u2019s weddings.\n\nEleven years ago, for instance, Trump got married for the third time. The over-the-top Palm Beach wedding in 2005 was a who\u2019s who of elites, including Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nAccess is this group\u2019s common currency. Wall Street spends millions to open doors to the top levels of the government that regulates it. Politicos bend over to get access to the money that keeps them in office. The media cut deals to get access to decision-makers needed to feed ratings and circulation, even if sometimes at the cost of objectivity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a collection of people who live in Washington, D.C., and don\u2019t care about the rest of the world,\u201d said Hackmann. And, he noted, \u201cThey all have jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe establishment is anybody with big money who can get to the Congressmen and lobbyists,\u201d said Judy Surak, a nurse from Clemson, S.C.\n\nAll over South Carolina, ask the people reveling in the music at Greenville Heritage Main Street Fridays, or starting their day with homemade onion sausage at Lizard\u2019s Thicket on Two Notch Road in Columbia to define the establishment, and they usually echo Surak.\n\nThey often add a gentle qualifier: They don\u2019t want to blow up the political system. They just want it to be more responsive, to work better.\n\n\u201cThe country\u2019s long-term problems have to be fixed within the system we have,\u201d said Mark Cruise, a Columbia executive.\n\nThe most wary tend to be better educated, higher earning, older voters, according to the national poll. They tend to see establishment figures easing in and out of lucrative, comfortable jobs, climbing ladders to success that seem unavailable to the rank and file who populate South Carolina\u2019s office cubicles.\n\nOf 78 members of Congress who left after the 2010 elections, four out of five found work with lobbying firms or clients, state or federal governments or political action committees.\n\nOne of Bill Clinton\u2019s former White House spokesmen hosts an influential network Sunday talk show. NBC hires Chelsea Clinton as a \u201cspecial correspondent,\u201d paying her a reported $600,000 annually, far above the typical pay for a reporter with no journalistic experience.\n\nThe ties are intricate and deep. Five Treasury secretaries in the past three presidential administrations have either headed big Wall Street firms or became top executives after leaving their jobs.\n\nEvery member of the U.S. Supreme Court has at least one Ivy League degree. Every president elected since 1988 is an Ivy Leaguer. So are Clinton and Trump.\n\nEven among Republican presidential candidates who insist they\u2019re running against the establishment, establishment ties have served them well.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, promotes himself as a maverick, but has two Ivy League degrees and worked in state and federal government before being elected. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was a congressman for 18 years, then was a senior executive at Lehman Brothers\u2019 investment banking division. Trump\u2019s company is building a luxury hotel five blocks from the White House.\n\nSomehow, many see Trump through a different lens.\n\n\u201cHe has all he ever wanted. He doesn\u2019t have to bother with this,\u201d explained Elaine Verma, a KIAWAH Island court reporter. \u201cHe just has the best interests of the United States at heart.\u201d\n\nOutside St. Louis in St. Clair County Illinois, people are far removed from Wall Street or Fifth Avenue. They want to know the conditions of their commute on Interstate 64. Or the streets of downtown Belleville, virtually empty by 6 p.m., so there\u2019s easy parking if you want to run in for carry out at the St. Louis Bread Company on Main Street.\n\nTrying to fathom the stratospheric sums lobbyists and corporations spend to ingratiate themselves with Washington decision-makers is akin to learning a foreign language.\n\nPeople here understand this much: \u201cEverybody\u2019s got somebody from Wall Street paying for them,\u201d said David Vail, an O\u2019Fallon, Ill., retiree.\n\nCorporate and other interests retained 11,465 registered lobbyists last year, spending $3.2 billion, roughly the same amount the United States pledged to poor countries to cope with global warming. To voters, the big money is emblematic of an impenetrable system they have no chance of influencing, let alone understanding.\n\nThat\u2019s why many cheer when Sanders complains that no one was punished harshly for the financial meltdowns of 2008. His lament touches directly what distresses people about the New York-to-Washington axis.\n\nPeople lost their jobs and homes in that recession. The nation teetered on the brink of a historic financial meltdown. Banks and institutional investors had let the mortgage market run amok.\n\n\u201cNo senior banker tried for crash-related frauds,\u201d said Bartlett Naylor, financial policy advocate at Public Citizen and former Senate Banking Committee chief of investigations.\n\nGoldman Sachs, a major Wall Street and Washington player, did agree in 2010 to pay $550 million and change its business practices in order to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it had misled investors in mortgage dealings as the housing market began to wobble. The company neither admitted nor denied the allegations.\n\nIn January, the company also agreed in principle to a $5 billion settlement that resolved both actual and potential civil claims by the Justice Department, New York and Illinois attorneys general and others \u201crelating to the firm\u2019s securitization, underwriting and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007.\u201d\n\nSanders was livid, saying the latest agreement \u201cshould make it clear to everyone that the business model on Wall Street is a fraud,\u201d a product of the financial world\u2019s revolving door to Washington.\n\nClinton was paid $675,000 for three Goldman Sachs speeches behind closed doors in the years after she left her job as secretary of state in 2013. She demanded transcripts be kept, and so far refuses to release them publicly.\n\nAndrew Williams, Goldman Sachs spokesman, explained: \u201cClinton spoke at conferences that we hosted for clients. We host literally hundreds of conferences around the world and continually search for fascinating speakers.\u201d\n\nSuch speeches are commonplace, he said, and singling out Clinton\u2019s talk is \u201cmisleading.\u201d\n\nNone of this convinces Tronda Minnie, a building service worker from Alton, Ill., that Clinton \u2014 or for that matter much of official Washington \u2014 can break these ties.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m for Sanders all the way,\u201d Minnie said. \u201cWhere\u2019s (Clinton\u2019s) money coming from?\u201d\n\nGOVERNMENT\u2019S CLOISTERED WORLD\n\nMuch of the influence industry\u2019s goal is to get a slice of the $4 trillion federal budget.\n\n\u201cThey make these deals, and they profit somehow,\u201d said Richard Shinkle, a pipeline builder from Columbia, Mo.\n\n\u201cAll of them just take money from lobbyists and use it the way they want,\u201d added Ron Lowe, an entertainment theme worker from O\u2019Fallon, Mo.\n\nIn recent years, the budget has become ever more a prize for the establishment insiders, removed even from most members of Congress. The last four annual budget plans have been negotiated by a handful of leaders, including former House Speaker John Boehner, then presented to the rank-and-file as a done deal.\n\nConservatives have tried hard to have more clout.\n\nIn 2013, for example, about 20 members of Congress met in the basement of the Tortilla Coast restaurant down the street from the Capitol, where the grilled chicken quesadilla costs $9.95, and a steak burrito with the house-made sauce costs $11.95. Their goal: use the budget leverage to end or at least dilute the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThey lost. The establishment prevailed.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of a shadowy system that, to the people in suburban St. Louis, seems open and approachable only to the well-entrenched and well-heeled.\n\nOnce elected to the Congress, for example, members basically have lifetime employment regardless of elections. In 2014, for example, 95 percent of the members of the House of Representatives won re-election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nA key reason for the insider edge? Money. The average incumbent running in 2012, the last year when full figures were available, raised $1.6 million for the campaign. The average challenger: $268,000.\n\nIt\u2019s an incestuous system, voters say, that\u2019s hard to crack. \u201cThe real access causing changes in laws is what big money buys,\u201d explained Vail, the O\u2019Fallon retiree.\n\nWhoever wins the White House will find the same establishment chiseled into the Washington fabric as firmly as the monuments that dot its landscape.\n\nTwo-thirds of the Senate doesn\u2019t face re-election this year. History says at least 85 percent, and probably many more, House of Representatives members will return. The lobbyists won\u2019t suddenly close their practices. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about one person,\u201d said Steven Reinisch, a Missouri investment adviser. \u201cThis is about the whole, big picture.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | ST.
