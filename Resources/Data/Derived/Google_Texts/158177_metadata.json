If allegations are correct, it now appears that those who scrutinize Beijing\u2019s political elite can get snatched off the streets of Hong Kong and dragged into China proper.\n\nThat is among Hong Kongers\u2019 worst fears, and they are right to worry. In recent months, five people connected to a single publishing house \u2014 known for detailing misdeeds of Communist Party officials \u2014 have simply vanished.\n\nThe latest to disappear is 65-year-old Lee Bo. He is an editor with Sage Communications, which puts out salacious books, sometimes shakily sourced, that describe Communist Party scandals. His top transgression, it seems, was preparing the release of a book on the \u2014 alleged \u2014 secret love life of China\u2019s President Xi Jinping.\n\nLee\u2019s case is remarkable because he was on Hong Kong soil when he disappeared on Dec. 30.\n\nHis wife, whom he briefly called after being detained, has told reporters that he said Chinese operatives took him to a non-disclosed location. He called from a number with a mainland Chinese area code.\n\nAccording to his wife, he told her he was asked to assist an investigation into the dissident publishing house. (Lee\u2019s wife has since withdrawn her missing-person report after claiming to have received written assurances from her husband, a move that Amnesty International said \u201csmacked of intimidation.\u201d)\n\nIf true, this is a massive breach of Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy.\n\nUnder a cherished set of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d laws, which offer limited independence to Hong Kong, Chinese police aren\u2019t allowed to make arrests within its borders. If covert Chinese forces can freely abduct dissidents in Hong Kong, the territory\u2019s prized free speech ideals are practically meaningless.\n\nThree other Hong Kong residents connected to the publishing operation vanished while visiting the Chinese mainland in October. Another disappeared while on vacation in Thailand \u2014 a sign that the Communist Party is willing to pursue its targets even on foreign soil. (Thailand, ruled by a military junta, is increasingly cooperative in deporting traveling Chinese dissidents back into their government\u2019s hands.)\n\nSage Communications belongs to a clique of independent publishers in Hong Kong that focus on \u201cpower struggles behind the scenes, love affairs and political gossip,\u201d says Maya Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics of Beijing's political elite are being snatched off the streets, and local officials are taking notice", "title": "Hong Kong\u2019s publishers keep disappearing.
