Harry Riley announced his plan for an Operation American Spring, he sought to evoke the same kind of populist uprising that toppled regimes in the Middle East, protests that were collectively given the moniker Arab Spring.\n\nAnd while the photos that poured in from Tahrir Square were incredible, depicting tens of thousands of people in the streets, the pictures from American Spring were\u2026less so:\n\nThe \u201csecond American revolution\u201d got off to a slow start in Washington, DC on Friday, falling roughly 9,999,950 people short of their goal of 10 million angry, constitution-wielding participants. (That was the low-end estimate. They were prepared for upwards of 30 million).\n\nThe few who did make it to Washington, D.C came with a laundry list of grievances, ranging from Benghazi, to Obamacare, to President Obama\u2019s birth certificate, to general lawlessness.\n\n\u201cOur main goal is to return our government to the constitutional government,\u201d said Marty Church, a protestor who traveled to Washington, D.C from the Maryland suburbs. \u201cThe whole administration is based on lies,\u201d added Fred Lachance, another protester from Maryland.\n\n\u201cBenghazi\u2019s a lie and a cover-up,\u201d said Church. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re lying about something as stupid as that, what else are you lying about?\u201d\n\nWiley Drake, a pastor and talk radio host from California, knows the truth behind the Benghazi coverup.\n\n\u201cWhat caused Benghazi was a kidnapping gone awry from Barry Soetoro,\u201d he said, referencing the name Birthers have ascribed to Obama based on a widely-circulated (and hastily photoshopped) Columbia University student ID. \u201cHe was going to kidnap Mr. Stevens, and he got killed in the process. That\u2019s what really happened, that\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed to cite other breaches of the constitution, one protestor referred us back to Operation American Spring\u2019s website, which offers little more than an outline of the group\u2019s three-phased mission (Phase 2 calls for 1 million of the 10 million gathered to camp out in Washington, D.C. until their demands are met).\n\nThose demands \u2014 removing Obama, Biden and Nancy Pelosi from the federal government \u2014 are not achievable ones even according to many of the attendees. \u201cIt\u2019s a good goal, but it\u2019s not a realistic goal,\u201d said Lachance. Others, though, were more optimistic.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is lawless, and we want him out,\u201d said Carrie \u201cBeth\u201d Koncar, who led a small group up from Georgia. \u201cAnd basically that is the goal here, for the resignation of Obama, Biden, Pelosi. The Lord God is behind this, the Lord is the breath in this. He puts kings and kingdoms in their places, and he takes them down.\u201d\n\nAs for the paltry turnout, several attendees could barely contain their dismay at the low-key affair. \u201cI took a day off from work to come down,\u201d said Art Skillman. \u201cWhere they are, I don\u2019t know.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Among the charges: that President Obama tried to kidnap Ambassador Stevens in Benghazi.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Among the charges: that President Obama tried to kidnap Ambassador Stevens in Benghazi.", "title": "Tens Of People Descend Upon The Capitol To Drive The Obama Administration Out Of Office", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/05/16/3438826/american-spring/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OAS_WhiteHouse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Among the charges: that President Obama tried to kidnap Ambassador Stevens in Benghazi.", "creator": "@AdamReports", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OAS_WhiteHouse-321x214.jpg", "title": "Tens Of People Descend Upon The Capitol To Drive The Obama Administration Out Of Office", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OAS_WhiteHouse.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OAS_WhiteHouse.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-16T16:32:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbc6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Obama administration is lawless, and we want him out,\u201d said Carrie \u201cBeth\u201d Koncar, who led a small group up from Georgia.\n\u201cOur main goal is to return our government to the constitutional government,\u201d said Marty Church, a protestor who traveled to Washington, D.C from the Maryland suburbs.\nPolitics Tens Of People Descend Upon The Capitol To Drive The Obama Administration Out Of Office CREDIT:When Col.
