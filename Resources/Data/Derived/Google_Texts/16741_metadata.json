She was riding with her father on a moped on May 5th when their vehicle collided with a truck near 10th and Waco.\n\nHer father had a leg injury from the accident, Aubrie was thrown from the moped and critically hurt. Family said that the doctors were in shock that the little girl was still alive when she arrived at the hospital right after the accident.\n\nAubrie had injuries to her spine. At this point of time, she cannot move her legs or arms or breath on her own - fundamentally, she is paralyzed - but there is hope that she will be able to recover.\n\nAs one can imagine, medical expenses get costly when someone is in a hospital for over a month and has to have machine after machine running to keep them alive. To help offset the cost, many organizations have help benefits to help the family with the cost.\n\nAn event on Sunday at VFW post 3115 was held to raise money for Aubrie. A hot grill was cooking hamburgers and fresh french fries were cooking nearby.\n\nThe barbecue raised $760, all of that going to Aubrie.\n\nAunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins were at the VFW, thanking people that donated their time and money.\n\nEarl Cooney is Aubrie's uncle, he was very emotional and thankful for the support they have received. \"It's amazing to see all these people come together and help my niece, \" he said.\n\nAubrie is was taken to a Kansas City hospital from Wichita and family hopes she will be moving to a rehabilitation hospital soon.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "VFW post 3115 held a benefit for Aubrie Sanborn, a 4-year old girl paralyzed after her and her father were injured in an accident on a moped.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "VFW post 3115 held a benefit for Aubrie Sanborn, a 4-year old girl paralyzed after her and her father were injured in an accident on a moped.", "title": "Benefit for Aubrie", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Benefit-for-girl-paralyzed-after-moped-accident-264176051.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/E55/408/E5540822E3274542BE4776DA609FC625", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/590/800/5908009DAA0549128AF72AEFB815EE05.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "VFW post 3115 held a benefit for Aubrie Sanborn, a 4-year old girl paralyzed after her and her father were injured in an accident on a moped.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Benefit-for-girl-paralyzed-after-moped-accident-264176051.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/AubrieSanboren+1.jpg", "title": "Benefit for Aubrie", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Benefit for Aubrie", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3cf\"", "article_summary": "Aubrie Sanborn is a four-year-old little girl, her family use to call her ornery and energetic.\nA benefit for a young girl who was paralyzed after a serious traffic accident between a moped and truck was held today.\nAubrie is was taken to a Kansas City hospital from Wichita and family hopes she will be moving to a rehabilitation hospital soon.\nHer father had a leg injury from the accident, Aubrie was thrown from the moped and critically hurt.\nAn event on Sunday at VFW post 3115 was held to raise money for Aubrie."}
