Ash at First Church of God. Officer Leeker reports an unknown number of people entered the church and attempted to start several fires and damaged several items within.\n\nValley Center is asking that if you have any information, you can call the station at (316) 755-7325 or you can send a private message to the Valley Center Dept of Public Safety Facebook page.\n\nMembers have held church services in the building since 1913. Church member Iris Schweer says, \"I think it's very important that they do find these kids because they're just starting. They also tried to start a fire downstairs. And they destroyed a lot more this time.\"\n\nSchweer says this is the fifth time in recent years the building has been broken into in recent years.\n\nIris' husband Sherman Schweer says what concerns him the most is all the matches the suspects lit. He says they didn't get a fire going but certainly could have.\n\nDespite their frustration with the trashing of some rooms, Sunday's opening prayer was for the vandals and their parents.\n\nVisiting minister Jason Rotramel prayed, \"It was kind of a sad scene we rolled in on this morning. Father, I'd just like to pray for those kids that they'd come to know you in a very real way, that you'd use this to announce your presence in their lives.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A group of people entered a church on 229 N.
