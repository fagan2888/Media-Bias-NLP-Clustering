Now that she\u2019s barely squeezed out a victory, the primaries ahead will require an extra push from her.\n\nThat extra push is likely to feature the following argument, which is especially effective on voters who are on the fence: Bernie Sanders may be progressive, bold and interesting, but Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state, first lady and senator, along with her sharp political instincts, ensures that she would be the best executive in a tumultuous time. Clinton has the ability to flip votes and to bring together stakeholders to reach consensus, while Sanders\u2019s administration would have little to show for it because his quixotic idealism would lose to the competing forces of organized Republican resistance and heavy corporate lobbying.\n\nIt sounds like a good argument, but it\u2019s deeply flawed, because it ignores a lingering problem for the party. The Democrats have expressed optimism that the party will recapture the House of Representatives. It remains to be seen how much those feelings reflect reality, but analysts know this much: If the party doesn\u2019t succeed in taking over Congress, then extending the party\u2019s stay in the White House means little. No Democratic president is going to have much success pushing through policy as long as Republicans have a majority, or even a sizable minority, in Congress.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s eight years in office have been marked by resistance from congressional Republicans at every turn, even when his party had the legislature. His mildest of proposals took shoving to get through \u2014 hence his decision to use executive orders. (Although Republicans paint his actions as excessive, he\u2019s used fewer executive orders than the GOP\u2019s modern-day patron revolutionary, Ronald Reagan.) The Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration\u2019s hallmark piece of legislation, has faced futile overturn votes numerous times, and two failed Supreme Court attempts to void it.\n\nThe conservative temperament is characterized by intransigence, and the party\u2019s voting bloc is big enough for that to matter. More than that, the party knows that the liberals are outnumbered.\n\nThis is the Democrats\u2019 existential crisis. At the presidential level, it might look like the Democrats are the more sophisticated of the two parties. The nomination process is down to two people, whereas the Republican Party is an endless parade of would-have-beens trying to gather up votes at the margins while Donald Trump and Ted Cruz send shivers through the GOP establishment. But the fact of the matter is that the Republicans have won handily over the past few election rounds at building leaders and superstar lawmakers in the states.\n\nIn the Senate, the Democrats are in the minority, and while many of them are competent lawmakers, few have the stature, charisma and fame to market themselves as future leaders of the Free World. In the House, the Republicans lead the Democrats by 58 seats. The important swing states of Florida and Ohio have proved essential for winning the Electoral College, but guess what: Both those states have Republican governors and state legislatures.\n\nJust look at Iowa, our most recent democratic testing ground. The state has gone to the Democrat in five out of six of the last presidential contests, but it has one lone Democrat, Rep. David Loebsack, in its congressional delegation.\n\nThe Democrats have pulled off two White House wins since the Reagan revolution, in part by producing extremely charismatic candidates. Examining the list of Democratic governors today, you can find plenty of good executives who have enacted liberal policy in their states, but it\u2019s hard to imagine Dan Malloy of Connecticut stirring up the nation\u2019s emotions the way Bill Clinton did as a young contender in 1992.\n\nThis is the long slog that the Democrats will have to face in the years to come, no matter what happens this November. Sure, there\u2019s a feeling that Hillary Clinton might be not only a competent manager of executive affairs, but also the best hope to save the nation from Trump or an unhinged Tea Partier like Cruz. It\u2019s at best a short-term fix to a long-term problem.\n\nSome see the reinvestment in urban areas as the new breeding ground for the next generation of liberalism. It\u2019s a start, but the Democratic Party\u2019s hardest sell has always been in so-called flyover country, the areas far flung from concentrated commerce. Winning that part of America is the most pressing thing right now. The party has hardly any long-term vision of whom it might run in the future, or of how to create the kind of Congress that would either deliver Democratic-friendly legislation or blunt an extremist Republican if one came to power.\n\nWhat this boils down to is that Democratic voters shouldn\u2019t vote for the candidate the pundit class says is most suitable. Instead, you may as well vote for the person who best represents your interests.\n\nAri Paul is a journalist in New York City who has covered politics for The Nation, The Guardian and many other outlets.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/128x79/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-1454542569.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Ari Paul", "sailthru.image.720x405": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.forward.com/images/720x405/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-1454542569.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "Democratic voters shouldn\u2019t back Hillary Clinton just because pundits say she can get things done, Ari Paul writes.
