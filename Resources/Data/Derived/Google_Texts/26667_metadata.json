(Courtesy of Hazelden-Betty Ford Foundation)\n\nMarvin Seppala wrote a book on conquering drug addiction with counseling and group therapy.\n\nThe spiritual, abstinence-based strategy pioneered by Alcoholics Anonymous and adopted by Narcotics Anonymous helped him overcome his own alcohol and cocaine addiction when he was 19. As medical director of Minnesota\u2019s Hazelden clinic, he watched it work for patients.\n\nHe believed in it \u2014 and then he changed his mind.\n\nIn 2007, Seppala began working at Beyond Addictions, a now-defunct treatment center in Beaverton, Ore. Instead of relying solely on counseling and 12-step programs, the center gave its patients a relatively new medication, buprenorphine, to relieve their drug cravings.\n\nBack in Minnesota, his patients had been bailing out of treatment to use illicit drugs again. In Oregon his patients on buprenorphine weren\u2019t relapsing or overdosing \u2014 they reported feeling \u201cnormal\u201d again.\n\nNearly a decade later, physicians and brain researchers say that drugs such as buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone are the most effective anti-addiction weapons available. Nevertheless, more than two-thirds of U.S. clinics and treatment centers do not offer the medicines. Many refuse to admit people who are taking them.\n\nThe result is that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Americans are dying unnecessarily, victims of an epidemic that killed more than 28,000 people in 2014 \u2014 more than homicides and almost as many as highway fatalities. At the beginning of his State of the Union address last week, President Obama took note of the opioid epidemic, saying that helping people addicted to prescription drugs was a bipartisan priority.\n\nThe research is unassailable: Staying in recovery and avoiding relapse for at least a year is more than twice as likely with medications as without them. Medications also lower the risk of a fatal overdose.\n\nAddicts who quit drugs under an abstinence-based program are at a high risk of fatally overdosing if they relapse. Within days, the abstinent body\u2019s tolerance for opioids plummets, and even a small dose of the drugs can shut down breathing.\n\nAnd yet, as the country\u2019s opioid epidemic worsens \u2014 every day, more than 70 Americans die from overdoses, and the numbers are climbing \u2014 only about a fifth of the people who would benefit from the medications are getting them, according to a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\n[Hopkins report focuses on opioid prescribers and dispensers]\n\n\u201cWhen we discovered medications that worked for AIDS, deaths immediately plummeted. It became a chronic disease instead of a terminal disease,\u201d said Andrew Kolodny, chief medical officer of the Phoenix House treatment centers, based in New York.\n\n\u201cThis epidemic could be the same,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have medications for addiction now. But unfortunately, we\u2019re not making them available enough.\u201d\n\nPeople who could benefit from the medications are not getting them for numerous reasons. Among them:\n\n\u25cfToo few health-care professionals have specialized training in addiction medicine. Although some primary care doctors have stepped in to fill the void, most are reluctant to treat people with addictions and say these patients are often recalcitrant and disturbing to others in their waiting rooms.\n\n\u25cfInsurance coverage is limited. Few private insurers and Medicaid programs cover all of the medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration. When they do, they typically limit the dosage or how long patients can take the medication or require them to first try group therapy, which is cheaper.\n\n\u25cfMany leaders of traditional drug treatment centers, such as national detox chains and residential rehab programs, are recovering addicts who conquered their own addictions without medication. The same is true of Narcotics Anonymous. They reject the notion that an addict can truly recover from a drug problem by becoming dependent on a different drug.\n\n\u25cfGreater use of medication could cut into the centers\u2019 revenue, by reducing the number of people who opt for expensive residential stays. And smaller clinics that might want to add medication services would have to hire a physician to do so, which many of them could not afford.\n\nKelly Clark, an addiction specialist in Kentucky and president-elect of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, said some of the resistance is cultural, rooted in a widespread belief \u201cthat drug addiction is a moral failing and that people should just get over it.\u201d\n\nResistance\n\nThere is no other disease for which doctors do not prescribe approved medications to all who need them, Clark said. \u201cWe used to consider people with mental illness inferior, even possessed,\u201d she said. \u201cScientific advances have combated stigma around a wide variety of brain diseases, but not addiction.\u201d\n\nHazelden was one of the many treatment centers that resisted the use of medication \u2014 until Seppala returned from Oregon in 2009 and began pushing the board to shift course. Hazelden started offering the medications shortly thereafter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to argue when you have patients dying of overdoses,\u201d Seppala said. \u201cWe said, \u2018This is truly a crisis. We can\u2019t just base our service on philosophy, we have to look at the data and base our treatment on the best way to save lives.\u2019 \u201d\n\n[Obama sets out new ways to fight heroin, prescription drug abuse]\n\nOpponents say that while addiction medications such as buprenorphine reduce cravings, they don\u2019t attack the underlying psychological problems that often go with addiction. Nor do they address shame, guilt and self-loathing, as counseling does.\n\nRobert Mooney\u2019s belief in abstinence has never wavered. As medical director at Vista Taos, a treatment center in New Mexico, he refers his patients elsewhere if they want to take medication. \u201cWhat we do here is abstinence-based, because there are some people that nothing else will work on,\u201d he said.\n\nMooney, a psychiatrist and board-certified addiction specialist, beat his own addiction to alcohol and cocaine with an abstinence-based approach, and he grew up in an abstinence-based treatment business. His parents, John and Dot Mooney, a surgeon and a nurse, overcame their own drug and alcohol addictions through abstinence and opened a treatment center in Statesboro, Ga., in 1971 to help others tread the same path.\n\n\u201cI tell patients, \u2018We\u2019re going to take you off all medications and give your brain a chance to land, and it\u2019s going to be a long road.\u2019 You need to prepare people for that.\u201d\n\nMooney says there hasn\u2019t been enough research on the long-term effectiveness of either medication or abstinence. \u201cBut let\u2019s at least hang on to an abstinence-based philosophy, because we absolutely need it as part of the solution,\u201d he said.\n\nSeppala, who wrote \u201cClinician\u2019s Guide to the Twelve Step Principles\u201d in 2001, says addicts who want abstinence-based treatment should get it. But, he said, medication should be offered. He stresses that medication should be combined with counseling and group therapy whenever possible. Given the toll of the drug epidemic, \u201cwe ought to put everyone on some sort of medication and give them all the psychosocial counseling we can,\u201d he said.\n\nMedications\n\nA 2000 federal law requires doctors to seek a special waiver from the Drug Enforcement Administration to prescribe buprenorphine, and it limits their number of patients to 30 in the first year and to 100 in subsequent years.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services may loosen the patient limit this year. Last week, an FDA advisory panel recommended approval of a long-lasting form of the drug that could reduce the risk of relapse associated with daily doses of the pill or a dissolving film that is placed under the tongue. Probuphine, a surgically implanted device that would deliver a steady dose of buprenorphine for six months, might also cut down on illegal street sales. The FDA is expected to consider the recommendation next month.\n\nMethadone can be dispensed by only about 1,400 licensed clinics nationwide. Because most of them are in major cities, the medication is unavailable to most in rural areas. Patients must show up every day to receive their dose under the supervision of a licensed professional.\n\nVivitrol, an injectable form of naltrexone, is not a narcotic and therefore not similarly regulated. Instead of fulfilling the addicted brain\u2019s perceived need for opioids, it blocks the effect of the drugs and thereby reduces cravings.\n\nAny doctor can prescribe and administer Vivitrol. But it has a major drawback: To avoid severe and dangerous withdrawal symptoms, patients must avoid opioids completely for at least seven days before receiving the first shot. For many, that means residential treatment, which can be costly. The drug itself is also expensive, at $1,000 per month.\n\nResearch on Vivitrol\u2019s long-term effectiveness is still to come, but its use is spreading, particularly in jails and prisons. Patients are also increasingly opting for Vivitrol because the shots are effective for 30 days, tempering the temptation to stop daily doses to get high.\n\nA turning point?\n\nFor advocates of medication-based treatment, recent policy changes are cause for optimism. The Affordable Care Act allows states to expand health insurance coverage to more adults and makes it mandatory for Medicaid and private insurers to cover substance abuse treatment.\n\nIn the past, Medicaid covered only low-income pregnant women, children and disabled adults. A severe drug or alcohol addiction, while debilitating and life-crushing, did not qualify on its own as a disability.\n\nUnder the ACA, 30 states and the District have opted to expand Medicaid to low-income, able-bodied adults, giving millions of poor Americans coverage for addiction treatment. The health law also requires all state Medicaid programs and all insurance companies to cover the gamut of recommended treatments for addiction.\n\nIn addition, the federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, although not enforced everywhere, requires insurers to pay for proven addiction treatments at the same dollar level as medical and surgical treatment for other diseases.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a better time to confront the addiction problem we have in this country,\u201d said Michael Botticelli, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n\n\u201cWe know so much more about addiction from years of scientific research,\u201d Botticelli said. \u201cWe know that substance-use disorders are diseases of the brain, that they can be chronic and relapsing. But we also know that, like other diseases, they can be prevented, treated, and people can recover.\u201d\n\nThis article was produced by Stateline, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, drug addiction, opioid epidemic, buprenorphine, prescription drug abuse", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Buprenorphine and methadone are effective, doctors say, but most clinics don\u2019t offer them.", "title": "Treating addicts: The tension between drug treatment and abstinence", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/treating-addicts-the-tension-between-drug-treatment-and-abstinence/2016/01/15/845bfb98-b89b-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/14/Local/Images/WomensRecoveryCenter6401452815410.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Buprenorphine and methadone are effective, doctors say, but most clinics don\u2019t offer them.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/treating-addicts-the-tension-between-drug-treatment-and-abstinence/2016/01/15/845bfb98-b89b-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, drug addiction, opioid epidemic, buprenorphine, prescription drug abuse", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "845bfb98-b89b-11e5-99f3-184bc379b12d"}, "article_summary": "Seppala, who wrote \u201cClinician\u2019s Guide to the Twelve Step Principles\u201d in 2001, says addicts who want abstinence-based treatment should get it.\n\u25cfMany leaders of traditional drug treatment centers, such as national detox chains and residential rehab programs, are recovering addicts who conquered their own addictions without medication.\n(Courtesy of Hazelden-Betty Ford Foundation)Marvin Seppala wrote a book on conquering drug addiction with counseling and group therapy.\nNevertheless, more than two-thirds of U.S. clinics and treatment centers do not offer the medicines.\nUnder the ACA, 30 states and the District have opted to expand Medicaid to low-income, able-bodied adults, giving millions of poor Americans coverage for addiction treatment."}
