Scott Walker, eager to jump-start a flagging campaign, expressed support for a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding and likened his fights with lawmakers in Wisconsin to the movie \u201cBraveheart.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush reveled in the weeds of his tax plan and federal discretionary spending, appearing grateful for the chance to address a policy forum \u2014 until a discussion of his long-held support for Common Core education standards inspired hearty boos. \u201cHang on a second,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cYou\u2019re going to like the ending of this story.\u201d\n\nAnd Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon ascending in recent weeks toward the top of the polls, brandished the understated charm that has powered his rise: He entered to a standing ovation, thanked his hosts for inviting him on the day he was turning 64, and was promptly serenaded by the crowd with a full rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople think doctors only know medicine,\u201d he said later, defending his qualifications as far-reaching. \u201cThey\u2019re nuts.\u201d\n\nTwo days after their second televised debate scrambled the race anew \u2014 perhaps most notably elevating the profile of Carly Fiorina \u2014 nearly all the Republican contenders for president descended on South Carolina on Friday for a conference organized by the conservative group Heritage Action for America. (The group is the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, founded in 1973 and transformed in recent years from a staid policy incubator to an organizing engine fueled by the Tea Party movement.)\n\nPhoto\n\nThe most striking exception was Donald J. Trump, who had been scheduled to appear. His campaign said that a pending business transaction had forced him to cancel, a development that Heritage Action called \u201cunfortunate.\u201d (Mr. Carson joked that the news of Mr. Trump\u2019s dropping out was the \u201cbest birthday present.\u201d)\n\nIn his absence, Mrs. Fiorina, propelled on Wednesday by a memorably steely exchange with Mr. Trump over his disparaging comments about her looks, moved to build her case as a top-tier candidate. (One of Heritage Action\u2019s moderators, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, quipped of Mrs. Fiorina, \u201cThis is what a smart, intelligent face looks like.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn her own comments, Mrs. Fiorina cited her history as an executive, including her history interacting with China, in a forceful call to action that earned several sustained ovations.\n\n\u201cPressure applied by citizens on their representatives will move the system,\u201d she said. \u201cPresident Fiorina will call on you as citizens of this great nation to take our government back.\u201d\n\nMr. Bush, who was generally received warmly, cast himself as \u201ca disrupter in Tallahassee\u201d during his time as governor, suggesting his peers had comparatively thin r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.", "article_metadata": {"tone":
