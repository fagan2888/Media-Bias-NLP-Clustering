Rand Paul (R-Ky.), an early supporter of the Defund Obamacare effort that pledged not to pass a budget if the health-care law funding was part of it, said shutting down the government was a \"dumb idea\" -- but that he wouldn't change his approach in the future.\n\n\"I said throughout the whole battle that shutting down the government was a dumb idea,\" Paul said Monday night on Fox News. \"Even though it did appear as if I was participating in it, I said it was a dumb idea.\"\n\nPaul didn't say that he regretted his vote against the budget and debt ceiling increases. In fact, he suggested he would again resist a so-called \"clean\" debt-ceiling increase while hoping that it wouldn't lead to a shutdown.\n\n\"I'm in favor of voting for the principled position, but trying not to be the fly in the ointment that shuts the government down,\" he said.\n\nPaul said he faced a conundrum between allowing government to be funded and allowing the debt to explode.\n\nThe Kentucky senator said a shutdown was unlikely to happen again because the GOP lost its edge.\n\n\"I think they will resist, and I think they know that our leverage is diminished and our will to shut down the government is diminished,\" Paul said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul suggested he would again resist a so-called \"clean\" debt-ceiling increase while hoping that it wouldn't lead to a shutdown.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Paul suggested he would again resist a so-called \"clean\" debt-ceiling increase while hoping that it wouldn't lead to a shutdown.", "title": "Rand Paul: Shutdown was \u2018dumb idea,\u2019 but I\u2019d vote the same way again", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/11/19/rand-paul-shutdown-was-dumb-idea-but-id-vote-the-same-way-again/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@aaronblake"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/11/19/rand-paul-shutdown-was-dumb-idea-but-id-vote-the-same-way-again/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "rand paul, rand paul shutdown, ted cruz, ted cruz shutdown, government shutdown, budget, washington post politics, rand paul 2016, red cruz 2016,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/aaronblakewp?fref=ts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "rand paul, rand paul shutdown, ted cruz, ted cruz shutdown, government shutdown, budget, washington post politics, rand paul 2016, red cruz 2016,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd970c\"", "article_summary": "\"I said throughout the whole battle that shutting down the government was a dumb idea,\" Paul said Monday night on Fox News.\n\"Even though it did appear as if I was participating in it, I said it was a dumb idea.\"\n\"I think they will resist, and I think they know that our leverage is diminished and our will to shut down the government is diminished,\" Paul said.\nPaul didn't say that he regretted his vote against the budget and debt ceiling increases.\nPaul said he faced a conundrum between allowing government to be funded and allowing the debt to explode."}
