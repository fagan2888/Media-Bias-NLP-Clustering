This week, the drought got even worse, making history as the most extreme drought ever recorded in the state.\n\nMashable\u2019s Andrew Freedman reports:\n\nThe percentage of the state in the worst category of drought \u2014 known as \u201cexceptional drought\u201d \u2014 skyrocketed from 36.5% to 58.4% in the past week alone, according to statistics released on Thursday. This sets a record dating back to 1999, when the U.S. Drought Monitor began assessing drought conditions. This means that the majority of the state, which is the top agricultural producer in the United States, is now in the worst possible drought conditions. Mark Svboda, a climatologist at the National Drought Mitigation Center in Nebraska told Mashable that until 2014, California had not seen any areas of \u201cexceptional drought.\u201d In addition, 100% of the state is now in \u201csevere drought\u201d or worse, which has not happened since the Drought Monitor began either, he said.\n\nSvboda said that it was difficult to compare this drought with one California saw in 1977, noting that California\u2019s population has doubled since then. He added, \u201cI think we\u2019re looking at a once in a generation type of event.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The majority of the state is now in \"exceptional drought\"", "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The majority of the state is now in \"exceptional drought\"", "title": "California is now in the midst of the worst drought on record", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/01/california_is_now_in_the_midst_of_the_worst_drought_on_record/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/california-drought-water-auctions.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The majority of the state is now in \"exceptional drought\"", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/california-drought-water-auctions.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "California is now in the midst of the worst drought on record", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "California is now in the midst of the worst drought on record", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California, drought, Water", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda215\"", "article_summary": "This sets a record dating back to 1999, when the U.S. Drought Monitor began assessing drought conditions.\nTopics: California, drought, Water, Sustainability News, NewsCalifornians have been in the midst of a three-year drought that has meant significant lifestyle changes (for instance, watering your lawn could earn you a $500 fine).\nThis week, the drought got even worse, making history as the most extreme drought ever recorded in the state.\nThis means that the majority of the state, which is the top agricultural producer in the United States, is now in the worst possible drought conditions.\nMashable\u2019s Andrew Freedman reports:The percentage of the state in the worst category of drought \u2014 known as \u201cexceptional drought\u201d \u2014 skyrocketed from 36.5% to 58.4% in the past week alone, according to statistics released on Thursday."}
