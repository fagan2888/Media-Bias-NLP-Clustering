PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Pop queen Beyonce has paid a visit to Haiti to look at the progress made since an earthquake devastated the country five years ago.

Haiti U.N. mission spokeswoman Sophie Boutaud de la Combe said Saturday that Beyonce also was able to “meet some of the people who were affected by” by the 2010 disaster in the impoverished Caribbean country.

De la Combe said the American singer, a 20-time Grammy winner, visited Haiti with Valerie Amos, the United Nations’ humanitarian affairs chief and emergency relief coordinator.

Photos taken during her Haiti visit show Beyonce wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of her charity organization.

It wasn’t immediately clear how long Beyonce’s stop in Haiti was or exactly where she visited.

Official estimates say the 2010 quake that shattered Haiti’s capital and surrounding areas claimed as many as 300,000 lives.
