Not yet finished with a 12-story, $1 billion building project begun in 2004, UK HealthCare announced Thursday plans for another 12-story tower to replace Good Samaritan Hospital. The budget for the first tower project has grown from about $400 million to $1 billion and the original completion date has changed from 2009 to beyond 2021.
