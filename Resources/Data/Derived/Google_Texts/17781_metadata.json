The official was not authorized to discuss the arrest and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGuzman, 56, was found with an unidentified woman. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Marshals Service were \u201cheavily involved\u201d in the capture, the official said. No shots were fired.\n\nMexico\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office confirmed a capture on Saturday but would not say whether it was Guzman.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge success for Mexican authorities,\u201d said Samuel Gonzalez, a former anti-drug prosecutor in Mexico, \u201cthat after so many years, this guy will return to prison. All of his victims deserve that.\u201d\n\nGuzman faces multiple federal drug trafficking indictments in the U.S. and is on the DEA\u2019s most-wanted list. Hisdrug empire stretches throughout North America and reaches as far away as Europe and Australia. His cartel has been heavily involved in the bloody drug war that has torn through parts of Mexico for the last several years.\n\nA legendary outlaw, Guzman had been pursued for several weeks. His arrest comes on the heels of the takedown of several top Sinaloa operatives in the last few months and at least 10 mid-level cartel members in the last week.\n\nThe son of Sinaloa\u2019s co-leader and Guzman\u2019s partner, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, was arrested in November after entering Arizona, where he had an appointment with U.S. immigration authorities to arrange legal status for his wife.\n\nThe following month, Zambada\u2019s main lieutenant was killed as Mexican helicopter gunships sprayed bullets at his mansion in the Gulf of California resort of Puerto Penasco in a four-hour gunbattle. Days later, police in the Netherlands arrested Zambada\u2019s flamboyant top enforcer as he arrived in Amsterdam.\n\nFor that reason, rumors circulated that that the government was mounting a major operation to get Zambada.\n\nExperts predict that as long as Zambada is at large, the cartel will continue business as usual.\n\n\u201cThe take-down of Joaqu\u00edn \u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzm\u00e1n Loera is a thorn in the side of the Sinaloa Cartel, but not a dagger in its heart,\u201d said College of William and Mary government professor George Grayson, who studies Mexico\u2019s cartels. \u201cZambada \u2026 will step into El Chapo\u2019s boots. He is also allied with Juan Jose \u201cEl Azul\u201d Esparragoza Moreno, one of most astute lords in Mexico\u2019s underworld and, by far, its best negotiator.\u201d\n\nGuzman\u2019s capture ended a long and storied manhunt. He was rumored to live everywhere from Argentina to Guatemala since he slipped out in 2001 from prison in a laundry truck \u2014 a feat that fed his larger-than-life persona. Because insiders aided his escape, rumors circulated for years that he was helped and protected by former Mexican President Felipe Calderon\u2019s government, which vanquished some of his top rivals.\n\nIn more than a decade on the run, Guzman transformed himself from a middling Mexican capo into arguably the most powerful drug trafficker in the world. His fortune has grown to more than $1 billion, according to Forbes magazine, which listed him among the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Powerful People\u201d and ranked him above the presidents of France and Venezuela.\n\nHis Sinaloa Cartel grew bloodier and more powerful, taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the U.S. border, including such prized cities as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Guzman\u2019s play for power against local cartels caused a bloodbath in Tijuana and made Juarez one of the deadliest cities in the world. In little more than a year, Mexico\u2019s biggest marijuana bust, 134 tons, and its biggest cultivation were tied to Sinaloa, as were a giant underground methamphetamine lab in western Mexico and hundreds of tons of precursor chemicals seized in Mexico and Guatemala.\n\nHis cartel\u2019s tentacles now extend as far as Australia thanks to a sophisticated, international distribution system for cocaine and methamphetamines.\n\nGuzman did all that with a $7 million bounty on his head and while evading thousands of law enforcement agents from the U.S. and other countries devoted to his capture. A U.S. federal indictment unsealed in San Diego in 1995 charges Guzman and 22 members of his organization with conspiracy to import over eight tons of cocaine and money laundering. A provisional arrest warrant was issued as a result of the indictment, according to the state department.\n\nHe has been indicted by federal authorities in the United States several times since 1996. The charges include allegations that he and others conspired to smuggle \u201cmulti-ton quantities\u201d of cocaine into the U.S. and used violence, including murder, kidnapping and torture to keep the smuggling operation running. He\u2019s also accused of conspiring to smuggle heroin into the United States and money laundering.\n\nIn 2013, he was named \u201cPublic Enemy No. 1\u201d by the Chicago Crime Commission, only the second person to get that distinction after U.S. prohibition-era crime boss Al Capone. Guzman faces a two-count indictment in Chicago charging him with running a drug smuggling conspiracy responsible for smuggling cocaine and heroin into the U.S.\n\nGuzman is still celebrated in folk songs and is said to have enjoyed deep protection from humble villagers in the rugged hills of Sinaloa and Durango where he has hidden from authorities. He is also thought to have contacts inside law enforcement that helped him evade capture, including a near-miss in February 2012 in the southern Baja California resort of Cabo San Lucas just after an international meeting of foreign ministers. He was vacationing in Cabo during a visit by then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no drug-trafficking organization in Mexico with the scope, the savvy, the operational ability, expertise and knowledge as the Sinaloa cartel,\u201d said one former U.S. law enforcement official, who couldn\u2019t be quoted by name for security reasons. \u201cYou\u2019ve kind of lined yourself up the New York Yankees of the drug trafficking world.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 70,000 people have been killed in drug violence since former President Calderon deployed thousands of soldiers to drug hotspots upon taking office on Dec. 1, 2006. The current government of President Enrique Pena Nieto has stopped tallying drug-related killings separately. Many say his government\u2019s assault ondrug cartels and arrest of kingpins actually fueled the growth of Sinaloa and its major rival, the Zetas, which are now going head-to-heard for lucrative territory.\n\nThe two are battling for Nuevo Laredo, a play Guzman lost to the Zetas in 2005, and hitting each other deep inside their respective territories. Sinaloa took over a key Zeta port in Veracruz, while bands of Zetas have attacked their rival deep inside the cartel\u2019s home, western Sinaloa and Jalisco states.\n\nThe conflict has led to the gruesome dumping of dozens of bodies by both organizations in their battlegrounds.\n\nAuthorities said the battle also weakened the Sinaloa cartel and that key hits on the top leadership in Guzman\u2019s organization had shaken up his inner circle. In the first months of 2012, the Mexican army and federal police arrested a half dozen key Sinaloa people, including two major cocaine suppliers and a man described as the head of Guzman\u2019s security detail.\n\nIn April last year, a video made the rounds on the Internet of a man whom U.S. authorities believed was Guzman, possibly indicating a security breach in his inner circle. In 2012, Colombian police seized 116 properties worth $15 million that they say were bought for Guzman, while the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was placing financial sanctions on a wife and several of his sons.\n\nWhile his capture may have symbolic importance, many, including Guzman\u2019s cartel partner, Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada, say it won\u2019t stop the violence or flow of drugs through Mexico to the United States.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the capos, jailed, dead or extradited \u2014 their replacements are ready,\u201d Zambada said in an exclusive interview published in Proceso magazine in April 2010.\n\nGuzman\u2019s success and infamy surpassed Colombia\u2019s Pablo Escobar, who was gunned down by police in 1993 after waging a decade-long reign of terror in the South American country, killing hundreds of police, judges, journalists and politicians.\n\nGrowing up poor, Guzman was drawn to the money being made by the flow of illegal drugs through his home state of Sinaloa.\n\nHe joined the Guadalajara cartel, run by Mexican Godfather Miguel Angel Gallardo, and rose quickly through the ranks as a ruthless businessman and skilled networker, making key contacts with politicians and police to ensure his loads made it through without problems.\n\nAfter Gallardo was arrested in 1989, the gang split, and Guzman took control of Sinaloa\u2019s operations.\n\nThe Sinaloa cartel violently seized lucrative drug routes from rivals and built sophisticated tunnels under the U.S. border to move its loads.\n\nIn 1993, gunmen linked to the Tijuana-based Arrellano Felix cartel attempted to assassinate Guzman at the Guadalajara airport but instead killed Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, outraging Mexicans.\n\nPolice arrested Guzman weeks later before his escape from El Puente Grande prison in 2001. At the time of his escape, Guzman had been serving a 20-year sentence for bribery and criminal association in a maximum-security prison in Mexico.\n\nHe was rumored to have once entered a restaurant in Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa state, where his henchmen confiscated every patron\u2019s cellphone so their boss could eat without fear of an ambush. He was also rumored to have staged an elaborate public wedding in 2007 to an 18-year-old bride that was attended by officials and local police.\n\nFederal police say they raided the town that day, but got there just a few hours too late.\n\nGuzman had long been reported to move around frequently, using private aircraft, bulletproof SUVs and even all-terrain vehicles.\n\nHis location was part of Mexican folklore, with rumors circulating of him being everywhere from Guatemala to almost every corner of Mexico, especially its \u201cGolden Triangle,\u201d a mountainous, marijuana-growing region straddling the northern states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua.\n\nAn archbishop in northern Durango state said in April 2009 that Guzman lived in a town nearby. Days later, investigators found the bodies of two slain army lieutenants with a note: \u201cNeither the government nor priests can handle El Chapo.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The head of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel who was the world's most powerful drug lord was captured overnight by U.S. and Mexican authorities at a condominium in Mazatlan, Mexico, The Associated Press learned Saturday, ending a bloody decades-long career that terrorized swaths of the country.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The head of Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa Cartel who was the world\u2019s most powerful drug lord was captured overnight by U.S. and Mexican authorities at a condominium in Mazatlan, Mexico, The Associated Press learned Saturday, ending a bloody decades-long career that terrorized swaths of the country.", "title": "Sinaloa drug chief \u2018Chapo\u2019 Guzman arrested by US, Mexican authorities in Mexico", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/22/sinaloa-drug-chief-chapo-guzman-arrested-us-mexica/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/22/drug-war-mexicojpeg-06d54.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/22/drug-war-mexicojpeg-06d54.jpg", "description": "The head of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel who was the world's most powerful drug lord was captured overnight by U.S. and Mexican authorities at a condominium in Mazatlan, Mexico, The Associated Press learne", "card": "summary", "title": "Sinaloa drug chief \u2018Chapo\u2019 Guzman arrested by US, Mexican"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca55f\"", "article_summary": "The Sinaloa cartel violently seized lucrative drug routes from rivals and built sophisticated tunnels under the U.S. border to move its loads.\n\u201cThis is a huge success for Mexican authorities,\u201d said Samuel Gonzalez, a former anti-drug prosecutor in Mexico, \u201cthat after so many years, this guy will return to prison.\nA senior U.S. law enforcement official said Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman was taken alive overnight by Mexican marines in the beach resort town.\nHis Sinaloa Cartel grew bloodier and more powerful, taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the U.S. border, including such prized cities as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez.\nAuthorities said the battle also weakened the Sinaloa cartel and that key hits on the top leadership in Guzman\u2019s organization had shaken up his inner circle."}
