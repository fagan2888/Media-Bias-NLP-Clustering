To make matters worse, they expected Americans to pay on both ends: higher premiums, and more tax dollars for these inevitable bailouts,\u201d Americans for Prosperity\u2019s Director of Policy Akash Chougule said. \u201cWhile conservative activists were thankfully able to pressure Congress into eliminating the bailout from December\u2019s government funding bill, we should be vigilant about the administration looking for other ways to prop up insurance companies as the problems with this law become more apparent by the day. Arkansas is on the brink of becoming the first state to abandon the fiscally ruinous Medicaid expansion, state co-ops are collapsing left and right, and major insurers are less and less committed to remaining in the exchanges. In short, we\u2019re watching this law come apart at the seams.\u201d\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nCopyright 2016 Daily Caller News Foundation\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
