The magazine allows individuals to vote once per day, through Oct. 25.\n\nIn 2008, Melinda MacInnis was an animal lover teaching high school English in South Central Los Angeles and living in Venice Beach, when she booked a bucket-list trip to South Africa for her 40th birthday.\n\nWhile on holiday, MacInnis ventured from Johannesburg over to Swaziland, a landlocked monarchy roughly the size of New Jersey, smack in the middle of northeast South Africa.\n\nThat excursion six years ago happened to coincide with a disturbing and unregulated spike in poaching of the creature \u2014 which, over time, has seen the worldwide rhino population drop from about 500,000 to just shy of 30,000. It was an issue MacInnis knew nothing about before visiting Swaziland, and which has largely defined her life since.\n\nShe's now in post-production on \"The Price,\" a feature-length documentary on the plight of the rhinoceros, and what that portends. For her efforts, which include trips to Nepal, Vietnam, China, Mozambique and Kenya, as well as years of filming the likes of Dr. Jane Goodall and Dame Daphne Sheldrick, MacInnis has been named one of ten nominees for National Geographic's Traveler of the Year award.\n\nMacInnis said she's humbled by the recognition, but remains focused on \"The Price.\"\n\n\"I don't want to show people the horrible stuff. I don't want to see dead elephants or any of that,\" said MacInnis, now a Boulder resident. \"What you realize is that this rhino story is a story of life on earth in a lot of ways. They've been here during continental shifts, ice ages, millions and millions of years. And now they're being wiped out in a 100-year period by humans?\"\n\nThough MacInnis and her film crew, which comprises a slew of Boulder folks and former University of Colorado film students, hope to paint a broader conservationist picture, the demise of the rhino is a rather powerful story in its own right.\n\n\"In some ways,\" MacInnis says, \"rhinos were like the cows of the ecosystem. They were like the lawnmowers, keeping grass low so other species could flourish.\"\n\nLike the North American bison, they were also easy to hunt. For millions of years, though, rhinos didn't have natural predators.\n\nEnter humans.\n\n\"When Europeans, colonial-era hunters, showed up with guns, there's stories of them taking out 100 a day, like pests. It was a crazy waste,\" MacInnis said.\n\nAs a result of poaching and black market sales of rhino horn \u2014 which, at three times its weight in gold, is highly sought after for supposed therapeutic properties debunked time and again by the fact that the horn is made of keratin and calcium, the same stuff found in fingernails \u2014 the creature now lives on the brink of extinction.\n\nRhino crimes aren't exactly a new development, but they've certainly worsened in recent years. In South Africa, for example, the national parks department reported that 13 rhinos were poached in 2007. The next year, it was up to 68, and, by 2009, more than 200. In 2013, the figure eclipsed 1,000.\n\nCountries like South Africa and Swaziland have been almost powerless in attempting to curtail the destruction. Game scouts and park rangers, MacInnis explained, would for years catch poachers with AK-47s and rhino carcasses, but, with no law on the books, the poacher would pay what amounted to a $10 fine, and be released.\n\nIt's a gruesome trend, indeed, but MacInnis hopes to deliver a more hopeful message to viewers \u2014 who, by the way, she plans to reach in at least four different languages, for which she already has translators lined up.\n\n\"Look at a film like Blackfish,\" MacInnis said of the blockbuster documentary on killer whale abuse at SeaWorld. \"It's an excellent example of connecting emotionally and linking you to an actual cause. That's something that's doable. You can stop supporting SeaWorld.\"\n\nThe rhino issue is different, she said, in that it's \"almost larger than us.\"\n\n\"How are we going to stop poaching across Africa? We have to find a way to communicate that saving the rhinos is doable. Rhino horn does not cure cancer. You don't need a rhino bracelet.\n\n\"We can shut down the organized crime that's behind it, and the consumers on the other end. It's a test case for solving so many environmental issues.\"\n\nContact Camera Staff Writer Alex Burness at 303-473-1389 or burnessa@dailycamera.com, or follow him at twitter.com/alex_burness.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26755168/boulder-filmmakers-travels-lead-her-project-highlighting-rhinos", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26755168:view"}, "startDate": "2014-10-18T18:15:22-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "National Geographic's 2014 Traveler of the YearTo cast your vote for Melinda MacInnis, or someone else, visit on.", "title": "Boulder filmmaker's travels lead her to project highlighting rhinos' plight", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26755168/boulder-filmmakers-travels-lead-her-project-highlighting-rhinos", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1018/20141018__19DCARHIw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2014-10-18T18:30:11-0600", "endDate": "2024-10-18T18:14:34-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Alex BurnessCamera", "pubDate": "2014-10-18T18:20:13-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-18T18:15:22-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder filmmaker's travels lead her to project highlighting rhinos' plight", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1018/20141018__19DCARHIw~1_300.jpg", "description": "National Geographic's 2014 Traveler of the YearTo cast your vote for Melinda MacInnis, or someone else, visit on.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_26755168/boulder-filmmakers-travels-lead-her-project-highlighting-rhinos", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "National Geographic's 2014 Traveler of the YearTo cast your vote for Melinda MacInnis, or someone else, visit on.", "title": "Boulder filmmaker's travels lead her to project highlighting rhinos' plight"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1018/20141018__19DCARHIw~1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6cf\"", "article_summary": "In South Africa, for example, the national parks department reported that 13 rhinos were poached in 2007.\nCountries like South Africa and Swaziland have been almost powerless in attempting to curtail the destruction.\nShe's now in post-production on \"The Price,\" a feature-length documentary on the plight of the rhinoceros, and what that portends.\nWhile on holiday, MacInnis ventured from Johannesburg over to Swaziland, a landlocked monarchy roughly the size of New Jersey, smack in the middle of northeast South Africa.\n( Courtesy photo / National Geographic )National Geographic's 2014 Traveler of the Year To cast your vote for Melinda MacInnis, or someone else, visit travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/vote-grid/vote-traveler-of-the-year-2014/."}
