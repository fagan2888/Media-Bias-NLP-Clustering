The decision is a reversal of policy stemming from the decision by two Catholic universities not to fund elective abortions through their employee health plans.\n\nAlthough the federal Affordable Care Act does not compel employers to provide workers with health insurance that includes abortion coverage, California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) Director Michelle Rouillard said in a letter to seven insurance companies on Friday that the state Constitution and a 1975 state law prohibits them from selling group plans that exclude the procedure. Rouillard said her department had \u201cerroneously approved or did not object\u201d to a small number of health insurance policies that excluded abortions.\n\nBut Bill Donahue, president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, said both Santa Clara University and Loyola Marymount University had already agreed to cover abortions in cases threatening the mother\u2019s life or health. Loyola also allowed employees to purchase separate insurance for elective abortions. The two schools said their insurers, Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente, had cleared the move with the state.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

Jerry Brown to clarify and reverse the healthcare department\u2019s decision.\n\nThe Life Legal Defense Foundation (LLDF) and Alliance Defending Freedom, sent a letter to Rouillard on Friday saying that under federal law, California cannot force employers to cover elective abortions. The groups said they would file a civil rights complaint with the federal government unless the state reinstated its previous policy.\n\n\u201cPro-life employers have the freedom to choose health insurance plans that do not conflict with their beliefs on the dignity of human life,\u201d LLDF Legal Director Catherine Short said. \u201cCalifornia cannot be allowed to discriminate against health plans that don\u2019t cover elective abortions and force people to purchase coverage that conflicts with their convictions.\u201d\n\nThe legal associations argue that the California Constitution only prevents the state from withholding funds for abortions. More significantly, they said the DMHC\u2019s decision conflicts with the Weldon Amendment, a federal law prohibiting federal funding for state agencies that discriminate against institutions that refuse to fund abortions. The groups said the DMHC faces potential loss of federal funding due to the violation.\n\n\u201cIt smacks in the face of freedom,\u201d said Dana Cody, LLDF executive director.\n\nThe two insurance companies told the San Jose Mercury News that they would comply with the new directive. Loyola and Santa Clara representatives said they would explore their options with Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente.\n\nIn her letter to the insurers, Rouillard asked the companies to review their plans, including any the department had already approved, to make sure they are in compliance with the new guidance. \u201cAbortion is a basic health care service,\u201d Rouillard said. \u201cAll health plans must treat maternity services and legal abortion neutrally.\u201d\n\nBut for Donahue, the DMHC\u2019s decision constitutes a violation of religious liberty.\n\n\u201cCatholic universities have a right and a duty to uphold the tenets of their faith in everything they do,\u201d he said. \u201cPaying for abortions is in direct conflict with the teachings of the Catholic Church. Not only is this decision morally obscene, it violates the religious liberties of Catholic institutions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "Health insurance companies in California may not refuse to cover the cost of abortions, state insurance officials have ruled.
