Health centers in Michigan that serve patients in need will receive $18.1 million in funding to increase access to medical service and to expand their clinics.

The funds are part of a $500 million awarded under the Affordable Care Act to 1,200 health centers nationwide.

In Michigan, 33 centers will receive a total of $9.4 million in funds to improve patient access to medical, dental, behavioral, pharmacy and vision care. They will provide services to more than 22,000 new patients, according to the Michigan Primary Care Association. Nine centers will receive $8.7 million to renovate or expand.

"These awards will give more people in Michigan access to comprehensive, quality health care," said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. "With these awards, health centers will be able to do things like increase their hours of operation, hire more behavioral health providers, add dental facilities, better treat patients with opioid use disorders, and help people get coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace and make the journey from coverage to primary care."
