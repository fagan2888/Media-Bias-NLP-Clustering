He and his wife were left largely with unfamiliar clinics dozens of miles away, as he tells it.\n\n+ Florida Blue says a Boynton Beach customer office represents one way consumers can resolve problems. \u00d7\n\nBut now it\u2019s too late to switch plans and keep the federal subsidy that helps reduce premiums under the Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stuck with them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\nOther complaints have sounded similar themes: \u201cWhen you finally come to the doctor in 2016, you discovered that doctor that was in network upon your signing up to the plan actually is not included,\u201d a woman identifying herself as a Lakeland customer said on consumeraffairs.com.\n\nPrivately, an official at one regional doctor group said they were puzzled by claim denials from Florida Blue early in 2016, but the insurer seemed to offer little resistance when the doctors warned they might be forced to leave the plan \u2014 and soon did so.\n\nThe problems come after a series of developments, including a GOP-led Congress\u2019 blocking of billions of dollars in \u201crisk corridor\u201d funding designed to help health insurers cushion losses in exchange plans.\n\nUnitedHealthcare, the biggest health insurer in the country, said last month that it plans to exit most Affordable Care Act exchanges by 2017.\n\nSo the question arises: Is Florida Blue taking steps to make its own plan unattractive because it fears it is too financially risky?\n\n\u201cNo, that is not the case at all,\u201d said Florida Blue spokesman Paul Kluding. \u201cSince the launch of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace, Florida Blue has offered plans in every county in the state of Florida, and we remain committed to providing health care to all Floridians through the marketplace.\u201d\n\nThis issue is \u201climited to one, new marketplace product, which is designed to provide access to affordable health care to more Floridians,\u201d Kluding said. \u201cThis product is focused on improving health outcomes, and therefore, requires greater engagement and collaboration among the patient, the doctor, and Florida Blue. This need for greater engagement has resulted in some modifications to the doctors available in this network, including some who have chosen to no longer participate in this product.\u201d\n\nFlorida Blue is not trying to back out of exchange coverage, he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the fluctuation of insurers\u2019 participation in the marketplace, there is a significant chance Florida Blue will be the only statewide plan in 2017,\u201d Kluding said. \u201cUnlike other insurers that select only certain counties, we are dedicated to improving the health of all Florida communities while adhering to our mission of helping people and communities achieve better health.\u201d\n\nAs for problems in places like Palm Beach County, Kluding said, \u201cWe apologize for, and truly regret, any challenges our members have experienced.\u201d\n\nIn certain markets, the company said it introduced a new localized health care product, named myBlue, aimed at providing more Floridians access to affordable care.\n\n\u201cWe have learned of some issues in Palm Beach County related to selecting a primary care doctor,\u201d Kluding said. \u201cDue to recent changes in the network, some of the myBlue members in Palm Beach County were assigned new primary care doctors, and a small percentage of those have had delays getting appointments. We are actively assisting members with finding convenient primary care doctors and helping them get appointments.\u201d\n\nIn Boynton Beach, Gordon said Florida Blue assigned a caseworker he credits with \u201cdiligently helping\u201d the family find better options for doctors close to them.\n\nThe Florida Office of Insurance Regulation said it is checking on the matter. \u201cThe Office will be speaking with Florida Blue to discuss this issue,\u201d spokeswoman Amy Bogner said.\n\nU.S. Health and Human Services officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFlorida Blue leads health insurers in total complaints to the state\u2019s Department of Financial Services with more than 1,550 since the start of 2015, records requested by The Palm Beach Post show. That\u2019s complaints on all services, not just Obamacare plans, but it is more than double the next competitor, a unit of UnitedHealthcare.\n\nFlorida Blue says it has the most customers, though merging Aetna and Humana appear to be on track to collect the most premium dollars in the state.\n\n\u201cWe take member concerns very seriously,\u201d Kluding said. \u201cAs the leading insurer in the state, Florida Blue has more than 4 million members in Florida, and the number of issues reported should be considered in the context of our large membership base.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of Florida\u2019s largest health insurers is facing complaints about confusing claim denials and doctors disappearing from 2016 plans, leading some consumers to protest they did not get what they bargained for in Florida Blue\u2019s Obamacare coverage.", "author": "By Charles Elmore - Palm Beach Post Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/business/florida-blue-customers-smell-obamacare-bait-and-sw/nrJDd/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/05/06/89/26/Florida-Blue-Boynton.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One of Florida\u2019s largest health insurers is facing complaints about confusing claim denials and doctors disappearing from 2016 plans, leading some consumers to protest they did not get what they bargained for in Florida Blue\u2019s Obamacare coverage.", "title": "Florida Blue customers claim Obamacare bait and switch"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/05/06/89/26/Florida-Blue-Boynton.jpg", "description": "One of Florida\u2019s largest health insurers is facing complaints about confusing claim denials and doctors disappearing from 2016 plans, leading some consumers to protest they did not get what they bargained for in Florida Blue\u2019s Obamacare coverage.", "card": "summary", "title": "Florida Blue customers smell Obamacare bait and switch"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "mypbp", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/business/florida-blue-customers-smell-obamacare-bait-and-sw/nrJDd/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3335706/news/business/florida-blue-customers-smell-obamacare-bait-and-sw/nrJDd/", "keywords": "ACC,allpbc,consumeradvice,health care,mobile breaking business,newsfeed", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9400\"", "article_summary": "Florida Blue says it has the most customers, though merging Aetna and Humana appear to be on track to collect the most premium dollars in the state.\n\u201cThe Office will be speaking with Florida Blue to discuss this issue,\u201d spokeswoman Amy Bogner said.\n+ Florida Blue says a Boynton Beach customer office represents one way consumers can resolve problems.\n\u201cAs the leading insurer in the state, Florida Blue has more than 4 million members in Florida, and the number of issues reported should be considered in the context of our large membership base.\u201d\nSo the question arises: Is Florida Blue taking steps to make its own plan unattractive because it fears it is too financially risky?"}
