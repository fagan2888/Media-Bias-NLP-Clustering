Beginning July 1st, guns can be legally concealed in carry bags without a special ID. In preparation for this new law, the Marion Police Department and Modern Outfitters have teamed up for a “Rights and Responsibilities” presentation.

“We’re going to go over different techniques, different mindsets and how that affects people both, emotionally afterwards as well as financially with lawsuits and the responsibility that goes with owning a firearm,” Eric Stubbs with Modern Outfitters says.

Marion Police Chief Randall Davis says his department has decided to take a proactive approach with new gun laws. He says he wants to let the public know the rights and wrongs in a class setting instead of elsewhere when a law might be unknowingly broken.

“I feel like it’s our duty to inform people and let them know about these new laws. We’ve teamed up with the experts at Modern Outfitters to help us do that,” Marion Police Chief Randall Davis says.

Stubbs says the two hour class will be perfect for those who might not know even own a gun or know much about them.

“This is the perfect class for anyone who is a beginner. Anyone that is new to firearms, anybody that is looking to get a gun for the first time. We will go over how they operate and some different things to consider when purchasing a firearm,” Stubbs says.

The class will be Tuesday June 23rd at 6:30pm.

It will be held inside of the Hamasa Shriner’s building in Marion.

The class will be free and open to all
