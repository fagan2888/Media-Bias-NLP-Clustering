It no longer works,\u201d McAfee said. \u201cThe digital age has changed the paradigm.\u201d\n\nMcAfee called for a complete overhaul of U.S. cybersecurity systems.\n\nAccording to CNN,\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if the entire country of Syria came here, if we had the cybersecurity system in place,\u201d McAfee said. McAfee said his preferred system would detect terrorist plots before they can go into effect. \u201cIf we had a coherent cybersecurity policy, we would\u2019ve known about this the moment it was hatched,\u201d McAfee said, advocating for what he called the Chinese approach to national security.\n\n\u201cIt would be impossible to hatch a plan against the Chinese,\u201d McAfee said. Having so much data in the hands of the government would seem counter to libertarian ideals. McAfee, however, disputes this. He argues the policy wouldn\u2019t be a violation of American citizens\u2019 privacy because it would be focused outside of the country. McAfee did say that his system would be \u201cdifficult to explain\u201d in the interview. In a recent op-ed for Business Insider , McAfee wrote that China was \u201ccapable of gathering all inputs prior to encryption and capturing screen shots after data has been decrypted\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t care what encryption techniques are used.\u201d\n\nMcAfee writes:\n\nHow does China achieve such dramatic results compared to the US? The answer is through a brilliant application of the foundation upon which digital science rests \u2013 mathematics. One of the most powerful tools of intelligence gathering in this new age of digital communications is a nearly forgotten field of mathematics called \u201cPoint Set Topology\u201d.\n\nHe continues, \u201cIt would be better to subcontract our security to the Chinese, eat crow and swallow our pride, until we can stand on our own as a nation in this sea of cyber security chaos which we are clearly incapable of navigating.\u201d\n\nMcAfee has been extremely critical of U.S. cybersecurity and has made it a primary focus of his campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "McAfee says that the United States is in the Stone Age when it comes to cybersecurity.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Libertarian Republic", "description": "McAfee says that the United States is in the Stone Age when it comes to cybersecurity.", "title": "John McAfee: We Need Chinese Approach to Cybersecurity", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/john-mcafee-known-for-his-antivirus-software-calls-portland-home-for-now-88776fbc2e21599d.jpg", "url": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/john-mcafee-need-chinese-approach-cybersecurity/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "McAfee says that the United States is in the Stone Age when it comes to cybersecurity.", "title": "John McAfee: We Need Chinese Approach to Cybersecurity", "image": "http://thelibertarianrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/john-mcafee-known-for-his-antivirus-software-calls-portland-home-for-now-88776fbc2e21599d.jpg", "creator": "@elias_atienza", "site": "@thelibrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 501616773}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/libertarianrepublic", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "potus2016", "published_time": "2016-03-24T10:45:20+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Elias-Atienza-712796805517411/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf we had a coherent cybersecurity policy, we would\u2019ve known about this the moment it was hatched,\u201d McAfee said, advocating for what he called the Chinese approach to national security.\n\u201cIt would be impossible to hatch a plan against the Chinese,\u201d McAfee said.\nMcAfee said they \u201cmissed the point\u201d by focusing on monitoring individuals instead of foreign nations with sophisticated cybersecurity systems before blasting the United States for having an outdated cybersecurity strategy.\nJohn McAfee: We Need Chinese Approach to CybersecurityMcAfee says United States is in the Stone AgeBy: Elias AtienzaLibertarian Party presidential candidate John McAfee has advocated for a Chinese approach to cybersecurity in a recent interview with CNN, where he also dismissed Hillary Clinton\u2019s call for more surveillance, Donald Trump\u2019s call for torture of terror suspects, and Ted Cruz\u2019s call for patrols of Muslim neighborhoods.\nAccording to CNN,\u201cI wouldn\u2019t care if the entire country of Syria came here, if we had the cybersecurity system in place,\u201d McAfee said."}
