Meanwhile, Kalamazoo County had the lowest uninsured rate among children under age 18 and Livingston County and Ottawa counties had the lowest percentage of uninsured for among all residents under age 65.





Those were among the statistics from the Census Bureau's 2012 American Community Survey, which provides data for counties with a population of more than 65,000 people.





Statewide, 11.4 percent of Michigan residents lacked health insurance in 2012, compared to a national average of 15 percent.





Most of the uninsured were between the ages of 18 and 64. Those 65 and older are covered by Medicare, while those 18 and under qualify for MIChild, a Michigan insurance program for children whose parents lack insurance.





Because of MIChild, 96 percent of Michigan children were insured in 2012. In Kalamazoo County, it was 99 percent.





Statewide, 14.4 percent of adults with a job lack insurance; 40 percent of those who are unemployed and seeking work, and 15 percent of adults under age 64 who don't work and aren't seeking work. The latter group includes college students and disabled people among others.
