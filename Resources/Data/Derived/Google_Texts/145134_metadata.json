On Tuesday, spokeswoman MaryAnn Hodges said in an e-mail that the current management is cooperating with the investigation. She said she could not comment on pending litigation.\n\n\"HMA associates and physicians who practice at our facilities are focused on providing the highest quality patient care in all of our hospitals,\" she wrote.\n\nThe chain owns or leases 23 hospitals in Florida, including some that it bought or leased after the accusations began.They include Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg and Munroe Regional Medical Center in Ocala. Those who may be touched by the wide-ranging investigation include UF Health, which is in a joint venture with HMA in three hospitals.\n\nNow, writes Tampa Bay Times business columnist Robert Trigaux, \"What did Bayfront Health step in?\" He says the once-independent St. Petersburg hospital is now caught up in a mess with a \"nose-pinching aroma.\"\n\nThe whistle-blower lawsuits allege that HMA broke anti-kickback laws that apply to those who bill Medicare and Medicaid. The Department said Monday that bonuses or contracts were given to physician groups staffing HMA emergency rooms, by providing free office space, staffing or offering direct payments. The Department singles out Primary Care Associates, a practice in Port Charlotte, for its referrals to two Florida HMA hospitals.\n\n\u201cUnlawful financial relationships between hospitals and physicians solely to increase referrals are, unfortunately, a common practice that corrupts the health care system,\u201d U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Wifredo A. Ferrer said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe system also suffers a direct financial hit when hospitals fraudulently increase admissions where they are not indicated, solely to benefit hospitals\u2019 bottom line. We will not relent in our efforts to combat these kinds of fraudulent schemes and recover funds for the Medicare program.\u201d\n\nThe announcement is just the latest in troubles for the community-hospital network, which operates 71 hospitals in 15 states. Just last week, HMA stockholders approved its nearly $4 billion sale to a Tennessee-based chain, Community Health Systems.\n\nJanet Goldstein, an attorney for two Florida whistleblowers, told Bloomberg News that the government\u2019s involvement \u201cspeaks to the quality of the evidence.\u201d\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
