It can be even worse for a child. Thankfully, medical technology and the ability to create more lifelike prosthetics are allowing children to regain the limb that was taken away from them.\n\nAs a part of the Techstar Disney Accelerator program, startup Open Bionics has been developing Disney-inspired bionic limbs for children who have lost them. The company is building these bionics in the hopes that kids get excited about prosthetics, as the idea of having a robotic hand and arm can be quite daunting for someone so young. Thankfully, with designs inspired by the likes of Marvel\u2019s Iron Man and Elsa from Disney\u2019s Frozen, Open Bionics is doing just that.\n\nIn a press release on their website, Open Bionics stated, \u201cNow kids can get excited about their prosthetics. They won\u2019t have to do boring physical therapy, they\u2019ll train to become heroes. They\u2019re not just getting medical devices, they\u2019re getting bionic hands inspired by their favorite characters.\u201d\n\nThe Walt Disney Company is lending its creative teams and providing royalty free licenses to ensure that every product that the British startup creates encapsulates every aspect of the heroes kids love. Open Bionics is also creating Star Wars-inspired bionics and says that more designs are on their way.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen a Marvel-inspired prosthetic. In 2014, 3-year-old Rayden Kahae received a 3D-printed prosthetic that was created to emulate Iron Man\u2019s gauntlets by the non-profit company E-Nable.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marvel, and, frozen, inspired, bionic, hands, given, amputee, children, thanks, open, bionics", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Open Bionics, in partnership with Disney, has created bionic hands for amputee children that take inspiration from Iron Man, Elsa from \"Frozen,\" and \"Star Wars.\"", "title": "These Bionic Hands Turn Child Amputees Into Iron Man And Elsa From 'Frozen'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/marvel-and-frozen-inspired-bionic-hands-given-amputee-children-thanks-open-bionics-356884", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/10/12/bionic-hands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Open Bionics, in partnership with Disney, has created bionic hands for amputee children that take inspiration from Iron Man, Elsa from \"Frozen,\" and \"Star Wars.\"", "title": "These Bionic Hands Turn Child Amputees Into Iron Man And Elsa From 'Frozen'", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/marvel-and-frozen-inspired-bionic-hands-given-amputee-children-thanks-open-bionics-356884", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/10/12/bionic-hands.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/10/12/bionic-hands.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-10-12T16:24:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-12T16:24:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Open Bionics, in partnership with Disney, has created bionic hands for amputee children that take inspiration from Iron Man, Elsa from \"Frozen,\" and \"Star Wars.\""}, "article_summary": "As a part of the Techstar Disney Accelerator program, startup Open Bionics has been developing Disney-inspired bionic limbs for children who have lost them.\nOpen Bionics is also creating Star Wars-inspired bionics and says that more designs are on their way.\nThankfully, with designs inspired by the likes of Marvel\u2019s Iron Man and Elsa from Disney\u2019s Frozen, Open Bionics is doing just that.\nIn a press release on their website, Open Bionics stated, \u201cNow kids can get excited about their prosthetics.\nThankfully, medical technology and the ability to create more lifelike prosthetics are allowing children to regain the limb that was taken away from them."}
