NEW YORK — Hundreds of demonstrators are marching across the Brooklyn Bridge to call for tougher gun control laws.

Saturday’s protest is being underwritten by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, one of the nation’s most visible gun control advocates.

The marchers include relatives of some of those slain in the 2012 shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.

About 1,000 activists gathered in downtown Brooklyn and are marching across the bridge to City Hall.

They will then hold a demonstration outside the building’s gates and chant “Not one more.”

That’s the rallying cry uttered by Richard Martinez, whose son Christopher was shot to death in Santa Barbara, California, last month.
