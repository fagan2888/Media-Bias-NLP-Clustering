But researchers implanted electronic sensors in his brain, and now he can actually grab a bottle and pour from it, stir liquid with a stick, swipe a credit card, wiggle his fingers and hold a toothbrush.\n\nThe downside of the discovery is he can only perform those tasks for a few hours each week, during lab time when he\u2019s attached to a device that interprets his brain signals and then stimulates the muscles in his arm.\n\nBut it holds potential to \u201creally increase my quality of life and independence,\u201d Burkhart said, the AP reported.\n\nPrior research has shown that paralyzed individuals can learn to move robotic limbs via brain implants or the diversion of signals from muscles in the body that aren\u2019t paralyzed. But this latest discovery shows a paralyzed person can actually be implanted with a chip that allows stimulation from his or her own paralyzed muscles.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!
