He failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled,\u201d Chaffetz, R-Utah, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis action will demonstrate to the American people that the IRS is under repair, and signal that Executive Branch officials who violate the public trust will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nKoskinen became commissioner in 2013 after the scandal surfaced, but Chaffetz and 18 of his Republican colleagues said his failure to comply with a subpoena enabled IRS employees to destroy key evidence necessary to investigations.\n\nSoon after the Senate confirmed Koskinen in February 2014, Congress ordered him to submit all emails associated with Lois Lerner, the former director of the IRS\u2019 exemptions division at the time of the agency\u2019s targeting.\n\nThe commissioner failed to do so, the resolution states, and just three weeks after the subpoena was issued, roughly 24,000 emails were destroyed.\n\nFurther, the committee contends that Koskinen \u201cengaged in a pattern of deception,\u201d detailing multiple occasions where the commissioner made false statements under oath during congressional hearings.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said in a statement Tuesday the House Judiciary Committee would review the impeachment resolution.\n\n\u201cThis has become an all too familiar pattern in an administration that chooses to misdirect, obscure and outright lie rather than truthfully describe their own actions,\u201d Issa said. \u201cThere has to be some consequence for misleading and obstructing a congressional investigation.\u201d\n\nThe announcement arrived just days after the Justice Department said it would close its two-year investigation into the IRS without pressing criminal charges.\n\n\u201cWe found no evidence that any IRS official acted based on political, discriminatory, corrupt, or other inappropriate motives that would support a criminal prosecution,\u201d the Justice Department said in its letter delivered to Congress.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said the \u201cmisconduct and misdeeds\u201d of those in government do not have to be illegal to initiate impeachment proceedings.\n\n\u201cThe original intent of the framers of the Constitution was for impeachment to be used to remove not just officials guilty of lawlessness or violations of specific legal requirements, but also to remove individuals guilty of maladministration.\u201d\n\nHe said that would include \u201cthose whose actions in government were incompetent, inept, ineffectual, and negligent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The articles of impeachment accuse John Koskinen of \"conduct that is incompatible with his duties as an officer of the United States.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The articles of impeachment accuse John Koskinen of \"conduct that is incompatible with his duties as an officer of the United States.\u201d", "title": "House Republicans Move to Impeach IRS Commissioner", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151027_IRSImpeachment_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1k88KlP"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The articles of impeachment accuse John Koskinen of \"conduct that is incompatible with his duties as an officer of the United States.\u201d", "title": "House Republicans Move to Impeach IRS Commissioner", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151027_IRSImpeachment_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach", "published_time": "2015-10-27T22:31:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "John Koskinen, Jason Chaffetz, Internal Revenue Service, IRS, House Oversight Committee, Darrell Issa"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCommissioner Koskinen violated the public trust.\nHouse Republicans, enraged by the inaction that has hindered federal investigations into the IRS, introduced a resolution Tuesday to impeach Commissioner John Koskinen, charging him of lying under oath and failing to respond to subpoenas for evidence.\nRep.
