This will impact many other faith-based organizations with actual, well, faith-based beliefs. Presumably, even People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals would have to allow Oscar Meyer to lead their campus chapters.\u201d\n\nStetzer then offered, \u201cOnly in a modern American university would this make any sense.\u201d\n\nMore from his analysis:\n\nNow, it\u2019s not persecution. Christians are not banned. People can share their faith. But, now, what we once called \u201cequal access\u201d has taken another hit \u2014 people of faith do not have equal access to the university community, like the environmentalist club, the LGBT organization, or the chess club. The university system has decided that speech with beliefs that undergird it \u2014 and shape how it is organized \u2014 has to be derecognized.\n\nStetzer asked IVCF\u2019s national field director & campus access coordinator to explain how the IVCF chapters in California state schools are affected. Here\u2019s what Greg Jao told him:\n\nLoss of recognition means we lose 3 things: free access to rooms (this will cost our chapters $13k-30k/year to reserve room). We also lose access to student activities programs, including the new student fairs where we meet most students. We also lose standing when we engage faculty, students and administrators.\n\nStetzer tore into what he sees as universities\u2019 \u201ccontinual sanitization of unacceptable religious voices\u201d and then noted a very big irony, writing that \u201cthose who champion nondiscrimination, in the name of nondiscrimination, are creating rules that push out those who \u2018discriminate\u2019 based on biblical belief statements.\u201d\n\nJao sees another irony, telling Stetzer that \u201cthe university is using a rule intended to protect and to include religious groups to exclude religious groups because they want their leaders to be representatives of that religion. It\u2019s an imposition of a civil religion (democratic process) on a religious leadership selection issue.\u201d\n\nStetzer concluded by noting it appears this trend will continue.\n\n\u201cBut, the question remains, how will Christians react? I hope they won\u2019t call themselves persecuted, since that lessens the persecution in, for example, Iran. However, I also hope they will speak up graciously. And, that even people who are not religious will see the danger of stripping faith from the organized conversation at the university.\u201d\n\nCheck out Jao\u2019s reaction to the \u201cderecognition\u201d of IVCF chapters at California state campuses:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;
