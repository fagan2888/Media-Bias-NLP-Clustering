But Obamacare not only takes uninsured Americans in the wrong direction \u2013 it\u2019s failing to reliably provide the basic coverage that Americans deserve.\n\nOf the 23 co-ops established under Obamacare, all but one lost money in the last year.\n\nIn fact over the past few weeks, more than half of our nation\u2019s health insurance co-ops have collapsed \u2013 forcing more than 700,000 Americans across the country to find new health insurance options.\n\nIt\u2019s just another example of how Obamacare is not only costing taxpayers billions of dollars, it\u2019s failing to provide the American people with reliable access to affordable care.\n\nAmericans are once again forced off the health care plans they liked and away from the doctors they trusted.\n\nWhen the federal government takes over our health care system and puts the whims of Washington bureaucrats over the needs of hardworking American families, prices go up and the quality of care goes down.\n\nAfter five years of seeing President Obama\u2019s experiment with Americans\u2019 health care result in failure and embarrassment, the American people know that it\u2019s time to stop putting more Band-Aids on something that\u2019s so far beyond repair.\n\nIn the coming weeks, Republicans will work to ensure that the voice of hardworking moms and dads, union workers and tribal members, and all families who face higher costs and substandard care is heard.\n\nWe will uphold our promise to the American people and vote to repeal President Obama\u2019s broken health care law.\n\nGrowing up in Montana, I was fly-fishing before Brad Pitt made it cool in the movie \u2018A River Runs Through It,\u2019 which was filmed in southwest Montana.\n\nI know that when your fishing line gets tangled up, you\u2019ve got two options.\n\nSometimes you can take some time, untangle it and cast again.\n\nBut other times, it gets so tangled up that the only option is to cut the line and start over.\n\nThe American people know that after more than five years of President Obama\u2019s health care law and its tangled mess, it\u2019s time to cut the line.\n\nWe need to repeal Obamacare and tie on a new fly.\n\nAnd we need to replace this broken law with state-led solutions that put patients back in the center of the health care equation.\n\nLast year, when I decided to run for Montana\u2019s open Senate seat, I promised the people of Montana that I would work tirelessly to repeal Obamacare.\n\nIn 2014, the American people spoke loud and clear and elected a Republican majority to dismantle the failure that Obamacare has become.\n\nObamacare isn\u2019t working. The American people don\u2019t want it.\n\nI have a message for all Americans working day in and day out to provide for their families and achieve the American dream.\n\nWe are working to protect you from rising health care costs. And we are working to ensure you receive the quality health care you deserve.\n\nWe are fighting for you and I promise we won\u2019t stop until we have health care that works for all.\n\nThank you and God Bless.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Daines: We Will 'Vote to Repeal' Obamacare 'In The Coming Weeks'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Daines: We Will 'Vote to Repeal' Obamacare 'In The Coming Weeks'", "title": "Daines: We Will 'Vote to Repeal' Obamacare 'In The Coming Weeks' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Daines-1114-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/14/daines-we-will-vote-to-repeal-obamacare-in-the-coming-weeks/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Daines: We Will 'Vote to Repeal' Obamacare 'In The Coming Weeks'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Daines-1114-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Daines: We Will 'Vote to Repeal' Obamacare 'In The Coming Weeks' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "affordable care act, Steve Daines,Breitbart TV, Obamacare,Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Steve Daines", "published_time": "2015-11-14T07:44:07-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "We will uphold our promise to the American people and vote to repeal President Obama\u2019s broken health care law.\nWe are fighting for you and I promise we won\u2019t stop until we have health care that works for all.\nTake Cindy from Missoula, Montana \u2013 like all Americans, President Obama promised her lower health care premiums under Obamacare.\nWe need to repeal Obamacare and tie on a new fly.\nLast year, when I decided to run for Montana\u2019s open Senate seat, I promised the people of Montana that I would work tirelessly to repeal Obamacare."}
