The Louisiana Association of Business and Industry released a pro-Common Core video Thursday, the day after Gov. Bobby Jindal announced plans to scrap the academic standards in the state.

"The timing, of course, couldn't have been any better," said Brigitte Nieland, who tracks education policy for the organization.

The business association and Jindal are typically on the same page about state policy. Common Core is the rare instance in which the governor and the industry group -- which is considered the most powerful lobby in Louisiana -- clash.

For Louisiana's political insiders, the video is amusing because it features Stephen Waguespack, Jindal's former chief of staff, advocating for Common Core to stay in Louisiana. Waguespack is now president of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry.

Jindal, a Common Core advocate for years, recently turned against the standards. Conservative activists have started to criticize the educational benchmarks for being tied to the federal government and President Barack Obama. Supporting Common Core could potentially hurt Jindal if he decides to run for president in 2016.

Common Core lays out what students are supposed to learn each year in mathematics and English. Louisiana and most other states adopted the standards a few years ago.
