That\u2019s eight percent of the state\u2019s population. Of course, you have some liberals who feel that this trend is \u201calarming,\u201d and that it leads to an increase in violent crime\u2013despite the fact that such crime is at its lowest rates in nearly five decades. Even gun homicides have been nearly cut in half since 1993\u2013and dropped another 3.9 percent from last year. So, there is no gun violence epidemic, just anti-gun hysteria coming from liberals. Nevertheless, with eight percent of the state being licensed carry permit holders; we could possibly have more clarity on the issue (via The Badger Herald):\n\nAs of March, Wisconsin has issued 300,000 total concealed carry permits, but the state impact of right-to-carry laws is still widely debated. While this makes up less than 8 percent of Wisconsin\u2019s adult population, concealed carry laws remain controversial. Those in favor argue concealed carry falls under one\u2019s right to defend themselves, while those against say violent crime increases when concealed carry is allowed. Sixty-three percent of Wisconsin residents support concealed carry and 31 percent are opposed, according to the January 2016 Marquette Law School poll. University of Wisconsin journalism and mass communication professor Michael Wagner said concealed carry impacts almost every Wisconsinite. He said 8 percent is a large enough percentage to enter into almost every social situation. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a room of 30 people, somewhere between two or three are probably armed,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat\u2019s just something that might give people pause when they\u2019re out in the community.\u201d Rep. Chris Taylor, D-Madison, said she believes the number of permits that have been issued is significant and \u201calarming.\u201d The Department of Justice had to add eight new positions just to process the new permit requests, Taylor said.\n\nWell, I\u2019d say that\u2019s ne of the safest rooms in the country, then. Second, Wagner does add that there really isn\u2019t enough evidence to suggest concealed carry reduces or increase crime. One study has shown that there is no discernable impact; another said that states with restrictive carry laws have higher rates of gun homicides. The Crime Prevention Research Center also issued a report saying that more people obtaining carry permits has decreased murder rates. Regardless, more Americans are carrying concealed firearms. Concerning women obtaining permits, that figure is up 270 percent since 2007. There is nothing \u201calarming\u201d about Americans exercising their civil rights, especially one of our oldest ones.\n\nEditor's Note: John Lott of the Crime Prevention Research Center pointed out that the study that showing concealed carry permits don't really reduce crime is a bit suspect since the data for that report has been withheld. At the same time, I was never trying to give that study credence, just pointing out that there are some who go against the position that CCW is a crime deterrent. I happen to strongly disagree, but felt that Lott's post on the study linked in my original post should be included as well:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eight percent of the Badger State's population .05/26/2016 18:15:31PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Eight percent of the Badger State's population", "title": "Milestone: Wisconsin Now Has 300,000 Licensed Concealed Carry Holders", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/23/wisconsin-hits-300000-licensed-concealed-carry-holders-n2152560", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/20/562b025e-1164-483e-a130-089669eca29c.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Eight percent of the Badger State's population", "title": "Milestone: Wisconsin Now Has 300,000 Licensed Concealed Carry Holders", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/23/wisconsin-hits-300000-licensed-concealed-carry-holders-n2152560", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/20/562b025e-1164-483e-a130-089669eca29c.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Milestone: Wisconsin Now Has 300,000 Licensed Concealed Carry Holders , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e5c\"", "article_summary": "Those in favor argue concealed carry falls under one\u2019s right to defend themselves, while those against say violent crime increases when concealed carry is allowed.\nWisconsin reached a major milestone this week: 300,000 of its residents are licensed to carry a concealed firearm.\nWhile this makes up less than 8 percent of Wisconsin\u2019s adult population, concealed carry laws remain controversial.\nSixty-three percent of Wisconsin residents support concealed carry and 31 percent are opposed, according to the January 2016 Marquette Law School poll.\nUniversity of Wisconsin journalism and mass communication professor Michael Wagner said concealed carry impacts almost every Wisconsinite."}
