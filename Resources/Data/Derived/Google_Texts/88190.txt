Well, this is awkward.

According to an analysis by the Washington Free Beacon, Hillary Clinton — a proponent of equal pay — paid her female staffers in her U.S. Senate office 72 cents for each dollar paid to their male counterparts.

During the time Clinton served as a New York senator, the median annual salary for her female staffers was $40,791.55, while that for her male staffers was $15,708.38 higher at $56,499.93.

More from the Beacon:

The analysis compiled the annual salaries paid to staffers for an entire fiscal year of work from the years 2002 to 2008. Salaries of employees who were not part of Clinton’s office for a full fiscal year were not included. Because the Senate fiscal year extends from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, Clinton’s first year in the Senate, which began on Jan. 3, 2001, was also not included in the analysis.

Ironically, Clinton herself has been a big supporter of the equal pay movement, a position that will undoubtedly be undermined upon the discovery of the pay gap in her own Senate office.

20 years ago, women made 72 cents on the dollar to men. Today it's still just 77 cents. More work to do. #EqualPay #NoCeilings — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) April 9, 2014

Unfortunately for the likely Democratic presidential candidate, this is not the first evidence of Clinton’s hypocrisy.

She has criticized Obamacare even after supporting and defending it, pledged to help young Americans in the job market even when her previous positions have hurt them, complained about college cost during a speech that she charged a university $225,000 to deliver, and slammed President Obama’s “don’t do stupid stuff” foreign policy strategy despite having been his former secretary of State.

Just imagine the anti-Clinton advertisements that will be cooked up ahead of 2016.
