I've always been impressed by people with great vocabularies and have been accused of using \"dollar\" words when \"quarter\" words will do. One of the words that's been rattling around in those dark recesses of my mind is nihilism. The word comes from the Latin, nihil, which means nothing. And one of its definitions is simply nothingness or non-existence. The reason the word came to mind is that it's the perfect word to describe the modern Republican Party.\n\nFor the longest time, I was concerned about what Republicans would DO to this country. But the more I've listened to what Republicans are actually saying, and what they propose as far as what they want government to do, I've come to the conclusion that ultimately all they want to do is NOTHING! They really believe that the government that governs best governs least, and you can hardly do less than nothing. Well, I exaggerate slightly. There are two things Republicans insist government SHOULD do. The first is to maintain a strong defense with an equally strong armed forces. And, the second to provide a certain amount of order and security with a powerful police force. But apart from that, Republicans expect absolutely nothing from government.\n\nThis explains a lot, especially the visceral dislike Establishment Republicans have for Donald Trump. Oh, I know. Trump describes himself as a conservative and therefore a part of the mainstream of the Republican Party. But have you really LISTENED to what Donald Trump has to say? I'll bet a dollar to a doughnut that Establishment Republicans have, and this is why they both fear and loathe him. He actually has goals and expectations for government. He envisions a government that accomplishes something. For instance, he extols other countries because they have high-speed trains, ultra-modern airports and up-to-date infrastructures. Well, just how did they get all this good stuff? Through the work of their governments, that's how! What Establishment Republicans are afraid of is that President Trump will send legislation to the Congress asking it to involve government in the lives of its people. He will EXPECT a Republican-led government to lead, which means he'll demand that it ACT. And this is something Republican office holders across the length and breadth of this country are loathe to do.\n\nAn oversimplification? Perhaps. But only slightly. For instance, if you ask any Republican candidate for federal office what ONE thing he or she would most want to accomplish during their tenure in government, I'd be willing to bet they choose the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. And what would they replace it with? Essentially, nothing! Think about it. What is the Republican position on climate change? Their answer is, \"There IS no climate change\". So why do anything at all to stop it? Worker safety? Do nothing! Regulating unfair business practices? No regulation, DEREGULATION! Protecting unwary consumers from unscrupulous con artists who would cheat them out of their savings and leave them high and dry? Their answer? Caveat Emptor, let the buyer beware.\n\nWhy even the Supreme Court is not exempt from this nihilist approach to government. Mitch McConnell and his merry minion of nihilists are bound and determined to keep Antonin Scalia's Supreme Court seat empty for at least the next full year. Ostensibly this is to protect the Republic from the degradation of a moderate or even, GASP, a liberal from taking a seat on the Court. But the PRACTICAL effect will be to foster a long series of four-to-four ties that will render the Supreme Court totally impotent and thus force it to do? NOTHING!!!\n\nI believe in democracy. And one of the gambles of democracy is that sometimes we the people, in our wisdom or lack thereof, make bad decisions, pick the wrong people to govern us. And I'm perfectly content to assume this risk, especially when I consider the alternatives. But to all my conservative friends out there, and you KNOW who you are, I say this. If we achieve this nihilist, Ayn Randian ideal of a government, please remove ONE sentence from you vocabulary entirely. And it is? Where's the government when we need it?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chicagonow.com/recesses-mind/2016/03/the-nihilist-party/", "image": "http://www.chicagonow.com/recesses-mind/wp-content/themes/chicagonow/images/large_cn_tool_kit.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "I LOVE words.
