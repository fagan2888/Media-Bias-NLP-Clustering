Here\u2019s how Maine compared with national averages and with other states. \u2022 In Maine, 13,700 people had enrolled by the end of December, and 2.2 million had signed up nationally. Vermont, 15,000; New Hampshire, 11,400; Massachusetts, 5,400; Rhode Island, 9,800. \u2022 Forty-three percent of Maine enrollees were ages 55-64, compared with 35 percent on the federal marketplace. In nearby states, Massachusetts had 24 percent in the 55-64 bracket; Vermont, 38 percent; Rhode Island, 34 percent; New Hampshire, 38 percent. \u2022 For the 18-34 age bracket, Maine was at 18 percent; Vermont, 19 percent; Rhode Island, 22 percent; Massachusetts, 31 percent; New Hampshire, 22 percent.

Angus King of Maine. \u201cMany who have never had coverage before now have coverage.\u201d\n\nIn Maine, whose population is the oldest in the country, nearly half of the enrollees were in the 55-64 age bracket, the third-highest percentage in the United States. The health care law hinges on more young people buying insurance, but Maine health experts said they aren\u2019t concerned about the large number of older enrollees in the first three months of the marketplace.\n\nThe marketplace is where individuals who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid \u2013 many self-employed or part-time workers \u2013 can buy subsidized insurance.\n\nLike Kamegni, many recent immigrants don\u2019t know that they are eligible for coverage under the law, said Libby Cummings, an outreach coordinator at the Portland Community Health Center.\n\nCummings has helped hundreds of people sign up for insurance, and she planned to tell Kamegni about his eligibility Monday after his appointment was completed. Kamegni, who speaks limited English, said he fled Cameroon in 2012 and is applying for political asylum.\n\nAsylum seekers, while in the United States legally, are not permitted to work immediately and are not eligible for Medicaid.\n\nImmigrants aren\u2019t the only ones who don\u2019t realize they are eligible for coverage until they are told by health center employees.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know that they qualify for (insurance) and haven\u2019t even thought about it yet,\u201d said Meg Clews, a nurse practitioner at the clinic. \u201cThey\u2019re still figuring out how the system works. I\u2019m still figuring out how the system works.\u201d\n\nLeslie Brancato, executive director of the health center, said the clinic anticipates a surge in patients so it is adding two nurse practitioners to meet the demand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing much faster growth than anticipated,\u201d Brancato said. \u201cWe have a lot of requests for new patient appointments.\u201d\n\nIn Maine, the number of sign-ups could more than double by March 31, the end of the 2014 enrollment period, said Mitchell Stein, public policy director for Consumers for Affordable Health Care, a health advocacy group.\n\nStein said it\u2019s just an educated guess at this point, but it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see enrollment on the marketplace reach 25,000 to 30,000 in Maine.\n\nWendy Wolf, president and CEO of the Maine Health Access Foundation, a nonprofit that is helping to publicize the Affordable Care Act, said the numbers are good news, especially considering the computer glitches that prevented people from signing up when the marketplace went online in October and the limited advertising for the insurance.\n\n\u201cI would say 13,700 is a pretty amazing figure. People are desperate to find affordable health insurance,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nKevin Lewis, the head of Maine Community Health Options, one of two insurers on the marketplace in Maine, said the enrollment \u201cexceeded expectations.\u201d He said 80 percent of the Mainers who shop on the marketplace are choosing Maine Community Health Options\u2019 plans.\n\nLewis and federal officials indicated that they are not concerned with the age mix of the enrollees because they expected many younger people to wait until closer to the March 31 deadline to enroll.\n\nNationally, 35 percent of those who signed up in the past three months were 55 or older. In Maine, 43 percent were 55 or older.\n\nThe health care law is intended to encourage younger, healthier people to buy coverage so that insurance premiums are reduced for older people.\n\n\u201cWe think more and more young people are going to sign up as time goes by, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in Massachusetts,\u201d said Gary Cohen, deputy administrator and director of the federal Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight. Massachusetts started a program similar to the Affordable Care Act in the mid-2000s.\n\n\u201cWe are actually very pleased with the percentage (of younger enrollees) that we have so far and we expect that percentage to increase,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nIn Maine, 18 percent of the enrollees were in the 18-34 age bracket, below the national average of 25 percent.\n\nLewis said that although the enrollees tend to be older, it may not increase costs, because of the preventive screenings available under the Affordable Care Act and through Maine Community Health Options plans.\n\nAnd Lewis said he believes that more young people will sign up.\n\n\u201cIn the end, we\u2019ll have a good risk pool,\u201d he said.\n\nWashington Bureau Chief Kevin Miller contributed to this report.\n\nJoe Lawlor can be contacted at 791-6376 or at: [email protected] Twitter: @joelawlorph", "article_metadata": {"description": "Overall enrollments so far show solid demand, but 43% are 55 or older.
