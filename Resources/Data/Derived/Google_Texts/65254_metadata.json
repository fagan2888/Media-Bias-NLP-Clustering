The federal government pays out 95 percent of the cost it would have otherwise paid in exchange subsidies and cost-sharing payments for the enrollees through the law\u2019s web-based insurance portals.\n\nSo far, Minnesota and New York taken advantage of the provision.\n\nIn a statement, the administration defended its work to implement the program and keep Congress in the loop.\n\n\u201cThe Basic Health Program provides flexibility and stability to both states and their consumers, and payments to states that choose this option are fully funded under the ACA,\u201d HHS spokeswoman Meaghan Smith said. \u201cThe department has provided substantive documents and answers to Congress on this matter, sent a senior administration official to brief the committee, and the secretary has answered questions before the Ways and Means Committee, and we will continue working to address follow-up questions.\u201d\n\nRepublican concerns about the program parallel claims in a House lawsuit against the administration.\n\nGOP members are challenging President Obama\u2019s decision to continue reimbursing insurers who have reduced co-pays and deductibles for qualified Obamacare enrollees as a condition of participating in the state-based health care exchanges.\n\nThe lawsuit says Congress never authorized spending for the cost-sharing program, and indeed zeroed out funding for it, so Mr. Obama was breaking the law and violating Congress\u2018 constitutional power of the purse by continuing to disburse the funds.\n\nU.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer, presiding in Washington, enthused conservatives and shocked Democrats in September by granted Republicans legal standing to sue Mr. Obama, meaning she will rule on its merits in the coming months.\n\nThe administration has argued it hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, citing in both cases a permanent appropriation that also covers Obamacare\u2019s exchange subsidies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two powerful Republicans threatened Friday to subpoena the Obama administration unless it explains by Jan. 28 why it is funding an obscure program under Obamacare without explicit approval from Congress.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two powerful Republicans threatened Friday to subpoena the Obama administration unless it explains by Jan. 28 why it is funding an obscure program under Obamacare without explicit approval from Congress.", "title": "Kevin Brady and Fred Upton, GOP chairmen, threaten subpoena over Obamacare standoff", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/15/kevin-brady-and-fred-upton-gop-chairmen-threaten-s/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/10/Budget_Battle.JPEG-0e600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/10/Budget_Battle.JPEG-0e600.jpg", "description": "Two powerful Republicans threatened Friday to subpoena the Obama administration unless it explains by Jan. 28 why it is funding an obscure program under Obamacare without explicit approval from Congre", "card": "summary", "title": "Kevin Brady and Fred Upton, GOP chairmen, threaten subpoena over Obama"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Congress, Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "The administration has said the Affordable Care Act of 2010 granted it the power to fund the Basic Health Program, but GOP critics disagree.\nIf they cannot get the information they want, the chairmen said, they will use their subpoena power to get it.\nTwo powerful Republicans threatened Friday to subpoena the Obama administration unless it explains by Jan. 28 why it is funding an obscure program under Obamacare without explicit approval from Congress.\n\u201cThe Basic Health Program provides flexibility and stability to both states and their consumers, and payments to states that choose this option are fully funded under the ACA,\u201d HHS spokeswoman Meaghan Smith said.\nIn a statement, the administration defended its work to implement the program and keep Congress in the loop."}
