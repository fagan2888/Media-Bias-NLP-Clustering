But its strategy for responding to competition from Lyft, a slightly more down-market alternative, has some questioning whether Uber has crossed ethical lines in an effort to hamstring the company it sees as its biggest competitor.\n\nIn an article published yesterday, Casey Newton of The Verge reported on an internal Uber program to recruit Lyft\u2019s drivers using a small army of independent contractors. The contractors, known as \u201csloggers\u201d after the program\u2019s internal acronym (Supplying Long-term Operations Growth), were given a pair of iPhones and a list of valid credit card numbers they were to use to create Lyft accounts and call for rides. Once in the Lyft driver\u2019s car, their job was to talk him or her into abandoning Lyft and coming to work for Uber.\n\nRelated: Uber Snatches Up Former Obama Campaign Guru\n\nWhile slightly underhanded, there is nothing outright unethical about that part of the plan. However, according to Newton, a side effect of the program was that thousands of Lyft drivers were sent to pick up riders who ultimately cancelled the transaction \u2013 costing the drivers time and money.\n\nBecause of the way Lyft is structured, riders don\u2019t know who their drivers will be until they call for a ride. According to Newton\u2019s reporting, Uber created an online database that its sloggers used to track which drivers had already been approached about joining Uber and which had not. Apparently, when a slogger found that a driver dispatched by the service was on the list, common practice was to cancel the ride.\n\nEarlier this month, Lyft \u2013 whose cars sport huge fluffy pink moustaches on their grilles \u2013 told CNN it had logged up to 5,000 cancelled rides that it claimed could be traced to Uber-related riders.\n\nRelated: Tech Upstart Uber Aims to Ride High in 2014\n\nSome commentators have defended Uber\u2019s tactic, pointing out it\u2019s a good thing for Lyft drivers to be aware of their options, and noting that a few thousand cancelled rides is a relatively tiny portion of the company\u2019s overall business.\n\nHowever, the timing of Uber\u2019s rollout of Operation SLOG suggests there might be more to it than simple marketing. According to Newton, a team of sloggers were set loose on the streets of New York City last month in a push designed to coincide with Lyft\u2019s launch in the Big Apple, which arguably made it more difficult for Uber\u2019s new competitor to get traction. Similar programs have been implemented in at least 10 cities nationwide.\n\nIn a blog post, an Uber spokesperson identified as \u201cCraig\u201d wrote a defense of Operation Slog. Among other things, he wrote, \u201cWe can\u2019t successfully recruit drivers without talking to them \u2013 and that means taking a ride. We\u2019re all about more and better economic opportunity for drivers. We never use marketing tactics that prevent a driver from making [a] living \u2013 and that includes never intentionally canceling rides.\u201d\n\nRelated: An App That Brings a Doctor to Your Door\n\nThe use of the word \u201cintentionally,\u201d of course, stops far short of a denial that Operation SLOG resulted in drivers losing business. It also doesn\u2019t address the ethics of launching such an operation against a new competitor just as it launches in a major market.\n\nIts defense of Operation SLOG suggests that Uber is simply trying to build its own business, not interfere with Lyft\u2019s. But in an email obtained by Newton, one Uber supervisor punctuates her message to the sloggers with the hashtag #shavethestache \u2013 clearly referring to Lyft\u2019s trademark decoration.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The ride-sharing company Uber has done a great job of positioning itself as an underdog fighting against entrenched taxi companies.
