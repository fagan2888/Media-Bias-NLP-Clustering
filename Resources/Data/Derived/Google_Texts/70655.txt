Axel Toupane will be on a plane Sunday.

He will be either heading to Miami with the Nuggets or returning to his D-League team in Toronto.

The athletic rookie forward has exhausted the first of what could be — if coach Michael Malone and general manager Tim Connelly want to keep him — two 10-day contracts with the Nuggets. Malone said he and Connelly will make decide after Saturday night’s home game against Washington.

“Tim and I have had some general conversations,” Malone said. “All I’ll say to that is Axel has been terrific. I like guys — and it’s appropriate for guys on a 10-day contract — to fit in before you try to stand out. Axel comes in here — yeah, he knows Joffrey (Lauvergne) for a long time — but he doesn’t try to be anything he’s not. He knows his role, he works hard.”

The French native, whom the Nuggets called up from the D-League, has been productive. Going into Saturday, Toupane had averaged 3.8 points in 12 minutes per game. He scored 10 points in the Nuggets’ win over Phoenix on Thursday.

“Everybody did a great job to work with me on the team and make me feel part of the family,” Toupane said. “I had no expectation coming here. I just wanted to, every time the coach called my name, just go all out and give everything I had. I’m just happy to be here and just go hard and give everything I have.”

The Nuggets can sign him to another 10-day contract before having to make a decision on whether to keep him for the balance of the season.

He said it. Malone, on Wizards point guard John Wall: “John Wall is a one-man break. He’s a one-man fast break. The guy is ridiculously fast in the open court.”
