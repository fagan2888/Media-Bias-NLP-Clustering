The Palo Alto Medical Foundation is hoping the breathing techniques, flexibility and mindfulness that students take away will be useful in building resilience skills to deal with stress in a healthy way. \u201cOur pediatricians have seen a lot of things \u2014 children who don\u2019t want to go to school or have a lot of anxiety around school,\u201d said Palo Alto Medical Foundation health educator Becky Beacom. \u201cThey recognize the pressure not just in Palo Alto but really the whole region, and have been looking for ways to help young people develop coping and resilience skills above and beyond the clinical ways of approaching it. They really believe it\u2019s a lifestyle effort to really pull that all together and be resilient.\u201d Palo Alto High School senior Alys Olmstead is one of the regular attendees. She pointed to yoga\u2019s ability to reduce stress as being helpful in her day-to-day life as a high school student.\u201cI think yoga is really important because it\u2019s just a good way to escape for a hour, once a week,\u201d Olmstead said. \u201cI use some of the breathing I\u2019ve learned before taking a test or something, and it\u2019s a good way to de-stress.\u201dIn addition to high attendance for the drop-in yoga sessions, Beacom said the Palo Alto Medical Foundation has seen an overall desire from the community for more teen mindfulness resources.\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to know that it\u2019s not just a yoga class that is marketed to teens,\u201d Beacom said. \u201cThe class is actually different than what most people think of as adult yoga. It is developmental in its approach, it looks at what teens like \u2014 they like to be with their peers, so there\u2019s partnering. There\u2019s also reflection. It\u2019s above and beyond an exercise class.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Mindful of the high-pressure nature of area high schools, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation has been providing free drop-in yoga for local teens with hopes of reducing stress and promoting wellness.", "title": "More than exercise, yoga provides calming relief to Palo Alto teens - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TeenYoga.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-15T10:58:24+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/01/05/teen-yoga-palo-alto/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Education", "tag": "yoga", "published_time": "2015-01-05T09:02:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T10:58:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mindful of the high-pressure nature of area high schools, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation has been providing free drop-in yoga for local teens with hopes of reducing stress and promoting wellness.", "title": "More than exercise, yoga provides calming relief to Palo Alto teens - Peninsula Press", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/TeenYoga.jpg", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a70\"", "article_summary": "Mindful of the high-pressure nature of area high schools, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation has been providing free drop-in yoga for local teens with hopes of reducing stress and promoting wellness.\nThey really believe it\u2019s a lifestyle effort to really pull that all together and be resilient.\u201d Palo Alto High School senior Alys Olmstead is one of the regular attendees.\nThe Palo Alto Medical Foundation is hoping the breathing techniques, flexibility and mindfulness that students take away will be useful in building resilience skills to deal with stress in a healthy way.\n\u201cOur pediatricians have seen a lot of things \u2014 children who don\u2019t want to go to school or have a lot of anxiety around school,\u201d said Palo Alto Medical Foundation health educator Becky Beacom.\n\u201cThey recognize the pressure not just in Palo Alto but really the whole region, and have been looking for ways to help young people develop coping and resilience skills above and beyond the clinical ways of approaching it."}
