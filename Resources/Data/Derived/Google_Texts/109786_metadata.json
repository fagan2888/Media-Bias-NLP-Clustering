That's what the Republican leader calls himself, and that is a good name he got for himself. That's what we've had here for five and a half years.\"\n\nAlthough the bill failed for the time being, it is likely to be brought back up because of its broad popularity.\n\n\"We've got to get rid of these procedural issues on every bill,\" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah), the top Republican on the Finance Committee. \"This is a bill that virtually everybody in this body wants, to a more or less degree. Some want it very, very much.\"\n\nThe measure may have to wait until after the House passes similar legislation.\n\nMichael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post.
