So, too, was the news that Wright \u2014 who earned more than $100,000 a year in her illegal trade \u2014 was receiving welfare benefits from the state of Maine.\n\nWright, a single mother at the time, was later found guilty of defrauding the state to the tune of more than $40,000 in welfare benefits, a part of the case that went largely overlooked.\n\nWright\u2019s crimes fetched the high-profile treatment of an international celebrity, but the amount she bilked from Maine\u2019s welfare coffers wasn\u2019t even close to what the state would recover from another fraud case involving Medicaid funds, which was announced 10 months later.\n\nThis time the crook wasn\u2019t a small-town prostitute, but a multinational medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturer.\n\nIn November 2013, Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay the federal government $2.2 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations involving the marketing of off-label, unapproved uses of three prescription drugs.\n\nMaine, according to a report in the Washington Post, would recover $2.8 million from the case, which involved alleged kickbacks to doctors and pharmacies for promoting a trio of drugs \u2014 two anti-psychotics and one heart medication.\n\nThe settlement funds, according to the Office of the Maine Attorney General, would serve as restitution for state Medicaid funds used to pay for the unapproved medications.\n\nAnd while you could hardly avoid the news about Wright, the settlement with Johnson & Johnson blipped under the radar screen of most of Maine\u2019s media.\n\nComparing the two cases, and the attention \u2014 or lack of \u2014 they received helps emphasize and lend context to a letter sent last month to state legislative leaders by Maine Attorney General Janet Mills.\n\nIn her letter, Mills urged lawmakers to be fair.\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of talk this election year about welfare fraud,\u201d Mills wrote. \u201cI hope we put this issue in perspective, that we make sure we apply the rule of law fairly and uniformly, that we go after big fish as well as small, and that we not elevate one over the other.\u201d\n\nOver the past three years, Maine judges have ordered individuals who have defrauded benefit programs to repay $488,303. That\u2019s an annual average of $162,767.\n\nOn the provider side, the state has seen restitution set at $18.7 million over the past four years, an annual average of $4.6 million.\n\nMills said Thursday that welfare-recipient fraud is dominating the political conversation, not only in Maine but across the country.\n\n\u201cBut people aren\u2019t talking about the big welfare fraud, which is provider fraud,\u201d Mills said.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ignore eligibility fraud,\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t ignore recipient fraud; we shouldn\u2019t ignore any allegations that somebody is getting state or federal benefits who isn\u2019t really eligible for them, but the big fish are the corporations, the major pharmaceutical companies and the providers that have been ripping off the state Medicaid program for years to the tune of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nAnd, according to Mills, the restitution orders the state has so far been able to get on the provider side \u201cis only the tip of the iceberg.\u201d\n\nThe message comes on the heels of a recently launched campaign by the administration of Republican Gov. Paul LePage to castigate individuals who have withdrawn cash benefits with state-issued electronic benefit transfer cards at questionable locations around the country.\n\nThe cards, which function as bank debit cards, are loaded with a range of financial benefits from the state, including child support payments, food stamp benefits and cash benefits under the federal Temporary Aid to Needy Families program.\n\nThe EBT campaign is part of LePage\u2019s efforts to ferret out abuse and fraud in Maine\u2019s welfare system.\n\nMills said that effort could be fruitless because the things LePage has been focusing on, the EBT side, may not even be crimes under state and federal law.\n\n\u201cThe statute made it a disqualifier, but it\u2019s not a crime,\u201d Mills said. \u201cIt may be a civil violation, but it\u2019s not a criminal offense. When you steal millions of dollars from the taxpayer through the same program, that\u2019s a crime.\u201d\n\nPeter Steele, LePage\u2019s communications director, said the governor is equally concerned about provider fraud and the focus on EBT card abuse is simply a new initiative.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s looked for this fraud in the past,\u201d Steele said.\n\nHe said LePage has been equally forceful on provider fraud, yet in 2012 his Department of Health and Human Services commissioner, Mary Mayhew, rejected a legislative proposal that would have installed more oversight and better surveillance and auditing of Medicaid payments to health care providers.\n\nState Rep. Peggy Rotundo, D-Lewiston, House chairwoman of the Legislature\u2019s budget-writing Appropriations Committee, said the proposal is again being debated and will be part of the ongoing debate over the state\u2019s supplemental budget.\n\nRotundo said a study by the National Conference of State Legislatures that focused on Medicaid fraud by providers found the problem was huge and that states had varying measures in place to protect against it and to recover misappropriated health care benefits.\n\nThe study also showed that nearly 75 percent of all health care fraud was committed by medical providers.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2012 PEW Center brief on the issue, found that about 7 percent of all federal Medicaid funds \u2014 an estimated $19 billion per year \u2014 is absorbed by improper payments, including \u201cfraud and abuse as well as unintentional mistakes such as paperwork errors.\u201d On the states\u2019 side, the figure is almost 9 percent of Medicaid funds, an estimated $11 billion based on 2010 figures, PEW found.\n\nRotundo said if LePage is serious about catching and prosecuting provider-side fraud, he would support installing new checks on the Medicaid system in Maine that would help root out abuse.\n\n\u201cWe have to be able to find them and establish the controls within DHHS to do that,\u201d Rotundo said. She estimated the annual cost to the state of making the changes would be between $100,000 and $200,000.\n\nShe said the issue has been a perennial recommendation of the state\u2019s auditors. The measure suggests that the state contract with a private company to look each year for fraud within the health care benefits system. She said the state could achieve the same result by installing new software systems and by training an individual to operate them.\n\nShe said placing too much emphasis on the recipients of individual benefits without an equal focus on the provider side is not only unjust, but costly.\n\n\u201cIf the focus is solely on those who are receiving those benefits and not on those who are providing them, then there is not a clear message that fraud is not to be tolerated amongst anyone,\u201d Rotundo said.\n\nOther lawmakers, including several Republicans, agreed with Rotundo.\n\nState Sen. Roger Katz, R-Augusta, assistant minority leader, is the co-author of a bill that would expand eligibility for the state\u2019s Medicaid program under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe bill adds two new investigators to the state\u2019s health care fraud unit. Katz said those investigators are meant to focus on both providers and recipients.\n\n\u201cClearly, the larger dollars we need to be concerned about are from health care providers,\u201d Katz said. \u201cBut there is a principle at stake here, too, and that is that nobody should be ripping off the system.\u201d\n\nRotundo, Katz and other lawmakers said the issue of recipient fraud resonates politically because it\u2019s the kind of thing everyday people believe they are witnessing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much closer to home when someone believes that the person living four doors down is ripping off the system,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to understand and see the faraway corporate behavior.\u201d\n\nThe state has limited dollars, Katz said, \u201cand we want to make sure they are getting to the people who need them and providers are paid fairly, but only what they are entitled to and no more.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 Early last year, the national media turned its gaze to Maine and the tawdry story of a Zumba-instructor-turned-prostitute in the affluent seacoast village of Kennebunkport.
