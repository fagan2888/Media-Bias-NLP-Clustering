FORTALEZA, Brazil (AP) — Germany central defender Mats Hummels was in the starting lineup for the Group G match against Ghana, which started with Germany-based striker Kevin-Prince Boateng and kept midfield star Michael Essien on the bench after he fought to return to fitness from a toe injury.

Boateng’s half-brother Jerome was in the Germany lineup, making it the second time they play against each other at a World Cup.

Coach James Appiah also switched goalkeepers to start with Fatau Dauda, while defender Daniel Opare is out injured.
