(OTCQB: TOMZ) (TOMI), a global bacteria decontamination and infection prevention company, announced the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has registered TOMI\u2019s patented Binary Ionization Technology (BIT\u2122) as a two-stage rapid disinfection system for use as a healthcare-hospital disinfectant (EPA registration no. 90150-2). TOMI\u2019s SteraMist\u2122 brand of products is powered by BIT and addresses numerous applications in hospitals and healthcare facilities.\n\nDr. Halden Shane, TOMI\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, stated: \u201cThis EPA registration is an important achievement for TOMI. As I have always been encouraged by our testing results, passing the difficult EPA protocols for a hospital-healthcare disinfectant and the registration by the EPA just verifies the power of TOMI\u2019s BIT technology and disinfection solution. This will now enable us to start filling our backlog of U.S. hospital orders. In addition, we are excited to pursue continued sales in the biosafety and clean lab applications, which present significant market opportunities for the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cAwareness of TOMI\u2019s products, both domestically and internationally, has increased tremendously as we have been recognized by numerous government agencies for our innovative solutions to many of the world\u2019s most significant disinfection/decontamination needs. TOMI was recently awarded a grant from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in conjunction with the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Office of the President for the development of a portable decontamination to be used in the fight against Ebola. SteraMist\u2122 is quickly establishing a reputation among decision-makers in a variety of applicable markets for its advantages in speed and efficacy over competing household and industrial cleaners. Our near-term outlook is quite positive as we focus on bringing our leading, cutting-edge technology to market in rapid fashion. I am proud of our entire team at TOMI who have demonstrated true dedication and determination in achieving this important milestone.\u201d\n\nSteraMist\u2122 incorporates TOMI\u2019s cost-effective patented platform BIT\u2122 technology, which utilizes a proprietary low concentration hydrogen peroxide as its active ingredient and passes the solution through an atmospheric cold plasma arc, which produces a highly reactive oxygen species. This species kills and inactivates bacteria, viruses and mold spores by lysis of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids leaving the hospital room free of the pathogens that are typically found in hospitals and healthcare environments.\n\nTOMI\u2019s SteraMist\u2122 Surface Unit has a five-second application time for room surfaces and a seven-minute contact time, the fastest of all mechanical cleaning healthcare agents. The mist produced by BIT dries rapidly on contact, does not contain or produce chlorine hypochlorite (bleach), aldehydes, phenols, ammonium compounds, sodium hydroxide, or contain silver. These toxins and harsh chemicals can be found in many other disinfecting solutions.\n\nDuring a terminal clean, TOMI\u2019s SteraMist\u2122 reaches in and around every surface in an enclosed area. There is no need to mix the solution, nor is there any need for rinsing or wiping as it dries quickly. Since its only by-products are oxygen and humidity, it can be used on all electronics. In addition, it is compatible with a wide variety of materials, it is non-corrosive and it leaves the environment with just oxygen and humidity. With TOMI\u2019s EPA approved five-second application and a seven-minute contact time, SteraMist\u2122 affords hospital staff significant time savings as the need to remove equipment is eliminated, enabling staff to bring the next patient into a completely disinfected room where you can \u201csmell the clean.\u201d\n\nSteraMist\u2122 is easy-to-use, highly effective, economical, and the quickest alternative to \u201cspray & wipe\u201d, ultra-violet (UV) light, and other fogging and misting applications. A key differentiator is that TOMI\u2019s products do not introduce caustic high percentages of hydrogen peroxide or leave residues of silver and/ or silver ions that permanently remain in the environment.\n\nIn practical use, the SteraMist\u2122 BIT disinfection system has demonstrated efficacy against a broad spectrum of pathogens. Previous pilot studies covering over 24 hospitals all demonstrated high rates of reduction of healthcare-related infections. After deploying SteraMist\u2122 in dozens of hospitals, both domestically and internationally, the results suggest the system offers a simple, quick and inexpensive way to reduce penalties associated with the Affordable Care Act and Medicare\u2019s non-payment policy.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nTOMI will hold a conference call Tuesday, June 30th at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to review the company\u2019s recent business highlights and answer questions.
