Lawyers for Weinstein did not immediately respond to requests comment.\n\nNagel said the Morristown, New Jersey jury needed less than 1-1/2 hours to reach its verdict, after a month-long trial. His firm Nagel Rice is based in Roseland, New Jersey.\n\nNacchio, 66, spent roughly five years in prison after being convicted in 2007 of insider trading.\n\nHe was also ordered to pay more than $63 million in fines and forfeiture, court records show. Nagel said Nacchio paid this sum.\n\nQwest was a U.S. regional phone company based in Denver before it merged in April 2011 with CenturyLink Inc.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Bernard Orr)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Joseph Nacchio, the former Qwest Communications International chief execut", "title": "Ex-Qwest CEO Nacchio wins $14 million verdict vs Goldman unit: lawyer", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/07/Ex-Qwest-CEO-Nacchio-wins-14-million-verdict-vs-Goldman-unit-law-firm-says", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/07/Ex-Qwest-CEO-Nacchio-wins-14-million-verdict-vs-Goldman-unit-law-firm-says", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Joseph Nacchio, the former Qwest Communications International chief execut", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Nacchio, 66, spent roughly five years in prison after being convicted in 2007 of insider trading.\n(Reuters) - Joseph Nacchio, the former Qwest Communications International chief executive, on Thursday won a $14.2 million jury verdict against a Goldman Sachs Group Inc unit and financial adviser over the sale of life insurance policies, his law firm said.\nNagel said the Morristown, New Jersey jury needed less than 1-1/2 hours to reach its verdict, after a month-long trial.\nHe was also ordered to pay more than $63 million in fines and forfeiture, court records show.\nNagel said Nacchio paid this sum."}
