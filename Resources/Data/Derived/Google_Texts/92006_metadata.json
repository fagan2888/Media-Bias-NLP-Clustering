It also says those drops were directly caused by Uber\u2019s entry into the local taxi market...\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s individual damages are less than $75,000 each, the suit says, and the damages sought in a class-action case would be less than $5 million.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Uber has been operating in St. Louis while being sued by the city's Taxicab Commission (and Uber is also suing back), but while locals continue to enjoy", "title": "Cabbies Sue Uber in St. Louis Over Lost Business", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/11/17/cabbies-sue-uber-in-st-louis-over-lost-b", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14478004068299.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14478004068299.jpg", "description": "Uber has been operating in St. Louis while being sued by the city's Taxicab Commission (and Uber is also suing back), but while locals continue to enjoy the ride-hailing app service, aggrieved taxi operators have", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cabbies Sue Uber in St. Louis Over Lost Business"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2015-11-17T23:14:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/brian-doherty"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "The latest suit, which was filed Friday, alleges that Uber\u2019s service and its drivers are \u201cfunctionally and legally indistinguishable\u201d from taxi services and taxi drivers in St. Louis and St. Louis County.\nThe plaintiffs in the suit filed in St. Louis County Circuit Court are Aaron Vilcek and Jeffrey Hamilton, drivers for St. Louis County Cab; Robert Glynn, who drives for Laclede Cab; and Douglas Uchendi, an ABC Cab driver...\n\u201cThe purpose of the suit is to recognize that Uber is operating illegally and as a result of that, the existing taxi drivers are being harmed,\u201d said Gary Growe, the Clayton attorney representing the taxi drivers.\nHe said if class-action status is granted, the suit could cover the roughly 1,100 cabdrivers licensed by the taxi commission.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s individual damages are less than $75,000 each, the suit says, and the damages sought in a class-action case would be less than $5 million."}
