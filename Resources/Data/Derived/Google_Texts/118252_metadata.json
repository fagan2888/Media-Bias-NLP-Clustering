I\u2019m concerned about my active, headstrong 4-year-old grandson. He is cute as a button but he has had behavioral issues since he was 18 months old despite getting timeouts and limits. His speech is delayed; his fine motor skills are poor; his impulse control is shaky; he can be rough with smaller children and he often ignores people when he\u2019s playing with a toy. And since he wants to know how his trucks and trains work \u2014 and his parents want to keep him busy \u2014 he has many, many toys.\n\nMy daughter \u2014 an at-home mom \u2014 is worn out and worried, especially about autism. Family and friends give her their opinions; his teachers ask for an evaluation and his doctor says he may need medication. This freaks me out, because I don\u2019t think a growing brain should get Ritalin.\n\nAlso he has touched my breasts several times and those of a 12-year-old family friend. This mortified my daughter because he knows that breasts are for breastfeeding and that he must keep his hands to himself.\n\nMy grandson \u2014 a tall, strong boy \u2014 has many positive qualities however. He dresses himself, goes to the toilet alone, sleeps at least nine hours a night, eats many foods (and a little chocolate) but he doesn\u2019t drink sodas and he hasn\u2019t had any allergies or unusual illnesses.\n\nHe likes to have fun too. He plays outdoors, reads books; goes to pre-K; knows his letters, numbers and colors; counts to 99 and enjoys the family\u2019s two goofy, sweet (and ill-trained) dogs. He never mentions having any friends, however, although he plays with the 6-year-old girl next door.\n\nMy grandson did, however, have some big changes this year. Although he quickly adjusted to his new house and to the long hours required by his dad\u2019s new job, he\u2019s been scared of loud noises ever since a smoke alarm went off one night.\n\nThe biggest change was the arrival of his baby sister seven weeks ago. We give him extra attention but he wants more whenever she is being breastfed or even held. Should the parents medicate my grandson? Should they get a private evaluation? Please point us in the right direction.\n\nA. You\u2019ve saved the best for last, haven\u2019t you?\n\nYour grandson does have some problems but his little sister is his biggest one. A new baby always shakes up an old baby, especially if he has behavioral issues. And why not? She gets presents, she gets picked up when she cries and she enchants everyone he loves. This boy must feel as unloved, unwanted and unnecessary as an old shoe.\n\nYour grandson will feel better about himself \u2014 and keep his hands away from your breasts \u2014 if your daughter asks him for help before he asks for her attention and if she tells him that he is the best present his little sister could get. He rocks her cradle better than anyone, fetches her diaper faster and he can even teach her to talk. The more people talk to her in the first three years, the bigger her vocabulary will be and the higher her I.Q. And the more time he spends with her, the more she will adore him.\n\nAll he has to do is sit next to her, face to face, and say the same word over and over without taking his eyes away from hers. Once she sees how his lips and tongue work she\u2019ll try to move her lips and tongue the same way and she\u2019ll soon try to make the same sound. A baby can\u2019t wait to talk.\n\nHis parents will still have to work on their son\u2019s behavioral problems. Medication may suppress them but look at his diet first. The wrong foods probably cause more trouble in children than anything else.\n\nBecause his behavior fell apart when he started eating regular foods \u2014 and because 62 percent of regular foods are processed \u2014 you need to cut out all additives, preservatives, oranges, tomatoes and other salicylates for five or six days to see if he acts better. If not, look at his dairy intake. Lactase dissipates in most children around the time they\u2019re weaned and then they may not be able to digest the lactose in dairy products. To check this out, his mother should switch him to lactaid milk and have him skip ice cream and cheese for a month. If he still acts up, let him go gluten-free for as long as two months, to find out whether his gut can process the gluten that\u2019s in bread, barley and rye. If not, he may feel \u2014 and act \u2014 miserably.\n\nAnd if he still misbehaves after these home evaluations? Have him examined by an experienced ADHD tester and do what he says.\n\nQuestions?
