(Jit Lim/iStockphoto)\n\nThe new health-care law has improved a lot of things about health insurance: You can\u2019t be turned down or charged extra if you have a preexisting condition, all types of basic health services are covered, plans can\u2019t cap annual or lifetime benefits, and most preventive care is free. But your insurance can still be complicated, and if you don\u2019t follow the rules, you can run into gotchas that can cost you an arm and a leg. (Speaking of rules, open enrollment under the Affordable Care Act is due to end March 31; it is scheduled to resume Nov. 15.)\n\nOrly Avitzur, medical adviser to Consumer Reports, lists five questions you need to answer before you see a doctor.\n\n\u25cf Is he or she in my plan\u2019s network? That seemingly simple question is anything but. Many practices participate in more than a dozen insurance plans. The list on the health plan\u2019s Web site might not be up-to-date, so it\u2019s best to double-check with the doctor\u2019s billing office, using the exact name of your plan.\n\nOrly Avitzur, medical adviser to Consumer Reports, lists five questions you need to answer before you see a doctor.\n\n\u25cf What are the limitations and exclusions? All plans must cover \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d such as physicians, hospitals, drugs, maternity care, mental health care, tests, emergency care and rehabilitation, but specifics might vary. You\u2019ll find those details in the standardized \u201cSummary of Benefits and Coverage\u201d form that all plans must supply. Look to see if any services have limitations (such as a ceiling on physical therapy visits) or aren\u2019t covered at all (such as acupuncture, dentures or hearing aids).\n\n\u25cf Do I need a referral or prior authorization? With many HMOs, you need to get approval from your primary-care physician to see other doctors or obtain certain tests or procedures. If you don\u2019t, the plan won\u2019t pay. Don\u2019t wait until the last minute, because offices are inundated with requests.\n\n\u25cf Will this test be covered? A common reason for a claim denial is that an insurance company deems a service \u201cnot medically necessary.\u201d You can save yourself an unwanted bill by checking ahead of time with the insurance company and your doctor\u2019s billing office. Keep detailed notes on whom you spoke with and what they told you.\n\n\u25cf How will my medication be covered? Every health plan has its own formulary, or list of preferred drugs, typically organized into as many as four tiers in ascending order of price. Tier 1 usually includes generic medication. You\u2019ll probably be required to pay more for a prescription when a higher-tier, brand-name product is dispensed. When starting a new drug, check your plan\u2019s formulary to see what tier it\u2019s in. If it\u2019s expensive, ask your doctor or pharmacist if a similar drug in a lower tier would work as well.\n\nFour payment terms you need to know\n\nYou\u2019ll pay your share of health-care costs in the following ways:\n\n\u25cf Out-of-pocket limit. This is the most you\u2019ll have to spend from your own pocket for medical care in the policy year. Once you hit that limit, your health plan will pick up 100 percent of any additional costs until year\u2019s end. The maximum allowable \u201cOOP\u201d for 2014 is $6,350 for an individual and $12,700 for a household.\n\n\u25cf Deductible. This is the amount you must pay for covered services each year before your insurance kicks in. Details may vary: One plan might have a single deductible for everything, while another might have a separate one for prescription drugs. With some plans, not all services are subject to the deductible.\n\n\u25cf Co-payment. This is a flat amount (for example, $20) that you pay for a covered health-care service.\n\n\u25cf Coinsurance. This is your share of the cost of a covered service. With 20 percent coinsurance, for instance, if a CT scan costs $1,000 and you\u2019ve met your deductible, your share of the cost will be $200.\n\nCopyright 2014.
