This money cannot be used to pay for underlying Medicaid services that are provided outside the health home model.\n\nAfter two years, the federal government will no longer provide an increased Federal Medical Assistance Percentage rate for the health homes program.\n\nRains said the mental health agency hopes to pay for the health home model, in part, through savings in improved health outcomes.\n\nThe agency anticipates it will save about $3.4 million the first two years of the program, because health homes will cut down on duplicate services, he said.\n\n\u201cIt will continue to be a budget request that we submit to the Legislature to fund the program,\u201d Rains said.\n\nWho qualifies\n\nRains said the mental health agency had identified about 30,000 adults and children in the Medicaid program who would qualify for the health home services.\n\nThe program is not part of Medicaid expansion, a key element of the Affordable Care Act. Oklahoma is among about 20 states that are not expanding their Medicaid programs to include, for example, unmarried low-income adults without disabilities or children.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving anyone any more eligibility than they already have,\u201d Rains said.\n\nRains said integrating care is the new way of providing comprehensive health care.\n\n\u201cAdults with serious mental illness are dying 25 years younger than the general population,\u201d Rains said. \u201cAdults with substance abuse on top of that are dying around ages 43 to 45, so it\u2019s even sooner, and a lot of that is not from suicide or accidental deaths that you\u2019d normally think of as being included with the population. It\u2019s for medical problems \u2014 poor diet, tobacco use, things that need to be addressed on the medical side.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oklahoma adults with serious mental illness are dying 25 years younger than the general population.
