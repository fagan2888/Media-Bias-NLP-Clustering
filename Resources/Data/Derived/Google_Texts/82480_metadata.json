It didn\u2019t matter that they were without the services of star power forward Kenneth Faried, whose sore back forced him to sit for a second straight game. The Nuggets were doing their thing, racing out to a lead as large as 22 points in a tough environment against the red-hot Charlotte Hornets.\n\nEven when Charlotte was in the midst of its charge and got back within striking distance, the Nuggets kept their composure, making all the necessary key plays down the stretch. It all added up to a 101-93 victory over the Hornets at Time Warner Cable Arena that snapped Denver\u2019s three-game losing streak.\n\n\u201cPoise,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cYou know a team is going to make a run, especially at home. The crowd gets into it, and how do you handle that? Do you get rattled and shook and come apart? Or do you have the poise to handle the adversity that you are facing?\n\n\u201cAnd I think it helps having a veteran like D.J. (Augustin) out there with three babies.\u201d\n\nAugustin, perhaps a bit fired up playing against the organization that drafted him ninth overall in 2008, led the Nuggets (29-41) with 24 points. He scored 11 straight points during one critical stretch in the fourth quarter after the Hornets had drawn within 79-70, but insisted he didn\u2019t gain any extra satisfaction spurring the Nuggets to a win over his former team.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done this on other teams, too,\u201d said Augustin, who recorded his third game of 20 or more points since joining the Nuggets last month. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not just Charlotte. I can play, man. It don\u2019t matter where I\u2019m at. As long as I get an opportunity. And it\u2019s like that with other guys. The NBA is all about opportunity\n\n\u201cYou go to the right situation and you get an opportunity to play and you can play well.\u201d\n\nForward Darrell Arthur and guard Gary Harris added 13 points apiece for the Nuggets, and center Nikola Jokic had 11 points, 14 rebounds and four assists before fouling out with 5:18 remaining.\n\nJeremy Lin paced the Hornets (30-30), who had won nine of their previous 10 games, with 16 points. Kemba Walker was held in check for the most part, hitting 6-of-18 shots and finishing with 15 points, seven rebounds and five assists.\n\nThe Nuggets led for the final 40:42, thanks mostly to outrebounding Charlotte 51-38, outscoring the Hornets\u2019 bench 46-32, and shooting 50 percent from 3-point range, compared with Charlotte\u2019s 28.1 percent beyond the arc. Those numbers injected the Nuggets with some confidence heading into the finale of their five-game road trip Monday in Cleveland.\n\n\u201cThis one was definitely a big win for us,\u201d Emmanuel Mudiay said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "D.J.
