Like most football players will tell you, it's not all that rare to hear "you suck!" from fans during a losing season. But three 10-year-old girls in Cleveland, Ohio have taken voicing their displeasure of the hapless hometown team one step higher, as reported by the right-of-center news portal The Daily Caller on Jan.3, 2014.

Pointing out the obvious on more than one level, Caroline Comisford left little to the imagination when she plainly stated "We suck bad. Like ObamaCare bad."

Effectively using just about every cute-kid-talking-about-a-grown-up-subject trick in the book, Comisford and her friends Caitlyn Daube and Lulu Yearling never mentioned Browns owner Jimmy Haslam by name, yet verbally body slammed him in a fashion that would have made Raider alum Jack "The Assasin" Tatum and George "Hitman" Atkinson beam with pride.

The toothsome trio cranked up the Adorable-O-Meter all the way to 11 in their effort to convince the Browns front office to hire former Ohio State coach Jim Tressel after club ownership recently pink slipped first-year head coach Rob Chudzinski.

Reportedly, the powers-to-be are looking at various university head coaches to sign on for the 2014 season.

The soft Brownies went a sad 4-12 this past regular season, losing the last seven scheduled games straight, coming in dead last in the AFC Northern Division.
