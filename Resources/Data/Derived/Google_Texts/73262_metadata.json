We're expected to do more and find new ways to be better.\"\n\nCurrently, in addition to budgeting tools, UC Davis relies on five-year forecasting to look further down the road in order to anticipate and deal with the risk of uncertainty.\n\nChange \u2013 including tough budget decisions \u2013 can be effective if done at a manageable pace and with some advance planning rather than in crisis mode, he said.\n\nUnfortunately, healthcare reform created a lot of uncertainty, which hasn\u2019t allowed CFOs to do much advanced planning or make decisions about updating their budgeting formats, Maurice noted.\n\n\"It's not clear where the puck's moving, so it's hard to know where to skate,\u201d he said. Restructuring the insurance marketplace for instance, has consequences, some of which are known and understood, others that aren\u2019t.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act creates a vision, but implementation decisions may not be what we expected,\" he noted.\n\nRegardless, he said, \u201cWe have to be prepared.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/reform-creating-budgeting-changes", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "In light of the cadre of reform measures reverberating through the healthcare industry, hospitals are responding to the pressure by changing up their budgeting formats.", "title": "Reform creating budgeting changes"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "In light of the cadre of reform measures reverberating through the healthcare industry, hospitals are responding to the pressure by changing up their budgeting formats.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Reform creating budgeting changes"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In light of the cadre of reform measures reverberating through the healthcare industry, hospitals are responding to the pressure by changing up their budgeting formats.&#13; Five or 10 years ago, hospitals largely operated their budgets through their general ledger, which, essentially, served as a vehicle for understanding their cost of running a department, said Jay Spence, vice president of product and solutions strategy for Axiom EPM, a Portland-based performance management software firm.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bc6\"", "article_summary": "In light of the cadre of reform measures reverberating through the healthcare industry, hospitals are responding to the pressure by changing up their budgeting formats.\nSan Francisco-based Dignity Health, for example, will \"almost certainly\" implement a form of budgeting based on managing patient populations, said Dan Albaugh, the health system\u2019s senior director of financial planning and analysis.\nUnfortunately, healthcare reform created a lot of uncertainty, which hasn\u2019t allowed CFOs to do much advanced planning or make decisions about updating their budgeting formats, Maurice noted.\nHealthcare reform\u2019s push to focus on value versus volume is having a large impact on budgeting, Albaugh said.\n\"It's a mindset that the industry needs to figure out fairly quickly,\" he said, however, CFOs are still evaluating how to respond to the changes brought on by healthcare reform."}
