And when those happen, we tend to get the most snow.\"\n\nChevalier comes to Eldora from two years as director of snow sports at Summit at Snoqualmie, in Washington, and previously was at Copper Mountain for seven years as director of skier services.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Boulder is the best-kept-secret ski town in the U.S.A.,\" Chevalier said. \"People don't view it as a ski town, but it is, for part of the year. It is one of the key hubs for snow sports, with a lot of (snow-sports-related) companies based there. Eldora is just a real treat in terms of being a ski area right on the doorstep of the ski town, Boulder.\"\n\nChevalier is not the only fresh blood at Eldora, being joined there by Paul Fillion, new director of mountain operations who comes from a long career at Vail Mountain, where he was most recently director of mountain operations.\n\nEllie Orszulaka puts away some rental skis at Eldora on Friday in preparation for opening day. (Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera)\n\nExpansion decision looms\n\nAs the new season approaches, Eldora officials, along with many resort users, environmentalists and people who live nearby, are anxiously awaiting release of the finalized environmental impact statement by the U.S. Forest Service on the ski area's proposed expansion.\n\nA draft of that document was released in February, drawing strong opinions on many fronts, including the Boulder County commissioners. They voiced concerns on what they saw as insufficient consideration of upgrades without expanding Eldora's boundaries, on the potential impact on the town of Eldora, and on bordering Middle Boulder and Jenny creeks.\n\nHighlights of the proposed expansion include 15 new ski trails and two new chairlifts \u2014 one on the front side and another on the back side. Additionally, the resort proposes construction of a new lodge atop the Challenge Mountain, expansion of The Lookout facility and the addition of 560 parking spaces.\n\nThe Forest Service's finalized environmental impact statement, and a draft decision on the planned expansion itself, will be coming soon.\n\n\"It is estimated that they are pushing it back until following Christmas or early January,\" said Boulder Ranger District spokeswoman Marcia Gilles.\n\nEldora Planning Director Jim Spenst said a positive outcome for Eldora's plans at the hands of the Forest Service is \"absolutely critical\" to the resort's long-term success.\n\nChevalier said such approvals \"never come through quickly.\"\n\n\"We're patient,\" he said. \"Our plans are to progress, whether with or without.\n\n\"We'll make anything succeed. It's just that we would be better off, in my mind, if we were able to move standards forward, with what I consider community interests and commercial interests.\"\n\nAlpine/Nordic split\n\nChevalier acknowledged that Eldora took a few public relations hits in the past year. Controversy arose when continued tenure at the resort was briefly threatened for Ignite Adaptive Sports, an independent nonprofit providing instruction in alpine and cross-country skiing, snowboarding and snowshoeing to people with cognitive and physical disabilities.\n\nSome longtime patrons were also upset when the resort announced it was separating the alpine and Nordic areas in its passes, which had previously included both options.\n\nBut the adaptive ski program was preserved, and it returns this year.\n\nThe alpine/Nordic split also remains.\n\n\"We'd like both businesses to succeed,\" Chevalier said, \"and we want them both to stand on their own merits ... .\"\n\nNo other resort in the region offers combined alpine and Nordic passes, he said.\n\nThe resort is happy to have added two new Kassbohrer PistenBully snow groomers to its fleet.\n\nSome customers might not be happy that Eldora has also added to the cost of its season passes.\n\nIts Adult Super Value Pass, for example, is now $299, up from $269. Children's passes are $229, up from $209. The Adult Full Pass is priced at $449, an increase from $399.\n\nChevalier defended the price hike, pointing out that the passes would still represent the smallest area of expense for most skiers, costing less than the clothes they'll be wearing, the equipment they'll be using and the mileage they'd put on their cars in driving back and forth from most other resorts. \"Drive less, ski more\" is a favored slogan at the resort.\n\n\"It's an investment in the sport that you love,\" he said.\n\nCharlie Brennan: 303-473-1327, brennanc@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/chasbrennan", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26941785/boulder-countys-eldora-primed-new-season", "sailthru.author": "By Charlie Brennan \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26941785:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-16T08:02:04-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Boulder County skiers and boarders can now count on one hand the number of days until their closest option for downhill delight is open for business.", "title": "Boulder County's Eldora primed for new season", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26941785/boulder-countys-eldora-primed-new-season", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1114/20141114__17dcaeldw~2.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder County News", "modificationDate": "2014-11-14T19:59:43-0700", "endDate": "2024-11-16T08:02:04-0700", "news_keywords": "Boulder County,Colorado,news,events,weather,breaking news,lifestyles,things to do,", "byline": "By Charlie BrennanCamera", "pubDate": "2014-11-14T19:58:29-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-16T08:02:04-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder County's Eldora primed for new season", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1114/20141114__17dcaeldw~2_300.jpg", "description": "Boulder County skiers and boarders can now count on one hand the number of days until their closest option for downhill delight is open for business.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_26941785/boulder-countys-eldora-primed-new-season", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder County skiers and boarders can now count on one hand the number of days until their closest option for downhill delight is open for business.", "title": "Boulder County's Eldora primed for new season"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1114/20141114__17dcaeldw~2.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c83\"", "article_summary": "Eldora is just a real treat in terms of being a ski area right on the doorstep of the ski town, Boulder.\"\nSome customers might not be happy that Eldora has also added to the cost of its season passes.\n\"People don't view it as a ski town, but it is, for part of the year.\n\"Eldora is all about the snow,\" Chevalier said.\nAdvertisement\"Boulder is the best-kept-secret ski town in the U.S.A.,\" Chevalier said."}
