Yoga has been shown to help reduce stress and depression, fight against PTSD, and boost your mood overall.\n\nBut not enough research has been done to figure out whether or not it has a positive impact on specific mental disorders, like bipolar disorder. In a new study, published in the Journal of Psychiatric Practice and led by Lisa Uebelacker at Brown University, researchers attempted to better understand how yoga might treat \u2014 or worsen \u2014 bipolar disorder.\n\n\u201cThere is no scientific literature on hatha yoga for bipolar disorder,\u201d Uebelacker, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and human behavior in the Alpert Medical School at Brown University, said in the press release. \u201cThere is reason to think that there are ways in which it might be wonderful and ways in which it might not be safe. We are interested in studying hatha yoga for bipolar as an adjunctive treatment to pharmacotherapy.\u201d\n\nIn the study, some 70 people answered an online survey that questioned how yoga benefited mental health. Many said that the benefits were \u201clife changing\u201d and one person in particular even noted that \u201cYoga has saved my life.\u201d In general, most of the respondents said that yoga helped lessen anxiety.\n\nBut some believed otherwise, noting that there were some negative effects as well. Some people with bipolar disorder noted that they had experienced agitation from rapid breathing; one person found themselves even more depressed afterwards because \u201cI fell into a relaxed state \u2026 near catatonic as my mind was depressed already. I was in bed for three days afterward.\u201d And as in every form of exercise, there\u2019s a risk for physical injury or pain \u2014 as well as self-criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that you want to avoid any extreme practice, such as extended periods of rapid breathing,\u201d Uebelacker said in the press release.\n\nBut this single study probably isn\u2019t enough to come to any clear conclusions on the matter. Uebelacker plans on continuing to examine the effect of yoga on bipolar disorder. Past research has linked yoga \u2014 and exercise in general \u2014 with improvements in mental health and overall well-being. So it might not be a surprise if Uebelacker finds that yoga can help bipolar disorder, too.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the scientific study of yoga demonstrates that mental and physical health are not just closely allied, but are essentially equivalent,\u201d Harvard Health Publications writes in an overview of yoga research. \u201cThe evidence is growing that yoga practice is a relatively low-risk, high-yield approach to improving overall health.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bipolar disorder, yoga, exercise mental health benefits", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Yoga might be helpful in boosting your mood, mental health, and overall physical health, but researchers are trying to figure out if it can have a positive impact on bipolar disorder.", "title": "Could Yoga Treat Bipolar Disorder, Too?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/practicing-yoga-treat-bipolar-disorder-comes-risks-and-benefits-303644", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/17/exercise.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yoga might be helpful in boosting your mood, mental health, and overall physical health, but researchers are trying to figure out if it can have a positive impact on bipolar disorder.", "title": "Could Yoga Treat Bipolar Disorder, Too?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/practicing-yoga-treat-bipolar-disorder-comes-risks-and-benefits-303644", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/17/exercise.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/17/exercise.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-17T16:02:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-17T16:02:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Yoga might be helpful in boosting your mood, mental health, and overall physical health, but researchers are trying to figure out if it can have a positive impact on bipolar disorder."}, "article_summary": "So it might not be a surprise if Uebelacker finds that yoga can help bipolar disorder, too.\nUebelacker plans on continuing to examine the effect of yoga on bipolar disorder.\n\u201cThe evidence is growing that yoga practice is a relatively low-risk, high-yield approach to improving overall health.\u201d\nYoga has been shown to improve mood, mental health, and physical strength \u2014 but researchers still want to find out if it has a positive impact on people with bipolar disorder.\nBut not enough research has been done to figure out whether or not it has a positive impact on specific mental disorders, like bipolar disorder."}
