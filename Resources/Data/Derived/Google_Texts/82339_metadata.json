Marlin Stutzman and Todd Young, two Republicans running for the U.S. Senate, rarely crossed party lines since first being elected to Congress in 2010. Here are a few times when one or the other sided with Democrats. (Dwight Adams/IndyStar) Wochit\n\nThe race for the Republican Senate nomination has been overshadowed by the spectacle that is the presidential primary. So it\u2019s been easy to miss just how nasty this GOP battle has been.\n\nA new commercial from Rep. Marlin Stutzman accuses his opponent in the Republican Senate primary, Rep. Todd Young, of being a factory-made \u201csellout.\u201d The two have waged increasingly negative campaigns against each other.\n\nFor a race that\u2019s not getting much attention, and one between two guys who agree on so much, it sure has been a bruiser.\n\nTodd Young and Marlin Stutzman, a pair of third-term congressmen, have been battling hard for the Republican Senate nomination for months. It\u2019s been a largely under-the-radar battle, though, one that for some reason seems not to have struck a chord with Hoosiers.\n\nWell, at least with those Hoosiers who do not live and die politics.\n\nNow, with the May 3 primary just two weeks away, an already hard-hitting race is getting rougher. Nasty, even. A pair of conservative Republicans who are darlings of the National Rifle Association and the anti-abortion movement, who almost always vote with their party, and who share a mutual contempt for Obamacare and most other things Obama, have been bashing each other in increasingly personal ways in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cTodd Young does as he is told,\u201d a new Stutzman commercial declares, portraying his opponent as a \u201csellout politician\u201d and a factory-made product of the D.C. establishment. On Facebook, Stutzman called Young \u201can establishment puppet seeking to undermine the voice of conservatives.\u201d\n\nYoung, meanwhile, has labeled Stutzman \u201ca career politician\u201d who relies on \u201cObama-style dirty tactics.\u201d He has even created a side-campaign called \u201cMe First Marlin,\u201d which tosses out frequent attack lines and grainy videos and mocks Stutzman as an untrustworthy demagogue who has \u201cmade a career of putting himself first.\u201d\n\nWe all knew the general election campaign between Democrat Baron Hill and the eventual Republican nominee would be rough. What\u2019s been surprising is just how negative the GOP\u2019s family affair has been. Essentially, the primary has centered on two things: Each candidates\u2019 talking points about how completely conservative they are, and attempts by both to burn down the reputation of the other guy.\n\n\u201cIt is a rough race,\u201d agreed state Sen. Jim Merritt, an Indianapolis Republican. \u201cEspecially considering Ronald Reagan\u2019s 11th Amendment about not criticizing other Republicans. That\u2019s been pitched overboard.\u201d\n\nPitched overboard, and buried somewhere deep in the Wabash River.\n\nMerritt, a Young supporter, seemed to accurately identify the cause of the intraparty name-calling. He pointed to widespread uncertainty about the state of the race because of a dearth of polling and a lack of engagement among many voters. Then there is perhaps the biggest X factor of all: How the raucous presidential primary will impact this race.\n\n\u201cThere are so many unknowns right now,\u201d Merritt said. \u201cI don\u2019t think either one of them (Young or Stutzman) wants to stand there on election night regretting that they didn\u2019t use everything they had, so they are throwing everything out there.\u201d\n\nEverything has included Young criticizing Stutzman for moving into a pricey house in the D.C. area, and Stutzman shooting back at Young for attending a Florida fundraiser with those dreaded big-money establishment types. The two have attacked each other's character, integrity, conservatism and honesty. And, of course, there was Stutzman\u2019s support for a Democratic legal challenge to Young\u2019s candidacy. More than anything else, that erased any chance that this primary wouldn\u2019t get intensely personal.\n\nThe race has been free of much that might inspire a voter. It\u2019s been ridiculous, actually, to watch two solidly conservative House members have their conservative credentials questioned. It\u2019s been comically painful to watch the two try to tie the other to President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI would use the word sad,\u201d said Monica Boyer, a prominent conservative activist in Kosciusko County who is volunteering for Stutzman\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see how dirty it can get, and I think a lot of people have checked out because of that.\u201d\n\nYou can\u2019t blame them.\n\nThe bummer is that the race actually offers a compelling storyline, and a clearly defined and critical choice for Republican primary voters. It could have provided a stage for a meaningful debate about the future direction of the Republican Party. Because while both candidates have solid conservative records and views, their methods could hardly be more different.\n\nStutzman, a former state lawmaker from Northern Indiana, has battled repeatedly with Republican leaders during his time in the House, accusing them of not playing the kind of \u201cshut-it-down\u201d hardball he believes would bring conservatives more victories. He was among a small group that recently opposed the House Republican budget, for instance, saying it did not go far enough in support of conservative principles.\n\nYoung, who spent a decade in the Marines before entering politics, has moved up in the House by being less of a bomb-thrower and more of a coalition-builder who argues that moving legislation forward requires accepting political realities. He has won praise for his ability to work within the system, pushing forward legislation, for example, to bring more congressional oversight to federal regulations.\n\nYoung has won big endorsements from business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and many top GOP leaders. Stutzman has received support from tea party organizations and other like-minded groups. You might say it\u2019s a battle between the Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz wings of the Republican Party.\n\nIndiana\u2019s GOP voters have an important choice on May 3. Do they want a nominee who insists the key to success is dedication to an all-or-nothing strategy? Or do they want one who has been willing to accept the notion that pragmatism is sometimes necessary in politics?\n\nThat could have been the basis of a great debate between two skilled politicians. It\u2019s too bad Young and Stutzman have chosen a much easier and sillier campaign path.\n\nThank you for reading.
