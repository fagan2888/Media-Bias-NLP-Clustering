At a certain point, it can feel more like a scathing pantomime of democracy than the contemporary manifestation of the real thing.\n\nSo when I saw President Obama being criticized by some pundits recently for saying his policies were on the ballot this November even if he was not \u2014 and consequently thwarting red state Democrats\u2019 attempts to distance themselves from him \u2014 I was at first inclined to dismiss it as more savviness for its own sake. If there was something interesting about the moment at all, I thought, it was that the usually on-message Obama made such a petty and silly mistake. Now I\u2019m having second thoughts.\n\nThe primary reason why is a recent succession of more substantial rhetorical faux pas from three Republican candidates \u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell, Gov. John Kasich and Gov. Paul LePage \u2014 which have me reconsidering whether the president\u2019s comment was truly a mistake. Whether he meant to or not, by placing himself back on center stage, Obama challenged the savvy position, which holds that Dems are wise to avoid defending his achievements (Obamacare chief among them) and to focus instead on slamming congressional Republicans. After what I\u2019ve heard from McConnell, Kasich and LePage? I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nSince Salon\u2019s already covered the feeble attempts by McConnell and Kasich to argue the popular parts of Obamacare don\u2019t count, I\u2019ll focus on LePage\u2019s comments, which came Tuesday night during the Maine gubernatorial race\u2019s final televised debate. Asked to defend his decision to reject Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which denied some 70,000 Maine residents access to affordable healthcare, the famously intemperate and radical Tea Party governor tried to sound as if those tens of thousands lacking coverage was not his fault. \u201c[T]here are people under the federal poverty level,\u201d LePage granted. \u201cThey need to be able to go to the exchanges \u2026Take those that do not qualify and then find a way to get them insurance.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed by a moderator to acknowledge that a reason many people weren\u2019t covered was because he had rejected the element of Obamacare designed to help them, LePage responded with pure nonsense. \u201cThat\u2019s ACA,\u201d he said, referring to the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare\u2019s official name. \u201cI didn\u2019t put that in.\u201d Reminded that the unaffordable deductibles keeping many Mainers without insurance long predated Obamacare (and were in fact part of the reason for its passage in the first place), LePage wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cYeah, well, that\u2019s ACA,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. The ACA has changed the entire system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maine governor Paul LePage shows why Democrats could have gone on offense on Obamacare -- and improved their odds", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Maine governor Paul LePage shows why Democrats could have gone on offense on Obamacare -- and improved their odds", "title": "Tea Party nut\u2019s Obama nonsense: How Paul LePage reveals a flawed Dem strategy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/22/tea_party_nuts_obama_nonsense_how_paul_lepage_reveals_a_flawed_dem_strategy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/paul_lepage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maine governor Paul LePage shows why Democrats could have gone on offense on Obamacare -- and improved their odds", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/paul_lepage.jpg", "title": "Tea Party nut\u2019s Obama nonsense: How Paul LePage reveals a flawed Dem strategy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Tea Party nut\u2019s Obama nonsense: How Paul LePage reveals a flawed Dem strategy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, ed fitzgerald, Editor's Picks, Election 2014, John Kasich, Mitch McConnell, Obamacare, Paul LePage, Tea Party, The New York Times, The Right", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcefa6\"", "article_summary": "After what I\u2019ve heard from McConnell, Kasich and LePage?\nAt a certain point, it can feel more like a scathing pantomime of democracy than the contemporary manifestation of the real thing.\nPaul LePage \u2014 which have me reconsidering whether the president\u2019s comment was truly a mistake.\nThe primary reason why is a recent succession of more substantial rhetorical faux pas from three Republican candidates \u2014 Sen.
