(approximate weight) boxes of \"Ground Beef Chuck 81% Lean 19% Fat (Fine Grind)\" with Sell By Date 11-03-2015 and case code 63100.\n\nAll of the recalled products are stamped with the establishment number \"EST. 20420\" inside the USDA mark of inspection.\n\nAll American Meats, based in Omaha, Nebraska, says the recalled meat products were shipped to retail locations nationwide. USDA and company officials expressed concern that some of the meat may be in consumers' freezers.\n\nUSDA testing detected a strain of E. coli called O157:H7, which can cause severe illness or even death. Symptoms including abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea may develop an average of 3 or 4 days after consuming food contaminated with the bacteria.\n\nWhile most people recover within a week, children under age 5 and older adults are at greater risk of severe complications, including kidney failure.\n\nThe USDA says cooking meat thoroughly to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit can kill harmful bacteria, including E. coli. The agency encouraged consumers to use a food thermometer to ensure that meat is cooked safely.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "All American Meats, Inc., is recalling more than 167,000 pounds of ground beef that may be\u00a0contaminated with E. coli.", "author": "CBS News", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30411562/ground-beef-recalled-over-e-coli", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9157101_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "All American Meats, Inc., is recalling more than 167,000 pounds of ground beef that may be\u00a0contaminated with E. coli.", "title": "Ground Beef Recalled Over E.
