Did you hear all the yelling? Did you catch when Donald Trump talked about Jeb Bush mooning people?\n\nDid you know that each of the men on stage wants to be in a position to appoint Supreme Court justices?\n\nIn between the arguments, all six candidates made the case for the kind of justices they would nominate\u2014one of the most significant decisions a president can make in office.\n\nAs a reminder of just how significant, here are the major cases before the Supreme Court right now and the issues at stake:\n\nImmigration.\n\nCase: United States v. Texas\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: The 26-state challenge has halted the implementation of President Obama\u2019s executive actions that would offer young undocumented immigrants and their parents temporary protection from deportation and allow them to lawfully seek work. The Supreme Court will decide whether Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and expanded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) will move forward.\n\nHealthcare.\n\nCase: Zubik v. Burwell\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: Religious nonprofits have challenged the mandate in the Affordable Care Act that allows employees to access contraceptive coverage through employer-sponsored plans. The Supreme Court will decide whether the law\u2019s current accommodation\u2014which allows employers to sign a form indicating they have a religious objection to the coverage and trigger a third-party insurer to provide it instead\u2014imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of these nonprofits.\n\nAbortion rights.\n\nCase: Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: A coalition of abortion providers in Texas, including Whole Woman\u2019s Health, has challenged Texas\u2019 sweeping abortion law, which has shuttered more than half the clinics that offer abortion services in the state. The Supreme Court will decide whether the law, by significantly reducing the availability of abortion services in the state, imposes an undue burden on women exercising their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nVoting rights.\n\nCase: Evenwel v. Abbott\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: Under the standard of \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d how should states count people when they draw legislative districts? Should they count just eligible voters, or should they count everyone\u2014including undocumented immigrants, children, and people who are incarcerated? The outcome could shift power away from cities and toward more rural areas.\n\nUnions.\n\nCase: Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: Can unions collect fees from non-members for collective bargaining done on their behalf? If the high court decides they can\u2019t, the California Teachers Association\u2019s financial resources\u2014and the union itself\u2014could be significantly weakened.\n\nAffirmative action.\n\nCase: Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin\n\nWhat it\u2019s about: Whether the University of Texas\u2019 admissions policy, which considers race as one factor, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The case was brought by a white student who says she was denied admission because of her race. The justices could gut affirmative-action programs at universities across the country. (At oral arguments, the late Justice Antonin Scalia mused that some black students might fare better at \u201ca less advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Think about the two-hour shouting match that just happened.
