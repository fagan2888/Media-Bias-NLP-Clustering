Vilsack has served in President Obama\u2019s cabinet since January of 2009, as the nation\u2019s ag secretary. \u201cI have been really blessed and privileged by this state and the one thing I definitely want to do, regardless of the future, is I want to come back here and I want to contribute in some way,\u201d Vilsack says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go some place else. I want to come back home because this is where the people of Iowa gave me all these extraordinary opportunities and I will be forever indebted to them.\u201d Vilsack, who grew up in Pennsylvania, met Christie Bell of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, in college and adopted her hometown as his own after the couple married. Vilsack was elected mayor of Mount Pleasant and won a seat in the state senate before being elected governor in 1998. Vilsack won reelection in 2002, but did not seek a third term, saying eight years was enough. He\u2019s not ruling out the idea of putting his name on an Iowa ballot again, though.\n\nThe first thought would be that Vilsack would most likely be interested in a state wide office. The major state wide office that would be up in the next election would be US senator. That seat is of course occupied by Chuck Grassley. In 2016 at the time of the next election, Grassley will be completing his 36th year as a senator and his 58th year in a legislative position. Over the years Grassley has embarrassed Iowans over and over, but somehow he keeps getting re-elected. Defeating Grassley will be a monumental task even at the then age of 83.\n\nHere is an ad from his last run to remind us what an embarrassment Grassley can be:\n\nVilsack will have the name recognition that many of Grassley\u2019s opponents have not had. He also will be running in a presidential year which historically has helped the Democratic turnout. As things are shaping up now, a national ticket with Hillary clinton at the top may add a spur to that turnout.\n\nJust speculation folks. Removing Grassley from the senate should be a top priority for Iowans.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "Vilsack won reelection in 2002, but did not seek a third term, saying eight years was enough.\nThe first thought would be that Vilsack would most likely be interested in a state wide office.\nThe major state wide office that would be up in the next election would be US senator.\nFrom the radioiowa news story:Former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack says he wants to come back to Iowa and he isn\u2019t ruling out another run for political office.\nVilsack was elected mayor of Mount Pleasant and won a seat in the state senate before being elected governor in 1998."}
