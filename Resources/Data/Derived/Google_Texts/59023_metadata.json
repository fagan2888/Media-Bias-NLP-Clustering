Like the boys she also consumes large volumes of protein shakes and won a recent weightlifting competition.\n\nThere is not much for her to do at TK these days so, after previously working 16-hours-a-day at the role 2 hospital rests bay nursing multiple trauma patients, she spends a lot of time in the gym and drinking coffee with her mates in between sick parades and tending to colds and flu.\n\n\"I was doing patrols outside the wire with the EOD guys on demolition duties and that was great,'' she said.\n\nSHOULD WOMEN IN DEFENCE SHARE FACILITIES WITH MEN? HAVE YOUR SAY\n\nIt never occurred to the young soldier that she was a trail blazer for women in combat.\n\n\"I have never had an issue with the guys hassling me and they treat me more like a little sister,'' she says over yet another coffee at the Green beans outlet.\n\nLance Corporal Bailey has a younger brother in the Army serving with the 7th Battalion in Adelaide and two \"ridiculously'' proud parents back in Bendigo.\n\nKnown as \"rocky'' by her mates after she told a government minister that her biggest shock in Afghanistan had been the huge amount of rocks around the place, she has been in the army for four-and-a-half years after working in a suit shop and she has been at Camp Holland since June 4.\n\n\"On TV it is all sand but over here there are rocks everywhere and they are difficult for little feet,'' she said.\n\nThe feisty young soldier will be home in early December in time for Christmas back with the folks in Bendigo.\n\n\"This deployment has been a great opportunity and I have a lot more experiences to gain with the army,'' Lance Corporal Bailey said.\n\nShe plans to remain in the army and her aim is to become an aero-medical evacuation (AME) retrieval medic, the same role held by RAAF Flight Lieutenant Pam Wittmann from Adelaide, who is posted to the 3rd AME Squadron at Richmond base near Sydney.\n\nThe 28-year-old University of South Australia graduate joined the defence force as an undergraduate and is on her second posting to the Middle East Area of Operations.\n\n\"Working as a retrieval medic is the pinnacle for a RAAF nurse,'' she said.\n\n\"The opportunity to travel with aeromedical evacuation patients and to help people is really what nursing is all about.''\n\nPutting aside the sparse living conditions in a bunk room at Camp Baker deep inside the dusty Kandahar base - and the shared bathroom facilities - Flight Lieutenant Wittmann loves her job.\n\n\"When I go to work I never know what I will be doing,'' she says.\n\nAt the camp's role 1 medical centre she even manages to keep her hand in by baking cup cakes in the microwave.\n\n\"I have seen how the folks live in TK and I have witnessed some terrible things in the role 3 hospital here, so I can't complain,'' she says.\n\nFlight Lieutenant Wittmann said she always wanted to do medical work and when she spotted a defence recruiting ad for the undergraduate scheme she jumped at the chance.\n\nThat meant sponsored study, a full-time wage and all her text books and other costs taken care of.\n\nDescribing the RAAF as like a big extended family with strong camaraderie and a great lifestyle, the only regret she has over her nine years of service are the long absences from her parents, Walter and Jenny, and brothers Andrew and Christopher in Adelaide.\n\n\"When I go to work in the morning I never know what I might be doing that day,'' she said.\n\nApart from her two deployments to Al Minhad air base near Dubai she worked rebuilding after cyclone Yasi and was involved in an emergency flight from Lord Howe Island.\n\n\"In the past three weeks I have had back to back missions from TK to Kabul and back to TK, and I have been to Germany to pick up seriously injured patients and fly them back to Australia.''\n\nOne of her most seriously ill patients was AusAID worker Dave Savage who was blown up and gravely wounded in Afghanistan by a teenage suicide bomber.\n\nWorking with the air load team at the vast and eternally dusty Kandahar airfield is a tough job for anyone but nothing seems to phase 25 year old Leading Aircraftsman Kylie Barnes from Canberra.\n\nMixing it with the men has never been an issue for the tall former model who admits to hankering after a nice dress and a pair of heels as she drives a forklift into the back of a C-17 transport jet or manhandles cargo onto a pallet.\n\nShe works with the 1st Airfield Operational Support Squadron at Richmond RAAF base and arrived in Kandahar in September for a seven-month deployment as the mission in Afghanistan was winding down.\n\n\"We are sending everyone and everything home and constantly loading and unloading passengers and cargo,'' Leading Aircraftsman Barnes said.\n\nShe joined the RAAF as a 21-year-old on the advice of her big brother Matthew who is a Captain in the Army. Her parents Rick and Alice live in Canberra where Kylie was born and raised.\n\n\"I was working as an administrator and wanted to get out of the office. I wento to the Amberley air show with its fast jets and loud noises and I was sold,'' she said.\n\nThe travel and long, irregular hours take a toll, but she soon got used to it and now relishes the challenge.\n\n\"I was looking for a long-term career and until I can find something with the same pay and benefits I am happy here.\n\n\"I have never had any dramas with the guys and I have a lot of male mates and they tend top be a lot less catty anyway.''\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "FOR crusty old diggers lining up at war memorials around the nation tomorrow for Remembrance Day ceremonies the idea of sharing close living quarters with a female soldier on operations would be unthinkable.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "FOR crusty old diggers lining up at war memorials around the nation tomorrow for Remembrance Day ceremonies the idea of sharing close living quarters with a female soldier on operations would be unthinkable.", "title": "War is the same for ADF women and men in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/national/war-is-the-same-for-adf-women-and-men-in-afghanistan/story-fncynjr2-1226756497793", "image": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2013/11/09/1226756/497617-776ff7de-467b-11e3-b366-b430cfe3cfdd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2013/11/09/1226756/497617-776ff7de-467b-11e3-b366-b430cfe3cfdd.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226756497793, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "keywords": "retrieval medic, close living quarters, petite blonde, demolition duties, sprained ankle, weightlifting competition, aid stations, air load team, protein shakes, bunk room, drinking coffee, tough job, national defence writer, manhandles cargo, war memorials, terrible things, adjoining cubicles, aeromedical evacuation patients, shared bathroom facilities, medical work, male mates, defence force, teenage suicide bomber, undergraduate scheme, defence recruiting, suit shop, Royal Australian Airforce, Aircraft Women Kylie, trail blazer, feisty young soldier, army serving, air show, cup cakes, ,,Kabul,, ,,,Germany, ,,,Australia, ,,Kandah\u00e2r,, Australian women military, ADF, Australian Defence Force, army medic, young soldier, male soldiers, sparse living conditions, aero-medical evacuation, defence writer, medical centre, sharing facilities, Australian base, nice dress, silent contemplation, long-term career, ill patients, government minister, proud parents, transport jet, sponsored study, myriad hospitals, fast jets, text books, female soldier, multiple trauma patients, Australian troops, emergency flight, ,Victoria, British Columbia,British Columbia,, ,,,Afghanistan, ,,,Dubai, ,,South Australia,, Defence Force, University of South Australia, Andrew, Dave Savage, Flt-Lt Wittmann, Matthew, Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan war", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Nov 09 20:44:42 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sat Nov 09 20:44:42 EST 2013", "author": "IAN McPHEDRAN national defence writer"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2b2\"", "article_summary": "War is the same for ADF women and men in AfghanistanVideoImage Families make pilgrimage to Afghanistan Family members of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan have made an emotional pilgrimage to Tarin Kowt.\nHAVE YOUR SAYIt never occurred to the young soldier that she was a trail blazer for women in combat.\nSHOULD WOMEN IN DEFENCE SHARE FACILITIES WITH MEN?\nShe works with the 1st Airfield Operational Support Squadron at Richmond RAAF base and arrived in Kandahar in September for a seven-month deployment as the mission in Afghanistan was winding down.\nI wento to the Amberley air show with its fast jets and loud noises and I was sold,'' she said."}
