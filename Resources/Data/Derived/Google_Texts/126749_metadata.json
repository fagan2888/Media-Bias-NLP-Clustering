Sam Brownback of Kansas.\n\nCertain that he could spur his state\u2019s economy, create \u201ctens of thousands of jobs\u201d and provide a model for other Republican governors to emulate, Brownback pushed a major tax system overhaul through the state legislature in 2012, including a 25 percent reduction in the top income tax rate and elimination of taxes on various types of income such as non-wage small business income.\n\nRelated: Why State Tax Cuts Aren\u2019t Driving Job Growth\n\nBut the experiment by this acolyte of President Ronald Reagan \u201chas caused a steep drop in state revenues, while not yet delivering the outsized economic growth,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. And rather than reaping political benefit, Brownback has suffered major defections within his party as he faces a tough challenge from Democrat Paul Davis, the state House Minority Leader who until recently was viewed as a very long shot in this red state.\n\nIn a startling rebuke to the governor, more than 100 Kansas Republican officials endorsed Davis on Tuesday, a rarity in statewide races and a wakeup call for Brownback, an arch conservative on economic and social issues and a former U.S. senator. The defectors said they are as concerned about cuts in education and other government services as well as the tax cuts that have left the state with a major hole in its budget.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply concerned by the direction Sam Brownback is taking Kansas,\u201d said Wint Winter, a former state senator who is supporting Davis, according to the Wall Street Journal account. \u201cWe are all Republicans. But we will always be Kansans first.\u201d\n\nRelated: Gov. Jerry Brown Uses Surplus to Prevent Bankruptcies\n\nIronically, while California, Ohio and scores of other states are reveling in surging revenues and budget surpluses, Brownback and other Kansas state officials are struggling to plug a gaping hole in their revenue estimates. State officials anticipated collecting $651 million from personal income tax in April and May, but instead received only $369 million with little time remaining in the state\u2019s fiscal year.\n\nBrownback and other state officials have downplayed the significance of the shortfall, saying that it was caused in part by changes in the capital gains law as part of the congressional \u201cFiscal Cliff\u201d deal in January 2013.\n\nIf the state manages to meet its revenue projections for the next 12 months, it will be left with a balance of $56 million by the end of fiscal year 2015, according to the Wichita Eagle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll finish this year with several hundred millions of dollars cash on hand \u2026 so we\u2019re going to be in fine shape,\u201d Brownback told the newspaper. \u201cWe projected a dip. We\u2019ve had good overall performance of our agencies being able to hold back costs, so it\u2019s two sides of the equation.\n\n\n\nBut a report by the Rockefeller Institute of Government found that Kansas is one of six states that has experienced a double-digit percentage decline in personal income tax revenue.\n\nRelated: No Job Loss in Most States That Raised Minimum Wage\n\n\u201cThe declines in income tax collections appear to have been driven mostly by behavior of taxpayers, who shifted income from tax year 2013 to tax year 2012 to minimize federal tax liability,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe situation was further complicated in states that reduced income tax rates, including Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nebraska, North Dakota, and Ohio, where it was difficult to sort out the effects.\u201d\n\nAdding to the Kansas state government\u2019s fiscal woes, Moody\u2019s Investors Service cut its credit rating this spring, while Davis has accused Brownback\u2019s administration of \u201cstarving local schools.\u201d\n\nThe non-partisan Cook Political Report last week moved the governor\u2019s race from leaning Brownback\u2019s way to a \u201ctoss-up,\u201d noting that the governor\u2019s administration is also beset with an influence peddling investigation.\n\n\u201cDemocrats believe that they have a strong candidate in . . . Paul Davis, who is said to be moderate enough to appeal to some Republican voters,\u201d the Cook Report explained. \u201cPolling shows a single-digit race, with the most recent survey conducted at the end of June giving Davis a six-point advantage.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Few politicians put more store in the supply-side economics magic of Reagan-style tax cuts than Republican Gov.
