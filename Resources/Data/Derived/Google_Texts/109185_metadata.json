To celebrate, I decided to talk with some LGBTQ people in my community\u2014Native brothers and sisters.\n\nBeing gay is a unique experience. Being Native American is a unique experience. And being a gay Native person who has been able to thrive and survive and is brave enough to share a personal story of coming out in this cutthroat world is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nNumbers-wise, the LGBTQ Native American community is a relatively small group. But the truth is that it is an immensely diverse subpopulation - one with many voices, many faces, and many realities.\n\nOr, as Melvin Monette characterizes, \u201cthere\u2019s no pan-gay Indian experience.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nMelvin has a lot to celebrate. He just got engaged to his long-time partner, and he\u2019s about to be inaugurated as the next President of the National Indian Education Association. That\u2019s huge. And it\u2019s full circle.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago this month I was freshly divorced, a single father moving back to my reservation, scared as hell of coming out to myself and my community and my family.\u201d\n\nIt turns out, the move back to his rez didn\u2019t go so well. One night, he ran into an old classmate.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t turn out to be a fag, did you?\u201d the guy asked.\n\nMelvin recoiled, \u201cAt 30 years old, suddenly I was a 10 year old sissy again.\u201d\n\nRaised to be a \u201cgood Catholic boy\u201d on the Turtle Mountain and Spirit Lake reservations, Melvin did what he thought was right: he got married and had kids. When he was growing up, he explains, there were no \u201cnormal\u201d gay people on TV or out in his community, and this lack of exposure to homosexuality painted a negative picture in his head about who he was. For many years, he didn\u2019t think he wanted that life.\n\nEventually, he did the \u201cnerdy thing\u201d: he studied LGBTQ life. He went online and realized that there were plenty of \u201cnormal\u201d gay people. After that, all it took was a nudge from a college friend to help him move forward. She told him she knew he was gay, and that it was okay. Feeling affirmed, he came out.\n\n\u201cIt was a sigh of relief. I immediately became a better father, a better son, a better employee\u2014I no longer had to think 24/7 about how to hide this thing. I became who I was.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nKenny Davis grew up on Turtle Mountain too\u2014but a generation after Melvin. By then, the community\u2019s worldview on gay life had changed\n\n\u201cIt was never an issue. Me being gay was never an issue,\u201d he says.\n\nNow, this is definitely a \u201cdespite all odds\u201d situation. To put it into perspective: rural community; prominent political family (his dad is the Vice Chairman of the tribe); devout Catholics. It sounds like a recipe for some type of homophobic disaster. But not for Kenny. Not for the Davis family. They always knew he was gay, and always accepted him. Beautifully, he never even had to come out.\n\nThanks in no small part to his supportive family, Kenny\u2014a former staffer for Senator Heidi Heitkamp\u2014has the confidence to dream big. He plans to one day run for Chairman of his tribe.\n\n\u201cI would be the first gay chairman of Turtle Mountain. Honestly, I think I can do it,\u201d he says. I don\u2019t doubt him for a second.\n\nI wonder if there\u2019s a chance that his sexual orientation could harm his chances of winning. Real talk: would enough voters discriminate against him to make a dent?\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d he says. \u201cWouldn\u2019t harm me. I know that constitution, I know that community, I know the ins and outs. Once I gain some experience, I\u2019ll be qualified and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nI also wonder whether Turtle Mountain has anything in their laws regarding marriage equality.\n\n\u201cNot yet, and if it hasn\u2019t happened by the time I\u2019m Chairman - well, there will be,\u201d he smiles.\n\n*****\n\nThe Suquamish Tribe was the second Tribe nationally to approve gay marriage, and did so long before most states approved it.\n\nTerry Johnson\u2014\u201cTJ\u201d\u2014and his husband made history as the first same-sex couple to be married there. They just celebrated a milestone: their one-year wedding anniversary, their sixth year together. For them and their three children, Suquamish is a warm and embracing place.\n\nConversely, the Native community where TJ grew up, Zuni Pueblo in New Mexico, has no public position on gay marriage.\n\n\u201cMy mom raised me on her own. I was always expected to be the man and do all the things men do. Coming out to her was the hardest thing,\u201d he explains.\n\nFor TJ, it wasn\u2019t just about himself.\n\n\u201cCulturally, it always goes back to who\u2019s your family?, who\u2019s your grandparents? That\u2019s how we identify ourselves as Native people. I didn\u2019t want to ruin my family\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nIn the end, those closest to TJ remained supportive after learning he was gay.\n\n\u201cMy biggest fear was being isolated from my friends and family. If I could look back and tell myself one thing, I\u2019d just say, don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019ll all work out.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nLexi Luger is my older sister. She lives on the Standing Rock reservation with her girlfriend, Rhonnae.\n\n\u201cThe biggest difference between being in an open gay relationship on the reservation versus being off the reservation is that everybody knows me and everybody knows my girlfriend. In a sense it\u2019s comforting, but it\u2019s annoying too. I suppose it\u2019s the same for other relationships on the rez,\u201d Lexi explains.\n\nDespite growing up in an extremely open-minded, liberal household, Lexi struggled to come out.\n\n\u201cI mean, it was North Dakota. I faced discrimination there as a woman, as a gay person, and as an American Indian person. When you have all these people around you your whole life telling you that there\u2019s something innately dirty about you, innately wrong with you, you internalize that.\u201d\n\nNow, she says, at 30 years old, she finally feels like she loves herself. And part of that self-acceptance has come directly from being surrounded by traditional Lakota culture.\n\n\u201cRhonnae and I go into a women\u2019s sweat lodge together, we help out with coming of age ceremonies, we speak with elder Native women who are loving and embrace us and want to see our love flourish. I couldn\u2019t experience that with her if she was a man, because we\u2019d be on two different walks of that road. But we\u2019re both Native, we\u2019re both women, and we are able to bond a very meaningful way.\u201d\n\n*****\n\nWambli Eagleman is an actor. He\u2019s not afraid to express himself in public, but he kept his sexuality a secret most of his life. Exactly one year ago, he came out.\n\nLike Melvin, he was scared. Like TJ, he feared family rejection. But like Kenny's family, Wambli's turned out to be accepting. Like Lexi, he was able to draw guidance from his elders.\n\nHis Navajo grandpa had the best reaction.\n\n\u201cYeah, so what?\u201d grandpa told the family:\n\n\u201cYou have to love him. You have to care for him. That\u2019s our child. Don\u2019t say bad things about gay people because a long time ago in the Navajo culture, the two spirited people were respected as sacred, and that\u2019s how we treat them.\u201d\n\nChelsey Luger is Anishinaabe and Lakota.
