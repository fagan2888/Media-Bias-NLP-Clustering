Highmark also failed to maintain records of complaints and failed to respond to the department's inquiries in a timely manner, the agency found.\n\nAt that time, Delaware's Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan was in the process of affiliating with Highmark, which required converting computer systems, Highmark Delaware spokesman Matthew Stehl wrote in an email. The period also covered the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, Stehl said.\n\n\u201cWe were aware of the issues identified in the examination and worked closely with the provider community and our customers to resolve them,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMost of Aetna's violations occurred primarily between Jan. 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012, according to documents the department filed. Aetna failed to pay claims within 30 days, charged excessive fees for chiropractic appointments and committed other violations, according to documents.\n\n\u201cAetna will continue to work closely with Commissioner (Karen Weldin) Stewart, and we welcome her attention to the need for compliance. We have reprocessed the claims for the providers involved,\u201d said Aetna spokesman Walter Cherniak Jr.\n\nWes Venteicher is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
