States such as Colorado that had their own health exchange would be able to decide for themselves whether they\u2019d pick up this option offered by the President and allow these so-called \u201cnon-ACA compliant\u201d plans to be sold.\n\nFor Colorado, however, the decision was a bit more tricky because of a law passed in 2013 designed to bring the state into maximum compliance with the ACA\u2014a piece of legislation given the obvious shorthand of \u201cthe alignment bill.\u201d One of the key provisions of the alignment bill was to ensure that all plans sold in 2014 and beyond were fully compliant with the benefits mandated by the ACA.\n\nThe DOI found itself in a quandary when the President made his announcement: How could they allow non-ACA compliant plans to be sold when the alignment bill prohibited them? Allowing the sale of these plans meant cancellation notices would be put off by a year, possibly two, which would minimize the negative press the ACA was creating in an election year for Democrats like then-Sen. Mark Udall.\n\nOn the same day President Obama made his announcement, DOI Communications Director Vincent Plymell addressed the issue in an email:\n\n\u201cWhat is our position? It would seem similar to the November 2013 proposal, in that we can\u2019t allow [the sale of these health plans] due to the Alignment Bill. Is that correct? \u2013 Vince\u201d\n\nA top policy analyst for the DOI, Matt Mortier, responded: \u201cI believe you\u2019re right. We\u2019re hard-coded in Section 70 (Effective date \u2013 applicability) that the alignment bill requirements apply to health-coverage plans (non-grandfathered plans) issued or renewed on or after January 01, 2014.\u201d\n\nIt seemed that if non-ACA plans were to be sold, the DOI would have to go back to the General Assembly and ask for a legislative fix. In fact, the DOI was so convinced of this necessity, Plymell went so far as to draft a press release on March 17 that would announce the department\u2019s intention to do just that.\n\nThe draft press release begins:\n\nThe Colorado Division of Insurance (DOI) will work to allow health insurance companies to extend their pre-ACA plans into 2016. This effort is in response to the March 5 announcement that the President and his administration would allow states to make such extensions possible. This extension will require a change in state law, specifically __________. Currently, the law states that all plans sold or renewed in 2014 must comply with the ACA. The DOI and the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA, the Division\u2019s home) will work with the legislature and the Governor\u2019s office on the necessary legislation.\n\nInstead of following through with the plan to seek approval from the legislature, the DOI instead simply issued a bulletin roughly six weeks later in May 2014.\n\nAs a legal justification, the DOI relied upon a clause \u2014 also in the alignment bill \u2014 that gives the insurance Commissioner the power to set rules regarding the ACA implementation. The only question then becomes whether the Commissioner\u2019s rule making power allows him/her to exceed \u201chard coded\u201d statute that details an outright ban on certain types of health plans. Such \u201crule making\u201d clauses are usually intended to allow for adjustments that are within all other limits of the law \u2014 but don\u2019t allow for legal limits to be exceeded, as appears to be the case here.\n\nIn an August 22 letter to four Republican Senators, Commissioner Salazar said:\n\nC.R.S. Section 10-16-109 provides that \u201cthe commissioner may promulgate reasonable rules consistent with this article that are necessary or proper for implementing and administering this article, including rules necessary to align state law with the requirements imposed by federal law regarding health care coverage in this state.\n\nThe March 5, 2014 offer from President Obama to allow non-ACA compliant plans to be sold was not a requirement \u201cimposed\u201d by federal law; it was an option. Furthermore, the statutory portion quoted by Commissioner Salazar says the rules should be \u201cconsistent\u201d with the alignment bill. It is highly debatable whether completely overturning a key criteria within the alignment bill would be legally deemed as \u201cconsistent.\u201d Instead, the bulletin issued by the DOI appears completely incongrous with the alignment bill.\n\nComplete Colorado sued the DOI for 11 months to gain access to the emails published in this report. Ultimately, DOI provided a majority of the emails sought in exchange for the lawsuit being dropped.\n\nOrdinarily, when a bureaucracy oversteps its jurisdictional power, some kind of political outrage typically is generated. But in this unique situation, both Democrats and Republicans got enough of what they wanted that little issue was made of the DOI decision.\n\nDemocrats were able to stop the bleeding on the continuing bad news of cancelled health plans. Republicans were able to tell their constituents they had delivered a success by providing at least another year of keeping their original health plan.\n\nHowever, the DOI\u2019s actions raise significant issues about the rule of law and the extent to which government bureaucracies can act independently of the wishes of the legislative branch.\n\nThe issue did surface in the 2014 governor\u2019s race. In a web-broadcast debate hosted by the Denver Post, Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez directly challenged Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper on the legality of his administration\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cJohn, you know I\u2019m not a fan of ObamaCare, so let me be clear about that,\u201d Beauprez began.\n\nBut I found it curious that part of Obamacare, uh, said all health care policies issued under ObamaCare had to be compliant with that law. And then the President \u2013 independently, without a vote on Capitol Hill, among Congress \u2013 the President independently said, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll just kick the can down the road,\u2019 as some are wont to do, and, and allow non-ACA compliant plans to be renewed in 2014. Your insurance commissioner said that would violate the law in Colorado. I think she was right. Because it\u2019s a law that you signed that said every plan sold in Colorado had to be ACA-compliant. And then magically, a short while later, somebody reversed opinion within your administration and said, \u2018We\u2019ll ignore the law\u2019 \u2013 that you signed \u2013 and go ahead and allow those plans to be renewed. Why\u2019d you break the law, John, the law that you signed?\n\nGovernor Hickenlooper used the opportunity to extol some portions of the ACA he was pleased with, but did not address Beauprez\u2019s question of legality in any meaningful sense. (Watch video of this portion of the debate here, begin at time 1:00:50.)\n\nIn July 2014, Complete Colorado published a story that provided lengthy documentation of DOI\u2019s internal belief that a legislative remedy was needed to legally allow the sale of non-ObamaCare compliant plans. But none of that documentation displayed as much conviction and certainty as the emails provided above. Additionally, much the documentation that existed from 2014 included first hand accounts but from persons outside the bureaucracy. The new emails obtained and published by Complete Colorado now give first hand accounts from top DOI administrative officials like Commissioner Marguerite Salazar, Vincent Plymell, and Matt Mortier.\n\nIn our report from July of last year, then-State Representative Amy Stephens blasted the actions of the DOI and the Governor\u2019s administration. \u201cHB [13]-1266 is very clear,\u201d Stephens said last year. \u201cIt is the law in Colorado and does not offer \u2018cover\u2019 for the Commissioner or Governor to break the law. They broke the law, because like our lawless President \u2013 \u201cthey think they can\u201d \u2013 and this is about trying to save the seats of a Democrat US Senator (Mark Udall) and the Governor (John Hickenlooper).\u201d\n\nNo document shows when, why, or how the main players inside DOI changed their minds. But calendar records show that in between believing a legislative fix was needed and the decision to simply allow the plans to be sold under the authority of a division-issued bulletin, Commissioner Salazar met with top members of the Hickenlooper administration at the Governor\u2019s offices in the Capitol.\n\nEmails requesting comment have not been returned by either the DOI, or by members of the Hickenlooper administration.\n\nCorrection: The original publishing of this article did not provide Commissioner Salazar\u2019s and the DOI\u2019s explanation as to why they thought the bulletin they issued was legal. We regret not including those comments and arguments in the first few hours of publication of this article.\n\nSpecial thanks to attorney Geoff Blue for his patience in discussing legal forms and open records laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "A draft press release reads, \"The DOI and the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA, the Division\u2019s home) will work with the legislature and the Governor\u2019s office on the necessary legislation,\" -- but that never happened.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.4.6", "og": {"site_name": "Complete Colorado - Page Two", "description": "A draft press release reads, \"The DOI and the Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA, the Division\u2019s home) will work with the legislature and the Governor\u2019s office on the necessary legislation,\" -- but that never happened.", "title": "Documents suggest Division of Insurance knowingly broke health care law in 2014", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/stethescopestatutes.png", "height": 987}, "url": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/2015/07/25/documents-suggest-division-of-insurance-knowingly-broke-health-care-law-in-2014/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 221004171379840}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Bob Beauprez,Colorado Division of Insurance,Governor John Hickenlooper,Mark Udall,Matt Mortier,obamacare,Vincent Plymell,", "article": {"section": "Exclusives", "tag": "Vincent Plymell", "published_time": "2015-07-26T01:17:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-26T19:17:28+00:00", "author": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/author/admin/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The draft press release begins:The Colorado Division of Insurance (DOI) will work to allow health insurance companies to extend their pre-ACA plans into 2016.\nDemocrats were able to stop the bleeding on the continuing bad news of cancelled health plans.\nCurrently, the law states that all plans sold or renewed in 2014 must comply with the ACA.\nNew emails obtained by Complete Colorado add support to the notion that the Colorado Division of Insurance (DOI) knowingly broke state law when the agency decided to allow some health plans to be sold last year.\n\u201cIt is the law in Colorado and does not offer \u2018cover\u2019 for the Commissioner or Governor to break the law."}
