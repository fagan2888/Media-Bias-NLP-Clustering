Trump leads Cruz by roughly 9 percentage points, 42%-32.7%, in the RealClearPolitics average of recent Hoosier polls. A win there could help solidify Trump\u2019s claim to the nomination, while dealing Cruz a formidable blow.", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Texas Sen.
