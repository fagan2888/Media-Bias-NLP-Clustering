Democrats had some fun on social media Tuesday ribbing Republicans over what looks like a Twitter snafu that popped up earlier in the day on the official feed of Speaker John A. Boehner, R-Ohio.

The Boehner tweet featured a bulleted list of the five key points of the GOP's Jobs Plan — but, for some reason, the bullet points were blank.

After yukking it up over that for a couple of hours ("No wonder this is the least productive Congress in history," tweeted Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich.), Democrats decided to start filling in the blanks.

Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., retweeted an image with handwritten suggestions in the blank spaces, including "Raise the minimum wage," "Healthy Families Act for paid leave," and "Paycheck Fairness Act — #Equal Pay" — all under the line "A few ideas for your blank agenda, Mr. Speaker."

The Boehner camp, which has earned notice recently for ramping up its social media game , quickly pushed back, sending out a tweet "thanking" the Democrats, including Maryland's Steny H. Hoyer and New York's Joseph D. Crowley, for calling attention to the GOP plan — 5 Points for Resetting America's Economic Foundation — and directing those interested to the speaker's website , where the plan was outlined in more detail than was available on Twitter.

Thanks to House Democrats like Reps Hoyer, Kildee, & Crowley for spreading the word about http://t.co/DR9MAb4X5d ✌ — Speaker John Boehner (@SpeakerBoehner) October 7, 2014
