His family immigrated to the U.S. from Cuba in 1962, and the Cuban sandwich is the staple of his Taste of Cuba booth at the fair.\n\nRousso said his winning creation takes the best of that sandwich \u2014 roasted pork, ham, pickles and Swiss cheese \u2014 and adds a side of mojo sauce.\n\n\u201cPut that all together and what you get is an explosion of flavor,\u201d Rousso said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nJustin Martinez won previously for Most Creative in 2011 with Deep Fried Bubble Gum, but said he wanted to break from sweet to try a savory invention. The idea, he said, hit him that Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cI remember loading up my plate, and actually looking at my plate saying, \u2018Oh my God, how can I fry Thanksgiving?\u2019\u201d Justin Martinez said.\n\nBut it took Justin Martinez nearly two years to perfect his recipe, he said, even withholding it from last year\u2019s competition because he didn\u2019t feel comfortable with it. His Fried Thanksgiving Dinner combines stuffing, turkey and southern cream corn, with gravy and orange cranberry sauce on the side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more like comfort,\u201d Justin Martinez said. \u201cIt seems like it brings people together. It creates a happy feeling, so that\u2019s always a plus.\u201d\n\nThe judges included Dallas Morning News columnist Jacquielynn Floyd, editorial writer Mike Hashimoto and The Ticket\u2019s Corby Davidson.\n\nTry them out for yourself when the State Fair of Texas opens on Sept. 27.\n\nThe winners:\n\nDeep Fried Cuban Roll: A filling of slow-cooked pork shoulder, chopped ham, Swiss cheese, pickles and secret sauce spread on a slice of Swiss cheese, rolled in pastry dough and deep-fried. Served with mojo sauce.\n\nFried Thanksgiving Dinner: Homemade stuffing and diced roasted turkey rolled in a ball, then dipped in southern cream corn, covered in seasoned corn meal and deep fried. Served with orange cranberry sauce and giblet gravy.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA5L2RlZXAtZnJpZWQtY3ViYW4tcm9sbC10YWtlcy1ob21lLXRvcC1ob25vci1hdC1iaWctdGV4LWNob2ljZS1hd2FyZHMuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Andrew Scoggin", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "The Deep Fried Cuban Roll and Fried Thanksgiving Dinner took home top honors this morning at the ninth annual Big Tex Choice Awards at Fair Park.
