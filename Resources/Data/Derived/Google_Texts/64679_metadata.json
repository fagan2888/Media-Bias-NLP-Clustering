Marco Rubio, who campaigned throughout the Tampa Bay region Saturday, said this election cycle seems more like a volatile online comments section of a blog than a race for president of the United States.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate began his day with a rally in Largo as part of a push for support as Florida\u2019s primary election looms Tuesday. Businessman Donald Trump is leading in polls of the state\u2019s voters.\n\n\u201cOur politics have become Twitter trolls,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cActing the same way, the outrageous comments people make on Twitter and about life in general. That\u2019s now bled into our politics.\u201d\n\nIf Trump becomes the nominee, the Republican party will fracture, Rubio said. Political movements based on anger, he said, historically have been \u201cdangerous and disastrous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe job of a true leader is not to stoke people\u2019s anger,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nMany of Trump\u2019s supporters like the candidate because he says what is on his mind, Rubio said, but that isn\u2019t a good attribute for a president.\n\n\u201cThere is an appeal to that; people find it appealing and refreshing that a political candidate says whatever\u2019s on their mind,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident\u2019s cannot say whatever\u2019s on their mind.\u201d\n\nRubio condemned protests that broke out at a Trump rally in Chicago on Friday night, which led to the event\u2019s cancellation. He said the GOP frontrunner is not doing enough to control the campaign\u2019s tone and aggressive words coming from his supporters at such events, and instead is capitalizing on people\u2019s anger for his political gain.\n\n\u201cLeaders cannot say whatever they want, because words have consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a push to win Florida, the Rubio campaign planned stops in Largo, Hudson, Tampa, Lakeland and Pensacola on Saturday. Rubio stopped by Oxford Exchange on West Kennedy Boulevard for a meet-and-greet Saturday afternoon, and encouraged his supporters to get as many people as possible out to the polls Tuesday.\n\nHe didn\u2019t give a formal speech during the roughly half-hour stop, instead posing for photographs with attendees and signing autographs inside the packed coffee house.\n\nRubio told the hundreds of people who came to his morning rally at Beckwith Electric in Largo that the viability of his candidacy always was going to come down to Florida. The state awards 99 delegates in the winner-takes-all contest on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how high the stakes are,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I need your help in this election.\u201d\n\nAs president, Rubio said, he will work for every American \u2014 even those who don\u2019t support him in the election. He joked with the crowd about one attendee who was wearing a Florida State University shirt. As a University of Florida alumnus, Rubio said, he wasn\u2019t going to ask the man to leave \u2014 only to turn his shirt inside-out.\n\nBeckwith Electric gained notoriety when owner Tom Beckwith, a devout Southern Baptist, fought against the Affordable Care Act provision requiring employer-sponsored health-care plans to cover costs of contraceptives. Beckwith was granted an exception to the mandate in 2013.\n\nBefore the rally Rubio told members of the media he plans to support the eventual Republican nominee \u2014 even if it\u2019s Trump \u2014 but that doing so gets harder every day.\n\nkmitchell@tampatrib.com\n\nTwitter: @Kristenreports", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 12 Mar 2016 10:31:29 -0400", "Description": "LARGO \u2014 Florida Sen.
