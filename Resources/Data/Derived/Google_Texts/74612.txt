NEW YORK — A small plane with three people on board made an emergency landing on the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx this afternoon, authorities said.

None of the three were seriously injured, they said.

The plane, a single-engine Piper PA 28, touched down on the expressway about 3:20 p.m. in the area of East 233rd Street, in the borough’s Kingsbridge neighborhood, according to local authorities and the Federal Aviation Administration.

The plane, built in 1966, is registered to a Westchester County, N.Y., man, according to the FAA’s website. An FAA spokeswoman said the plane sustained minor damage.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said the plane was returning to Danbury, Conn., when it experienced engine problems. He said all three people on board were being treated at a Bronx hospital for non-life-threatening injuries

It was not clear why the Piper landed on the highway, which travels north-south, or where the plane had originated or was looking to land. The highway was closed and emergency personnel were on the scene.
