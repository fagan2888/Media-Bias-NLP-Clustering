Truly touching and inspirational photographs of three beautiful little girls have become an internet sensation, touching the hearts of all who see them. The photos have both spread awareness of the hardships that come with childhood cancer and reminded people everywhere of strength that comes from friendship. Photographer Lora Scantling captured the image of the three young girls who all share one thing in common; they have been afflicted with some form of cancer. The youngest, Rylie, at age 3 has just won her battle with stage five kidney cancer. In the center, Rheann, age 6, has brain cancer and Ainsley, age 4, has leukemia, according to The Huffington Post.

The young girls never met before the photo shoot but quickly formed a friendship. “The girls had a lot of fun, I mean it was just very moving watching their bond form,” explained Valeria Franklin, Rheann’s mother, on the televised report. The photographers wanted to bring awareness to the hardships faced by children with cancer every day. “I just wanted something that would just show the bond and the strength, that they weren’t alone,” Scantling told the news team. The message printed on one photograph, “Sometimes strength comes in knowing that you are not alone,” brings to light an important aspect of childhood cancer; loneliness. For children with cancer, most of the short lives can be spent in a hospital. They are unable to properly attend school and forming friendships can be difficult. The photographs will hopefully remind other children in the world that they are not alone in their struggle.

Scantling Photography and Goodger Photography collaborated to take the photographs, with the help of Penelope’s Children’s Boutique and PJ’s Boutique. According to The Huffington Post, the image has gone viral, with thousands of Facebook users already sharing the powerful photograph.
