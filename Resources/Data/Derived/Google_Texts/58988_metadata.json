New cyber stocks are hitting the market on a regular basis, with every technical glitch and hack driving prices higher.\n\nJust last week, an outage at the New York Stock Exchange \u2014 attributed to a software update that went awry \u2014 provided a boost to cyber stocks on the exchanges that remained online.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"These days, every 'glitch' is a suspected cyberattack,\u201d said Ray Rothrock, a Silicon Valley-based venture capitalist who backs a number of cybersecurity companies. \u201cThe cyber stock ups and downs are largely emotional. All the companies are all doing well financially, so it all depends on your speculation.\u201d\n\nFor the last few years, it\u2019s been nearly all ups, as hackers systematically broke into major retailers, banks, insurers and government agencies. In the first half of 2015, major cybersecurity firms have seen their stock skyrocket 30, 40, even 60 percent.\n\nWhile analysts say the trend won\u2019t abate any time soon, some investors are signaling a note of caution that buyers are blindly gobbling up any stock attached to the buzzy term, \u201ccyber.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the public companies today are selling solutions that are old and arguably obsolete, said David Cowan, a cyber-focused investor with Bessemer Venture Partners.\n\nOne of the firms whose stock has benefited from Wall Street\u2019s cyber explosion is Proofpoint. The company\u2019s stock has more than doubled over the last year, and has been creeping towards $70 per share in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cA lot of things have changed fairly radically in the last year in the security landscape which has, of course, led to a much bigger spotlight,\u201d said Ryan Kalember, senior vice president of marketing at Proofpoint.\n\nFollowing a rash of data breaches, Proofpoint\u2019s services suddenly became in high demand, with executives seeking help with security basics like encrypting email, monitoring incoming messages and watching outgoing data.\n\n\u201cMany, many, many more [chief information security officer]-level conversions,\u201d Kalember said. \u201cMany more conversations with government agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd,\u201d he added, \u201cit\u2019s also of course reflected in the stock price.\u201d\n\nThe firm is not alone. Nearly every major data breach in 2015 has translated to a stock surge for publicly traded security companies.\n\nOn June 5, the day after the government revealed the historic hack at the Office of Personnel Management, many high-profile cyber firms saw their share prices spike. Proofpoint jumped over 6 percent that day, one of its biggest single-day bumps of 2015.\n\nEven cyber companies that haven\u2019t yet hit the market are upping the goals for an initial public offering, or IPO.\n\nIn early July, Rapid7, a prominent Boston-based security firm, had to boost its IPO estimate by 38 percent due to high demand.\n\nThe company went public on Friday, pricing its stock at $16 a share, which still beat expectations, according to several reports. It immediately shot up over $26 a share, and finished at $25.25.\n\nTraders are also bundling cyber stocks into what are called exchange-traded funds (ETF). An ETF can package dozens of companies, but trades as one stock.\n\nThe first cyber ETF, which goes by the symbol \u201cHACK,\u201d eclipsed $1 billion in assets within eight months of trading, a rarity on the markets. According to financial news site ETF Trends, roughly half of ETFs introduced each year fail to even reach $10 million in assets. In 2015, HACK is up nearly 20 percent, easily outpacing the overall market.\n\nA second ETF, \u201cCIBR,\u201d hit the market in early July.\n\nWhat has gone largely unnoticed by traders, experts say, is that each cyber company does something different.\n\nEvery time \u201csomething goes wrong,\u201d Kalember said, \u201call of them seem to get a similar boost,\u201d even if a company\u2019s technology wouldn\u2019t have actually helped prevent the latest attack.\n\nThat scares some analysts. Prices can only climb so high before tumbling.\n\n\u201cThere are certainly companies in every part of the tech sector that have valuations that do not really strongly tie to their fundamentals,\u201d Kalember said.\n\nBut Rothrock, who also is CEO of his own security firm, RedSeal, maintained that security companies are responding to \u201chuge market problems.\u201d\n\nEach breach exposes another gaping hole in the country\u2019s digital defenses.\n\n\u201cCyber is not going away,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Rotchrock did warn that the sums public companies are paying to acquire even small private cyber firms are spiraling out of control, which could create a bubble.\n\nCowan believes it\u2019s incumbent on increasingly massive public companies to use their vast \u201cstock currency\u201d to snap up \u201cmore relevant\u201d technologies.\n\nHe pointed to a firm like FireEye, one of the hottest cyber stocks since it debuted in 2013. The company dropped $1 billion to buy Mandiant, a firm that made waves with its groundbreaking 2013 report tracing a wide swath of digital attacks on the U.S. to a 12-story building on the outskirts of Shanghai that housed China\u2019s elite digital soldiers.\n\nWithout such acquisitions, \u201cit will be another four to five years before the most effective solutions, the most effective startups even get to public offerings,\u201d Cowan said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Nearly every major data breach in 2015 has translated to a stock surge.", "description": "Nearly every major data breach in 2015 has translated to a stock surge.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Nearly every major data breach in 2015 has translated to a stock surge.", "title": "Traders cash in on soaring cyber stocks", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/248372-traders-cash-in-on-soaring-cyber-stocks", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/nyse_071315getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/248372-traders-cash-in-on-soaring-cyber-stocks", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-18T10:13-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Dustin Weaver", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-18T10:13:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Business, Technology, Investment, Financial economics,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/248372-traders-cash-in-on-soaring-cyber-stocks", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Nearly every major data breach in 2015 has translated to a stock surge.", "card": "summary", "title": "Traders cash in on soaring cyber stocks"}, "dcterms.title": "Traders cash in on soaring cyber stocks"}, "article_summary": "New cyber stocks are hitting the market on a regular basis, with every technical glitch and hack driving prices higher.\nTraders are also bundling cyber stocks into what are called exchange-traded funds (ETF).\nHe pointed to a firm like FireEye, one of the hottest cyber stocks since it debuted in 2013.\n\u201cThe cyber stock ups and downs are largely emotional.\nThe first cyber ETF, which goes by the symbol \u201cHACK,\u201d eclipsed $1 billion in assets within eight months of trading, a rarity on the markets."}
