Three young women from the Dallas, Texas suburb of Garland died after their sport utility vehicle fell more than 60 feet from an overpass Saturday night.

Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Lonny Haschel said told WFAA that 28-year-old Charqual McMath was driving eastbound on President George Bush Turnpike near US-75 in Plano.

The SUV was in the far right lane and when traffic slowed, the driver swerved left in an attempt to avoid a collision, crossing all eastbound lanes.

McMath then lost control of the 2003 Chevrolet Tahoe, which rolled multiple times and struck another vehicle before falling to a parking lot below.

Three passengers later died at a local hospital. They are identified as Torneki McMath, 19, Myaa Moore, 13, and Tyreana McMath, 12.

McMath was not seriously hurt.

The crash remains under investigation.
