Kimberly Gonzales of Loveland wanted to put all the different calendars and listings of family-friendly events in one place, so she launched Colorado Kids Connection in April.

To welcome the public to see what her free Website is all about, she will hold a ribbon cutting and open house at 4:30 p.m. Tuesday at the Loveland Chamber of Commerce featuring kids activities, food and giveaways. The activities will include a bounce house, face painting and a visit by Spider-Man.

"My whole goal is to be that middle person to make these connections for people in the community," Gonzales said.

Colorado Kids Connection compiles lists of events, activities and classes for families in Northern Colorado, plus resources in the community, things to do at home and reviews on family places, such as restaurants and businesses. Gonzales works with nonprofits, schools, businesses and cultural facilities to help host kids events and plans to create some of her own.

Her website is www.ColoradoKidsConnection.com.
