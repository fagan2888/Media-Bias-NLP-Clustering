Gardner Homes Denver hears the story again and again from buyers who discover his contemporary urban duplexes surrounding the burgeoning Tennyson Street arts/dining district: \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking at LoHi, but it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d Then Pagano walks them a block over to Tennyson, where a half dozen restaurants have opened this year, flanked by galleries, coffee shops, and places like Parisi Trattoria at 44th that have been here for years.\n\n\u201cThen they say, \u2018Hey, this is kind of cool,'\u201d recalls Pagano, as his buyers rapidly warm up to Berkeley \u2013 the neighborhood north of 38th Avenue flanking the corridor of shops and galleries along Tennyson that long ago was a shopping street near Elitch Gardens amusement park.\n\nGraphic designer, Laura Manthey, bought a home from G.J. Gardner Denver a block from Tennyson Street last year. \u201cPicking a restaurant now in Berkeley is less a matter of deciding which ones are really good than of what are you in the mood for?\u201d she said. Her recent favorites include Brazen and chophouse-style Block & Larder, both newly arrived \u2014 along with Hops & Pie, an \u2018artisan pizzeria and craft-brew taproom\u2019 she says is \u2018unbelievably good.\u2019 More arrive monthly \u2013 Royal (burgers), Atomic Cowboy and Denver Biscuit Co, opening this spring.\n\n\u201cPrices have gotten out of reach in LoHi,\u201d Pagano says. He\u2019ll let you tour a G.J. Gardner duplex today at 4364 Stuart Street, and he can put you within two blocks of the action on the walkable north-south streets that flank Tennyson, where looser zoning allows duplexes with 2-car garages from around $609,000 \u2013 well below prices for this kind of space around Highland Square and LoHi. Sales manager Jeff Cook says Gardner has half a dozen homes in the pipeline, headed for completion in 2015. Buyers can still pick personalized color and trim options on those, and can choose even more options on the ones that are furthest from completion (G.J. Gardner Denver will open a design center serving the neighborhood at 4316 Tennyson next month).\n\nPagano also knows other city neighborhoods, some with even lower prices \u2013 including Cole/Whittier where he\u2019ll create a single family home at around $475,000, and south of Highlands in Sloan\u2019s Lake where he can deliver one overlooking the huge park from the $800\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re really a custom builder,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe can help you find a lot in Platt Park, University Park or any city area of Denver.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, G.J.
