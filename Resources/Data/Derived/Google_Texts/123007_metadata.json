Photograph By ADRIAN LAM, Times Colonist\n\nAbout 7 p.m. on a typical night in the Rock Bay Landing shelter, a man with a tattoo under his right eye rolls a marijuana cigarette while a petite woman, sitting with her hands clasped over her knees, stares into the middle of the room with a blank smile. Several men gathered around a television watch a Canucks game. A 25-year-old rolls her wheelchair into the reception area and the little greying chihuahua sitting in her lap elicits plenty of smiles from people who reach down and tousle his matted fur.\n\nListening to some of residents, you get a sense of the tensions that inevitably follow the drug addiction and mental illness of many shelter residents. One woman talks about how earlier in the month someone was wheeled out on a stretcher because of a non-fatal overdose. A few weeks later, an older man had to be removed because he was spitting vitriol and racist comments about First Nations people.\n\nBut there are bright spots, too, including the weekly art classes Patrick Neilson runs and the boisterous games of foosball.\n\n\u201cIt gets to you,\u201d 30-year-old Brianna Shiri-White says about life in the shelter, which provides a bed or a mat, or just a chair, for more than 130 people a night. Some prefer camping in the park instead of staying in the shelter because of the pressure-cooker atmosphere among so many conflicting personalities.\n\nLorraine Perren, a 53-year-old affectionately known as Pinkie, is waiting for a spot in a transition house. She says without the shelter she would have had no place to go. Xan Beauchamp, a budding artist, calls it the only reason he\u2019s not in jail or on the street using drugs.\n\nSuch are the extremes that characterize Rock Bay Landing, which opened three years ago this November \u2014 the extremes of human emotion, between despair and hope, between frustration and numb nothingness.\n\nBut staff work hard to maintain a balance. They provide hot, nutritious meals, clean beds, a willing ear and an open mind. It\u2019s the remarkable patience and positivity they show clients that elevates them beyond staff toward counsellor, mentor, life coach, friend and parent.\n\nShelter management is also trying to make Rock Bay Landing more than just a place for the homeless to use on a revolving-door basis, but rather part of a more ambitious integrated strategy to find people housing, help them fight addiction and manage their mental illness.\n\nThe 84-bed purpose-built shelter opened on Nov. 1, 2010, at a cost of $13 million, to replace the old Street Link shelter on Store Street.\n\nThe difference is \u201cnight and day,\u201d says Cool Aid Society\u2019s manager of shelters Don McTavish.\n\nStreet Link, a dank, crowded space filled with yellow artificial light, was about half the size of the 60,000-square-foot facility at 525 Ellice St.\n\n\u201cJust talking about the building, we have light, we have windows,\u201d he says. \u201cThat has a huge impact on people\u2019s attitudes and behaviours and how they are feeling about themselves.\u201d\n\nCool Aid staff at Street Link were trying to cram 100 people into a space designed for 45, and the cracks were showing in the building and on the residents. The shelter\u2019s Chinatown neighbours weren\u2019t happy. High-end furniture store Chintz & Co. would bear the brunt of the problems, with people camping in the bushes and leaving behind needles and refuse.\n\nRock Bay Landing is in an industrial area on Ellice Street but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a constant effort to rein in the illegal activity and fights that inevitably follow drug addiction and mental illness.\n\nPolice calls to the Rock Bay neighbourhood, bounded by Garbally Road, Douglas Street, Hillside Avenue and Turner Street, are up 55 per cent \u2014 1,054 calls between January and October 2013 compared to 678 calls in the same period in 2012.\n\nIn fact, this past September and October saw the highest number of calls for police service in the last two years, with 149 and 150 calls in September and October, respectively.\n\nThe most common calls were for an \u201cunwanted person,\u201d which more than doubled to 230 so far this year from 101 in 2012. The second most common call was for police needed to assist fire or ambulance such as a medical call or traffic collision which jumped to 115 from 74.\n\nMcTavish says he thinks the spike is driven by people who weren\u2019t \u201cusing our services in the way we had intended.\u201d\n\nThe aim was never for it to be a \u201cone-off service,\u201d where people grab a meal and a bathroom break, stay for awhile and then go back to the \u201cchaos\u201d of being homeless, McTavish says.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to draw people from town in this direction if they were going to come and stay for an entire suite of service. So let us get you a bed, then we can provide three meals a day, then we can get to know you a bit and see what else we can do to help and actively, proactively do that kind of work so that we can help someone stabilize their lives a bit, and not just be a drop-in.\u201d\n\nThe shelter will bar people from the facility, and from the block, if they\u2019re violent or consistently break the rules around drug use. Victoria police Const. David Bratzer, the community officer assigned to the shelter, helps enforce those bans and also communicates with businesses in the area to make sure the shelter is living up to the good neighbour agreement.\n\nBratzer and McTavish said they try hard to be responsive from any concerns from their neighbours which includes a day care, a church and several family-owned businesses.\n\nChristine Kenwood, acting executive director of the Single Parents Resource Centre, located half a block from the shelter on Gorge Road East, said the centre has had some problems with needles and garbage around its property. But Kenwood said Rock Bay Landing\u2019s clean team walks around the neighbourhood daily collecting needles and any other garbage.\n\nThe shelter has eight client-service workers who work individually with longer-term residents on a plan for their recovery. They\u2019ll accompany them to medical appointments, addiction groups, parole meetings.\n\nBeauchamp, who lives in one of the 23 long-term transition rooms on the fifth floor, is trying to move past the cycle of crime and addiction. He eventually wants to get a job and find a place of his own.\n\nHe says his client-service worker, Jesse Morrison, is literally a lifesaver.\n\n\u201cHe really helped me to see my personal value a lot more. I\u2019m no longer a criminal. I\u2019m on the methadone program, so I\u2019ll be ready for work in six months,\u201d Beauchamp says.\n\n\u201cHe can totally bust you. He\u2019s got this psychic ability to know if you\u2019re screwing up. He puts out this energy that makes you feel like change is easy, it\u2019s not as scary.\u201d\n\nMorrison said staff try and help clients get on waiting lists for affordable housing, set up tenancy education sessions to help people become better renters.\n\nSome clients, especially those trying to overcome addiction, complain the shelter isn\u2019t strict enough about restricting drug use under its roof.\n\nShiri-White, who doesn\u2019t use hard drugs, says she\u2019s sick of seeing people shoot needles into their necks in the main bathroom. She says complaints about one of her roommates smoking crack in their room fell on deaf ears.\n\nMcTavish admits it\u2019s difficult being all things to all people. He says an ideal situation would be several small shelters scattered around Greater Victoria that cater to different populations \u2014 young people here, old people there, a shelter for severe addicts here, one for people in transition there.\n\nThe shelter follows a harm-reduction strategy, \u201cwhich means we have supplies available from toothbrushes to Band-Aids to sharps to pipes,\u201d he says.\n\nOne Rock Bay Landing resident, Eric Tate, says if he had to design the shelter, he\u2019d have a dry side for recovering addicts and a wet side with a safe-injection site staffed by nurses.\n\nAnother resident, John Stitt, who has lived in Rock Bay Landing on and off since it opened, says much of the tension at the shelter is caused by mentally ill people who self-medicate with drugs after they fall through the cracks of the health system.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of mental illness that is not being dealt with in the hospitals, that it\u2019s being dealt with with the drugs, which is magnifying it,\u201d says Stitt, an addict who says he bounced back and forth from being a banker\u2019s son growing up in an upper-class home to a juvenile delinquent who broke into the social services office to get the file about his biological mother. Stitt says the first few years of his life were in a foster home, where he was abused, which tainted the rest of his life, even as his adoptive parents showered him with love, money and attention.\n\nHe says the drugs on the street are even more potent and dangerous, as predatory dealers try to cut them with potentially lethal ingredients to increase their profit.\n\n\u201cI have witnessed a huge shift in the drugs being used, and how they\u2019re being used,\u201d Stitt says.\n\nRev. Al Tysick, former executive director of Our Place Society, sees many of the Rock Bay clients on a daily basis as he does his morning walks around the downtown delivering coffee and cigarettes to the homeless.\n\nTysick runs the Dandelion Society, which focuses on the most difficult segment of the homeless population \u2014 often those who are banned from the shelters because of violence or aggression.\n\nTysick says when you\u2019re running a shelter for the most vulnerable in society, there will always be success stories and failures. The \u201cying and the yang\u201d as he calls it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not running a convent or a library, we\u2019re running a shelter. Street people come in and to think they\u2019re not going to bring their street issues with them is ridiculous,\u201d Tysick says.\n\n\u201c[Rock Bay Landing] is serving people well and with dignity. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind we\u2019re a better city because of it.\u201d\n\nkderosa@timescolonist.com\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Times Colonist", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 7 p.m. on a typical night in the Rock Bay Landing shelter, a man with a tattoo under his right eye rolls a marijuana cigarette while a petite woman, sitting with her hands clasped over her . . .", "title": "Rock Bay Landing shelter provides refuge for homeless", "og": {"site_name": "Times Colonist", "description": "About 7 p.m. on a typical night in the Rock Bay Landing shelter, a man with a tattoo under his right eye rolls a marijuana cigarette while a petite woman, sitting with her hands clasped over her . . .", "title": "Rock Bay Landing shelter provides refuge for homeless", "url": "http://www.timescolonist.com/rock-bay-landing-shelter-provides-refuge-for-homeless-1.751087", "image": "http://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.751084.1386604182!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/vka-rock-bay-0299-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "About 7 p.m. on a typical night in the Rock Bay Landing shelter, a man with a tattoo under his right eye rolls a marijuana cigarette while a petite woman, sitting with her hands clasped over her . . .", "creator": "@katiemderosa", "image": "http://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.751084.1386604182!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/vka-rock-bay-0299-jpg.jpg", "title": "Rock Bay Landing shelter provides refuge for homeless", "site": "@timescolonist", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Katie DeRosa", "robots": "NOODP", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 589634334411994}, "msvalidate.01": "B35552358D0685310DF5A3DE206352FA", "MobileOptimized": 320, "DC.creator": "Katie DeRosa", "keywords": "Times Colonist, Victoria, BC, local news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/timescolonist"}, "DC.title": "Rock Bay Landing shelter provides refuge for homeless", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Times Colonist, Victoria, BC, local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3eca\"", "article_summary": "Sherri-Lynn Crocker gives her dog, Tre, a hug in her room at Rock Bay Landing in Victoria.\n\u201c[Rock Bay Landing] is serving people well and with dignity.\nSuch are the extremes that characterize Rock Bay Landing, which opened three years ago this November \u2014 the extremes of human emotion, between despair and hope, between frustration and numb nothingness.\nBut Kenwood said Rock Bay Landing\u2019s clean team walks around the neighbourhood daily collecting needles and any other garbage.\nOne Rock Bay Landing resident, Eric Tate, says if he had to design the shelter, he\u2019d have a dry side for recovering addicts and a wet side with a safe-injection site staffed by nurses."}
