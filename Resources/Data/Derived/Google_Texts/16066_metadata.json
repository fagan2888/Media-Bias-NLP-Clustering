It marks its second fundraise this year, having raised $4 million in July, according to Technically Philly.\n\nThe company provides its plan decision support products through collaborations with retail pharmacies, payers, self-insured employers, exchanges and brokers. For individuals picking a health plan, it uses predictive analytics to come up with options based on answers to questions covering projected costs, risk tolerance, lifestyle preferences and behavioral patterns. Another tool geared to Human Resources professionals seeks to optimize subsidies that companies provide employees using specific goals such as minimizing costs or improving employee welfare. It also provides consulting services to its clients.\n\nIt claims that its decision support tools can help save customers 20 percent on their total healthcare spending by helping them make better choices.\n\nAlthough Picwell has been around since 2012, many companies have moved into this space. With the Affordable Care Act requiring individuals to buy insurance or face fines, entrepreneurs see an opportunity to provide a way to guide people who are unaccustomed to navigating health insurance plans or making tough choices about the advantages and disadvantages of one plan over another.\n\nAmong its venture investors are MassMutual Ventures, which led a financing round in July, and Osage University Partners. Some of its angel investors come from Tenet Healthcare and Humana, specifically:\n\nTrevor Fetter, the chairman and CEO of Tenet Healthcare;\n\nPaul Kusserow, CEO of Amedisys, and former chief strategy officer of Humana and senior vice president of corporate strategy and ventures of Tenet Healthcare; and\n\nBruce Perkins, Humana\u2019s former president of health and well-being services.\n\nSome of the other startups seeking to carve a niche in the area of health insurance literacy and steering consumers to make smarter insurance decisions include Stride Health, Sherpaa, Lumity, and HoneyInsured.\n\nPhoto: Big Stock Photo", "article_metadata": {"description": "The company's venture backers for a previous funding round include include MassMutual Ventures and Osage University Partners.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The company's venture backers for a previous funding round include include MassMutual Ventures and Osage University Partners.", "title": "Picwell raises $3M as interest in health insurance decision support picks up steam", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-The-words-What-Now-asking-the-33761060-e1453793765473.jpg", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/12/health-insurance-decision-support/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/bigstock-The-words-What-Now-asking-the-33761060-e1453793765473.jpg", "description": "The company's venture backers for a previous funding round include include MassMutual Ventures and Osage University Partners.", "card": "summary", "title": "Picwell raises $3M as interest in health insurance decision support picks up steam - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Startups", "published_time": "2015-12-29T11:47:36-04:00"}, "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,health IT, payers, Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Picwell, Startups, , MedCity News", "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Some of the other startups seeking to carve a niche in the area of health insurance literacy and steering consumers to make smarter insurance decisions include Stride Health, Sherpaa, Lumity, and HoneyInsured.\nThe company provides its plan decision support products through collaborations with retail pharmacies, payers, self-insured employers, exchanges and brokers.\nFor individuals picking a health plan, it uses predictive analytics to come up with options based on answers to questions covering projected costs, risk tolerance, lifestyle preferences and behavioral patterns.\nPicwell, a healthcare startup that seeks to guide customers to the most appropriate health insurance options using predictive analytics, has raised $3 million, according to a Form D filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nIt claims that its decision support tools can help save customers 20 percent on their total healthcare spending by helping them make better choices."}
