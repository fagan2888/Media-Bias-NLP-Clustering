Rand Paul, R-Ky., told Politico that the GOP could win one third of the black vote in 2016 by promoting \u201ccriminal-justice reform, school choice and economic empowerment.\u201d\n\nIn a phone interview with Politico, Paul said:\n\nIf Republicans have a clue and do this and go out and ask every African-American for their vote, I think we can transform an election in one cycle. That doesn\u2019t mean that we get to a majority of African-American votes in one cycle, but I think there is fully a third of the African-American vote that is open to much of the message, because much of what the Democrats has offered hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nPaul told Politico that his meetings with African-Americans have been productive:\n\nAs I travel and I go and meet with African-American leaders \u2014 they may not be ready to embrace a Republican yet, but they say that they\u2019re very happy that we\u2019re competing for their vote. And they often tell me, \u2018You know what? I haven\u2019t seen my Democrat representative in a while.\u2019\n\nPaul added that he did not want to \u201climit\u201d the GOP to a third of the vote: \u201cThe reason I use the number \u2018a third,\u2019 is that when you do surveys of African-American voters, a third of them are conservative on a preponderance of the issues. So, there is upside potential.\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with CNN, Paul called the GOP\u2019s failure to reach out to African Americans \u201cthe biggest mistake we\u2019ve made.\u201d Paul has recently met with African-American leaders in Ferguson, Mo., and students at historically black colleges.\n\nExit polls indicate that former Mass. Gov. Mitt Romney won only 6 percent of the African-American vote in 2012.\n\nPaul, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, was recently pictured on the cover of TIME magazine where he was called \u201cThe Most Interesting Man in Politics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
