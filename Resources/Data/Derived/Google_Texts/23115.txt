A Pasco County man was shot to death in the parking lot of a Hudson strip club early today and deputies said they are searching for three or four suspects who fled the scene.

Deputies responded to a call about 2 a.m. to Calendar Girls, 16309 U.S. 19, the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office said.

Deputies identified the deceased at 24-year-old Pierre Pickett, whose last known address was 5575 Brown St., Zephyrhills.

According to deputies, Pickett got into an argument with his girlfriend at the club and unknown people intervened before he was shot in the parking lot.

Deputies said they are searching for three or four male suspects who left in a black, four-door sedan with chrome wheels.

This evening, deputies released a surveillance video from outside the club, hoping to generate tips from the public.

Anyone with information was asked to contact the sheriff’s office tip line at 1-800-706-2488.
