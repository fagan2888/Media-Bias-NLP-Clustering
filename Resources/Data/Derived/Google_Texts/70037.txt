On Friday, the Crestview Police Departmentâ€™s Special Enforcement Team executed a narcotics search warrant to a home on Panama Drive. That search warrant led to a drug bust, and now two people have been arrested.

Reports say, 32-year-old Gregory Foss and 36-year-old Erica Hughes were arrested on a number of charges including, trafficking in Amphetamine, unlawful possession of listed chemicals and five counts of possession of a controlled substance.
