Many Americans are already acutely aware that there are still a few big issues hamstringing the economy, namely wage growth and the swelling ranks of the long-term unemployed, but it turns out there has been another problem brewing for some time now, and it may lead to further complications down the road.\n\nAccording to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a huge number of America\u2019s jobs \u2014 we\u2019re talking as many as 40% \u2014 are \u201ccontingent\u201d jobs. That means that those jobs are not particularly secure, and are made up of positions that require employees to work on contracts, on-call, or as independent contractors.\n\nThese jobs are not only less secure than full-time positions, but they also come with limited benefits including subpar healthcare, sick days, and retirement plans. Those missed benefits can be problematic for many workers, but it\u2019s the general lack of job security that can really be stressful. As companies have downsized and worked toward building leaner organizational structures following the economic meltdown from the Great Recession, the number of contingent workers has grown greatly.\n\n\u201cContingent employment remains an important concept for understanding the dynamics of the labor market,\u201d the GAO report reads. \u201cOur own work suggests that many of these contingent workers receive lower wages and benefits than workers in standard employment arrangements. Many questions remain as to whether contingent employment and alternative work arrangements are growing or evolving, about the impact of the recent recession and recovery on this segment of the labor force, and about the longer term implications of contingent employment arrangements for workers, employers, income equality, and economic growth.\u201d\n\nThis is an issue that has somewhat flown under the radar and been hidden by the improvement shown in traditional economic indicators, notably the unemployment rate. These contingent jobs do get people back to work and earning paychecks, but these are positions that are shaky at best in terms of security. What Americans need, and have been clamoring for, are good, well-paying jobs that will allow the middle class to flourish and return to a healthy state. But what we\u2019ve seen instead is the spread of the contingent workforce. Part-time work has taken off at unprecedented rates, and temp jobs are up 57% over the past five years. The growth in these types of work has helped bolster the unemployment rate and get America\u2019s economic engine running again, but that has left the middle class on shaky ground.\n\nWith as much as 40% of the American workforce being a part of that contingent workforce, another large economic shudder could lead to some huge problems as companies can quickly and more efficiently shed labor costs. If we were to experience another recession in the near term (which could very well happen), it\u2019s conceivable that as much as 40% of the American workforce, the contingency workforce, could be very quickly out of work.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that these are all bad jobs, and that people don\u2019t want them. It\u2019s more of a detraction from what we have traditionally thought of as important to sustaining a vibrant middle class. There are actually plenty of workers, particularly young people, as a recent Slate article explains, that are perfectly happy working as part of the \u2018contingency.\u2019\n\nWhat young workers find particularly enticing about contingency jobs is that they are far more flexible than traditional full-time gigs, and allow for them easily jump from one job to the next. One important thing to note here is that these workers, many in their early 20s, are also benefiting in a large way from the Affordable Care Act. That is, they can remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance until the age of 26, so there\u2019s no need to find a job that supplies them with that perk.\n\nWhile younger workers may enjoy their stint as independent contractors and freelance workers, people who need full-time jobs with benefits and reasonable pay still have plenty of reason to be worried about the GAO\u2019s findings. But what the GAO report could really be pointing at is something bigger \u2014 perhaps a whole new economic makeup.\n\nIf companies value fluidity and flexibility, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to look for in employees. If that\u2019s the case, we may need to rethink compensation, benefits, and perks packages as a society, not just for a portion of the workers in the labor market.\n\nFollow Sam on Twitter @Sliceofginger\n\nMore from Business Cheat Sheet:", "article_metadata": {"syndication-source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/the-one-big-economic-problem-that-no-one-is-talking-about.html/", "sailthru.author": "samuel-becker", "news_keywords": "jobs,Employment,unemployment rate,economic growth,Government Accountability Office,", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "og": {"site_name": "The Cheat Sheet", "description": "Though Americans have gotten back to work as the economy has found its footing, a new problem looms: these jobs aren't secure.", "title": "The One Big Economic Problem That No One Is Talking About", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/under-construction-concept-640x426.jpg", "url": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/business/the-one-big-economic-problem-that-no-one-is-talking-about.html/?a=viewall", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though Americans have gotten back to work as the economy has found its footing, a new problem looms: these jobs aren't secure.", "creator": "@sliceofginger", "image": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/under-construction-concept-640x426.jpg", "title": "The One Big Economic Problem That No One Is Talking About", "site": "@cheatsheet", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cheat Sheet", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-27T16:15:04-04:00", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091, "app_id": 354932851235506}, "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/under-construction-concept-150x100.jpg", "item-category": "Business News", "sailthru.tags": "business,economy,business-news,jobs,employment,unemployment-rate", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-27 16:15:04", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wallstcheatsheet", "section": "Business", "tag": "unemployment rate", "published_time": "2015-05-27T16:15:04-04:00"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/under-construction-concept.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Though Americans have gotten back to work as the economy has found its footing, a new problem looms: these jobs aren't secure."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22bc\"", "article_summary": "According to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a huge number of America\u2019s jobs \u2014 we\u2019re talking as many as 40% \u2014 are \u201ccontingent\u201d jobs.\nAs companies have downsized and worked toward building leaner organizational structures following the economic meltdown from the Great Recession, the number of contingent workers has grown greatly.\n\u201cContingent employment remains an important concept for understanding the dynamics of the labor market,\u201d the GAO report reads.\nBut what we\u2019ve seen instead is the spread of the contingent workforce.\n\u201cOur own work suggests that many of these contingent workers receive lower wages and benefits than workers in standard employment arrangements."}
