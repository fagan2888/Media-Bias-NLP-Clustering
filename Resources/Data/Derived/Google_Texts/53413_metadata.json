Brock, the chairwoman of the national board of directors for the N.A.A.C.P.\n\nIn an interview on Saturday morning, Mr. Brooks said he was \u201cextraordinarily humbled and honored\u201d at being chosen to lead the 105-year-old civil rights organization. He listed voting rights, economic equality and health equity as some of the most pressing civil rights concerns facing the country today.\n\n\u201cClearly there\u2019s much work to be done,\u201d Mr. Brooks said.\n\nMr. Brooks, 53, is an ordained minister and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from Jackson State University, a master of divinity degree from the Boston University School of Theology and a doctoral degree from Yale Law School. Mr. Brooks has served as senior counsel with the Federal Communications Commission and on the transition team for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey in 2010.\n\nHe has been married for more than 20 years, has two children and lives in Annandale, N.J. Mr. Brooks also owns a home in Prince William County in Northern Virginia and said he planned to move to the Washington, D.C., area for his new role. He will be formally introduced to the N.A.A.C.P. membership at the organization\u2019s annual convention in July.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Brock said the N.A.A.C.P. had worked with the Hollins Group of Chicago to conduct a nationwide search for its new leader and had more than 450 candidates before settling on 30 finalists, eight of them women.\n\nBenjamin Todd Jealous, the most recent president and chief executive, stepped down last year. Since then, Lorraine C. Miller has served as the interim president and chief executive. The organization has never had a woman fill the role of president and chief executive permanently, and there were calls to name one after Mr. Jealous\u2019s departure. Ms. Brock remains the highest-ranking woman in the organization.\n\nThe election occurred during a difficult period for the N.A.A.C.P. both internally and externally. Ms. Brock said the organization \u201chas taken proactive steps to improve our financial stability,\u201d including reducing its staff by 7 percent in recent months. \u201cLike all nonprofit organizations, we have experienced the ebb and flow of funding,\u201d she said.\n\nIn an email sent to the staff at the end of April to explain the layoffs, Ms. Miller said the organization was facing \u201csevere budget shortfalls and we need to align the shortfall with cuts.\u201d\n\nThe organization\u2019s Los Angeles branch is also under scrutiny after a decision by the branch\u2019s leadership to honor Donald Sterling, the beleaguered Los Angeles Clippers owner, with a lifetime achievement award this month. Mr. Sterling\u2019s foundations have given the Los Angeles branch at least $45,000 since 2007, records showed. The National Basketball Association banned Mr. Sterling from the league after a recording of racist remarks by Mr. Sterling was made public.\n\nMs. Brock said the organization had \u201cquickly addressed that issue\u201d and rescinded the award to Mr. Sterling. \u201cThe unit is moving forward under new leadership,\u201d she said of the Los Angeles chapter, adding that the organization was instituting new guidelines for selecting award recipients.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140517132607, "twitter": {"description": "The executive board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People elected Cornell William Brooks to lead the 105-year-old civil rights organization.", "title": "Amid Tumult, N.A.A.C.P.
