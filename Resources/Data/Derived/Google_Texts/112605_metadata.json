You had a great night on Tuesday. But remember: You didn\u2019t win it; the Democrats lost it.\n\nThis is not to say that you didn\u2019t show discipline in making the election a referendum on six years of Barack Obama. You exercised adult supervision over the choice of candidates. You didn\u2019t allow yourselves to go down the byways of gender and other identity politics.\n\nIt showed: A gain of probably nine Senate seats, the largest Republican House majority in more than 80 years, and astonishing gubernatorial victories, including Massachusetts, Maryland, and Illinois, the bluest of the blue, giving the lie to the Democrats\u2019 excuse that they lost because the game was played on Republican turf.\n\nThe defeat \u2014 \u201ca massacre,\u201d The Economist called it \u2014 marks the final collapse of Obamaism, a species of left-liberalism so intrusive, so incompetently executed, and ultimately so unpopular that it will be seen as a parenthesis in American political history. Notwithstanding Obama\u2019s awkward denials at his next-day news conference, he himself defined the election when he insisted just last month that \u201cthese [i.e. his] policies are on the ballot \u2014 every single one of them.\u201d\n\nThey were, and America spoke. But it was a negative judgment, not an endorsement of the GOP. The prize for winning is nothing but the opportunity for Republicans to show that they can govern \u2014 the opportunity to seize the national agenda.\n\nFive weeks ago, I suggested a series of initiatives that would be like the 1994 \u201cContract with America,\u201d but this time post facto. It\u2019s not rocket science. Mitch McConnell, the incoming Senate majority leader, and House speaker John Boehner are already at work producing such an agenda.\n\nIt needs to be urgent, determined, and relentless \u2014 say, a bill a week for the first ten weeks. Start with obvious measures that have significant Democratic support, like the Keystone XL pipeline. Another such measure is fast-track trade-negotiation authority, which Harry Reid killed and Obama, like all presidents, wants. Republicans should propose and pass it, thereby giving Obama a victory and demonstrating both bipartisanship and magnanimity (as well as economic good sense).\n\nThen a simple, targeted bill to repatriate the $2 trillion of assets being held by U.S. corporations overseas, a bill to authorize and expedite the export of liquid natural gas and crude oil (the latter banned by an obsolete 1975 law), and a strong border-security bill.\n\nAs for Obamacare, a symbolic abolition that Obama will immediately veto is less important than multiple rapid-fire measures to kill it with a thousand cuts: Repeal of the medical-device tax, repeal of the individual mandate, repeal of the employer mandate, repeal of the coverage mandate (thereby reinstating Obama\u2019s broken promise that \u201cif you like your health-care plan, you can keep it\u201d), and repeal of the federal bailout for insurers on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nIf Obama issues vetoes, fine. Let the Democrats defend them for the next two years.\n\nThen go big and go positive: A sweeping reform of the tax system, both corporate and individual, abolishing loopholes and lowering rates, like the historic 1986 Reagan-O\u2019Neill reform or Obama\u2019s own abandoned Simpson-Bowles commission. And go large: Invite the other side into immediate negotiations with the aim of producing a tax bill by spring.\n\nHow will Obama react? My guess: With the petulance and denial he displayed in his post-election news conference. Moreover, he will try to regain control of the national agenda with executive amnesty for illegal immigrants.\n\nFinal memo to the GOP: That would be naked impeachment bait. Don\u2019t take it. Use the power of the purse to defund it. Pledge immediate repeal if Republicans take the White House in 2017. Denounce it as both unconstitutional and bad policy. But don\u2019t let it overwhelm and overtake the GOP agenda. That\u2019s exactly what Obama wants. It is his only way to regain the initiative.\n\nThe 2014 election has given the GOP the rare opportunity to retroactively redeem its brand. The conventional perception, incessantly repeated by Democrats and the media, is that Washington dysfunction is the work of the Party of No. Expose the real agent of do-nothing. Show that with Harry Reid no longer able to consign House-passed legislation to oblivion, Congress can actually work.\n\nPass legislation. When Obama signs, you\u2019ve shown seriousness and the ability to govern. When he vetoes, you\u2019ve clarified the differences between party philosophies and prepared the ground for 2016.\n\nTuesday\u2019s victory was big.
