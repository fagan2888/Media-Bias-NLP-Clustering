His face lights up in wonder; he sheds the drudgery of his life in the warmth of human connection.\n\nThere\u2019s something magnetic about Julien Arnold\u2019s quintessential performance as Scrooge\u2019s frostbitten clerk that just took hold of my heart the other night when I saw the Citadel\u2019s masterful 15-year-old production of A Christmas Carol again.\n\nLater, under thetutelage of a Ghost of Christmas Present, the old skinflint, whose Bah! Humbug! has a withering rage in James MacDonald\u2019s performance, sees the Cratchits at home. And he\u2019s startled, incredulous, appalled, and then jarred by a redeeming ripple of shame, at their capacity for joy \u2013 and for grief. It was wonderfully set forth, in vivid detail, Thursday night, as A Christmas Carol returned to its seasonal place: no, my little cock robins you won\u2019t see a better Christmas Carol anywhere.\n\nEvery year I see this extraordinary version of Dickens\u2019 great 1843 ghost story; every year I\u2019m struck again by the ingenious theatricality of it, in a magical Victorian pop-up Christmas card (designed by the great Leslie Frankish) opened, and turned by human agency. This time, I noticed, more than ever, the sheer emotional heat generated by the Cratchits \u2013 Mrs. Cratchit (the excellent Kate Ryan) fierce in defence of a man who is temperamentally unable to defend himself; the children protective of a man they suspect might be more innocent than they are.\n\nIt gives depth and an emotional coherence to the redemption narrative of an ossified soul rescued from his own isolation and doom. It\u2019s a story about the possibility of change. The lustre of Tom Wood\u2019s adaptation and Bob Baker\u2019s production is not just its superb stagecraft. So often the story of the flinty Ebenezer turns out to be a showcase for codger-dom, Scrooge as a crusty old guy who\u2019s in a bad mood, and then isn\u2019t, thanks to a dream. Here, in MacDonald\u2019s performance, he\u2019s someone trapped in his own anger. The actor, who inherited the role from Wood, whose keynote was sardonic humour, has made it triumphantly his own.\n\nHe\u2019s an energetically malevolent, exasperated Scrooge, not a Scrooge who\u2019s simply listless, or a gloomy Gus pennypincher. Donald\u2019s Scrooge is vigorously angry, as he stomps through his world. I hear from all kinds of sources that the alternate Scrooge, Glenn Nelson, is excellent too.\n\nIt\u2019s a measure of the attention and care lavished on the production that the role of Fred, Scrooge\u2019s irrepressible nephew, is occupied by John Ullyatt. In Christmas Carol\u2018s world-wide, Fred, as buoyant and charitable as his uncle is not, always makes you smile. He doesn\u2019t often break your heart, the way this actor does when Uncle Scrooge finally arrives at his door on Christmas day.\n\nThe long poetic speech at the top of Act II, as the set opens up in sunlight through stained glass, struck me this time, too. In a duet with the Ghost of Christmas Present, the pastor speaks of the way the spirit of Christmas roams through the world of sailors and miners. I loved it for its strangeness, and for the sense of the world as haunted by human kindness.\n\nThis is a show to make you feel the specialness of the season every year \u2013 \u201cat this time of the rolling year\u201d in Dickens\u2019 memorable line. I wouldn\u2019t want to miss that; that\u2019s why I\u2019ve seen the show 14 of its 15 incarnations. Christmas can now officially begin.\n\nA Christmas Carol runs on the Citadel\u2019s Maclab stage through Dec. 23.
