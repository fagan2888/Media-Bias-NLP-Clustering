Former Democratic congressman Barney Frank has some tough words for President Barack Obama about his handling of Obamacare.

"The rollout was so bad, and I was appalled -- I don't understand how the president could have sat there and not been checking on that on a weekly basis," Frank tells the Huffington Post in a recent interview.

"But frankly, he should never have said as much as he did, that if you like your current health care plan, you can keep it. That wasn't true. And you shouldn't lie to people. And they just lied to people."

Frank told the liberal website, "Any smart political adviser would have said, 'Don't lie to people, because you're gonna get caught up in it and it's gonna have this tsunami that you now have.' â€¦ My political motto, very simple. I have always told the truth, and nothing but the truth. But I don't volunteer the whole truth in every situation."

Frank, who appears liberated to speak his mind now that he's now longer in politics, says here's what Obama should've said: "He should have said, 'Look, in some cases the health care plans that you've got are really inadequate, and in your own interests, we're going to change them.' ... But that's not what he said."
