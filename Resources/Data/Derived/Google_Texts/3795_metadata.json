But the heart of Obamacare is coercion. If Americans fail do what the law\u2019s Democratic authors believe is best, the federal government will punish them, through the progressively higher penalties of the individual mandate, until it hurts more not to buy coverage than it does to give up and purchase it.\n\nBut what if many of those Americans rebel? Even if they know having health insurance is better than not having it, what if they refuse to be forced to buy the kind of coverage dictated by the government \u2014 which may not really meet their needs \u2014 at prices they don\u2019t want to pay? What then?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Obamacare can survive without people wanting to buy it,\u201d Bob Laszewski, the respected health care analyst whose writings on Obamacare have become essential in recent months, told me in an email exchange recently. \u201cHow the hell are you going to enforce a mandate to buy something that people don\u2019t think is valuable enough to buy? If the uninsured don\u2019t start to see value in Obamacare and buy it, is the Democratic solution to fine the heck out of them until it hurts so much they have to buy it? Great political strategy!\u201d\n\nOf course, that\u2019s exactly what the strategy is. Democrats designed the penalty for not having \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d to start low and increase rapidly. For this year, according to a chart prepared by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the penalty is $95 per adult and $47.50 per child. But the penalty cannot rise above $285, or one percent of family income, whichever is higher. (Obamacare uses a measurement called Modified Adjusted Gross Income to determine penalties \u2014 a measure that is usually higher than the Adjusted Gross Income many taxpayers are familiar with.)\n\nIn the second year, the penalty will rise dramatically, to $325 per adult and $162.50 per child, or two percent of family income, whichever is higher. The year after, the penalty will take another big jump, to $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, or 2.5 percent of family income. The only limit on the penalty is that it cannot be higher than the national average premium for a Bronze Plan purchased on the Obamacare exchanges. According to the Congressional Budget Office, that could be as much as $5,000 in 2016. And after that initial increase in the penalty, future penalties will rise according to the cost of living.\n\nBut Democrats in Congress feared public reaction to actually forcing Americans to write a check to the government to cover the penalty. So instead, the Internal Revenue Service, which is charged with enforcing Obamacare, will subtract the penalty from the tax refunds of those Americans who incur the penalty, provided they are due a refund. Otherwise, the IRS will not have a way to collect the money.\n\n\u201cIn the first year, the mandate is useless,\u201d said Laszewski. \u201cOne percent isn\u2019t strong enough. The IRS can\u2019t really collect it anyway from anyone who wants to flaunt it. Then we get to the second and third year. Two percent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016. Now we have real money. The IRS still can\u2019t collect it, but lots of people will still be troubled by it because they won\u2019t like getting nasty letters from the IRS.\u201d\n\nAs Laszewski sees it, the mandate could become extremely unpopular \u2014 it\u2019s already by far the least popular part of Obamacare \u2014 if policies are not what the public wants to buy. Who would want to be forced to buy something he or she doesn\u2019t want? That something is not insurance itself \u2014 it is insurance that is ill-fitting and overpriced. \u201cThe problem is that the government will be hard pressed to collect a fine on something lots of people don\u2019t believe has value,\u201d Laszewski said. \u201cThis is when it will become a huge political albatross. At the core Obamacare is not sustainable, and the mandate/fine is not politically sustainable, if there are lots of middle class people who see Obamacare as a poor value.\u201d\n\nI got in touch with Laszewski after reading an interview he did with the Washington Post\u2019s Ezra Klein in which Laszewski explained that if Obamacare had been designed by businesspeople, it might have had more features to appeal to customers. But it was designed by lawmakers and lobbyists and is something quite different. \u201cThe problem with Obamacare is it\u2019s product driven and not market driven,\u201d Laszewski told Klein. \u201cThey didn\u2019t ask the customer what they wanted. And I think that\u2019s the fundamental problem with Obamacare. It meets the needs of very poor people because you\u2019re giving them health insurance for free. But it doesn\u2019t really meet the needs of healthy people and middle-class people.\u201d\n\nOf course, the individual mandate forces people to buy coverage whether it meets their needs or not. And Laszewski sees a real possibility that it won\u2019t work. If enough dissatisfied Americans simply don\u2019t buy the product, he said, that would create political momentum \u201cto get rid of the mandate/fine \u2014 which is effectively the same thing as getting rid of Obamacare.\u201d And if that happens, the American health system will be in entirely uncharted territory.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "If enough dissatisfied Americans simply don't buy the product, that would create political momentum.", "title": "What is Americans rebel against the Obamacare mandate?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/141960558-480x320.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/01/13/what-is-americans-rebel-against-the-obamacare-mandate/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "If enough dissatisfied Americans simply don't buy the product, that would create political momentum.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/141960558-480x320.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "If enough dissatisfied Americans simply don't buy the product, that would create political momentum."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc965b\"", "article_summary": "HealthcareThe Obama administration is trying to persuade millions of uninterested, or perhaps reluctant, Americans to purchase health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges.\n\u201cHow the hell are you going to enforce a mandate to buy something that people don\u2019t think is valuable enough to buy?\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Obamacare can survive without people wanting to buy it,\u201d Bob Laszewski, the respected health care analyst whose writings on Obamacare have become essential in recent months, told me in an email exchange recently.\nBut what if many of those Americans rebel?\nBut Democrats in Congress feared public reaction to actually forcing Americans to write a check to the government to cover the penalty."}
