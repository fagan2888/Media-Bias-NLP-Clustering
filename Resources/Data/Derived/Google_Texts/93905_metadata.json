We were talking politics, and he suddenly told me: \u201cDonald Trump would be a great president.\u201d I almost spit up my drink as he explained himself. \u201cDamn Reagan and his big tent, drawing in all of the evangelicals. They\u2019ve hijacked the party.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Trump?\u201d I asked. The birther? With the bankrupt casinos? Who teases a presidential run every four years and makes a mockery of the electoral process?\n\n\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d my friend replied. \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who isn\u2019t a part-time preacher, and it\u2019s about time we had a businessman as president. A businessman would do this country a hell of a lot of good.\u201d\n\nTurns out that Trump has more support than you might imagine in the Iowa business community. Some might say that\u2019s a sign that nothing should start in Iowa, let alone the race for the world\u2019s most powerful office. Early last month, I received an invitation to visit with Trump on his private jet, during a highly publicized visit to the Hawkeye State. I thought it might be fun to see whether this bizarre idea seemed a little less weird when viewed from close-up.\n\nScuttling across the tarmac toward what Trump claims is a $100 million Boeing 757, which had just landed at the Des Moines Airport, I asked a respected print journalist walking beside me if the situation seemed at all bizarre to him.\n\n\u201cBeen on a lot of candidate buses before,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut never a personal airplane.\u201d\n\nWe were flanked front and back by TSA agents and Trump staffers as we were escorted to the plane. The sky was dark. There was a light drizzle. We were penned in.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re behaving sort of like sheep,\u201d I observed.\n\nHe smiled and nodded.\n\nWe climbed the aircraft steps, and I scraped my shoes on the ladder before I entered the plane, worried that I might be tracking mud. It felt like the discourteous kind of thing he might tweet about afterward. It was a good precaution, as I was soon to learn.\n\nOnce inside, we were greeted warmly by the same pleasant woman who apparently greets all of the guests on \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d On television she cheerily intones: \u201cMr. Trump will see you now.\u201d But she didn\u2019t use the line on us, and I wondered if, like her boss, even she holds the media in lower regard than a reality TV contestant.\n\nBehind her was Trump himself, who welcomed us, shaking hands before moving to the front of the cabin to take questions. The plane looked opulent, reportedly with a marble bathroom and 24-carat gold seat belt buckles, as well as a tropical wood inlaid table, and carpet fibers woven with fleece taken from yearling Peruvian llamas. (OK, those last two things were made up.)\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why rulers have for many millennia built pyramids, great temples, coliseums and the like to impress the masses. The truth is, we\u2019re easily impressed. And on Trump\u2019s plane, we especially were. It was difficult not to be, in much the same way that a toddler might fixate on a brightly colored object.\n\nAnd so, Trump suffered the media with the same brand of tolerance as a tired new parent, as we all started jostling for position with cameras and microphones in the confined space. It\u2019s a big plane. But a supposedly $100 million plane is still just a plane. Every time the cameras and boom mics approached the ceiling or the woodwork, Trump let out a weary sigh.\n\n\u201cWatch\u2026 watch\u2026. watch your ceiling,\u201d urged Trump. \u201cIf you hurt the ceiling you\u2019re going to make it a very expensive day\u2026\u201d\n\nOne camera touched the ceiling gently. \u201cOof,\u201d groaned a Trump staffer. \u201cCareful with that on the ceiling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am being careful,\u201d a short reporter shot back, a selfie stick extended toward Trump over the backs of other reporters. Trump eyed it hovering like it was a potentially rabid bat.\n\nEventually, the requisite questions about his recently launched exploratory committee began. \u201cIt\u2019s going really, really well, it\u2019s going amazingly well,\u201d he said, referring to some poll that had him in \u201ceither third or fourth place,\u201d even though, of course, he isn\u2019t even officially running.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Last month, I got a peek at Trump's 757 during a highly publicized trip to Iowa.
