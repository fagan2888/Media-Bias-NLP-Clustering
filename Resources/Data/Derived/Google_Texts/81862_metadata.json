He murdered four Jewish men \u2013 Yoav Hattab, Philippe Braham, Yohan Cohen and Francois-Michel Saada \u2013 in a seven-hour standoff before being killed by police.\n\nToday ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl asked White House press secretary Josh Earnest about Obama\u2019s comment, saying:\n\nThis was not a random shooting of a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris. This was an attack on a kosher deli. Does the president have any doubt that those terrorists attacked that deli because there would be Jews in that deli?\n\n\u201cIt is clear from the terrorists and the writings that they put out afterward what their motivation was,\u201d said Earnest. \u201cThe adverb that the president chose was used to indicate that the individuals who were killed in that terrible, tragic incident were killed not because of who they were but because of where they randomly happened to be.\u201d\n\nEarnest added that the victims \u201cwere not targeted by name.\u201d\n\nWhen Karl pressed Earnest to say that the victims were targeted for their faith, Earnest responded that \u201cthere were people other than just Jews who were in that deli.\u201d\n\nWhen Karl continued to press whether there was doubt the president believes the victims were targeted for their faith, Earnest replied, \u201cI answered the question once. No.\u201d\n\nIn a tweet later today, Earnest clarified:\n\nOur view has not changed. Terror attack at Paris Kosher market was motivated by anti-Semitism. POTUS didn\u2019t intend to suggest otherwise. \u2014 Josh Earnest (@PressSec) February 10, 2015\n\nIn a Tuesday briefing with reporters, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki declined to say what the motives for the attack were, and deferred to French authorities. After the press briefing, Psaki offered clarification on her statement in a tweet.\n\nWe have always been clear that the attack on the kosher grocery store was an anti-semitic attack that took the lives of innocent people. \u2014 Jen Psaki (@statedeptspox) February 10, 2015\n\nIn a speech following the attack, French President Francois Hollande said through an interpreter that the attack on the kosher deli was \u201cobviously a horrible, anti-Semitic act that was committed.\u201d\n\nNile Gardiner, the director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Signal that the remarks of the president and the White House were \u201cabsolutely outrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous to believe that terrorists randomly select targets,\u201d said Gardiner. \u201cThere is no doubt that the victims of the terrorist attack were specifically selected because of their religion.\u201d\n\nGardiner said that Islamists in France seek to \u201cdrive Jews out\u201d of the country in an effort to establish \u201can Islamic Caliphate in Europe.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets, Yair Rosenberg, a writer at Tablet Magazine, said that the president simply \u201cmisspoke to Vox\u201d and that the administration was turning a \u201cminor misstatement into an actual fiasco.\u201d\n\nSince Obama\u2019s team is turning a minor misstatement on the Paris shooting into an actual fiasco, a few thoughts on what actually happened: \u2014 Yair Rosenberg (@Yair_Rosenberg) February 10, 2015\n\n1. Obama has called the Paris kosher market attack \u201canti-Semitic,\u201d as did Samantha Power. He still thinks that. He just misspoke to Vox. \u2014 Yair Rosenberg (@Yair_Rosenberg) February 10, 2015\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, the national correspondent at The Atlantic, tweeted that the Obama administration has been clear in its condemnation of anti-Semitism \u201cover time.\u201d\n\nFWIW, the Obama Administration has been pretty clear in its condemnations of European anti-Semitism over time. \u2014 Jeffrey Goldberg (@JeffreyGoldberg) February 10, 2015\n\nIn January, the State Department called the attack \u201canti-Semitic\u201d in a statement to the Jerusalem Post.\n\n\u201cWe condemn in the strongest terms ?yesterday\u2019s cowardly anti-Semitic assault against the innocent people in the kosher supermarket,\u201d Chanan Weissman, a spokesman for the State Department, told the Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House explains the president's remarks regarding the attack on the Kosher deli in Paris.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The White House explains the president's remarks regarding the attack on the Kosher deli in Paris.", "title": "White House Clarifies Obama\u2019s Comments on Paris Kosher Deli Attack", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150210_Random.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-10T18:53:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/16OCahV"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The White House explains the president's remarks regarding the attack on the Kosher deli in Paris.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150210_Random.jpg"}, "title": "White House Clarifies Obama\u2019s Comments on Paris Kosher Deli Attack", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2015-02-10T18:50:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-10T18:53:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obama, Josh Earnest, Amedy Coulibaly, Charlie Hebdo, Paris attack"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe61\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Jeffrey Goldberg (@JeffreyGoldberg) February 10, 2015In January, the State Department called the attack \u201canti-Semitic\u201d in a statement to the Jerusalem Post.\nObama has called the Paris kosher market attack \u201canti-Semitic,\u201d as did Samantha Power.\nThis was an attack on a kosher deli.\nWe have always been clear that the attack on the kosher grocery store was an anti-semitic attack that took the lives of innocent people.\nTerror attack at Paris Kosher market was motivated by anti-Semitism."}
