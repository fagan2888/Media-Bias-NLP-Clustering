The prime minister also visited the Australian base in the United Arab Emirates where he was briefed by the chief of the ADF, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin.\n\nTurnbull stopped over in Iraq on the way to his first official visit to the United States, where his talks with Barack Obama are set to be dominated by coalition efforts against Isis and other security issues.\n\nWhile Australia has formally declined a US request to increase its military commitment beyond its current level, Turnbull used his meetings in Iraq to emphasise the significant size of the existing involvement. He said the contribution to coalition forces on the ground in Iraq remained second only to that of the US.\n\nThe prime minister told al-Abadi Australia was \u201cstrongly committed to helping Iraq in its fight against Daesh\u201d, another term for Isis.\n\n\u201cDaesh is a threat to all of us and we need to continue to work together to defeat these terrorists,\u201d he said in remarks to the media after their meeting.\n\n\u201cBut this war against Daesh requires, for victory, more than military means. It is also in many respects a war of ideas. I have discussed with you, prime minister, your efforts to promote national unity and reconciliation, and that is absolutely critical to countering this extremism now and for the longer term.\n\n\u201cYou fill us with confidence that victory against Daesh in Iraq is within sight, within reach. You exude confidence, prime minister, and that is very encouraging, but the victory must be one that endures. For it to endure there must be genuine reconciliation between the various parties in Iraq.\u201d\n\nRelated: Iraqi PM visits Ramadi after declaring Isis will be 'terminated' in 2016\n\nTurnbull added there needed to be \u201ca solution, an outcome, a reconciliation in Syria\u201d in order to maintain peace in Iraq. He invited al-Abadi to visit Australia.\n\nAbout 780 ADF personnel are in the Middle East for the anti-Isis operation, including 400 in the air task group that is carrying out airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, 300 in the Taji group working with New Zealand on a training mission, and 80 in the special operations task group \u201cadvising and assisting\u201d Iraqi security forces.\n\nTurnbull, answering questions from ADF personnel at the Taji military complex, said the Iraqi government had not asked for an extra military commitment from Australian, but \u201cthe nature of our commitment may evolve over time\u201d.\n\nThe prime minister also defended his handling of the US request, which he said comprised \u201ca form letter to 40 countries which basically was in exactly the same terms\u201d. Turnbull said the Australian government judged its existing commitment to be substantial given the ADF\u2019s size and the country\u2019s distance from the theatre.\n\nTurnbull urged other countries, particularly European countries, to \u201cstep up and make a greater contribution to it\u201d.\n\nOn his visit to Taji, Turnbull said the ADF personnel were winning plaudits for their \u201cgreat professionalism, great commitment and great success\u201d.\n\nHe told the troops al-Abadi had \u201cspent a long time, much of the meeting, talking about the great work you\u2019re doing, how much he appreciated it, and the absolutely critical role in that success in retaking Ramadi \u2013 which of course has been so important not just at a tactical level but it\u2019s been an enormous strategic lift for the Iraqi government\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given them an enormous boost to their morale, and they certainly feel that they couldn\u2019t have done it without you, so hats off, you have done a great job, it\u2019s terrific,\u201d Turnbull said.\n\nIn remarks at Camp Baird in the UAE, Turnbull said the ADF was \u201cdoing vitally important work, not just for Iraq, not just for the region, but for the whole world\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe have a global struggle against terrorism and you are in the front line,\u201d he said.\n\nTurnbull\u2019s approach to the fight against terrorism has raised the ire of some members of his Liberal party allied to the former prime minister Tony Abbott, including the former defence minister Kevin Andrews who said Australia should have favourably considered the US request to contribute more to the military efforts.\n\nAndrews, who has previously argued ground forces would be needed to defeat Isis, repeated his views in a radio interview on Sunday but said he did not think Turnbull\u2019s rejection of the request would affect Australia\u2019s relationship with the US.\n\n\u201cWe have a long-term relationship with Washington and can I say these are matters of judgment,\u201d Andrews told 3AW.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying this in any black-and-white, absolute sense. It\u2019s a matter of judgment but my opinion is that where a reasonable requests comes from the US if we\u2019re capable of meeting it then we should give serious consideration to doing so because we\u2019ve basically got to win this war.\u201d\n\nAndrews said he had not spoken to the prime minister since airing his opinions and said the disagreement was \u201cnot a personality issue for me\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "description": "Prime minister travels to Camp Taji near Baghdad to personally thank Australian defence force personnel for their work in Iraq", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Daniel Hurst", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Prime minister travels to Camp Taji near Baghdad to personally thank Australian defence force personnel for their work in Iraq", "title": "Iraq visit: Malcolm Turnbull calls for reconciliation to secure lasting peace", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/17/iraq-visit-malcolm-turnbull-calls-for-reconciliation-to-secure-lasting-peace", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cf79acd6632b11752acf9b094f4ace1f53166bc/622_369_4525_2715/master/4525.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=ab80fccfb3fcaad63963a337208ef173", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@guardian", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2016/jan/17/iraq-visit-malcolm-turnbull-calls-for-reconciliation-to-secure-lasting-peace?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jan/17/iraq-visit-malcolm-turnbull-calls-for-reconciliation-to-secure-lasting-peace", "iphone": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2016/jan/17/iraq-visit-malcolm-turnbull-calls-for-reconciliation-to-secure-lasting-peace?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/8cf79acd6632b11752acf9b094f4ace1f53166bc/622_369_4525_2715/master/4525.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@danielhurstbne"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://australia-news/2016/jan/17/iraq-visit-malcolm-turnbull-calls-for-reconciliation-to-secure-lasting-peace?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Malcolm Turnbull,Australian defence force,Australia news,Iraq,Islamic State,Middle East and North Africa", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2016-01-17T00:59:57.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-hurst", "section": "Australia news", "modified_time": "2016-05-08T22:53:05.000Z", "tag": "Malcolm Turnbull,Australian defence force,Australia news,Iraq,Islamic State,Middle East and North Africa"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cf79acd6632b11752acf9b094f4ace1f53166bc/622_369_4525_2715/4525.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=2717440c5ae883dbb47a895cbbda871e", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Malcolm Turnbull,Australian defence force,Australia news,Iraq,Islamic State,Middle East and North Africa"}, "article_summary": "On his visit to Taji, Turnbull said the ADF personnel were winning plaudits for their \u201cgreat professionalism, great commitment and great success\u201d.\nMalcolm Turnbull has called for \u201cgenuine reconciliation\u201d to secure lasting peace in Iraq and has personally thanked Australian defence force personnel for their efforts during his first visit to the country since becoming prime minister.\nThe prime minister told al-Abadi Australia was \u201cstrongly committed to helping Iraq in its fight against Daesh\u201d, another term for Isis.\nYou exude confidence, prime minister, and that is very encouraging, but the victory must be one that endures.\nI have discussed with you, prime minister, your efforts to promote national unity and reconciliation, and that is absolutely critical to countering this extremism now and for the longer term."}
