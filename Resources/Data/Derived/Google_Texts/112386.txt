MEMPHIS, Tenn. — There will be no more walking in Memphis — at least outside her enclosure — for Zimm, the monkey.

The monkey that inspired Twitter with her jailbreaking heroism has been recaptured by the Memphis Zoo.

The 3-year-old Sulawesi macaque escaped from her enclosure into the zoo’s drain system on Thursday afternoon. Zimm was initially defiant, but quickly grew tired of her new home, according to a Twitter account started in her name.

She felt just a little lonely:

But still managed to keep a good attitude:

Catch me if you can 😏 @MemphisZoo — Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 9, 2015

This drain is pretty cozy not gonna lie — Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 9, 2015

A little damp but I could fix it up a bit, make it my own — Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 9, 2015

This drain is lame, let me out — Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 10, 2015

I'm still in the drain. The humans have trapped me, I was just trying to live my life — Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 10, 2015

So ended Zimm’s epic run, one that — if social media is to be believed — included pep talks to humans, responding to pitches for a sitcom, to tweeting at USA Women’s Soccer team hero Carli Lloyd:

Wonder if the best escaped monkey in the world, can get a follow from the best soccer player in the world @CarliLloyd? — Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 9, 2015

Yet in the end, Zimm seemed content to be back in her zoo home. She’s getting checked out at the zoo’s hospital and will return to the Primate Canyon soon, where she hopes her Twitter fame will gain her some real-life visitors:

“Whew! I’m so glad they found me, I was getting worried they wouldn’t!” she tweeted.
