Over the border in southern Thailand, 14 people have been killed in the floods that began in mid-December.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak toured some of the worst-hit areas this weekend, following his return from a vacation in Hawaii on Friday.\n\nNajib was criticized for his absence during the calamity, after being photographed playing golf with President Barack Obama.\n\nNortheastern Malaysia and southern Thailand are regularly hit by flooding during the annual northeast monsoon but this year the rain has been particularly heavy.\n\nThe Malaysian government said rain in Kelantan and southern Thailand would last for at least another week. An official in the southern Thai border town of Sungai Kolok said it would take up to two days for water levels to drop and for the border to be reopened.\n\n(Reporting by Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah in KUALA LUMPUR, Panarat Thepgumpanat and Viparat Jantraprap in BANGKOK; Editing by Praveen Menon and Robert Birsel)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The worst flooding in Malaysia in more than a decade has killed 10 people and forced nearly 160,000 from their homes and more rain is expected, authorities said on Sunday.", "title": "Floods in Malaysia and Thailand kill at least 24", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141228&t=2&i=1007589853&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEABR03U", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, MALAYSIA, FLOODS", "sailthru.title": "Floods in Malaysia and Thailand kill at least 24", "keywords": "US,MALAYSIA,FLOODS,Malaysia,Thailand,Disasters / Accidents,Environment,Climate Politics,Science,Floods,Tourism / Travel,Asia / Pacific,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Transportation (TRBC),Economic Events,Precipitation,ASEAN Countries,Wind / Hurricanes / Typhoons / Tornadoes", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;MALAYSIA;FLOODS;Malaysia;Thailand;Disasters / Accidents;Environment;Climate Politics;Science;Floods;Tourism / Travel;Asia / Pacific;Arts / Culture / Entertainment;Transportation (TRBC);Economic Events;Precipitation;ASEAN Countries;Wind / Hurricanes / Typhoons / Tornadoes", "WT.cg_n": "World", "sailthru.description": "The worst flooding in Malaysia in more than a decade has killed 10 people and forced nearly 160,000 from their homes and more rain is expected, authorities said on Sunday.", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-28T11:12:46+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;newsMaps;Nissan;treasuryMarkets;samsung;newsproHome;fedex_neg;TCS_IN", "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Dec 28 11:12:46 UTC 2014", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Floods+in+Malaysia+and+Thailand+kill+at+least+24", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0K606X20141228", "WT.cg_s": "World", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141228&t=2&i=1007589853&w=&fh=50&fw=50&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEABR03U", "description": "The worst flooding in Malaysia in more than a decade has killed 10 people and forced nearly 160,000 from their homes and more rain is expected, authorities said on Sunday.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-worldNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "The worst flooding in Malaysia in more than a decade has killed 10 people and forced nearly 160,000 from their homes and more rain is expected, authorities said on Sunday.", "title": "Floods in Malaysia and Thailand kill at least 24", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141228&t=2&i=1007589853&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEABR03U", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-floods-idUSKBN0K606X20141228", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,MALAYSIA,FLOODS,Malaysia,Thailand,Disasters / Accidents,Environment,Climate Politics,Science,Floods,Tourism / Travel,Asia / Pacific,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Transportation (TRBC),Economic Events,Precipitation,ASEAN Countries,Wind / Hurricanes / Typhoons / Tornadoes", "published_time": "2014-12-28T11:12:46+0000", "modified_time": "2014-12-28T11:12:46+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "DCSext.ContentID_worldNews": "USKBN0K606X20141228", "DCSext.contentversion": "original", "sailthru.image.full": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141228&t=2&i=1007589853&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEABR03U"}, "article_summary": "Over the border in southern Thailand, 14 people have been killed in the floods that began in mid-December.\nNortheastern Malaysia and southern Thailand are regularly hit by flooding during the annual northeast monsoon but this year the rain has been particularly heavy.\n(Reporting by Al-Zaquan Amer Hamzah in KUALA LUMPUR, Panarat Thepgumpanat and Viparat Jantraprap in BANGKOK; Editing by Praveen Menon and Robert Birsel)\nThe Malaysian government said rain in Kelantan and southern Thailand would last for at least another week.\nAmong the casualties, five were in the worst-hit state of Kelantan, in northeastern peninsular Malaysia."}
