On Saturday, they were challenged to get as close to those hazards as possible.\n\nMore than 50 truckers from across the state descended on a rainy, windswept course of cones and targets in the parking lot of Dysart\u2019s Trailer Shop on Saturday morning to compete in the Maine Professional Truck Driving Championships.\n\n\u201cThis is their Super Bowl,\u201d said Brian Parke, president and CEO of the Maine Motor Transport Association.\n\nIt started with a written test, gauging drivers\u2019 knowledge of the trucking industry, safety, rules of the road, health and wellness, first aid and more. The second part of the contest had drivers performing pre-trip inspections on a series of vehicles that had been sabotaged in various ways. Drivers were tasked with finding the defects, while members of Maine State Police\u2019s Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Unit looked over their shoulders.\n\nThe big spectacle, the one that brings driver\u2019s families to the event, is the driving portion of the test. Drivers maneuvered around a series of six obstacles meant to represent challenges truckers face every day. They backed up to a fence to see how close they can get without hitting it. They had to park with their back tires on a line without much of a reference point, before moving on to negotiate a tight turn without clipping any cones.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be perfect, just better than the other guy,\u201d said competitor Steve \u201cMcQueen\u201d Collins, who has been working for Hartt Transportation for 12 years and driving trucks since he finished high school in 1977. \u201cThis is what you do every day, you either know your stuff or you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe drivers, representing 19 companies, took the seat of nine classes of vehicles, ranging from box trucks to 53-foot trailers attached to sleeper cabs. One of the more challenging to handle was the truck hauling a pair of trailers.\n\nWinners get bragging rights, and a chance to represent Maine by advancing to the National Truck Driving Championships in Pittsburgh later this summer. Some companies also provide incentives for drivers if they perform well.\n\nThe Grand Champion of the event was Denis Litalien of Clifford W. Perham Inc., and James McKeen of YRC Freight took home \u201crookie of the year\u201d honors. The competition\u2019s Team Trophy went to Hannaford Trucking.\n\nRonald Round of Pottle\u2019s Transportation performed best on the written exam, while Vince Cote of Hannaford Trucking got the nod for best pre-trip inspection.\n\nThe following drivers were recognized for best handling their respective classes of trucks:\n\n\u2014 James McKeen, YRC Freight, three axle.\n\n\u2014 Denis Litalien, Clifford W. Perham Inc., four axle.\n\n\u2014 Jonathan Roussel, Portland Air Freight, five axle.\n\n\u2014 Robert Balfour, Wal-mart, flatbed.\n\n\u2014 Jeffrey Granholm, Pottle\u2019s Transportation, sleeper cab.\n\n\u2014 Scott Wickstrom, FedEx, step van.\n\n\u2014 Alan Paradis, A&A Trucking, straight truck.\n\n\u2014 Ray Bucknell, Irving Oil Terminal Inc., tanker.\n\n\u2014 Matthew Richardson, Performance Transportation LLC, twin trailers.\n\nFollow reporter Nick McCrea on Twitter @nmccrea213", "article_metadata": {"description": "HERMON, Maine \u2014 On most days, a professional driver\u2019s job is to get where they\u2019re going, avoiding obstacles and hazards at all costs.
