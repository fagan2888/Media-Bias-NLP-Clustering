Stasis is death. We must constantly create and innovate to move forward our massive $14-trillion-per-year economy. That takes lots and lots and LOTS of speculative capital.\n\nWithout certain certainties, investment collapses. If investors don\u2019t have any reasonable idea what\u2019s going to happen in a market \u2013 they won\u2019t invest in that market.\n\nThat is not to say guarantees. Investing is \u2013 in the best of circumstances \u2013 extraordinarily risky. Investors know this. They are risk takers by nature \u2013 thank God. Without them, their copious coin \u2013 and their intestinal fortitude \u2013 everything economic collapses.\n\nWhat we absolutely do not need is government artificially creating all manner of additional uncertainties. Sadly, that is inherently what government does.\n\nRegulation-compliance-costs waste investment capital. Unilateral regulation \u2013 when the Executive Branch bypasses the Legislative Branch and its process and rewrites and superimposes laws all by its onesies \u2013 creates tremendous uncertainty. And with it tremendous loss of investment.\n\nBecause if the economic landscape can be fundamentally altered on a whim \u2013 by the wave of a hand and the stroke of a pen \u2013 those looking to invest will instead head for the hills.\n\nThe examples are legion \u2013 and often legendary.\n\n10,000 Commandments\n\nFederal regulation and intervention cost American consumers and businesses an estimated $1.88 trillion in 2014 in lost economic productivity and higher prices.\n\nHow Over-Regulation Hurts Us \u2013 Some Eye-Popping Numbers\n\nRegulation: The Bite is Worse than the Bark\n\nRegulatory Uncertainty Is Largest Barrier To Energy Investment\n\nNet Neutrality Will Slow Investments\n\nBank Regs Hurt Investors\n\nLand Regulation Will Hurt Investment\n\nAnd on, and on, and\u2026\n\nSometimes this is the expressed intent of those in governmental power. Remember these promises from now-President Barack Obama?\n\n\u201cUnder my plan\u2026electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, if somebody wants to build a coal plant, they can \u2013 it\u2019s just that it will bankrupt them, because they are going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that\u2019s being emitted.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s certainly investment-friendly.\n\nOften the intent is just as malicious \u2013 but obfuscated. Remember this promise from now-President Obama?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll work to reduce (health insurance) premiums by $2,500 per family per year.\u201d\n\nAfter our premiums necessarily skyrocketed, we learned from ObamaCare architect and accidental video star Jonathan Gruber that they all along knew it would increase premiums by 19-30 percent. In many instances, it\u2019s been much higher than even that. And there are more, even larger increases on the way.\n\nThere are many, many, MANY ways this money could be better spent.\n\nOften uncertainty and its resulting loss of investment is \u2013 if we\u2019re giving the benefit of the doubt \u2013 an accidental government by-product. They mean well, but their government actions end up squelching speculative coin.\n\nFor instance \u2013 behold the woefully misnamed Innovation Act. Which harms what it claims to want to help. Yet another government \u201cOops.\u201d\n\n\u2018Innovation Act\u2019 Will Stifle Innovation\n\nFor investors in technology start-ups, things are about to get much more complex and dangerous\u2026.\n\n(T)his bill actually will kill investment and innovation\u2026.\n\nThe American patent, so indispensable to technology start-ups, is about to be rendered useless when faced with an infringer of disproportionate size\u2026.\n\nPresident Obama, known to be tight with Google, has said he will sign it. Google and other mega-corporations will be pleased.\n\nBig Government and Big Business love it. The Little Guys \u2013 not so much.\n\nThe Innovation Act Would Hurt Inventors Like Me, And Thousands Of Others\n\n(T)he Innovation Act threatens American inventors, particularly individual inventors and those working at small businesses and startups\u2026.\n\nWhat do all of these inventors need to create and innovate? Investment. Which the government is poised to fundamentally undermine.\n\nWhen the ability for investors to get a return on said investment is legislated away \u2013 they\u2019ll head for the hills. And take their copious coin \u2013 and our hopes for future creation, innovation and economic expansion \u2013 with them.\n\nOf that we can all be most certain.\n\n[Originally published at Red State]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/05/worse-than-government-caused-uncertainty-certainty-the-government-is-against-you/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/regulations.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Worse Than Government-Caused Uncertainty?
