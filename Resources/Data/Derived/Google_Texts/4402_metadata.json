The improvement is due to better management of occupancy rates, broadened business lines and services, and the implementation of strategic plans, according to Milwaukee-based financial advisory firm Cleary Gull. The company conducted the survey between February and May of this year via an online tool provided to \u201call known\u201d not-for-profit senior living organizations.\n\nHowever, service expansions and campus repositioning efforts also create \u201cperiods of operational stress\u201d and lower margins for companies going through these changes, the report states. This means that Clearly Gull analysts expect to see \u201cextreme\u201d spreads between margins at either end of the spectrum. This year, some companies reached as high as 14.5% while others reported margins as low as minus-24.6%.\n\nWhile occupancy ticked up for most companies polled, it remains a challenge. Average occupancy currently is at about 91%, while the C-suite leaders said they are aiming for 94% to 95%. Affordable Care Act changes and lower reimbursements were cited as two other primary challenges.\n\nIn terms of how these companies are allocating assets in their investment portfolios, fixed income and cash were down more than 6%, now making up just over half of holdings. Equity holdings increased by more than 4%, to make up more than 42% overall.\n\n\u201cThe key takeaway is that diversification is critical,\u201d stated Steve Backus, client advisor at Clearly Gull. \u201cSince uncertainty persists about when and at what pace interest rates will rise, and senior living organizations continue to carry high percentages of fixed income and cash in their portfolios, it's important to develop and begin acting on a plan to mitigate risk.\u201d\n\nBackus and the company's president, Stephanie Chedid, AIF, will be available to answer questions on the report at next week's LeadingAge conference in Dallas.
