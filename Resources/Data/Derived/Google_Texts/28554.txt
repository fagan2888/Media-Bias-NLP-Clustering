The Driftless Film Festival may have some work to do before it's even mentioned in the same sentence as festivals like Sundance, but the 6-year-old event does offer sage and cinematic storytelling in another old mining town.

With all the films shown in a beautifully restored opera house in Mineral Point, the festival draws an intimate gathering of filmmakers and film lovers across the Midwest and beyond. The festival is about a two-hour drive from Milwaukee and runs from Thursday through Monday.

The opening film "Almost There," a profile of a so-called outsider artist, explores the fine line between creative independence and mental fragility, between hoarding and a visionary gathering of art objects. The Driftless Sisters, a regional band of "almost sisters" raised in area antiques stores, who play banjo, guitar, ukulele and harmonica, will play Friday night, too.

Single tickets for the films are $10, and a pass for the full slate is $50. For more information: driftlessfilmfest.org.
