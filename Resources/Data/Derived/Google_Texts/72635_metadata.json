In the year-end crush, take time to sit down and focus on your finances.\n\nBut a fat balance in a savings or investing account beats one on a credit card. And the clock is ticking on a number of tax deductions.\n\nSo let friends and family know: Instead of buying them presents they\u2019ll only wind up regifting, you will now be me-gifting, redirecting those funds into your Roth IRA.\n\nOr, if that\u2019s too radical, just do this.\n\nCheck your mix\n\nA volatile year in the markets may have mucked up your mix. Look over any portfolio and 401(k) plan investments and, if you have one, even your target-date fund, which automatically rebalances your holdings between asset classes as you get closer to your retirement date.\n\nWhy check something that\u2019s on autopilot? First, because many people don\u2019t know how their target-date fund is invested. Second, there\u2019s a fairly wide range of equity stakes in funds geared to the same retirement year, and you want to be comfortable with your fund\u2019s equity risk. T. Rowe Price Retirement\u2019s 2025 fund, for example, has 71 percent in equities now, with 10 years until the date its holders plan to retire, according to Morningstar. The Wells Fargo Advantage DJ 2025 fund has 49 percent.\n\nThe point is simply to know what you own and be comfortable with it, or adjust your holdings. That could stave off any temptation to sell in a panic if there\u2019s a big market drop.\n\nLower your taxable income\n\nCharitable contributions made by Dec. 31 can be deducted on itemized income taxes, as long as you have the receipts. If you\u2019re mailing in a donation form and charging it to your credit card, try not to procrastinate. Last year, planner June Ann Schroeder, of Elm Grove, Wisc., tried that at the last minute. Three of the charges weren\u2019t processed until January and had to go in this year\u2019s taxes.\n\nIf you have kids and live in a state that allows tax credits or deductions for 529-fund contributions, be sure to contribute by year end, said Marguerita Cheng, head of Blue Ocean Global Wealth, in Potomac, Md.\n\nDonating appreciated assets such as stocks, real estate and mutual funds also has big tax benefits. Say you want to give your college some money and you have a mutual fund worth $20,000 that you bought ages ago for $5,000. Give it to your college and you can write off the full $20,000 and avoid capital gains on the appreciation.\n\nIf you sold the fund to get the money, you\u2019d have to pay those capital gains and then dip into other accounts to give the full $20,000. You could still deduct the cash donation on your taxes, but you wouldn\u2019t be making the smartest tax move.\n\nOptimize your health benefits\n\nMany employees need to use up the pretax money they contributed to a flexible spending account (FSA) for health-care expenses by Dec. 31. So let the parade of visits to doctors and dentists begin.\n\nWhile many people race to get new glasses or contact lenses at year end, the IRS has given employers more flexibility in recent years. Check to see if your company has done one of two things (it can\u2019t do both): let employees stretch the use period for the FSA out two and a half months into the following year (March 15 for most plans), or let them roll $500 of the account over to next year.\n\nAnother item to consider now and over the next two years is maximizing contributions to health savings accounts (HSAs), the tax-advantaged savings accounts for medical expenses that are often paired with high-deductible health-care plans, said Michael Baker of Vertex Capital Advisors in Charlotte, N.C. In 2018, a provision of the Affordable Care Act called the Cadillac Tax will take effect and could limit savers\u2019 ability to fund those kinds of plans, he said.\n\nThe details of any changes are being debated in Washington, D.C., and \u201cit\u2019s likely we won\u2019t know how this rule will be interpreted or possibly changed until the last minute,\u201d Baker said. If you want to be prudent with any excess dollars this year, he suggests fully funding an HSA (for 2015 the limits are $3,350 for individuals and $6,750 for a family), particularly since unused HSA funds can eventually be used as retirement savings.\n\nRead up on Roths\n\nThere\u2019s an upside to the inevitable downturn in stocks. If a market drop sends the value of your traditional IRA way down, you\u2019ll have less money to pay taxes on if you convert that pretax money into an after-tax Roth IRA. There are no income limits on the move, but a conversion is the only way those with high incomes can get into a Roth; for 2016, single people with adjusted gross income of $132,000 or more, and married couples filing jointly with income of $194,000 or more, cannot open regular Roth IRAs.\n\nTaxes will still likely take a painful bite in a conversion, but with a Roth you can withdraw the money tax-free in retirement.\n\nPrepare to file early\n\nIf you expect to get a tax refund, the absolute best way to stop a scammer from getting your refund (except withholding enough so you don\u2019t get a refund, which is the ideal situation) is to file as early as possible. That way, you may beat your potential fraudster to the punch. That date will be Jan. 25, 2016, for most people.\n\nThe rub: You may not have all the forms you need to file by then. If you need to wait for a \u201cSchedule K-1\u201d from a partnership \u2014 and many energy, real estate, hedge fund, and private equity investors do \u2014 it can sometimes take until late summer to arrive. So you may need to pay whatever you or your accountant estimates you\u2019ll owe by April 15 and file for an extension until you can get the forms.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Time is winding down to take advantage of a number of tax deductions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Time is winding down to take advantage of a number of tax deductions.", "title": "Clock is ticking on your end-of-year tax deduction moves", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/business/clock-is-ticking-on-end-of-year-moves/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/a082a3fa-99fe-11e5-ae3b-69b0b1312aff-1560x1939.jpg", "height": 1939}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "Time is winding down to take advantage of a number of tax deductions.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/a082a3fa-99fe-11e5-ae3b-69b0b1312aff-780x969.jpg", "title": "Clock is ticking on your end-of-year tax deduction moves"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-12-05 08:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07 06:52:20"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Business, Local Business"}, "article_summary": "And the clock is ticking on a number of tax deductions.\nYou could still deduct the cash donation on your taxes, but you wouldn\u2019t be making the smartest tax move.\nDonating appreciated assets such as stocks, real estate and mutual funds also has big tax benefits.\nTime is winding down to take advantage of a number of tax deductions.\nGive it to your college and you can write off the full $20,000 and avoid capital gains on the appreciation."}
