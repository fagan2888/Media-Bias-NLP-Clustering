Companies are introducing higher deductibles and co-payments, rising premiums and the imposition of wellness programs that carry penalties for people who don\u2019t comply.\n\nRequiring employees to shoulder more of the cost burden may undermine public support for Obamacare just as Congress, now firmly under Republican control, considers new ways to gut the law.\n\nThe tax takes effect in 2018, and employers are already laying the groundwork to make sure they don\u2019t have to pay the 40 percent surcharge on health-insurance spending that exceeds $27,500 for a family or $10,200 for an individual. Once envisioned as a tool to slow the nation\u2019s growing health-care tab, the tax has in practice meant higher out-of-pocket health-care costs for workers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any employer that\u2019s planning on paying that tax,\u201d Steve Wojcik, vice president of public policy for the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers, said in a phone interview.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t help the company, it doesn\u2019t help the employees, it doesn\u2019t help the shareholders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really help anybody except the federal government.\u201d\n\nSlowing Growth\n\nThe tax on Cadillac plans -- named after the luxury vehicle to denote their lavishness -- is one reason the growth in health-care premiums has slowed since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act took effect in 2010.\n\nLast year, average family premiums rose 3 percent to $16,834, while single premiums held steady at $6,025, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Companies with a large percentage of high-wage workers paid more, with an average of $6,244 for single coverage.\n\nAmong employers with 200 or more workers, 51 percent had employees paying one-quarter or more of their premiums for family coverage last year, according to Kaiser\u2019s report in September. That portion has been gradually increasing since 2011, when it was 42 percent.\n\nIntended Effect\n\nEmployers who have traditionally offered generous benefits to lure top professional talent, or who have conceded to demands from labor unions for better health benefits, are most susceptible to the tax, Wojcik said. Many are responding by imposing new requirements on workers and reducing their health benefits.\n\nThe tax \u201cis having the effect that was intended, which is the cost of these plans are being reduced,\u201d Christopher Condeluci, a former Senate Republican aide who helped design it, said in a phone interview. \u201cSadly, the way in which they\u2019re being reduced is they\u2019re shifting more costs onto the employees.\u201d\n\nPremium increases for employer-provided health insurance, which covers about 48 percent of Americans, \u201cslowed markedly\u201d in 31 states since 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act became law, the New York-based Commonwealth Fund reported today. Nationally, premium growth fell by about a percentage point after the law, to 4.1 percent a year on average, the report said.\n\nDeductibles, however, have more than doubled in all but six states since 2003, the report said.\n\n\u201cWorkers are paying more but getting less protective benefits,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said.\n\nBiometric Screening\n\nJPMorgan expanded its wellness program for 2015, requiring workers to complete a biometric screening and an online questionnaire in exchange for $200 in a savings account for medical expenses. Employees who don\u2019t comply will pay $500 extra for their insurance premiums.\n\nThe bank also raised its insurance premiums for workers and even more for their spouses, who \u201chave higher claims, on average,\u201d it said in an employee brochure.\n\nJPMorgan employees pay about 25 percent of the cost of medical coverage, with the company covering the rest, according to enrollment materials. Higher-salaried workers pay more for coverage.\n\nAndrew Gray, a spokesman for the bank, declined to comment.\n\nGeorge Washington University in Washington eliminated its most generous health plan this year because it would have been subject to the tax, the school told employees in a benefits guide.\n\nBalance Challenge\n\n\u201cPrimarily as a result of this significant future tax liability, GW will no longer be offering this plan after 2014,\u201d the university said. Employees can select from three health plans, including a new one that carries a deductible of at least $1,500, almost twice as much as the next-highest plan.\n\nThe high-deductible plan, which employees at the school can pair with a savings account for medical expenses, covers less of workers\u2019 health costs -- 70 percent on average, compared with at least 79 percent for the other two plans.\n\nHigh Deductibles\n\n\u201cGW, like all employers, has the challenge of maintaining competitive benefits plans while balancing increases in the cost of medical care,\u201d the university\u2019s executive vice president and treasurer, Lou Katz, said in a September blog post.\n\nThe university \u201cmay need to make additional changes before 2018 to fully eliminate any potential tax liability,\u201d a spokeswoman, Maralee Csellar, said in an e-mail. \u201cThe goal is to begin taking steps now, in anticipation of the excise tax, to use our benefit dollars wisely in keeping the plans affordable.\u201d\n\nMore employees than expected had opted for the new high-deductible plan, Csellar said. She didn\u2019t provide a specific number, saying the data were preliminary.\n\nThe number of employers offering only a high-deductible plan was expected to increase by 50 percent for 2015, according to an August study from the National Business Group on Health. Thirty-two percent planned to offer such \u201cconsumer-directed health plans,\u201d up from 22 percent in 2014.\n\nHarvard is requiring employees to pay in-network deductibles for the first time this year, sharing in the cost of care, which will help the university reduce the premiums workers pay. That led to protests from faculty who called the change a pay cut.\n\nUnclear Role\n\nThe school has been scrutinizing employee benefits since at least 2012, when the college said the annual expense had doubled to $476 million over the previous 10 fiscal years. Harvard gives general guidelines on spending to the University Benefits Committee, a group of faculty and staff who advise the provost on health benefits.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much of a role the Cadillac tax played in Harvard\u2019s decision, said Michael Chernew, the chairman of the committee and a professor of health-care policy at Harvard Medical School in Boston. The tax\u2019s debut in 2018 is still a long way away, and Harvard probably wouldn\u2019t have been affected by it for the first few years, depending on how quickly health-care spending climbs, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are people here who believe the Cadillac tax is really important. But it doesn\u2019t come until 2018,\u201d Chernew said. \u201cMy belief is that in 2018 we were not at substantial risk of bumping into the Cadillac tax substantially. As time goes on we were more and more likely to be affected.\u201d\n\nRepeal Possible?\n\nPresident Barack Obama, who signed the Affordable Care Act, won\u2019t be around to collect the Cadillac tax. It will be implemented and administered by his successor, and there is some hope among employers that the levy may yet be delayed or repealed, said Wojcik, of the large employers\u2019 group.\n\nOne complication for repeal, though, is the cost. The Congressional Budget Office said in 2012 that repealing the tax would add $111 billion to the deficit by 2022, an amount that increases each year as health-care costs grow and the tax takes a bite from more employers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of time between now and then; we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cFor most employers, they\u2019re going with the assumption now that this is the law and in order to avoid this pretty drastic tax we need to take action now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne and John Lauerman", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-07/lavish-cadillac-health-plans-dying-out-as-obamacare-tax-looms", "title": "Lavish \u2018Cadillac\u2019 Health Plans Dying as Obamacare Tax Looms", "description": "Large employers are increasingly putting an end to their most generous health-care coverage as a tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d insurance plans looms closer under Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne and John Lauerman", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Law,Family,Health", "news_keywords": "Law,Family,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-07/lavish-cadillac-health-plans-dying-out-as-obamacare-tax-looms", "parsely-title": "Lavish \u2018Cadillac\u2019 Health Plans Dying as Obamacare Tax Looms", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-01-09T03:08:24.201Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Large employers are increasingly putting an end to their most generous health-care coverage as a tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d insurance plans looms closer under Obamacare.", "parsely-tags": "Law,Family,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-01-09T03:08:24.201Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-07/lavish-cadillac-health-plans-dying-out-as-obamacare-tax-looms", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Large employers are increasingly putting an end to their most generous health-care coverage as a tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d insurance plans looms closer under Obamacare.", "title": "Lavish \u2018Cadillac\u2019 Health Plans Dying as Obamacare Tax Looms"}, "fb": {"status": "Large employers are increasingly putting an end to their most generous health-care coverage as a tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d insurance plans looms closer under Obamacare."}, "parsely-post-id": "NHS4HN6JIJUS01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "Thirty-two percent planned to offer such \u201cconsumer-directed health plans,\u201d up from 22 percent in 2014.\nLarge employers are increasingly putting an end to their most generous health-care coverage as a tax on \u201cCadillac\u201d insurance plans looms closer under Obamacare.\nHarvard gives general guidelines on spending to the University Benefits Committee, a group of faculty and staff who advise the provost on health benefits.\nJPMorgan employees pay about 25 percent of the cost of medical coverage, with the company covering the rest, according to enrollment materials.\nMany are responding by imposing new requirements on workers and reducing their health benefits."}
