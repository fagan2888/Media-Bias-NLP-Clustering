I knew better. I am embarrassed, and I am sorry,\u201d Gruber will tell the committee.\n\nHowever, he will also attempt to backtrack claims that Obamacare only passed due to \u201ca lack of transparency\u201d in the legislative process.\n\n\u201cLet me be very clear: I do not think that the Affordable Care Act was passed in a non-transparent fashion,\u201d he will tell the committee.\n\n\u201cReasonable people can disagree about the merits of [some of Obamacare\u2019s revenue raising provisions], but it is completely clear that these issues were debated thoroughly during the drafting and passage of the ACA,\u201d he will say.\n\nThat is a marked departure from his comments since the law passed. \u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage,\u201d he said in one recently released video seized on by Obamacare opponents as evidence of Democrats\u2019 legislative chicanery.\n\nGruber\u2019s testimony will not address his relationship with the Department of Health and Human Services in 2009 and 2010 that critics say presented his macroeconomic analyses of the law as objective even though he was on the department\u2019s payroll.\n\nHHS, the White House, congressional Democrats, and numerous Obamacare supporters in the media touted Gruber\u2019s analyses as definitive evidence of Obamacare\u2019s positive fiscal impacts.\n\nNeither Gruber nor the administration disclosed that he was being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by HHS to act as an adviser during Obamacare\u2019s legislative stages.\n\nDuring his Tuesday testimony Gruber will also attempt to head off arguments that the law was written to provide health insurance subsidies only through insurance exchanges established by the various states.\n\nThat question is at the heart of an ongoing Supreme Court case that could invalidate subsidies offered in exchanges offered by the federal government. Obamacare supporters say the provision was simply a drafting error. Others say HHS must abide by the law as written.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s important to remember politically about this, is if you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t set up an Exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits,\u201d Gruber said in 2012.\n\nHe will walk back those comments on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI have a long-standing and well-documented belief that health care reform legislation in general, and the ACA in particular, must include mechanisms for residents in all states to obtain tax credits,\u201d he will tell the committee.\n\nGruber\u2019s critics say his explanation is wanting.\n\n\u201cGruber new claim that he was referring to only the hypothetical in which no federal exchange is built is the biggest whopper of a lie yet from a boastful master of deception,\u201d said Phil Kerpen, president of the conservative group American Commitment, which has criticized the MIT professor\u2019s recently released statements.\n\n\u201cHe expressly said on two occasions and clearly implied on at least five others that tax credits depended on state exchanges. Full stop,\u201d Kerpen said in an email. \u201cHis new proviso is as laughably false as when Obama re-explained \u2018you can keep your plan\u2019 with \u2018if it hasn\u2019t changed\u2019 after mass cancellations hit.\u201d\n\nDespite numerous press reports referring to Gruber as an \u201carchitect\u201d of Obamacare, he will dispute that moniker at today\u2019s hearing.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A controversial professor who helped devise Obamacare will apologize to a House committee on Tuesday and attempt to walk back comments about the law\u2019s passage that he says were \u201cuninformed\u201d and", "title": "Gruber to Apologize, Walk Back \u2018Lack of Transparency\u2019 Comments", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/gruber-to-apologize-walk-back-lack-of-transparency-comments/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/j-gruber-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A controversial professor who helped devise Obamacare will apologize to a House committee on Tuesday", "creator": "@lachlan", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/j-gruber-150x150.jpg", "title": "Gruber to Apologize, Walk Back \u2018Lack of Transparency\u2019 Comments", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce56\"", "article_summary": "However, he will also attempt to backtrack claims that Obamacare only passed due to \u201ca lack of transparency\u201d in the legislative process.\nThat is a marked departure from his comments since the law passed.\nI am embarrassed, and I am sorry,\u201d Gruber will tell the committee.\nDuring his Tuesday testimony Gruber will also attempt to head off arguments that the law was written to provide health insurance subsidies only through insurance exchanges established by the various states.\n\u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage,\u201d he said in one recently released video seized on by Obamacare opponents as evidence of Democrats\u2019 legislative chicanery."}
