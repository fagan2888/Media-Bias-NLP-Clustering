Since then, the Obama administration has looked for ways to persuade Republicans who have steadfastly opposed Obamacare to participate in this key component of the act. The biggest incentive is the law\u2019s promise of federal funds to cover the whole cost of newly qualified Medicaid patients for three years, until 2016, and at least 90 percent of the costs thereafter. Nevertheless, 20 states have refused to ease access to their Medicaid rolls. A few have been able to eat their cake and have it, too: Because of special arrangements that predate Obamacare, four states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid have been getting billions each year in extra funding to pay for the care of people who are uninsured.\n\nThat\u2019s about to change. On April 14, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which manages federal funding to the states for health programs, alerted Florida officials that CMS plans to let the $1.3 billion the state gets annually to help hospitals cover the cost of treating uninsured patients lapse at the end of June. \u201cUncompensated care pool funding should not pay for costs that would be covered in a Medicaid expansion,\u201d CMS wrote in its letter, which it released to reporters.\n\nRick Scott, Florida\u2019s Republican governor, responded two days later with a threat to sue the Obama administration. \u201cIt is appalling that President Obama would cut off federal health-care dollars to Florida in an effort to force our state further into Obamacare,\u201d Scott said in a public statement. On Fox News, Scott was more animated: \u201cThis is The Sopranos. They\u2019re using bullying tactics to attack our state.\u201d Scott\u2019s office declined to comment further.\n\n\u201cThis is \u2018The Sopranos.\u2019 They\u2019re using bullying tactics to attack our state.\u201d Florida Governor Rick Scott\n\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott quickly joined forces with Scott. Texas\u2019 special Medicaid funding, which accounts for about half of the state\u2019s $3.4 billion pool to repay hospitals for treating uninsured patients, expires in September 2016. In an April 20 statement, Abbott, a former attorney general who took office in January, vowed to support Florida\u2019s suit. (As of April 22, no lawsuit had been filed.) \u201cThe Supreme Court made it very clear that the Constitution does not allow the federal government to use these coercive tactics against the States,\u201d Abbott said.\n\nFlorida and Texas are among nine states with high numbers of uninsured residents that struck deals with CMS for extra federal money to help hospitals, which are legally bound to provide care whether or not patients can pay. The arrangements, known as uncompensated care pools, are subject to periodic renewal and were also granted to Arizona, California, Hawaii, Kansas, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and Tennessee. Of those, only Kansas and Tennessee have joined Florida and Texas in continuing to resist Medicaid expansion.\n\nFlorida is the first to come up for review since the Affordable Care Act went into force. Scott, a Tea Party conservative, opposed expanding Medicaid when he took office in 2011, then reversed himself in 2013, saying in a news conference that with Washington picking up the tab, \u201cI cannot, in good conscience, deny Floridians the needed access to health care.\u201d With his state legislature dominated by conservative Republicans, he wavered.\n\nAfter learning CMS wasn\u2019t going to renew Florida\u2019s funds for uncompensated care unless the state increases access to Medicaid, the governor reversed course again, saying the threat proved the Obama administration couldn\u2019t be trusted to fulfill its promise to cover most of the cost of a Medicaid expansion, either. \u201cWhy would we put state taxpayers on the hook for something when we can\u2019t trust the federal government to fulfill a program they already started?\u201d he said to reporters.\n\nAs Obama looks to cement his health-care accomplishments before the 2016 election, the White House seems to see an opportunity to exact a political price from Scott, Abbott, and other Republicans who continue to resist expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain why somebody would think that their political situation and their political interest is somehow more important than the livelihood and health of 800,000 people that they were elected to lead,\u201d White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during an April 17 press briefing.\n\nTexas and Florida together have 1.6 million people who could qualify for Medicaid under the wider eligibility criteria, according to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation. That\u2019s more than 40 percent of the people who would benefit from Medicaid expansion in the 20 states that have opted out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here in Florida is probably just the first indication of where CMS is going with all of this for all states that have uncompensated care pools,\u201d says Bruce Rueben, president of the Florida Hospital Association, which backs Medicaid expansion.\n\nIn Tennessee, conservative lawmakers who control the legislature killed Republican Governor Bill Haslam\u2019s request to expand Medicaid earlier this year. Kansas Republican Governor Sam Brownback, who has long opposed Obamacare, recently signaled that he might be willing to change his position in the face of a $400 million budget gap. CMS won\u2019t say whether states that decide to expand Medicaid will get to keep their low-income pools. \u201cDiscussions with each state will also take into account state-specific circumstances,\u201d says CMS spokesman Aaron Albright.\n\nStates resisting Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion shouldn\u2019t expect the federal government to extend special funds that are \u201cabove and beyond the normal workings of Medicaid,\u201d says Cindy Mann, a former top Medicaid official in the Obama administration who\u2019s now a partner at law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips. \u201cThese were all started before the Affordable Care Act, and it\u2019s not surprising CMS is looking to focus its funding on these pools for care that wouldn\u2019t be otherwise covered by Medicaid.\u201d\n\nSome governors have found conservative-friendly compromises to take federal Medicaid money and use it to expand private coverage. That approach gave Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, and former Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe, a Democrat, political cover in states where \u201cObamacare\u201d is a dirty word. Florida\u2019s Senate backs such a proposal. If Scott can\u2019t find a political compromise to get there, he may be the first Republican governor to learn just how costly disagreeing with the Obama administration over health care can be.\n\nThe bottom line: Florida Republican Rick Scott is picking a fight with the White House on Medicaid, even though he risks a budget hit.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John Tozzi,Margaret Newkirk", "description": "The\u00a0White House seems to see an opportunity to exact a political price from Rick Scott, Greg Abbott, and other Republicans who continue to resist.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The\u00a0White House seems to see an opportunity to exact a political price from Rick Scott, Greg Abbott, and other Republicans who continue to resist.", "title": "Republican Governors May Pay Price for Refusing to Expand Medicaid Under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-23/republican-governors-may-pay-price-for-refusing-to-expand-medicaid-under-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iF7yQHbIHm4w/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The\u00a0White House seems to see an opportunity to exact a political price from Rick Scott, Greg Abbott, and other Republicans who continue to resist.", "title": "Republican Governors May Pay Price for Refusing to Expand Medicaid Under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-23/republican-governors-may-pay-price-for-refusing-to-expand-medicaid-under-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iF7yQHbIHm4w/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "The\u00a0White House seems to see an opportunity to exact a political price from Rick Scott, Greg Abbott, and other Republicans who continue to resist."}, "parsely-title": "Republican Governors May Pay Price for Refusing to Expand Medicaid Under Obamacare", "parsely-tags": "Texas,Barack H Obama,Florida,Standoffs,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NN9DC36JTSEA01", "parsely-author": "Margaret Newkirk", "date": "2015-04-23T12:00:03.170Z", "keywords": "Texas,Barack H Obama,Florida,Standoffs", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Texas,Barack H Obama,Florida,Standoffs", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-04-23T12:00:03.170Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iF7yQHbIHm4w/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-04-23/republican-governors-may-pay-price-for-refusing-to-expand-medicaid-under-obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f29\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is \u2018The Sopranos.\u2019 They\u2019re using bullying tactics to attack our state.\u201d Florida Governor Rick ScottTexas Governor Greg Abbott quickly joined forces with Scott.\nIn Tennessee, conservative lawmakers who control the legislature killed Republican Governor Bill Haslam\u2019s request to expand Medicaid earlier this year.\nThe bottom line: Florida Republican Rick Scott is picking a fight with the White House on Medicaid, even though he risks a budget hit.\nIn 2012, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government couldn\u2019t force states to expand eligibility for their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act.\nCMS won\u2019t say whether states that decide to expand Medicaid will get to keep their low-income pools."}
