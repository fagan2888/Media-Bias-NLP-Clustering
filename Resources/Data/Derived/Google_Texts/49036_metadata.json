St. Vincent's Hospital\n\nA team of Australian scientists made history Friday when they announced success in reviving dead hearts and transplanting them from cadavers into awaiting patients. The operation was a success in large part because of the perfusion-based machine that re-animated the still organs.\n\nDoctors from St. Vincent Hospital in Sydney say the hearts had stopped beating for a full 20 minutes before they resuscitated them and installed them inside a machine that supplies the non-beating heart with steady supplies of oxygen, which they\u2019ve dubbed the \u201cheart in a box.\u201d The team estimates the new method, one that has been in development for over 12 years, could potentially save 20 to 30 percent more lives.\n\nPerfusion isn\u2019t a new concept. There\u2019s a good chance if you\u2019ve ever needed the help of an EMT, part of the checklist in measuring your vital signs was seeing how fast the capillaries under your skin refilled with blood, going from white to pink. This replenishing is the perfusion. And it\u2019s what makes transplanting a dead heart possible in the first place.\n\nAfter the heart gets back up and running inside the machine, branded by TransMedics as OCS HEART, doctors remove the organ and inject it with a preservation solution, designed to keep the heart fresh, essentially, as it makes a new home in the patient\u2019s body. \u201cSo those two things coming together [the console and preservation solution] almost like a perfect storm, have allowed this sort of transplantation of a heart that's stopped beating to occur,\" Professor Bob Graham told ABC News. Graham is the executive director of the Victor Chang Institute, the facility behind the preservation solution. \u201cBefore that it wasn't possible.\u201d\n\nIn a world first surgeons at St Vincent's have transplanted a heart that had stopped beating .#9NewsAt6 pic.twitter.com/sIU1oRUI34 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Mark Burrows (@MarkWBurrows) October 23, 2014\n\nThe breakthrough comes just over a year after another world-first, when transplant specialists at University Hospitals Leuven, in Belgium, performed a double transplant that involved a patient\u2019s lungs and liver. In performing a routine lung transplant, doctors noticed acute liver problems. The patient then slipped into a coma, forcing doctors to remove the lungs and then the liver, because a liver transplant requires a healthy set of lungs.\n\nBut instead of putting the lungs on ice, as common practice would dictate, they turned to OCS LUNG \u2014 the same (and only) perfusion-based machine capable of keeping the organs alive. On ice, they would last no more than six hours. Inside OCS LUNG, they stayed healthy for 11 hours.\n\nOver in Sydney, the most recent patient marks the third success story within a few months. The first was a 57-year-old woman named Michelle Gribilas, who was bedridden before the surgery but now says she feels like she\u2019s in her 40s. The second was Jan Damen, a 44-year-old father of three. And the third, and most recent, patient is still recovering.\n\nThough the perfusion-based technology is commercially available only in Europe and Australia, where it\u2019s also being used in clinical settings, doctors say the technology is under investigation in the United States. In the meantime, the Victor Change Institute said in a statement that the breakthrough represents \u201ca paradigm shift in organ donation\u201d and has the potential to \u201cresult in a major increase in the pool of hearts available for transplantation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "heart, transplant, breakthrough, revives, dead, organ, giving, patient, new, life", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "There's only one machine in the world that can keep a heart or pair of lungs alive outside the body for nearly half a day.", "title": "Heart Transplant Shows The Near-Godlike Power Of Perfusion", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/heart-transplant-breakthrough-revives-dead-organ-giving-patient-new-life-307866", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/hearttransplant.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's only one machine in the world that can keep a heart or pair of lungs alive outside the body for nearly half a day.", "title": "Heart Transplant Shows The Near-Godlike Power Of Perfusion", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/heart-transplant-breakthrough-revives-dead-organ-giving-patient-new-life-307866", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/hearttransplant.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/24/hearttransplant.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-10-24T10:26:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-24T10:26:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "There's only one machine in the world that can keep a heart or pair of lungs alive outside the body for nearly half a day."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd40\"", "article_summary": "The patient then slipped into a coma, forcing doctors to remove the lungs and then the liver, because a liver transplant requires a healthy set of lungs.\nIn performing a routine lung transplant, doctors noticed acute liver problems.\nThere's only one machine in the world that can keep a heart or pair of lungs alive outside the body for nearly half a day.\nThe operation was a success in large part because of the perfusion-based machine that re-animated the still organs.\nSt. Vincent's HospitalA team of Australian scientists made history Friday when they announced success in reviving dead hearts and transplanting them from cadavers into awaiting patients."}
