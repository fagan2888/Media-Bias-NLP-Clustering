Chapman, 31, hasn\u2019t had insurance since he was 18, but signed up for Medicaid, which, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, is now available to single adults making less than $15,000.\n\nDavid Chapman, 31, hasn\u2019t had health insurance since he was 18, when he aged out of his parents\u2019 plan.\n\nFor the past 13 years Chapman has lived in shelters and tent camps and spent some time in jail. Whenever he needed medical care he went to the emergency room.\n\nIn 2004, he tore a rotator cuff and walked out of the ER with pain killers, his arm in a sling.\n\nIn 2010, after he fell off a skateboard and got a hernia, he ended up in the ER again. Another time, it was a 104-degree temperature, he said.\n\nOne thing remained the same: On each visit, emergency room doctors sent him away with a prescription he couldn\u2019t fill or a referral to a specialist that he couldn\u2019t afford.\n\nIn January, that could change.\n\nChapman is one of an estimated 7,000 homeless people in King County and 8.7 million people nationwide who could qualify for Medicaid on Jan. 1 thanks to the Affordable Care Act. If he gets a Medicaid card, Chapman will pay nothing for his health care.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, expands Medicaid coverage to anyone living at 138 percent of the federal poverty level, about $15,000 a year for a single adult.\n\nBeginning Oct. 1, staff and volunteers from Seattle-King County Public Health and a number of nonprofits serving homeless people fanned out to food banks, day centers and meal programs looking for other people like Chapman.\n\nChapman arrived at Transform Burien\u2019s hot-meal program on a recent Wednesday, intending to eat some casserole in the community center while his girlfriend had a dental appointment outside, at King County\u2019s Mobile Medical Clinic. Instead, he found himself meeting with Whitney Walker, an outreach specialist for HealthPoint, a nonprofit community clinic, who was there to find new Medicaid clients.\n\nWalker will spend the next three months helping people fill out Medicaid applications.\n\nShe said she was so excited about the work that she couldn\u2019t sleep the night before: \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been waiting for for the last year.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Health Care Authority, which is overseeing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion in Washington, allocated $6 million to train outreach workers like Walker to assist people in filling out their applications.\n\nDozens of others around the county are doing the same. The Downtown Emergency Services Center trained 28 of its staff members to help the organization\u2019s more than 2,000 clients sign up. Staff at Evergreen Treatment Center were also trained to engage the 500 clients it serves.\n\nOutreach workers got off to a slow start. The state\u2019s computer system was overloaded with people signing up for insurance.\n\nSo instead of using a computer, Walker pulled out a nine-page paper application. She and another HealthPoint outreach worker met with about a dozen people, slowly writing out the forms, which they would later input into a computer.\n\nThey expect most of the people they meet will qualify for the program and have a Medicaid card by Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cI wish everything was working 100 percent, but I know we\u2019re going to get there,\u201d said John Gilvar, Seattle-King County Public Health\u2019s high-risk populations coordinator. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t really dampened our enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nChapman, by contrast, was nonchalant. He lives with constant back pain, he said, and needs surgery.\n\n\u201cIt was going to cost thousands of dollars without insurance,\u201d he said. He will use Medicaid to have surgery, \u201cif I can get the cost down,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dc": {"title": "Yes, they can"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0.0"}, "article_summary": "Whenever he needed medical care he went to the emergency room.\nIf he gets a Medicaid card, Chapman will pay nothing for his health care.\nDavid Chapman gets a checkup inside the King County Mobile Medical Clinic, below, on Oct. 2.\nDavid Chapman, 31, hasn\u2019t had health insurance since he was 18, when he aged out of his parents\u2019 plan.\nFor the past 13 years Chapman has lived in shelters and tent camps and spent some time in jail."}
