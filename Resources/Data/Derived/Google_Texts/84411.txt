In Trenton, Atlantic City is careening between bankruptcy and a state takeover. In Washington, it's a success story.

State Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester) has been pushing for a takeover of the city's finances, which have deteriorated as four casinos have closed. The issue gained currency as Gov. Chris Christie vetoed legislation designed to help stabilize the troubled city.

In response, Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian said he would discuss whether the city should file for bankruptcy. "It would be good from a financial point for Atlantic City to file bankruptcy," Guardian said.

It's a different story coming out of D.C. The Auditor took note of a fact sheet from the White House, issued as more than 250 mayors met with President Barack Obama while in town for the annual meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Among the highlights: Unemployment in the Atlantic City-Hammonton metropolitan area fell to 8.2 percent from 14 percent at the height of the Great Recession. Gas prices dropped to an average $1.74 from $3.57 in mid-2014. The number of residents without health insurance declined to 13.5 percent in 2014 fro 15.4 percent in 2013 under the Affordable Care Act.

"Atlantic City has come a long way since the depths of the Great Recession," the White House said.

Given the city's recent troubles, the Auditor wonders how far Atlantic City has really come.
