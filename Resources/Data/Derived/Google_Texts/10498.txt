If you’re headed to Beyonce’s gig in Washington, D.C., Wednesday, you might spot some folks carrying picket signs outside and taking issue with an aspect of the pop superstar’s performance.

But they won’t be protesting her lyrics or her outfits — they’ll be urging her to tell young audience members to sign up for Obamacare, Politico reported.

The scheduled protest is the brainchild of Rocky Twyman, also known as the guy behind the 2008 “Pray at the Pump Movement” to protest high gas prices. He was also the force behind the “Pray Without Ceasing Political Party.”

Twyman has organized other protests and notably claimed that God unleashed a magnitude 5.8 earthquake on the east coast in August 2011 to get lawmakers focused on job creation and a lagging economy.

But on Wednesday night, Beyonce is his target.

“Superstar Beyonce raised millions for President Obama during his 2012 campaign,” Twyman said in a news release, noting that his group plans on “urging her to use her enormous influence with youth to get them signed up (for Obamacare) before the December 23 deadline.”

Twyman and company said they “intend to bring healthcare.gov forms with us to be distributed to the loyal youthful fans that will be present waiting in in line to see the diva.”

Some of the signage you might see outside the Verizon Center?

“Beyonce, Obamacare is in Deep Trouble”

“Use Your Clout to Get Your Youthful Fans Enrolled”

“Beyoncé and Jay-Z Help President Obama’s Divinely Inspired healthcare Plan Succeed”

In addition, Politico noted that Twyman says he “takes issue with Christian politicians who are against providing low cost health care for 40 million people. They have forgotten the golden rule. The Bible specifically states that God wants us all to prosper and be in good health.”
