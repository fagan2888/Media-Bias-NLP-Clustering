By charging Medicare for what they deem to be medically necessary implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for certain patients, they may be at risk of fraud and its penalties. Last October, that hypothetical scenario became a reality for 457 hospitals.\n\nStuck in time\n\nFrom the medical community\u2019s perspective, the crux of the problem lies in Medicare\u2019s national coverage determination (NCD) for primary prevention ICD therapy. The NCD, revised most recently in 2005, outlines what the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) deemed reasonable and necessary treatment for its beneficiaries based on evidence from key clinical trials. Like most trials, they excluded some patients for ethical or practical reasons, making the results applicable to only a subset of the patients cardiologists treat in everyday practice. Over the decade, science progressed but the NCD remained unchanged, further widening the gap between regulations and clinical care.\n\n\u201cThe problem with ICDs is that our national coverage determination is out of date,\u201d says John D. Day, MD, director of Heart Rhythm Services at Intermountain Medical Center in Salt Lake City and\n\npresident of the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). \u201cAlso, 10 to 20 percent of our patients do not fit nicely into these very tightly defined clinical scenarios that the NCD covers. When you have a very legalistic interpretation, it leaves 10 to 20 percent of patients who we know will benefit with this life-saving therapy out of luck because the NCD is either out of date or too tightly defined.\u201d\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act included a vow to crack down on fraud and the many billions of dollars it costs the federal government. Using the False Claims Act as its enforcement tool, the Department of Justice (DOJ) expanded its targets from what Isaac D. Buck, JD, describes as conventional fraud to overtreatment, or care that Medicare sees as medically unnecessary. ICDs came under the DOJ\u2019s scrutiny after a study concluded that about one in five implantations fell outside practice guidelines (JAMA 2011;305[1]:43-49). The NCD requires, among other things, that cardiologists wait at least 40 days after a myocardial infarction (MI) and 90 days after revascularization before implanting an ICD.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most perfect examples of the era we are in in healthcare fraud enforcement, where no longer is it defined by intentional fraudulent schemes; it is defined by excessive medical care,\u201d says Buck, an assistant professor at Mercer University\u2019s law school in Macon, Ga., who studies the tension between clinical and legal standards. \u201cThe battle becomes who says what is excessive.\u201d\n\nNot so cut & dry\n\nOn Oct. 30, 2015, the DOJ announced that it reached 70 settlements totaling $250 million with healthcare systems and their 457 hospitals that the DOJ claimed violated the False Claims Act by implanting ICDs in Medicare patients contrary to the NCD. During the expansive investigation, the agency released medical review guidelines and a resolution model for hospitals that outlined categories, or \u201cbuckets,\u201d where it would not enforce penalties or seek repayment, plus the documentation hospitals were required to provide.\n\nThe buckets included scenarios such as coding \u201cMI\u201d in the prohibited timeframe that later was determined to not be an MI, and patients who met all of the criteria for a permanent pacemaker and an ICD except for the waiting-period limit. Coders sometimes misguidedly interpret an elevated troponin level as an MI when it actually is due to cardiac arrest, Day explains. Waiting three months after graft surgery to replace a pacemaker with an ICD may prove counter to quality care, adds Andrea M. Russo, MD, co-chair of 2013 ICD appropriate use criteria (AUC)\n\ndesigned to inform treatment decisions for scenarios not addressed in the guidelines.\n\n\u201cNot only is that not in the best interest of that patient but it can be dangerous for that patient because we know revisions have a higher risk of infections or problems occurring after that,\u201d says Russo, director of the electrophysiology and arrhythmia service at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, N.J. \u201cOn top of that, it would cost the healthcare system a lot more money than putting the ICD in upfront.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ reviewed \u201cclinical realities on a case-by-case basis,\u201d DOJ spokesperson Nicole Navas", "article_metadata": {"description": "A disconnect between best care and what Medicare is willing to reimburse for it has put some electrophysiologists and their hospitals in a bind.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rights": "TriMed Media Group, All Rights Reserved", "og": {"site_name": "Cardiovascular Business", "description": "A disconnect between best care and what Medicare is willing to reimburse for it has put some electrophysiologists and their hospitals in a bind.", "title": "The ICD Impasse: Medically Right But Legally Wrong", "url": "http://www.cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/electrophysiology-arrhythmia/icd-impasse-medically-right-legally-wrong", "image": "http://trimed-cms-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/articles/Businessman-uses-a-Telescope-%5BConverted%5D.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "keywords": ",Electrophysiology & Arrhythmia,", "twitter": {"description": "A disconnect between best care and what Medicare is willing to reimburse for it has put some electrophysiologists and their hospitals in a bind.

Douglas Zipes, Alfred Buxton, Andrew Epstein, Robert Myerburg, John DiMarco, Mariell Jessup, Sharon Hunt, Joseph Alpert, Rita Redberg and Harlan Krumholz.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Russo, who as co-chair of the AUC document was asked to meet with DOJ members but was not a consultant, commends them for making the effort to understand the clinical nuances facing physicians. \u201cThey really did due diligence,\u201d she says.Buck also notes that the DOJ seems to be \u201cgiving some leeway in an enforcement mechanism, which I think is a good thing. But then it also indicates how out of step the reimbursement standard is.\u201dThe DOJ emphasized that its resolution model did not replace or update the NCD. In a viewpoint article published after the AUC came out, Russo and colleagues also cautioned that the resolution model was applied retrospectively and that it did not give cardiologists a green light to disregard the NCD (J Am Coll Cardiol 2014;63[1]12-14). \u201cWe needed to do some kind of statement to help raise this awareness and help clarify that the AUC are not what is being reimbursed,\u201d she says. \u201cThe resolution of the DOJ investigation doesn\u2019t mean now you will be covered for these things, even if they decided not to [find] damages in that particular area.\u201dPolicy pitfallsThe authors offered options for cardiologists and electrophysiologists who decide an ICD that falls outside the NCD is medically appropriate: consider an external defibrillator; don\u2019t charge Medicare for the device or proactively contact a Medicare intermediary about the situation; or ask the patient to sign an Advance Beneficiary Notice acknowledging that he or she may have to pick up the tab. They advised documenting the case in the medical record with a detailed account of the reasoning, a strategy HRS advocates as well.\u201cThis has created a lot of challenges,\u201d Day says. \u201cWe are recommending that our members extensively document their decision-making process,\u201d including citations to findings that support use of the therapy. At Intermountain, \u201cif we have a patient who we know, based on medical science, will benefit but won\u2019t fit a very tightly defined, outdated NCD, our hospital is donating the device rather than risk retribution. That is not right, either, but that is what is happening in the marketplace.\u201dThe fear of a legal challenge for hospitals and physicians who want to treat outside the NCD may have other negative consequences as well, Buck points out. It may stymie the advancement of care in the field. \u201cIn the last 10 years, there have been presumably breakthroughs in the area where the old standard has become somewhat outdated,\u201d Buck proposes. \u201cIf we have a government agency or enforcement mechanism applying standards from 10 years ago, then that will basically completely arrest the standard-of-care development. That is a big concern.\u201dUltimately, Medicare beneficiaries may lose the most from this disconnect, according to electrophysiologists. Hospitals can negotiate with private payers in cases that don\u2019t fit within the scope of the guidelines to ensure their patients get appropriate care, but that option is not feasible with Medicare, Russo says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t give you room for more individualized patient care. \u2026You want to do the right thing for your patients, and you don\u2019t want the Medicare patients to get inferior care to private patients,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to treat patients differently.\u201d\u201cWhat has been lost in this [situation] is the patient perspective and access to care,\u201d Day agrees. \u201cThis gap is really putting patients and physicians at risk.\u201d\u00a0HRS and other cardiology societies are working with CMS to update the NCD, \u201cbut it is a slow process,\u201d Day says.Their experience with pacemakers may offer a tiny glimmer of hope. The 1984 NCD for pacemakers was updated in 2004 and then revised in 2013. With pacemakers, they assembled a consensus document that included \u201ca huge body of evidence,\u201d according to Russo. The data for ICDs in the three-month period after revascularization, on the other hand, is limited. \u201cWe clearly need more research in this area.\u201d", "creator": "@TriMed_Media", "url": "http://www.cardiovascularbusiness.com/topics/electrophysiology-arrhythmia/icd-impasse-medically-right-legally-wrong", "image": {"src": "http://trimed-cms-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/articles/Businessman-uses-a-Telescope-%5BConverted%5D.jpg"}, "title": "The ICD Impasse: Medically Right But Legally Wrong", "site": "@healthimaging", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "article_summary": "Over the decade, science progressed but the NCD remained unchanged, further widening the gap between regulations and clinical care.\nStuck in timeFrom the medical community\u2019s perspective, the crux of the problem lies in Medicare\u2019s national coverage determination (NCD) for primary prevention ICD therapy.\nBy charging Medicare for what they deem to be medically necessary implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) for certain patients, they may be at risk of fraud and its penalties.\nA disconnect between best care and what Medicare is willing to reimburse for it has put some electrophysiologists and their hospitals in a bind.\nThe NCD requires, among other things, that cardiologists wait at least 40 days after a myocardial infarction (MI) and 90 days after revascularization before implanting an ICD."}
