CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) - The city of Chattanooga is moving a police firing range to make way for a National Park Service management plan in the area.

City officials called a committee that met for the first time on Friday to devise a plan to relocate the firing range from Moccasin Bend.

The Times Free Press reports (http://bit.ly/1LYXZf7) the city has the challenge of finding a suitable location and setting aside money to pay for it. They say they want to find a place where residents won’t be bothered by the noise.

“We’ve got to figure out what it is we need and want and where and how, and then figure out how much that costs,” said Daisy Madison, Chattanooga’s chief financial officer.

The committee is made up of representatives from the police department, the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office, the Friends of Moccasin Bend National Park, the National Park Service, the Trust for Public Land, the city and the county.

Keeping the range on the Tennessee riverbank at Moccasin Bend would delay the National Park Service’s long-term plans for the area. The agency plans to incorporate the 33-acre area into an existing park. Another possible complication is the buildup of lead in the soil from firing range bullets.

The next phase of the Tennessee Riverwalk will eventually stretch from downtown Chattanooga to Moccasin Bend, where trails and other recreation opportunities have been proposed.
