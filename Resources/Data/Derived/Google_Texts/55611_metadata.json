Kelly Ayotte agrees with President Barack Obama on at least one aspect of fighting terrorism \u2013 that those on the nation\u2019s \u201cno fly\u201d list should not be allowed to purchase firearms.\n\nBut Ayotte and her Democratic challenger, Gov. Maggie Hassan, disagree on the extent of due process protections that should be afforded Americans on the much broader \u201cterrorist watch list\u201d before their firearms are taken away.\n\nAyotte last week opposed an amendment put forward by Democratic U.S. Sen. Diane Feinstein that would have allowed the government to ban the sale of firearms to anyone on the terrorist watch list. Ayotte opposed it, along with three Republican senators who are running for president \u2013 Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.\n\nAyotte\u2019s office said Monday she opposed the Feinstein bill because it did not provide sufficient \u201cdue process\u201d for those who feel that they are on wrongly on the list. Also, her office noted, the Feinstein bill would have gutted the underlying bill, which repealed several provisions of the Affordable Care Act and ended Medicaid expansion as of Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nAyotte instead joined with Republicans to vote in favor of an alternative bill sponsored by U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Cornyn\u2019s bill would have allowed the attorney general to delay firearms sales to suspected terrorists for up to 72 hours while authorities pursued a court order to block the sales permanently.\n\nAccording to Ayotte\u2019s office, Cornyn\u2019s bill also would have left the underlying bill's Affordable Care Act provisions intact.\n\nWhile Republicans say Feinstein\u2019s bill would have provided no recourse or due process for those who feel they are wrongly on the list, Democrats disagree.\n\nFeinstein has said that under her bill, those who are denied firearms \u201ccan take the Justice Department to court to overturn the decision.\u201d\n\nWhere the burden of proof lies is the key difference between the two bills.\n\n\"Kelly obviously opposes terrorists having guns, but the Feinstein amendment was a political stunt that would have eliminated the underlying Obamacare repeal bill, blocked critical funding for substance abuse and mental health, and lacked due process protections for American citizens,\" Ayotte spokeswoman Liz Johnson said.\n\n\"She instead voted for a measure that allows the Department of Justice to prevent known or suspected terrorists on the terrorist watch list from purchasing firearms while ensuring due process for American citizens who believe they are wrongfully on the list. Similarly, she supports ensuring that those who are on the no fly List, a narrower subset of the terrorist watch list, cannot purchase a firearm, provided there are due process protections for Americans.\"\n\nBut both bills failed, continuing the Washington gridlock on the gun issue even in the wake of the San Bernadino and Paris terrorist-related shootings.\n\nOn Sunday night, Obama said in his nationally televised speech:\n\n\u201cCongress should act to make sure no one on a no-fly list is able to buy a gun. What could possibly be the argument for allowing a terrorist suspect to buy a semi-automatic weapon?\"\n\nAfter Obama\u2019s speech, Ayotte tweeted, in apparent agreement, but with a key caveat:\n\n\u201cWe need to come together now and pass law (to) stop those on no-fly list from buying guns, with due process for Americans who are wrongfully on list.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, the Washington Post, citing the National Counterterrorism Center, a government agency, reported that there were 1.1 million people, many with multiple spelling variations, in the classified database as of December 2013. It also reported there were 47,000 people on the no-fly list, 800 of whom were Americans.\n\nAyotte\u2019s tweet, following her votes last week in favor of the Cornyn bill and against the Feinstein bill, prompted criticism from Hassan\u2019s campaign and the state Democratic Party.\n\nHassan spokesman Aaron Jacobs said the governor \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the Feinstein bill.\n\n\u201cMaggie Hassan believes it's common sense that a person who is too much of a threat to fly on an airplane should not be permitted to purchase firearms or explosives,\u201d he said \u201cKelly Ayotte's vote to continue allowing known or suspected terrorists to purchase guns and explosives undermines public safety, and it is extremely troubling that Ayotte would put Washington special interests ahead of the safety and security of the people of New Hampshire.\"\n\nThe Democratic Party questioned whether Ayotte was doing the bidding of the powerful National Rifle Association.\n\nThe party produced a 2010 NRA questionnaire in which the organization stated that it opposed \u201cthe use of secret lists to deny persons their Second Amendment rights\u201d and asked candidates to state whether they agree or disagree with the NRA.\n\nWhile Ayotte\u2019s position on the specific question is unclear, the NHDP pointed out that Ayotte in 2010 received an \u201cA\u201d rating from the NRA.\n\nState Democratic Party Chairman Raymond Buckley asked if her vote against the Feinstein amendment \u201cwas the result of a secret 2010 campaign pledge to the NRA.\u201d\n\n\"The legislation referenced in the NRA questionnaire is the same as what Feinstein proposed, which Kelly opposed,\" Ayotte spokeswoman Johnson said. \"Kelly believes that Americans' constitutional rights should not be denied because of watch lists, which is why she voted to preserve due process protections for Americans who believe they are wrongfully on the terrorist watch list.\"\n\nDemocratic Party spokeswoman Melissa Miller said the Cornyn bill, backed by Ayotte, \u201cis a sham Republican alternative.\"\n\nAyotte\u2019s campaign responded by criticizing Hassan, calling her \"woefully ill-equipped to make decisions about keeping our country safe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 07 Dec 2015 18:00:00 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "U.S. Sen.
