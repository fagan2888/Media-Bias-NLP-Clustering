And many states remain in Common Core, adding to the testing burden.\u201d\n\nObama announced the plan in a video message posted to Facebook, vowing to work with school districts to ensure that students are taking only tests that supplement quality teaching and learning.\n\n\u201cOur kids should only take tests that are worth taking\u2014tests that are high-quality, aimed at good instruction, and make sure everybody\u2019s on track,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cLearning is about so much more than just filling in the right bubble.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Education conceded that the administration is partly to blame for \u201cunnecessary\u201d testing, recommending in its \u201cTesting Action Plan\u201d that schools cap the amount of time students spend on taking exams to no more than 2 percent of classroom time.\n\nThe department also called on Congress to \u201creduce over-testing\u201d after lawmakers voted last summer to reauthorize No Child Left Behind, the nation\u2019s Bush-era education standards that poured a wave of federal programs and testing standards onto U.S. public schools.\n\nBurke said the \u201cmost impactful\u201d piece of the plan is that it limits \u201cdouble-testing\u201d for students in eighth grade who, for example, passed an advanced placement math test but then have to additionally take the ninth-grade state math test.\n\nWhile the plan offers suggestions for school districts to follow, the guidelines are nonbinding.\n\nThe administration said it would issue detailed guidance in January advising states and districts on how to use federal money to assess the quality of their testing procedures. It will also provide advice on how schools can best use testing as an effective learning tool.\n\nThe administration\u2019s announcement came the same day as a Council of the Great City Schools report that evaluated testing in the U.S.\u2019s largest urban school districts.\n\nThe study found that the average student will take roughly 112 standardized tests before high school graduation\u2014about eight per year. Those numbers exclude \u201coptional tests, diagnostic tests for students with disabilities or English learners, school-developed or required tests, or teacher designed or developed tests.\u201d\n\nNotably, the study discovered \u201cno correlation between time spent testing and improved math and reading scores.\u201d\n\nUnion groups that have fought against mounting testing requirements and the use of test scores to assess teachers backed the administration\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal that the president and the secretaries of education\u2014both current and future\u2014are saying that they get it and are pledging to address the fixation on testing in tangible ways,\u201d Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said in a statement.\n\nWeingarten called the plan \u201ccommon sense\u201d but stipulated that \u201cthe devil is in the details.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Probably not.
