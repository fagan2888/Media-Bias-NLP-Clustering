Ted Cruz was one of the first to cheer on the idea when she took to Twitter.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cHas anyone compiled the definitive list of conservatives who should be blackballed for supporting Trump? I will if it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d she tweeted. She later listed an array of more than 60 names of conservatives to be shunned.\n\nAmid responses from some to create websites that would identify those blacklisted, The Blaze\u2019s Matt Walsh provided a philosophical justification for a blacklist, saying it is necessary to \u201cidentify the traitors and remember their names.\u201d\n\nThose listed by Walsh included Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, Bill O\u2019Reilly, Laura Ingraham, Sarah Palin, Fox News, Chris Christie, Ben Carson, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), The Drudge Report, Breitbart, Jerry Falwell Jr. and Robert Jeffress.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cWe do this not out of spite, but in keeping with the Bible\u2019s many warnings about false prophets. Scripture urges us to \u2018expose the unfruitful works of darkness\u2019 (Ephesians 5:11) and avoid becoming partners with those \u2018who deceive with empty words\u2019 (Ephesians 5:6). Colossians implores us not to be \u2018taken captive by deceit,\u2019\u201d Walsh wrote.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re warned in 2 Timothy that the time will come when people will not want to hear the truth, so they will surround themselves with frauds who tell them what their \u2018itching ears want to hear.\u2019 I believe we have arrived at that moment, and it is now urgent that we specifically identify these frauds and false teachers. This is not a fun or polite process, but it is necessary, so we must get on with it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nNot everyone is on board.\n\n\u201cThis is sophomoric,\u201d Alicia Powe wrote on Young Conservatives. \u201cBlacklisted?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like Trump is less ideologically pure than Mitt Romney, the father of Obamacare,\u201d Powe wrote. \u201cUnder the establishment\u2019s leadership we have Obamacare, a $20-plus trillion dollar budget, the weakest military in many decades, ISIS, a disastrous VA, and illegals coming across the border like they\u2019re crossing a street.\u201d\n\n\u201cDesperate times call for desperate measures, but is this the best they can do?\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo see such a tribal-minded movement coming from conservatives \u2013 who claim to be ardent defenders of the Constitution and freedom of expression \u2013 is especially disgraceful.\u201d\n\nPatrick Howley, writing on Breitbart, shared those sentiments.\n\n\u201cWhy not a \u2018blacklist\u2019 for conservatives who sold out the movement, and their own country, by embracing amnesty and the doctrine of open borders? Why not a \u2018blacklist\u2019 for those who wrecked the New American Century within three years by staging a trillion-dollar nation-building experiment in the Middle East?\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhy not a \u2018blacklist\u2019 for those currently trying to broker the convention to throw out the will of the people, or those who would rather support Hillary Clinton because at least they\u2019ll still be able to gin up donations for opposing her?\u201d he added.\n\nh/t: Breitbart", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This is not a fun or polite process...\"", "author": "Jack Davis", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"This is not a fun or polite process...\"", "title": "Revealed: Here Are The Conservatives The Establishment Has Blacklisted For Doing THIS", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 914, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blacklist.jpg", "height": 600}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/revealed-here-are-the-conservatives-the-establishment-has-blacklisted-for-doing-this/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"This is not a fun or polite process...\"", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blacklist.jpg", "title": "Revealed: Here Are The Conservatives The Establishment Has Blacklisted For Doing THIS", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-03-19T13:44:30-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Election 2016", "tag": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2016-03-19T13:44:30-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "conservatives, blacklisted, supporting trump, donald trump, republican party, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "Advertisement \u2013 story continues below\u201cHas anyone compiled the definitive list of conservatives who should be blackballed for supporting Trump?\nColossians implores us not to be \u2018taken captive by deceit,\u2019\u201d Walsh wrote.\n\u201cWhy not a \u2018blacklist\u2019 for conservatives who sold out the movement, and their own country, by embracing amnesty and the doctrine of open borders?\nAdvertisement - story continues belowIn the political version of The Blacklist, the alleged criminals are conservatives who have committed the so-called offense of supporting Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\nShe later listed an array of more than 60 names of conservatives to be shunned."}
