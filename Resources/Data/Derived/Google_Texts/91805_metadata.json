They found that heterosexual providers always implicitly favored heterosexual patients over lesbians and gays. Straight nurses held the strongest implicit preference for straight men over gay men, according to the study abstract.\n\nThe implicit preference by straight providers for straight people was moderate to strong, according to the study. The \"controversial\" implicit bias technique shows that people are prejudiced, even if they don't demonstrate that prejudice through their actions, according to a blog post published by Science 2.0. The test asked participants to endorse various statements about the type of people they prefer. Despite the results, the study also found that explicit preferences for straight over lesbian and gay people were weaker for all groups studied, according to the abstract.\n\nAs providers look to assess whether those implicit preferences affect patient care, a previous study also published in the American Journal of Public Health found that U.S. academic faculty medical practices lacked lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)-competent physicians. More than half of respondents in that study said their practices had no training in place to identify LGBT-competent physicians.\n\nResearch shows that sexual orientation can cause significant disparities in quality of care, along with race, income and gender, especially in rural areas. Such provider biases have prompted the transgender community to create a directory, TransRecord.com, rating providers on their knowledge and treatment of trans and genderfluid patients.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the Science 2.0 post\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLGBT-competent doctors few and far between\n\n4 ways to tackle healthcare disparities\n\nTransgender patients form their own health referral networks\n\nLatest Aetna marketing campaign targets LGBT community\n\nACHE 2015: Healthcare must focus on vulnerable populations\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whether or not they realize it, heterosexual healthcare providers are biased against LGBT patients, a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Journal of Public Health\u00a0found, but how those biases affect care is unclear.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Whether or not they realize it, heterosexual healthcare providers are biased against LGBT patients, a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0American Journal of Public Health\u00a0found, but how those biases affect care is unclear.", "title": "Straight healthcare providers unconsciously biased against LGBT patients", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/straight-healthcare-providers-unconsciously-biased-against-lgbt-patients/2015-07-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "bias,Care Delivery,care quality,Healthcare Disparities,LGBT competence,LGBT patients,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2ff\"", "article_summary": "They found that heterosexual providers always implicitly favored heterosexual patients over lesbians and gays.\nThe implicit preference by straight providers for straight people was moderate to strong, according to the study.\nWhether or not they realize it, heterosexual healthcare providers are biased against LGBT patients, a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health found, but how those biases affect care is unclear.\nStraight nurses held the strongest implicit preference for straight men over gay men, according to the study abstract.\nSuch provider biases have prompted the transgender community to create a directory, TransRecord.com, rating providers on their knowledge and treatment of trans and genderfluid patients."}
