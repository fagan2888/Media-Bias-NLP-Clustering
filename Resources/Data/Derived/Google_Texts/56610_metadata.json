Through the Neighborhood Lifts program, 272 families have been able to achieve home ownership, and in the past 18 months 1,000 formerly homeless veterans have been housed.\n\nIn education, a grant from the National Service Corporation for National and Community Service will support \u201cembedded workers to identify and navigate for students in need,\u201d said the mayor, \u201cin eight schools in the Flowing Wells, Sunnyside and Tucson Unified School Districts.\u201d\n\nFor Tucsonans who have time to volunteer, \u201cGo into the schools, become a mentor through Reading Seed, United Way and many other programs,\u201d urged Rothschild.\n\nAdditional panelists who spoke at the forum, which was followed by a Q & A, included Michael McDonald, CEO of the Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona; Peggy Hutchison, CEO of the Primavera Foundation; David R. Baker, Ed.D., superintendent of the Flowing Wells School District; and Julia Smith Grace, M.S., doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona School of Sociology.\n\nPanelists agreed that it\u2019s complicated to evaluate all of poverty\u2019s components. How does the poverty rate in other large cities compare to Tucson? \u201cTo say we\u2019re the eighth highest is too simplistic,\u201d said Grace, who led a recent UA study on poverty. The incomes of 200 randomly chosen local families may have classified some as poor, \u201cbut programs like food stamps help. We also have to look at what we\u2019re comparing, which doesn\u2019t address cost of living,\u201d she said, which is much higher in New York City than it is in Tucson.\n\nPoverty rates in different demographic groups must also be recognized. Tucson has a larger proportion than similar-sized cities of single parents, seniors, individuals with less than a high school education and Hispanics, all of whom have \u201ca little bit higher poverty rates across the United States,\u201d said Grace.\n\nPlus, \u201cincome is not a great measure of people\u2019s living standards. The families we interviewed didn\u2019t necessarily describe themselves as poor but used strategies like borrowing money,\u201d which, she said, \u201ccome at a cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoverty affects the standard of living in all of us,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cWe are impoverished because our neighbors are not able to fulfill their potential.\u201d Considering the issue of food security, \u201cwe serve 217,000 people in our five-county service area every year. We\u2019ve got to have government continue to do its part.\u201d\n\nHow society evaluates government programs for the poor, and how people are identified as poverty-stricken varies depending on who\u2019s looking. Hutchison pointed to misconceptions about people who live in poverty. \u201cSometimes we forget that people in poverty are working very hard to do better. There is a lack of equity of opportunity in our community,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m totally awed and overwhelmed by the deep struggles of working families in our community. It becomes like low-intensity conflict in a war zone. They get used to it.\u201d\n\nThe effects of poverty may be most apparent in schools. \u201cParents may hand off lunchboxes to kids at 7 a.m. when they come home from work,\u201d maybe from a second job, said Baker. \u201cI see the anguish in families when they don\u2019t have $5 for an arts club or for their kids to participate in athletic programs. I can\u2019t even imagine the toll it takes on those families to make those emotional decisions.\u201d The school superintendent wants to change that.\n\n\u201cWe have to be careful about the competition-based model [of education]. Some kids cost more to educate than others. Poverty is in that mix. I think we have to be really careful\u201d how we engage students in classrooms. \u201cSchools need to be more receptive to kids talking to each other, and that may be louder, not sitting quietly in rows,\u201d he said. \u201cKids need experiences to make connections, such as going to the top of Mount Lemmon, to New York City or to the Community Food Bank. I\u2019m also going to push inquiry-based science field trips.\u201d\n\nDuring the Q & A period, panelists spoke about how lives can change when relationships are built \u2014 for both children and adults. \u201cMany single mothers are rent-burdened, spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent,\u201d said Hutchison, adding that when they become first-time homebuyers \u201cthey start to get promotions. They start thinking about college. They start seeing themselves differently.\u201d\n\nIn her UA research, Grace found that a lot of people don\u2019t have access to full-time work. They may only be working 10 hours a week, possibly at a few different jobs, which doesn\u2019t make for stable family life.\n\nThe Community Food Bank \u201cis incubating food entrepreneurs,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cWhat if you grow a garden and sell food at a farmer\u2019s market? If a family makes $100 more a month sometimes that can make a difference,\u201d and it can also be a project that a family works on together.\n\nMcDonald stressed that people \u201cneed partners in assuring the common good. And that\u2019s called government,\u201d he said, recalling how the War on Poverty, introduced by President Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1964 State of the Union address, led to a series of initiatives signed into law, many of which are still in place today.\n\nStatistics from a Columbia University economic study showed that \u201cgovernment action is literally the only reason we [had] less poverty in 2012 than we did in 1967,\u201d when data started to be collected on the effects of government programs, such as the Food Stamp Act of 1964, the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid, and many education initiatives, Dylan Matthews wrote in the Washington Post in January 2014.\n\nSetting Tucson schoolchildren on a path of community involvement, said Baker, can help change lives. As a school superintendent, for example, he nominates students to serve on the Federation\u2019s Jewish-Latino Teen Coalition every year, (see azjewishpost.com/2015/jewish-latino-teen-coalition-showcases-multiculturalism-at-home-and-in-d-c).\n\n\u201cNo matter how much we test kids, that\u2019s not the whole story,\u201d said Baker. What makes a difference is compassionate relationships and \u201csharing our stories enough to influence policymakers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"locale": "en_US", "image": "http://azjewishpost.com/files/2015/05/Mayor-cmyk.jpg", "site_name": "Arizona Jewish Post", "title": "JCRC forum on poverty in Tucson highlights needs, progress, AZ Jewish Post"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#eef4f9", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://azjewishpost.com/wp-content/themes/azjewishpost-2015/assets/img/mstile-310x310.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc874\"", "article_summary": "The Community Food Bank \u201cis incubating food entrepreneurs,\u201d said McDonald.\n\u201cKids need experiences to make connections, such as going to the top of Mount Lemmon, to New York City or to the Community Food Bank.\n\u201cSchools need to be more receptive to kids talking to each other, and that may be louder, not sitting quietly in rows,\u201d he said.\nHow does the poverty rate in other large cities compare to Tucson?\nThe incomes of 200 randomly chosen local families may have classified some as poor, \u201cbut programs like food stamps help."}
