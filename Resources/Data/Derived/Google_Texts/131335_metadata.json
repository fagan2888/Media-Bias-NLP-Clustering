That means the insurers can set their premiums lower, at least theoretically. But, depending on the plan\u2019s design, consumers typically pay more, and sometimes much more, if they use a doctor or hospital outside the network.\n\n[Insurers restricting choice to keep costs down.]\n\nCompared with traditional employer coverage, exchange plans had networks with 42 percent fewer cancer and cardiac specialists; 32 percent fewer mental health and primary-care doctors, and 24 percent fewer hospitals, the Avalere analysis found.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report underscores the importance of consumers knowing whether particular doctors or hospitals are included in their plans\u2019 networks. Some plans, such as HMOs, don\u2019t permit out-of-network coverage.\n\nOther plans do cover care provided by out-of-network doctors and hospitals, but consumers pay more out of pocket than they would if they went to in-network providers. And in those plans, consumers may find that those costs don\u2019t count toward their deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums.\n\nInsurance companies tend to be excluding traditional, high-cost teaching hospitals and \u201cexpensive, prestigious providers\u201d from the networks, said Dan Mendelson, Avalere\u2019s chief executive. That\u2019s not necessarily bad for consumers, he said, because having several choices of providers does not always improve quality of care.\n\nA more tightly controlled network of providers could mean better management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, he said.\n\nA May study in Health Affairs found that California hospital networks are narrower in exchange plans than in commercial plans, but that the networks have a comparable or even higher average quality than networks of their commercial counterparts.\n\n[1 in 4 adults had insurance but still couldn\u2019t afford medical care]\n\nA poll last year by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that the people most likely to buy coverage on the insurance marketplaces were more willing than the public at large and people with employment-based coverage to accept a narrower network of doctors and hospitals in exchange for lower costs. In general, older people and those with higher incomes prefer broad networks, even if they cost more, while younger people and those with lower incomes are more evenly divided.\n\nAvalere researchers analyzed data submitted by the health plans for the largest rating region in each of the five states that had the highest enrollment in exchanges for 2015 coverage: California, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Texas. Avalere compared the average number of providers in exchange networks with commercial networks in the same geographic area for each of the five categories of providers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health-care exchange networks include 42 percent fewer cancer and cardiac specialists, study found.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Health-care exchange networks include 42 percent fewer cancer and cardiac specialists, study found.", "title": "Report: ACA plans have a third fewer providers than employer-based plans", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/report-aca-plans-have-a-third-fewer-providers-than-employer-based-plans/2015/07/15/6ee8ebf2-2b08-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/02/Business/Images/115278426-5659.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bylenasun"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/report-aca-plans-have-a-third-fewer-providers-than-employer-based-plans/2015/07/15/6ee8ebf2-2b08-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, Obamacare, doctors, hospitals", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lena.sun.90"}, "eomportal-uuid": "6ee8ebf2-2b08-11e5-a250-42bd812efc09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health, Obamacare, doctors, hospitals"}, "article_summary": "In these \u201cnarrow networks,\u201d health plans negotiate contracts with a select number of providers who agree to be reimbursed at lower rates.\nAnd in those plans, consumers may find that those costs don\u2019t count toward their deductibles or out-of-pocket maximums.\nThe report underscores the importance of consumers knowing whether particular doctors or hospitals are included in their plans\u2019 networks.\nCompared with traditional employer coverage, exchange plans had networks with 42 percent fewer cancer and cardiac specialists; 32 percent fewer mental health and primary-care doctors, and 24 percent fewer hospitals, the Avalere analysis found.\nAvalere compared the average number of providers in exchange networks with commercial networks in the same geographic area for each of the five categories of providers."}
