Most of those recipients were awarded the medal after being killed in combat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my mission. It\u2019s my ministry if you will,\u201d Fike said this week at a Denver national convention of the Military Order of the Purple Heart, an organization of veterans wounded in combat. \u201cI can\u2019t keep up.\u201d\n\nFike, who created Purple Hearts Reunited in 2012, has accumulated another 300 Purple Heart medals to deliver to families.\n\nThe service members\u2019 medals and other property often are lost in estate sales, found in basements and attics, or sometimes in pawn shops, antique stores or thrift stores if they are stolen. The medals keep coming at a rate of three to five per week.\n\nFike, 33, of Georgia, Vermont, is a 16-year veteran and an antiques collector. He was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, to parents who both served as U.S. Army drill sergeants.\n\nHis mother gave him a Purple Heart medal as a Christmas present in 2009.\n\nThe medal had been awarded to Corrado Piccoli, a private killed on Oct. 7, 1944, in Fremifontaine, France, near the border with Germany.\n\n\u201cI knew that medal didn\u2019t belong to me. And it sent me on a journey to find the family,\u201d Fike said.\n\nBefore he could do so, Fike was deployed to Afghanistan as a logistics officer. He was wounded in a rocket attack at Bagram Airfield in September 2010 and was awarded his own Purple Heart.\n\nBack home, he found Piccoli\u2019s family \u2014 and learned how the medal ended up in an antique shop where his mother bought it for $100.\n\nPiccoli\u2019s nephew had been given the medal as a family heirloom and placed it in a storage locker when he joined the Navy. He shipped out in the mid-1970s and, while on tour, his property in the locker was auctioned off when he couldn\u2019t pay the rental fee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A veteran\u2019s Purple Hearts mission began with gift", "title": "A veteran\u2019s Purple Hearts mission began with gift", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A veteran\u2019s Purple Hearts mission began with gift", "title": "A veteran\u2019s Purple Hearts mission began with gift", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/08/a_veterans_purple_hearts_mission_began_with_gift/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/purple-hearts-labor-of-love.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A veteran\u2019s Purple Hearts mission began with gift", "title": "A veteran\u2019s Purple Hearts mission began with gift", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/purple-hearts-labor-of-love.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "P.
