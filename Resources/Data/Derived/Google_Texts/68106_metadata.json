Rand Paul a leading figure.\n\nAt the State of the Net Conference, I spoke with this new leader in the Republican party, asking about what life would be like for innovators if he and his small-government brethren continue their rise to power.\n\nI kept it deliberately philosophical to understand how Paul will view issues in the future. Here are a few take-aways.\n\nScience Funding, If You Can Find It\n\n\u201cThe real explosion of the Internet was the lack of control,\u201d argues Paul, in response to my question about if the Internet\u2019s origins in military labs proves that government is essential to American innovation.\n\nPaul maintains that we shouldn\u2019t overestimate the need for government to support Silicon Valley. But, he\u2019s a fan of federal-funded science and technology, just so long as it doesn\u2019t add to the country\u2019s trillion-dollar-sized debt. \u201cI\u2019d rather spend the money on R&D if there\u2019s not a marketplace for that,\u201d he says.\n\nPaul is admirably consistent here; scientists freaked out over one of his early budget proposals to slash R&D funding, but calmed down after he brokered a deal with Democrats that would slightly increase funds for higher education and research (by finding other programs to cut, of course).\n\nCivil Liberties Galore And No Killing Of Hackers\n\nPaul infamously said that whistleblower Edward Snowden and intelligence director James Clapper should share the same jail cell (Clapper for lying to Congress). I pressed Paul on how he would treat information activists.\n\n\u201cThere do have to be some rules and there are some problems with disclosing secrets and people could die,\u201d he warns. But, security hawks \u201care calling for the death penalty\u201d for Edward Snowden, \u201cand I think that\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d\n\nPaul wouldn\u2019t commit to what punishment people like Snowden should receive. He is, however, suing the federal government to stop the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk collection of Internet and phone data. It\u2019s no shocker that under Libertarian leadership, national defense would be dramatically cut back and civil liberties would take center stage.\n\nAllowing Companies To Do Good, Stockholders Be Damned\n\nPaul thinks that Silicon Valley should have more leeway to invest in socially beneficial products. \u201cThere is a sense, particularly in young people, they still want to make money, they want to do things that are successful, but they\u2019re socially conscious.\u201d\n\nPaul says he\u2019s supportive of legislation to give legal immunity to B-corps, (Benefit Corporations), which would allow for-profit companies to invest in sustainable products, even if it wasn\u2019t the best way to optimize shareholder value. Stockholders \u201ccan always leave your company if they don\u2019t like what you\u2019re doing, but [business owners] should be able to do things, even if they\u2019re not the least expensive thing, because you think this is good for the environment.\u201d\n\nFederalism For Everyone!\n\nIt\u2019s a caricature of libertarianism to believe that it\u2019s only about slashing the government into the smallest possible slice of its former self. \u201cFederalism is that you devolve power, and the power is not all in Washington, it\u2019s in different places,\u201d Paul tells me, when asked about the future of small-government conservatism.\n\nUnder a federalist government, San Francisco could allow a drone to airdrop you a piping-hot taco, while New York City could choose to outlaw Amazon\u2019s new army of delivery drones. Silicon Valley has always had a separatist itch; a libertarian might give them more room to experiment.\n\nThough, in practice, Paul (and other libertarians) have valued no government over decentralized rule. Paul opposed the law that would allow states to collect Internet sales tax, which would have effectively hiked up everyone\u2019s pajama-clad Christmas shopping splurge about 7%.\n\nFederalism is a nice theory for now, but it\u2019s unclear how it could impact the Valley.\n\nPatents\u2026Pretty Much The Same\n\nDoes Paul see patents as a legalized monopoly? In a word, no. \u201cThere are libertarians that have written that you shouldn\u2019t have any patents \u2014 the market will just sort it out,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there ought to be protection for intellectual property.\u201d\n\nRecent attempts in Congress have tried to change intellectual property law, especially around patent \u201ctrolls\u201d and for software, but there are no bills with serious traction. Either way, this doesn\u2019t appear to be of serious interest to leading Paul and his ilk.\n\nUnions A No-No\n\nWe\u2019ve often noted that tech companies rank as the \u201cbest\u201d companies to work for, despite having no labor union. Unions have a rough-and-tumble relationship with innovation, largely because technology destroys jobs. Would Paul give beleaguered unions a helping hand, or does he think they\u2019re past their prime?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not opposed to the small guy organizing to have leverage against the big guy,\u201d he explains. But, unions have gone overboard, he says. \u201cLabor unions had their heyday; it was in trying to get rid of really horrific working conditions,\u201d he continues. \u201cI don\u2019t think they really have a place in the high-tech industry.\u201d\n\nYes, Libertarians Are Getting More Powerful\n\nThe right-wing traditionalists of the Republican party are getting thumped by tech-savvy libertarians. Tea Party founder Mark Meckler once explained to me how individualistic principles make libertarians so powerful on the net, \u201cBecause folks who participate tend to be so individualistic, what started to happen is, without anybody telling them, they immediately started to spawn hundreds and then ultimately thousands and then millions of web pages dedicated to tea party activity.\u201d\n\nPaul, whose father is an Internet political celebrity and former long-serving member of the House of Representatives, sees the same thing happening with his own base of support. \u201cI think there\u2019s a huge bunch of people who are a part of a leave-me-alone coalition,\u201d he explains.\n\nThough Silicon Valley leaders overwhelmingly support President Obama, Paul argues the political tides could change in his favor. His argument is worth quoting in full:\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve been out and visited Google or Facebook, when you go in, there\u2019s an atmosphere of not of structure, there\u2019s an atmosphere of, you know, not being able to go five steps without having food, or a nap, or play ping pong. It\u2019s less rigidity and more openness. I think people are attracted to that; it\u2019s sort of a libertarian sense, \u2018as long as I\u2019m not hurting someone else, let me do what I want to do.\u201d\n\nMy 2 Bitcoins\n\nBefore I praise Paul, let me first note that I am not a fan of libertarianism. I find it an unrealistic social philosophy. Our personal success is inextricably linked to the lives of our neighbors and the rest of the world. If they suffer, we suffer. If they do well, we do well.\n\nThat said, this modern strain of libertarianism is growing on me. Our government is terribly inept. The refusal of the White House to partner with the tech sector on the failed launch of the health insurance website, healthcare.gov, shows that we need a radical rethinking of government.\n\nSo, as long as Paul and his ilk don\u2019t recreate some Hunger Games-style version of ruthless capitalism that leaves the downtrodden without a safety net, and provides ample funding for education and research, perhaps our country could use a government diet.\n\nThere is still much more we need to know, but the direction is promising.
