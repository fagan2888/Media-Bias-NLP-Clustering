A bride and groom spontaneously joined a gun rights protest and their pictures are wonderful

This couple took “shotgun wedding” to a fantastic new level.

1,000 protesters had gathered outside the capitol building of Washington state on Saturday to rally against strict new background check laws for gun sales.

When a wedding party, which was not originally part of the protest, passed by, they couldn’t resist getting in on the action.

The bride and groom stopped for pictures on the capitol steps at the rally’s “violation station” where the rally encouraged residents to pose with firearms. An activist handed them an AR-10 rifle, and they handled it with style.

According to the New York Daily News, protest-organizers claimed these firearms were in violation of the new background check laws, but authorities said they were not in fact in violation and made no arrests.

The background check law eliminated previous loopholes for gun sales, and requires virtually all transfers to involve checks. A Washington museum has since been forced to close a WWII-era gun exhibit, prevented by the strict regulation from displaying the firearms.
