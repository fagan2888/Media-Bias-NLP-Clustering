Respondents \u2013 who participate on boards of publicly traded, private, and private-equity-owned companies as well as not-for-profits in the US \u2013 were allowed to list multiple areas of risk concern.\n\nAlmost three-fourths of all respondents (72%) listed reputational risk among those areas, nearly identical to the 73% who listed reputational risk in 2013. Meanwhile, cybersecurity and IT risk rose nine percentage points from 2013 to 62%, overtaking regulatory compliance risk, which fell six percentage points to 50%.\n\nPrivate company directors chose cybersecurity and IT risk as their No. 1 concern.\n\nSteven Kreit, a partner in EisnerAmper\u2019s public companies practice, said in a news release that regulatory concerns seem to have dropped following the rollout of legislation in the US such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen we take into account additional feedback from the participants, it paints a picture of boards coming to terms with both Dodd-Frank and health-care reform,\u201d Kreit said.\n\nThe survey was completed before two separate and opposing appeals court decisions Tuesday fanned the flames of the political debate over US health-care reform legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, rising cybersecurity and IT concerns create an imperative for senior management to get up to speed on risks related to the security of technology. While 74% of directors said their CEOs have a strong understanding of regulatory compliance challenges, barely half (51%) said their CEOs possess a strong understanding of cybersecurity topics.\n\nCFOs also were perceived by board members as more often having a strong understanding of regulatory compliance changes (79%) than cybersecurity (58%).\n\n\u201cGiven the results of the survey, we have a concern that boards need to have deeper intelligence about issues that might create reputational harm in their companies and must be better prepared to move quickly in the event of a problem,\u201d EisnerAmper CEO Charles Weinstein, CPA, said in the report. \u201cBoards recognise the potential harm, but they have yet to plan accordingly.\u201d\n\nAccounting standards remain a significant area of regulatory compliance concern for board members. As companies begin to digest the new, converged accounting standard on revenue recognition, which was released in May, 59% of directors said they are concerned or very concerned about accounting standards as an area of regulatory compliance risk.\n\nTax ranked second (57%) in areas of regulatory compliance concern. None of the other areas \u2013 health-care reform, Dodd-Frank, energy legislation, and environmental \u2013 exceeded 42%.\n\nRelated CGMA Magazine content:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the Risk?
