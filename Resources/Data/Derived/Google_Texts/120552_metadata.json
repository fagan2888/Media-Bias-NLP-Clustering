They have shifted its center of gravity from Athens to Savannah to Augusta. Barrow, who now has a permanent account with Two Men And A Truck, has deftly sent his challengers home each time.\n\nBut Barrow\u2019s campaigning prowess isn\u2019t the sole factor. Republicans have had difficulty producing a quality candidate \u2013 without running a cash-draining gauntlet. A grueling 2012 primary and runoff produced Lee Anderson, an affable state lawmaker and farmer so deficient in oratorical skills that his handlers didn\u2019t dare put him on a stage with Barrow.\n\nThe congressional district gave 55 percent of its vote to Mitt Romney. And 54 percent to Barrow.\n\nQualifying for the 12th District contest, along with hundreds of others, opens at the state Capitol on Monday. And history may be poised to repeat itself.\n\nFor the better part of a year, the Republican race for the 12th District has been a two-man affair between Augusta businessman Rick Allen, a self-funder, and former congressional staffer John Stone.\n\nThis was to be a neat package cleanly settled with a May 20 primary.\n\nBut Allen turned in a disappointing campaign finance report in January \u2013 showing a mere $78,311 raised over the last three months of 2013, and $100,000 in cash on hand.\n\nNow the GOP field has blossomed.\n\nLast week, Eugene Yu, a Korean-born former defense contractor from Augusta, dropped out of the Republican race for U.S. Senate \u2013 and into the close-to-home contest.\n\nBut the most interesting new face belongs to two-term state Rep. Delvis Dutton, R-Glennville, the young owner of a well-drilling company on the hard-right side of the House GOP caucus. His is the first signature on HB 100, a measure to prohibit the confiscation of firearms during a state of emergency. (The Augusta Chronicle this weekend has a piece on Dutton\u2019s past financial difficulties.)\n\nWe tried to catch up with Dutton over several days and were unsuccessful. But Joel McElhannon, a GOP consultant based in Athens, gave this assessment.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a presentable guy. He can talk farm \u2014 I see the appeal of that. [But] Delvis has never been tested before, never been in a campaign \u2014 a real campaign. This is a national profile, targeted, top-10 race,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat makes this unusual, McElhannon said, is that Dutton is the preferred candidate of the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2013 the multi-million dollar organization devoted to supporting U.S. House candidates.\n\n\u201cThe NRCC basically got Delvis in the race. They\u2019re running his campaign, ran his whole launch. They had a staff person on the ground in Georgia, coordinating his announcement,\u201d the consultant said.\n\nAn NRCC-tested firm is doing his media and polling, McElhannon added.\n\nWhy would this be important? Because an NRCC-backed candidate would essentially amount to a declaration of no confidence in the rest of the GOP field.\n\nWe sent an email to the NRCC in Washington, and got a call back from political director Rob Simms \u2013 who served as Karen Handel\u2019s chief of staff in Atlanta when she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cThe NRCC does not endorse or pick sides in Republican primary. Nor did we recruit Delvis Dutton,\u201d Simms said. But he acknowledged having an NRCC staffer on site when Dutton announced his candidacy last month.\n\n\u201cOur job is to talk to and have relationships with the candidates who are running,\u201d said Simms, adding that the NRCC has had similar contact with other GOP candidates in the 12th District contest.\n\nWe posed the same question to U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Coweta County, who is deputy chairman of the NRCC. Here\u2019s the quote from Westmoreland that his staff emailed back:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told (NRCC) staff that we need to stay out of that primary. I am convinced, with the field that we\u2019ve got, that our nominee, whomever that may be, can beat John Barrow in November.\u201d\n\nWestmoreland\u2019s statement seems to imply that an intervention in the 12th District has occurred \u2013 or, at the very least, has been discussed. The congressman\u2019s office declined to elaborate. (To be fair, Westmoreland was at a funeral on Friday.)\n\nBut it appears that, in addition to another expensive primary runoff, the GOP race for the 12th District also includes some upper-crust, closed-door dissension.\n\nSometime this week, the elusive Barrow will make his way to Atlanta, to re-up for his congressional seat. He will have his fingers crossed, hoping that another snipe hunt is about to begin.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/03/01/hints-of-turmoil-in-another-gop-effort-to-oust-john-barrow/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/032913-leg-photo-jg31.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "For the last several election cycles, Republican attempts to sack John Barrow, the last white Democrat from the Deep South in Congress, have had the feel of a snipe hunt.\r\n\r\nA scrambling in the dark, accompanied by a great number of stubbed toes, with nothing...", "title": "Hints of turmoil in another GOP effort to oust John Barrow | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
