Annoyed by Americans who resist the massive, corporation-backed push for a governmental takeover of healthcare, Organizing for Action sent out a Friday email blast touting a new bumper sticker mocking the tea party, titled “Don’t Tread on My Obamacare.”

“Show the world you’re proud of health care reform,” OFA’s site headline reads. The sticker is shown below in a series of photos: stuck onto the back of a green smart car, slapped onto the front of a recycled cardboard journal and covering the Apple logo on a laptop at a rakish angle, clearly meant to convey the supporter’s snarky yet compassionate political views.

“This is for everyone who’s tired of hearing the other side talk smack about the health care reform that is helping millions of Americans get affordable, quality care,” executive director Jon Carson said in OFA’s email release. “They’ve spent hundreds of millions to tear it down. We’ve worked hard to make sure they didn’t succeed. If you’re like me, you’re pretty proud of that. Wanna brag about it? Simply connect with OFA on Facebook today and tell us where to send your sticker.”

OFA’s “Truth Team” is behind the stunt. A video on their landing page features former deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutter scolding Obamacare opponents for “wasting time and money.” (RELATED: Crossfire Review #1)
