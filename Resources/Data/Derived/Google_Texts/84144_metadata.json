So certainly there is a little bit of a genetic component to that, but as we get older the collagen in the skin starts to break down and certainly gravity starts to work on us too,\u201d Kirschner said.\n\nKirschner specializes in eyelid lifts or blepharoplasty.\n\nWith 200 procedures a year, it's the bulk of his practice.\n\n\"Medicare covers this procedure but most insurance carriers do as well. However there are certain requirements that we look at when evaluating patients for these procedures,\u201d said Kirschner.\n\nPrivate insurance companies require Kirschner and other doctors to submit for authorization of the procedure. They evaluate the medical benefits before giving the OK, but that's not how it works with Medicare, which Kirchner explains has no pre-authorization requirement for eyelid lifts.\n\nHe makes every candidate undergo a comprehensive eye exam, a visual field test and submit to photographs, and he says he turns patients away.\n\nIt's most important to rule in who's right for the surgery and rule out who's wrong for the surgery,\u201d Kirschner said.\n\n\u201cI took the test, and he said, \u2018You're in good shape. You're a good candidate.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn average, the surgery costs about $3,000. Tinney paid just $50, because he's enrolled in Medicare.\n\n\u201cI'm glad I done it,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, the Center for Public Integrity raised concerns about the way the procedures were being handled from 2001 to 2011. The report notes eyelid lifts paid for by Medicare more than tripled. 136,000 people now get the procedure annually with an $80 million taxpayer price tag.\n\n\u201cIt's breathtaking that you can go from $20 million to $80 million in a 10-year period. That's an amazing amount of taxpayer dollars,\u201d said State Rep. Cameron Henry.\n\nHenry is one of the more conservative members of the Louisiana Legislature, and he's been a watchdog when it comes to any kind of government spending that may be under-regulated. Henry understands there is a medical need for the procedure, but when nationwide statistics show some doctors performing thousands of eyelid lifts per year, he feels more monitoring is needed.\n\n\u201cYou just have to make sure the people who need it are getting the surgery and the people that don't need it are not getting the surgery. That's it. It's just making sure nobody is taking advantage of the system. It seems like some doctors at 2,200 surgeries in a year have found a loophole and are taking advantage of the system, and that penalizes everyone,\u201d Henry said.\n\nWDSU reached out to the government agency, and they issued the following statement:\n\n\"The Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services takes seriously allegations of any abuse of Medicare benefits, and we have in place a series of tools to spot and stop fraud. We believe these tools, including sophisticated data analytics and stronger enrollment and screening requirements for health care providers, made possible by provisions of the affordable care act, will protect the Medicare trust fund.\"\n\nLawmakers say with Medicare on life support and set to go bankrupt in just over 10 years, reforms can't happen fast enough.\n\n\u201cIf this continues, eventually you run out of money, and that's kind of where we're headed,\u201d said Henry.\n\nThese eyelid surgeries are performed all over the country, yet according to the center for public integrity, 11 of the 20 highest billers in 2008 were in Florida, a haven for seniors and also a place under the microscope for questionable Medicare billing.\n\nThis follows a trend in terms of the use of Medicare. In 2007, 925,000 doctors billed Medicare for their services.\n\nIn 2011, that number jumped to 1.25 million.\n\nSign up for our email newsletters to get breaking news right in your inbox.
