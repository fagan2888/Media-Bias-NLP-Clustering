Reuters\n\nOfficials in Tokyo have announced that radiation leaks related to the Fukushima power plant disaster will not compromise the safety of the 2020 Olympics.\n\nIn a letter obtained by the Associated Press, bid leader Tsunekazu Takeda stated that radiation levels surrounding the capital of Japan are not only \u201cnormal and safe,\u201d but also equal to those of New York City, Paris, or London.\n\n\u201cYou might have seen news reports about the situation at the Fukushima nuclear plant, in the northeast of Japan. Please allow me to reconfirm that Tokyo remains completely unaffected,\u201d Takeda said in the letter. \u201cLife here, for all 35 million residents, is completely normal and safe and we do not foresee any change to that. The city\u2019s air and water are monitored daily and there remains no evidence at all of any issue, as confirmed by the Japanese government.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Nulcear Regulation Authority (NRA), the nearly 300 tons of highly radioactive water released into the environment from Fukushima have been estimated to total several thousand terabecquerels (a standard unit of radioactivity).\n\nThe NRA stated it will consult with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to determine if its level assessment is appropriate since the leak occurred in the wake of the meltdown crisis. In March 2011, a tsunami resulting from an earthquake damaged reactor-cooling systems and sparked three meltdowns at the plant. This accident has been recognized globally as the worst nuclear plant calamity since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee will make its decision on the 2020 Olympics location this Saturday in Buenos Aires, Argentina.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tokyo, japan, 2020, olympics, fukushima, radiation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Tokyo representatives tell the International Olympic Committee that radiation levels from Fukushima will not affect safety for the 2020 event.", "title": "Fukushima Radiation Leaks Won't Affect Safety For 2020 Olympics", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tokyo-officials-say-fukushima-radiation-leaks-wont-affect-safety-2020-olympics-255491", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/fukushima-radiation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tokyo representatives tell the International Olympic Committee that radiation levels from Fukushima will not affect safety for the 2020 event.", "title": "Fukushima Radiation Leaks Won't Affect Safety For 2020 Olympics", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tokyo-officials-say-fukushima-radiation-leaks-wont-affect-safety-2020-olympics-255491", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/fukushima-radiation.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/25/fukushima-radiation.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-04T13:35:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:09:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Tokyo representatives tell the International Olympic Committee that radiation levels from Fukushima will not affect safety for the 2020 event."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8f3\"", "article_summary": "Tokyo representatives tell the International Olympic Committee that radiation levels from Fukushima will not affect safety for the 2020 event.\nThe International Olympic Committee will make its decision on the 2020 Olympics location this Saturday in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nReutersOfficials in Tokyo have announced that radiation leaks related to the Fukushima power plant disaster will not compromise the safety of the 2020 Olympics.\n\u201cYou might have seen news reports about the situation at the Fukushima nuclear plant, in the northeast of Japan.\nIn a letter obtained by the Associated Press, bid leader Tsunekazu Takeda stated that radiation levels surrounding the capital of Japan are not only \u201cnormal and safe,\u201d but also equal to those of New York City, Paris, or London."}
