Oddly, there is still an option on OIR's website for the public to comment on an insurer's proposed rate changes, even if they aren't visible.\n\nBennett told CNBC that the OIR is not going to challenge the Florida insurers' claims of privacy, nor will it release that information about rate changes on its own. Asked if OIR believed the insurers were legally correct in claiming that trade secret exemption in not disclosing their proposed rates, Bennett said, \"A judge would have to decide that.\"\n\nHe said insurers are claiming the exemption under Florida statute 624.423 f.s. which can be viewed here.\n\nThe move by insurers means that Floridians, as opposed to residents of at least 10 other states so far, may not know what the Obamacare rates for 2015 will be until they are finalized, which is expected in late July.The other 10 states' insurance regulators have publicly disclosed what insurers want to charge Obamacare enrollees.\n\n\n\nBennett did say, \"Of the filings we've gotten so far, we have had some increases and we've had some decreases.\" He did not have information about what the range of those increases and decreases were.\n\nRead More US creates CEO position for Obamacare marketplace\n\nIronically, Florida's insurance regulator, because of a decision by the state legislature, does not have the power until 2016 to approve or disapprove Obamacare exchange-sold plan rates, unless they affect an insurers' solvency.\n\nBut because OIR has had rate approval over plans sold in the individual insurance market, the federal Obamacare regulator, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, does not have the authority to alter proposed rates for Florida plans sold on HealthCare.gov.\n\n\"We're accepting the rates as informational only,\" Bennett said. HealthCare.gov has not released the proposed rates for the 36 states that it sells plans in. The federal exchange sells Florida plans because the state opted not to run its own Obamacare exchange.\n\nFlorida Blue, the state's largest insurer and a major player on the Obamacare market, refused to comment.\n\nCigna referred questions about its rates to OIR. The other insurers who sold plans on the exchange last year and are seeking new rates had no immediate comment.\n\nUnited Healthcare of Florida, a division of UnitedHealthcare, said it would not yet disclose its proposed rates for 2015, the first year UnitedHealthcare will be selling Obamacare plans in the state.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Most insurers in Florida aren't disclosing their Obamacare rates for next year because they say they are trade secrets.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, insurance, florida, rate, premiums, secret, trade, disclose", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Most insurers in Florida aren't disclosing their Obamacare rates for next year because they say they are trade secrets.", "title": "Florida Obamacare rates still a secret", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/25/florida-obamacare-rates-still-secret.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/24/101785774-479745177.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most insurers in Florida aren't disclosing their Obamacare rates for next year because they say they are trade secrets.", "creator": "@_DanMangan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/06/25/florida-obamacare-rates-still-secret.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/24/101785774-479745177.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "No Obamacare sunshine: Florida rates still secret", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, US: News, Politics, Obamacare, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-06-25T14:22:45-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2014-06-25T18:37:05-0400", "tag": "Obamacare"}, "pageNodeId": 101785741, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef26\"", "article_summary": "United Healthcare of Florida, a division of UnitedHealthcare, said it would not yet disclose its proposed rates for 2015, the first year UnitedHealthcare will be selling Obamacare plans in the state.\nThe federal exchange sells Florida plans because the state opted not to run its own Obamacare exchange.\n\"Some insurers chose to put in zero,\" said OIR spokesman Harvey Bennett, whose state has nearly 1 million enrollees in Obamacare plans.\nFlorida Blue, the state's largest insurer and a major player on the Obamacare market, refused to comment.\nHealthCare.gov has not released the proposed rates for the 36 states that it sells plans in."}
