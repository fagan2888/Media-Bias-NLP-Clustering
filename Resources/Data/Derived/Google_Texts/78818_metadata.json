Reserve safeties Jasen Oden and Jake Schlager are expected to get more snaps with two usual starters, safety Kevin Pierre-Louis (ankle) and cornerback Bernard Blake (toe), banged up.\n\nThat\u2019s a scary thought, considering that CSU ranks 120th nationally in pass defense. The Rams secondary has particularly been burned when quarterbacks leave the pocket and then pull up and throw.\n\nOn the other hand, CSU fans \u2014 and perhaps coaches \u2014 may be ready to see what the sophomore Oden and true-freshman Schlager can do.\n\nColorado State, which should move the ball offensively, is a touchdown favorite. But any advantage for the Rams becomes reduced \u2014 or eliminated \u2014 Fajardo has a big game.\n\nTom Kensler: , tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State knows it must contain Nevada QB Fajardo", "title": "Colorado State knows it must contain Nevada QB Fajardo", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/09/colorado-state-knows-it-must-contain-nevada-qb-fajardo/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109__nevada-qb-cody-fajardop1.jpg", "height": 597}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109__nevada-qb-cody-fajardop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-09T12:48:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:40:32+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22c9\"", "article_summary": "The Rams secondary has particularly been burned when quarterbacks leave the pocket and then pull up and throw.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a really good quarterback,\u201d CSU safety Trent Matthews said.\nThat\u2019s a scary thought, considering that CSU ranks 120th nationally in pass defense.\nFajardo has thrown only two interceptions all season, and his career completion percentage of 67.7 ranks sixth nationally among current players.\nOn the ground, Fajardo has netted 411 yards and scored five touchdowns this season , with a long gain of 47 yards."}
