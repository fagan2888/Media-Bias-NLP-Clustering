ISIS-inspired terrorism had suddenly arrived in this country, touching off an intense national debate over security and immigration practices and prompting GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump to call for blocking all Muslims from entering the country.\n\nOn Wednesday, a new survey released by Morning Consult shows that national security has overtaken the economy as the leading concern of a plurality of registered voters. When asked to state their top concerns as they scan the field of 2016 presidential candidates, 34 percent cited national security as their single biggest concern, while 30 percent mentioned concerns about the economy.\n\n\u201cRepublicans, conservatives and \u2014 surprisingly \u2014 women are all more likely to pick security as their top issue,\u201d wrote Reid Wilson of Morning Consult. By contrast, Democrats were more inclined to cite the economy than national security.\n\nRelated: How Obama's Response to ISIS Is Boosting Trump and Cruz\n\nFrom a strictly partisan standpoint, the new polling results have to be good news for Trump and the Republicans headed into the 2016 presidential and congressional elections. That\u2019s because those voters who identified national security as their biggest concern say they would choose just about any GOP candidate over a Democrat running for a House seat next year.\n\nThose who say security is their top concern would choose a generic Republican candidate running for a U.S. House seat over a generic Democrat by a substantial 56 percent to 25 percent margin. Democrats continue to lead among voters who say the economy is most important, 41 percent to 34 percent. Overall, GOP candidates lead the generic ballot over the Democrats, 40 percent to 35 percent.\n\nIf that margin holds up, it would be almost impossible for the Democrats to make any significant gains in the House next year.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump Is No Sure Thing in Early Voting States\n\nAlthough Trump has kicked up a firestorm over his call for barring most Muslims from the U.S., he continues to lead in just about every national and statewide poll. In the latest Morning Consult poll, he\u2019s still leading among Republicans and GOP-leaning independents, with 41 percent of the vote. However, he doesn\u2019t do as well as some of the other GOP candidates in hypothetical matchups with Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new survey highlights a dilemma for congressional Democrats who are struggling to find an appropriate response to voters\u2019 heightened concerns about the safety of the country and to Republican criticism of President Obama\u2019s leadership and strategy for combatting the ISIS threat.\n\nThe New York Times reported Tuesday that many of the president\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill do not think he has been aggressive enough in confronting the terrorist threat to this country. And many Democrats were underwhelmed by Obama\u2019s Sunday night address to the nation from the Oval Office in which the president sought to reassure the country that his strategy for fighting the terrorists would prevail.\n\n\u201cThe president is trying to lay out a plan that is thoughtful,\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) told the newspaper. \u201cIt may not be robust enough.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Even after the horrific terrorist attacks on Paris in November that killed 129 people", "title": "It's Not the Economy, Stupid: The New Top Worry for US Voters", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/09/Its-Not-Economy-Stupid-New-Top-Worry-US-Voters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02102011_voters_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/09/Its-Not-Economy-Stupid-New-Top-Worry-US-Voters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02102011_voters_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Even after the horrific terrorist attacks on Paris in November that killed 129 people", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "On Wednesday, a new survey released by Morning Consult shows that national security has overtaken the economy as the leading concern of a plurality of registered voters.\nDemocrats continue to lead among voters who say the economy is most important, 41 percent to 34 percent.\nBy contrast, Democrats were more inclined to cite the economy than national security.\nEven after the horrific terrorist attacks on Paris in November that killed 129 people and stunned the world, concerns about the economy continued to dominate the concerns of U.S. voters.\nThat\u2019s because those voters who identified national security as their biggest concern say they would choose just about any GOP candidate over a Democrat running for a House seat next year."}
