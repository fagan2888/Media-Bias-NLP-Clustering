Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The moderator was CBS News political director John Dickerson, with support from Kimberley Strassel of the Wall Street Journal and Major Garrett of CBS News.\n\nHere is a partial transcript of the debate. Check back later for a complete transcript.\n\nDICKERSON: Good evening. I\u2019m John Dickerson. This holiday weekend, as America honors our first president, we\u2019re about to hear from six men who hope to be the 45th.\n\nDICKERSON: The candidates for the Republican nomination are here in South Carolina for their ninth debate, one week before this state holds the first-in-the south primary.\n\nGeorge Washington wrote that the truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains taken to bring it to light. We hope to shed some light on the candidates\u2019 positions tonight to help voters make up their minds.\n\nSo gentlemen, please join us on stage.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWith us tonight \u2014 with us tonight are retired neurosurgeon, Ben Carson of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump of New York.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFormer governor, Jeb Bush of Florida.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd Governor John Kasich of Ohio.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, as most of you have heard by now, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died today at the age of 79. He was the longest serving member of the court, appointed by President Reagan in 1986. Justice Scalia was the court\u2019s leading conservative, and even those who disagreed with his opinions regarded him as a brilliant legal scholar. Please join us and the candidates on our stage in a moment of silence for Justice Antonin Scalia. Thank you.\n\nWe will talk to the candidates about Justice Scalia and the road ahead when the debate begins in a moment.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nDICKERSON: Before we get started, candidates, here are the rules. When we ask you a question you will have on minute to answer, and 30 seconds more if we ask a follow-up. If you\u2019re attacked by another candidate you get 30 seconds to respond.\n\nAnd, here\u2019s how we keep time. After we ask a question, you\u2019ll get a green light. The yellow light means you have 30 seconds left to finish you answer, and when time is up, the light turns red. That means please stop talking. If you keep talking you\u2019ll hear this.\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nYou don\u2019t want to hear that. Joining me in the questioning tonight, my CBS News colleague, Chief White House correspondent, Major Garrett, and Kimberly Strassel who is on the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd, you can participate in the debate through our partnership with Twitter. Tweet us your questions and comments using the hashtag, \u201c#GOPDebate\u201d.\n\nSo, let\u2019s begin.\n\nFirst, the death of Justice Scalia, and the vacancy that leaves on the Supreme Court. Mr. Trump, I want to start with you. You\u2019ve said that the President shouldn\u2019t nominate anyone in the rest of his term to replace Justice Scalia. If you were President, and had a chance with 11 months left to go in your term, wouldn\u2019t it be an abdication to conservatives in particular, not to name a conservative justice with the rest of your term?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I can say this. If the President, and if I were President now I would certainly want to try and nominate a justice. I\u2019m sure that, frankly, I\u2019m absolutely sure that President Obama will try and do it. I hope that our Senate is going to be able \u2014 Mitch, and the entire group, is going to be able to do something about it.\n\nIn times of delay, we could have a Diane Sykes, or you could have a Bill Pryor, we have some fantastic people. But this is a tremendous blow to conservatism. It\u2019s a tremendous blow, frankly to our country.\n\nDICKERSON: So, just to be clear on this Mr. Trump, you\u2019re OK with the President nominating somebody\u2026 TRUMP: \u2026 I think he\u2019s going to do it whether or I\u2019m OK with it or not. I think it\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell, and everybody else to stop it. It\u2019s called delay, delay, delay.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Governor Kasich, I want to get your thoughts on this. Justice Scalia was a real believer, obviously, in the strict word of the constitution. Now, Harry Reid says that a failure to fill his vacancy would be, quote, \u201cShameful abdication of one of the Senate\u2019s most essential constitutional responsibilities.\u201d\n\nWhere do you come down on this?\n\nKASICH: Well, John, first of all if I were president we wouldn\u2019t have the divisions in the country we have today. I do want to take a second as we reflected on Judge Scalia, it\u2019s amazing \u2014 it\u2019s not even two minutes after the death of Judge Scalia, nine children here today, their father, didn\u2019t wake up. His wife sad, but, I just wish we hadn\u2019t run so fast into politics.\n\nHere\u2019s my concern about this. The country is so divided right now, and now we\u2019re going to see another partisan fight take place. I really wish the president would think about not nominating somebody. If you were to nominate somebody, let\u2019s have him pick somebody that\u2019s going to have unanimous approval, and such wide spread approval across the country that this could happen without a lot of recrimination. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, and I would like the President just to for once here put the country first. We\u2019re going to have an election for President very soon, and the people will understand what is at stake in that election.\n\nAnd, so I believe the President should not move forward, and I think that we ought to let the next President of the United States decide who is going to run that Supreme Court with a vote by the people of the United\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nKASICH: \u2026 States of America.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Dr. Carson. Dr. Carson, you, like others, put out a statement after the death was announced, and you said the president should delay.\n\nYou\u2019ve written a book on the constitution recently. What does the constitution say about whose duty it is here to act in this kind of a situation?\n\nCARSON: Well, the current constitution actually doesn\u2019t address that particular situation, but the fact of the matter is the Supreme Court, obviously, is a very important part of our governmental system. And, when our constitution was put in place, the average age of death was under 50, and therefore the whole concept of lifetime appointments for Supreme Court judges, and federal judges was not considered to be a big deal.\n\nObviously that has changed, and it\u2019s something that probably needs to be looked at pretty carefully at some point. But, we need to start thinking about the divisiveness that is going on in our country. I looked at some of the remarks that people made after finding out that Justice Scalia had died, and they were truly nasty remarks. And, that we have managed to get to that position in our country is truly a shame. And, we should be thinking about how we could create some healing in this land.\n\nBut, right now, we\u2019re not going to get healing with President Obama. That\u2019s very United Nationsclear. So, I\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nCARSON: \u2026 Fully agree that we should not allow a judge to be appointed during his time.\n\nDICKERSON: Senator Rubio, you\u2019re a\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Senator Rubio, you\u2019re a lawyer. Quickly, can you address the issue of whether the Constitution tells us who has the power to appoint Supreme Court justices?\n\nAnd then, also, the Senate Republicans last year floated an idea of removing the filibuster for Senate \u2014 excuse me, for Supreme Court nominations. You seemed open to that. What\u2019s your feeling on that now?\n\nRUBIO: Well, let me first talk about Justice Scalia. His loss is tremendous and obviously our hearts and prayers go out to his family. He will go down as one of the great justices in the history of this republic.\n\nYou talk about someone who defended consistently the original meaning of the Constitution, who understood that the Constitution was not there to be interpreted based on the fads of the moment, but it was there to be interpreted according to its original meaning.\n\nJustice Scalia understood that better than anyone in the history of this republic. His dissent, for example, on the independent counsel case is a brilliant piece of jurist work. And, of course, his dissent on Obergefell as well.\n\nNumber two, I do not believe the president should appoint someone. And it\u2019s not unprecedented. In fact, it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.\n\nAnd it remind us of this, how important this election is. Someone on this stage will get to choose the balance of the Supreme Court, and it will begin by filling this vacancy that\u2019s there now.\n\nAnd we need to put people on the bench that understand that the Constitution is not a living and breathing document. It is to be interpreted as originally meant.\n\nDICKERSON: Quickly, though on this question\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Very quickly, Senator, on this specific question, though. You were once in favor of dropping the threshold\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRUBIO: That\u2019s not accurate.\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 majority \u2014 you were never in favor of that?\n\nRUBIO: No, I\u2019ve never \u2014 there has been, for example, today, according to the changes Harry Reid made, appellate judges can now be appointed by a simple majority, but not Supreme Court justices.\n\nAnd I think today you see the wisdom of why we don\u2019t that want to change. Because if that were the case and we were not in charge of the Senate, Harry Reid and Barack Obama would ram down our throat a liberal justice, like the ones Barack Obama has imposed on us already.\n\nDICKERSON: OK. Thank you, Senator.\n\nGovernor Bush, I would like to ask you, conservatives for a long time have felt like that their Republican presidents have picked justices that didn\u2019t turn out to be real conservatives.\n\nBUSH: Right.\n\nDICKERSON: Bernie Sanders has said he would have a litmus test. He would you make sure that he appointed a justice who was going to overturn Citizens United. If they can have a litmus test for a nominee, what about you? Would you have a litmus test for a nominee? And what would it be?\n\nBUSH: Not on specific issues, not at all. I think the next president \u2014 if I\u2019m president, I will appoint people \u2014 I\u2019ll nominate people that have a proven record in the judiciary.\n\nThe problem in the past has been we have appointed people thinking you can get it through the Senate because they didn\u2019t have a record. And the problem is that sometimes we\u2019re surprised.\n\nThe simple fact is the next president needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record, similar to Justice Scalia, that is a lover of liberty, that believes in limited government, that consistently applied that kind of philosophy, that didn\u2019t try to legislator from the bench, that was respectful of the Constitution.\n\nAnd then fight and fight, and fight for that nomination to make sure that that nomination passes.\n\nOf course, the president, by the way, has every right to nominate Supreme Court justices. I\u2019m an Article II guy in the Constitution. We\u2019re running for the president of the United States. We want a strong executive for sure. But in return for that, there should be a consensus orientation on that nomination, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Barack Obama will not have a consensus pick when he submits that person to the Senate.\n\nDICKERSON: Right, so, Senator Cruz, the Constitution\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: So, Senator Cruz, the Constitution says the president \u201cshall appoint with advice and consent from the Senate,\u201d just to clear that up. So he has the constitutional power. But you don\u2019t think he should.\n\nWhere do you set that date if you\u2019re president? Does it begin in election year, in December, November, September? And once you set the date, when you\u2019re president, will you abide by that date?\n\nCRUZ: Well, we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. And let me say, Justice Scalia\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: Just can I \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to interrupt, were any appointed in an election year or is that just there were 80 years\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCRUZ: Eighty years of not confirming. For example, LBJ nominated Abe Fortas. Fortas did not get confirmed. He was defeated.\n\nDICKERSON: But Kennedy was confirmed in \u201988.\n\nCRUZ: No, Kennedy was confirmed in \u201987\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: He was appointed in \u201987.\n\nCRUZ: He was appointed in\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 confirmed in \u201988. That\u2019s the question, is it appointing or confirming, what\u2019s the difference?\n\nCRUZ: In this case it\u2019s both. But if I could answer the question\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: Sorry, I just want to get the facts straight for the audience. But I apologize.\n\n(BOOING)\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCRUZ: Justice Scalia was a legal giant. He was somebody that I knew for 20 years. He was a brilliant man. He was faithful to the Constitution. He changed the arc of American legal history. And I\u2019ll tell you, his passing tonight, our prayers are with his family, with his wife, Maureen, who he adored, his nine children, his 36 grandkids.\n\nCRUZ: But it underscores the stakes of this election. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states. We are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia\u2019s seminal decisions that upheld the Second Amendment right to keep and to bear arms.\n\nWe are one justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans \u2014 and the stakes of this election, for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee.\u201d\n\nAnd then for the state of South Carolina, one of the most important judgments for the men and women of South Carolina to make is who on this stage has the background, the principle, the character, the judgment, and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court? That will be what I will do if I\u2019m elected president.\n\nDICKERSON: All right.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nThank you, Senator Cruz. All right, we\u2019re going to move on to national security here, and we are going to \u2014 I want to read a quote from Secretary Robert Gates, former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served for eight year \u2014 under eight presidents.\n\nAnd this is what he said about Republican candidates, quote, \u201cPart of the concern that I have with the campaign is that the solutions being offered are so simplistic and so at odds with the way the world really works.\u201d\n\nSo, in that spirit, we\u2019re going to work tonight to be more specific.\n\nMr. Trump, I want to start with you. You have said as president, you\u2019ll get up to speed very quickly. You\u2019ll know more quickly as president than any of the experts.\n\nSo, you\u2019ve been elected president. It\u2019s your first day in the situation room. What three questions do you ask your national security experts about the world? TRUMP: What we want to do, when we want to do it, and how hard do we want to hit? Because we are going to have to hit very, very hard to knock out ISIS.\n\nWe\u2019re going to also have to learn who our allies are. We have allies, so-called allies, we\u2019re spending billions and billions of dollars supporting people \u2014 we have no idea who they are in Syria. Do we want to stay that route, or do we want to go and make something with Russia?\n\nI hate to say Iran, but with Russia, because we \u2014 and the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I have ever seen negotiated in my entire life. It\u2019s a disgrace that this country negotiated that deal. But very important\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNot only a disgrace, it\u2019s a disgrace and an embarrassment. But very important, who are we fighting with? Who are we fighting for? What are we doing? We have to rebuild our country. But we have to \u2014 I\u2019m the only one on this stage that said, \u201cDo not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq.\u201d Nobody else on this stage said that. And I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn\u2019t a politician, fortunately.\n\nBut I said it, and I said it loud and clear, \u201cYou\u2019ll destabilize the Middle East.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what happened.\n\nI also said, by the way, four years ago, three years ago, attack the oil, take the wealth away, attack the oil and keep the oil. They didn\u2019t listen. They just started that a few months ago.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Senator Rubio \u2014 just 30 seconds on this question, Senator Rubio. Are those the questions you would ask?\n\nRUBIO: No. I think there are three major threats that you want to immediately get on top of. No. 1 is, what are we doing in the Asia-Pacific region, where both North Korea and China pose threats to the national security of the United States.\n\nNo. 2 is, what are we doing in the Middle East with the combination of the Sunni-Shia conflict driven by the Shia arc that Iran is now trying to establish in the Middle East, also the growing threat of ISIS.\n\nAnd the third is rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe and in Eastern Europe, where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20 percent of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine.\n\nDICKERSON: Let me ask you a follow-up, a full, proper question, then.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nViolent extremists are operating or active in 40 countries. Some 80 countries are in different degrees of instability. And so, that\u2019s just the crises overseas. Barack Obama walked into an economic collapse when he came into office. We face international health crises, from Ebola to Zika.\n\nSo, there is a lot of opportunity for crisis, as you have talked about. What would you point to in your past to show voters that you\u2019ve been in a crisis and that you\u2019ve been tested when that inevitable crisis comes when you\u2019re president?\n\nRUBIO: Well, let me tell you what has happened a couple of years ago. One of the hardest decisions you\u2019ll ever make in Congress is when you are asked by the president to authorize the use of force in a conflict, because you are now putting your name, on behalf of the people of your state, behind a military action, where Americans in uniform could lose their life.\n\nSo, in 2014, Barack Obama said he would not take military action against Assad unless it was authorized by the Senate, beginning on the Committee of Foreign Relations, where I am one of its members.\n\nRUBIO: And it was hard because you looked at the pictures. I saw the same images people saw. I\u2019m the father of children. I saw the images of these little children \u2014 been gassed and poisoned by their own leaders and we were angry. Something had to happen, and there was the sense that we needed to seek retribution.\n\nAnd then I looked at Barack Obama\u2019s plan. Barack Obama\u2019s plan, which John Kerry later described as unbelievably small, and I concluded that that attack would not only not help the situation, it would make it actually worse. It would allow Assad to stand up to the United States of America, survive a strike, stay in power and actually strengthen his grip.\n\nSo it was a difficult decision to make and when we only had a few days to look at and make a decision on it and I voted against Barack Obama\u2019s plan to use force, and it was the right decision.\n\nDICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I want to ask you a question\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDr. Carson, you said you\u2019ve had more two a.m. \u2014 two a.m. phone calls than anybody up on this stage. But when those two a.m. phone calls came, you operated on a foundation of all of that amazing medical work that you did, all of that learning. So if you were to be president, though, you wouldn\u2019t have the political foundation that hones those instincts when the two a.m. phone call comes. So isn\u2019t that a liability?\n\nCARSON: No, it isn\u2019t. First of all, let me go back to your first question for me. It wasn\u2019t phrased as who gets to nominate Supreme Court appointees, of course that\u2019s the president. So I know that there are some left wing media who would try to make hay on that.\n\nSecondly, thank you for including me in the debate. Two questions already. This is great. Now, as far\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAs far as those two a.m. phone calls are concerned, judgment is what is required. And the kinds of things that you come up with are some sometimes very, very difficult and very unique. One of the things that I was known for is doing things that have not been done before. So no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before. That\u2019s where judgment comes in.\n\nAnd that, I think, is a situation that we\u2019re in right now, a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation, and it comes in very handy in those situations.\n\nDICKERSON: Governor Kasich, Russia is being credited\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRussia is being credited with bombing U.S.-backed rebels on behalf of Assad in Aleppo and Syria. They\u2019ve also moved into the Crimea, eastern Ukraine. You\u2019ve said you want to punch them in the nose. What does that mean? What are you going to do?\n\nKASICH: First of all \u2014 yes. First of all, look, we have to make it clear to Russia what we expect. We don\u2019t have to declare an enemy, rattle a sword or threaten, but we need to make it clear what we expect. Number one is we will arm the folks in Ukraine who are fighting for their freedom. They deserve it. There will be no ifs, ands or buts about it.\n\nSecondly, an attack on NATO, trumped up on any excuse of Russian- speaking people, either in the NATO countries or in Finland or Sweden is going to be an attack on us. And look, I think we have an opportunity as America to put something really great together again.\n\nThe Egyptians, the Saudis, the Jordanians, the Gulf states, they all know they\u2019re at risk. We need to look into Europe, we look at France, we look at Germany and the migrants. We look at Belgium, we look at Britain. Everybody now is being threaten by radical Islam. We have an opportunity to lead.\n\nYou know, the fact of the matter is the world is desperate for our leadership. Sometimes they may \u2014 they may make a remark here or there that we don\u2019t like, but frankly, the world needs us. And we have an opportunity now to assemble a coalition of the civilized people, those who respect civilization, the rights of women, the rights to protest, to be able to reassert our leadership all across this globe again and make sure this century is going to be the best we\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nDICKERSON: Governor\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGovernor Bush.\n\nBUSH: Yes.\n\nDICKERSON: You said defeating ISIS requires defeating Assad. But wouldn\u2019t that also put us into conflict with Russia, a country that supports Assad? so doesn\u2019t that mean effectively Assad\u2019s there to stay?\n\nBUSH: No, it doesn\u2019t, and that\u2019s the problem. The lack of leadership in this country by Barack Obama, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, thinking that this is a policy that works, this policy of containment with ISIS. It\u2019s a complete, unmitigated disaster. And to allow Russia now to have influence in Syria makes it harder, but we need to destroy ISIS and dispose of Assad to create a stable Syria so that the four million refugees aren\u2019t a breeding ground for Islamic jihadists.\n\nThis is the problem. Donald Trump brought up the fact that he would \u2014 he\u2019d want to accommodate Russia. Russia is not taking out ISIS. They\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re attacking our \u2014 our \u2014 our team, the team that we\u2019ve been training and the team that we\u2019ve been supporting. It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that Russia could be a positive partner in this. They are on the run. They are making \u2014 every time we step back, they\u2019re on the run.\n\nBUSH: The question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do \u2014 what three things would you do.\n\nI would restore the military, the sequester needs to be reversed. I would have a strategy to destroy ISIS, and I would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to Iran\u2019s ambitions, and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for Iran to do what it\u2019s doing, which is to move towards a nuclear weapon.\n\nThose three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nBUSH: \u2026 in 2017.\n\nDICKERSON: Mr. Trump, you\u2019re\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Mr. Trump, you were mentioned here. You did say that you could get along very well with Vladimir Putin. You did at one point say let Russia take care of ISIS\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 (INAUDIBLE) called me a genius, I like him so far, I have to tell you. Let me just tell you this.\n\nJeb is so wrong. Jeb is absolutely self \u2014 just so you understand, you know what that is? That\u2019s Jeb\u2019s special interest and lobbyist talking.\n\nLook, let me just tell you something, Jeb \u2014 Jeb is so wrong. You got to fight ISIS first. You fight ISIS first. Right now you have Russia, you have Iran, you have them with Assad, and you have them with Syria. You have to knock out ISIS. They\u2019re chopping off heads. These are animals. You have to knock em out. You have to knock them off strong. You decide what to do after, you can\u2019t fight two wars at one time.\n\nIf you listen to him, and you listen to some of the folks that I\u2019ve been listening to, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve been in the Middle East for 15 years, and we haven\u2019t won anything. We\u2019ve spent $5 trillion dollars in the Middle East with thinking like that. We\u2019ve spent $5\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nTRUMP: Lindsey Graham, who backs him, had zero on his polls. Let me just say something \u2014 we\u2019ve spent \u2014 we\u2019ve spent.\n\nI only tell the truth, lobbyists.\n\nWe\u2019ve spent $5 trillion dollars all over the \u2014 we have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. you listen to that you\u2019re going to be there for another 15\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 Alright\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 You\u2019ll end up with world war three\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 Alright, Governor Bush, please respond.\n\nBUSH: The very basic fact is that Vladimir Putin is not going to be an ally of the United States. The whole world knows this. It\u2019s a simple basic fact.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH: They\u2019re not taking out \u2014 they\u2019re not even attempting to take out ISIS. They\u2019re attacking the troops that we\u2019re supporting. We need to create a coalition, Sunni led coalition on the ground with our special operators to destroy ISIS, and bring about stability. And, you can\u2019t do that with Assad in power. He has\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 We\u2019re supporting troops\n\nBUSH: \u2026 Let me finish\u2026.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026that we don\u2019t even know who they are.\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 OK, settle\u2026\n\nBUSH: \u2026This is ridiculous\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 We\u2019re supporting troops that we don\u2019t even know who they are\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 Alright, Mr. Trump, alright\u2026\n\nTRUMP: We have no idea who they are.\n\nDICKERSON: Gentleman, I think we\u2019re going to leave that there. I\u2019ve got a question for Senator\u2026\n\nBUSH: \u2026 This is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 Oh, yeah, yeah\u2026\n\nBUSH: \u2026 This is a guy who thinks that Hillary Clinton is a great negotiator in Iran\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 Let 44 million in New Hampshire, it was practically (INAUDIBLE)\u2026\n\nBUSH: \u2026 This is a man who insults his way to the nomination\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 44 million \u2014 give me a break.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 Alright, alright, gentlemen, gentlemen, let\u2019s leave it there so I can ask a question of Senator Cruz who\u2019s also running for President.\n\n(LAUGHTER) (APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Senator Cruz, you talked about the first Gulf War as being a kind of model for your focused, and determined effort to go after ISIS. But, there were 700,000 ground troops as a part of that, and you don\u2019t have a ground component to your plan. Why?\n\nCRUZ: Well, we need to focus on what the objective is, you know? You\u2019re question about the first three questions you would ask in this Situation Room. I think it is a problem if the president, commander in chief we\u2019ve elected does not have the experience and background to understand the threats facing this country coming in on day one.\n\nIf you look at the threats facing this country, the single gravest threat, national security threat, is the threat of a nuclear Iran. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve pledged on day one to rip to shreds this Iranian nuclear deal, and anyone that thinks you can negotiate Konami does not understand the nature of Komani.\n\nWhen it comes to ISIS, we\u2019ve got to have a focused objective. One of the problems of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton\u2019s foreign policy, and sadly, too many establishment Republicans in Washington, is they focus on issues unrelated to protecting this country. They focus on nation building, they focus on toppling governments to promote democracy, and it ends up undermining our national security.\n\nNow, with regard to ISIS, we need a commander in chief that sets the objective we will utterly defeat them because they have declared war. They\u2019ve declared a jihad on us.\n\nNow, what do we need\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nCRUZ: \u2026 To carry that out. We need overwhelming air power, we need to arm the Kurds who can be our boots on the ground, and if ground troops are necessary than we should employ them, but it shouldn\u2019t be politicians demonstrating political toughness. It should be military expert judgement carrying out the objectives set out by the commander in chief.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Very quickly, 30-second follow-up. You\u2019ve said that essentially the Kurds would be the American ground forces in there. The criticism that experts have on that is that the Kurds only can work within their territory.\n\nIf they take larger amounts of territory, you have an ethnic war with the Arabs. So the Kurds can\u2019t really do as much as you seem to be putting on their backs.\n\nCRUZ: We have Kurds in both Iraq and Syria. They are fighting ISIS right now. They are winning victories right now. ISIS is using American military equipment they\u2019ve seized in Iraq. And the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds, the Peshmerga, the fighting forces who have been longtime allies.\n\nWe ought to be arming them and letting them fight. Now if we need to embed Special Forces to direct our overwhelming air power, if it is required to use ground troops to defeat ISIS, we should use them, but we ought to start with using our incredible air power advantage.\n\nThe first Persian Gulf War, we launched 1,100 air attacks a day. Today we\u2019re launching between 15 and 30. We\u2019re not using the tools we have and it\u2019s because the commander-in-chief is not focused on defeating the enemy.\n\nDICKERSON: All right. Mr. Trump\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 on Monday, George W. Bush will campaign in South Carolina for his brother. As you\u2019ve said tonight, and you\u2019ve often said, the Iraq War and your opposition to it was a sign of your good judgment.\n\nIn 2008, in an interview with Wolf Blitzer, talking about President George W. Bush\u2019s conduct of the war, you said you were surprised that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t try to impeach him.\n\nYou said, quote: \u201cwhich personally I think would have been a wonderful thing.\u201d When you were asked what you meant by that and you said: \u201cFor the war, for the war, he lied, he got us into the war with lies.\u201d Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached.\n\nTRUMP: First of all, I have to say, as a businessman I get along with everybody. I have business all over the world.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nTRUMP: I know so many of the people in the audience. And by the way, I\u2019m a self-funder. I don\u2019t have \u2014 I have my wife and I have my son. That\u2019s all I have. I don\u2019t have this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: So let me just tell you, I get along with everybody, which is my obligation to my company, to myself, et cetera.\n\nObviously, the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake. All right? Now, you can take it any way you want, and it took \u2014 it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the beginning of his announcement, when he announced for president, it took him five days.\n\nHe went back, it was a mistake, it wasn\u2019t a mistake. It took him five days before his people told him what to say, and he ultimately said, \u201cit was a mistake.\u201d The war in Iraq, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, we don\u2019t even have it. Iran has taken over Iraq with the second-largest oil reserves in the world.\n\nObviously, it was a mistake.\n\nDICKERSON: So\u2026\n\nTRUMP: George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.\n\nDICKERSON: But so I\u2019m going to \u2014 so you still think he should be impeached?\n\nBUSH: I think it\u2019s my turn, isn\u2019t it?\n\nDICKERSON: You do whatever you want. You call it whatever you want. I want to tell you. They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction, there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nDICKERSON: All right. OK. All right.\n\nGovernor Bush \u2014 when a member on the stage\u2019s brother gets attacked\u2026\n\nBUSH: I\u2019ve got about five or six\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 the brother gets to respond.\n\nBUSH: Do I get to do it five or six times or just once responding to that?\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m being nice.\n\nBUSH: So here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019m sick ask tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH: And, frankly, I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me. It\u2019s blood sport for him. He enjoys it. And I\u2019m glad he\u2019s happy about it. But I am sick and tired\u2026\n\nTRUMP: He spent $22 million in\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUSH: I am sick and tired of him going after my family. My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH: And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe. And I\u2019m proud of what he did.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH: And he has had the gall to go after my brother.\n\nTRUMP: The World Trade Center came down during your brother\u2019s reign, remember that.\n\n(BOOING)\n\nBUSH: He has had the gall to go after my mother.\n\nHold on. Let me finish. He has had the gall to go after my mother.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s not keeping us safe.\n\nBUSH: Look, I won the lottery when I was born 63 years ago, looked up, and I saw my mom. My mom is the strongest woman I know.\n\nTRUMP: She should be running.\n\nBUSH: This is not about my family or his family. This is about the South Carolina families that need someone to be a commander-in- chief that can lead. I\u2019m that person.\n\nDICKERSON: Governor Kasich, would you weigh in on\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Governor Kasich, please weigh in.\n\nKASICH: I\u2019ve got to tell you, this is just crazy, huh?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nKASICH: This is just nuts, OK? Jeez, oh, man. I\u2019m sorry, John.\n\nDICKERSON: Why is it nuts? Talk about it. Give us your sense of\u2026\n\nKASICH: Oh, well, listen, I think being in Iraq, look, we thought there were weapons of mass destruction. Colin Powell, who is one of the most distinguished generals in modern time said there were weapons there.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: But, but, the fact is we got ourselves in the middle of a civil war. The Sunni, the Shia, and the Kurds, never gotten along. In fact, that country was drawn \u2014 the borders of that country were drawn after World War I by Westerners that didn\u2019t understand what was happening there.\n\nKASICH: The tragedy of it is that we\u2019re still embroiled. And, frankly, if there weren\u2019t weapons of mass destruction we should never have gone. I don\u2019t believe the United States should involve itself in civil wars. Civil wars are not in our direct are interest, and if you \u2014 and look, I served on a defense committee for 18 years and was called into the Pentagon after 9/11 by Secretary Rumsfeld to deal with some of the most serious problems that we faced.\n\nThe fact is, is that we should go to war when it is our direct interest. We should not be policemen of the world, but when we go, we mean business. We\u2019ll do our job. We\u2019ll tell our soldiers, our people in the service, take care of your job and then come home once we\u2019ve accomplished our goals.\n\nThat\u2019s what we need to do.\n\nDICKERSON: Thirty seconds, Senator Rubio.\n\nRUBIO: I just want to say, at least on behalf of me and my family, I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nAnd you can \u2014 I think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things, but he kept us safe. And not only did he keep us safe, but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein was in violation of U.N. resolutions, in open violation, and the world wouldn\u2019t do anything about it, and George W. Bush enforced what the international community refused to do.\n\nAnd again, he kept us safe, and I am forever grateful to what he did for this country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: How did he keep us safe when the World Trade Center \u2014 the World \u2014 excuse me. I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush. He kept us safe? That is not safe. That is not safe, Marco. That is not safe.\n\nRUBIO: The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn\u2019t kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him.\n\n(APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And George Bush\u2013 by the way, George Bush had the chance, also, and he didn\u2019t listen to the advice of his CIA.\n\nDICKERSON: All right, Dr. Carson, we have a cleansing\u2026\n\nBUSH: Can I just\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: We have a cleansing\u2026\n\nBUSH: I\u2019m not going to invite Donald Trump to the rally in Charleston on Monday afternoon when he brother is coming to speak.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want to go.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBUSH: I\u2019m rescinding the invitation. I thought you might want to come, but I guess not.\n\nDICKERSON: All right. Well, Dr. Carson, I have got a question now for you.\n\nA moment of pause here. You have said, Dr. Carson, that \u2014 referring to yourself that people bought into the idea that, quote, \u201cA nice person can\u2019t be tough on terrorists.\u201d\n\nYou have called for loosening the rules of engagement for the military, which could lead to more civilian casualties.\n\nSo, explain why those casualties would be acceptable in the fight against ISIS?\n\nCARSON: Well, first of all, let me just address the Iraq question.\n\nYou know, I was not particularly in favor of us going to war in Iraq, primarily because I have studied, you know, the Middle East, recognizing that those are nations that are ruled by dictators and have been for thousands of years. And when you go in and you remove one of those dictators, unless you have an appropriate plan for replacing them, you\u2019re going to have chaos.\n\nNow, fortunately, we were able to stabilize the situation, and it was the current administration that turned tail and ran and destabilized the situation.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nNow, having said that, in terms of the rules of engagement, I was talking about, you know, Obama has said, you know, we shouldn\u2019t bomb tankers, you know, coming out of refineries because there may be people in there, or because the environment may be hurt.\n\nYou know, that\u2019s just asinine thinking. And the fact of the matter is\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nYou know, we \u2014 obviously, you\u2019re not going to accomplish all of your goals without some collateral damage. You have to be able to assess what is acceptable and what is not.\n\nDICKERSON: All right, thank you, Dr. Carson.\n\nWe\u2019re going to have to take a commercial break here. Thank you to all the candidates. We\u2019ll be right back with CBS News\u2019 2016 debate in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nDICKERSON: We\u2019re back with the Republicans who could (ph) be president. The topic now is money and how the candidates would spend it. We\u2019ll turn the questioning over to Kimberly Strassel of The Wall Street Journal and Major Garrett of CBS news. Kim?\n\nSTRASSEL: Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: Yes.\n\nSTRASSEL: You have made a lot of promises and you have also \u2014 you\u2019re the only candidate who has said he would not touch entitlements. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that your ideas would cost an additional $12 trillion to $15 trillion over the next 10 years and that we would have to have annual economic growth of anywhere from 7.7 percent to nine percent annually to pay for them. Are you proposing more than you can actually deliver, at least not without big deficits?\n\nTRUMP: First of all, the \u2014 when you say I\u2019m the only candidate, if you listen to the Democrats, they want to do many things to Social Security and I want to do them on its own merit. You listen to them, what they want to do to Social Security, none of these folks are getting elected, OK, whether they can do it or not. I\u2019m going to save Social Security. I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from China. I\u2019m going to bring jobs back from Mexico and from Japan, where they\u2019re all \u2014 every country throughout the world \u2014 now Vietnam, that\u2019s the new one.\n\nThey are taking our jobs. They are taking our wealth. They are taking our base. And you and I have had this discussion. We\u2019re going to make our economy strong again. I\u2019m lowering taxes. We have $2.5 trillion offshore. We have 2.5 trillion that I think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2.5, they have no idea what they\u2019re doing or saying, as they\u2019ve proven very well.\n\nWe\u2019re going to bring that money back. You take a look at what happened just this week, China bought the Chicago Stock Exchange, China, a Chinese company. Carrier is moving to Mexico, air conditioning company. Not only the ones I talk about all the time, Nabisco and Ford and \u2014 they\u2019re all moving out.\n\nWe have an economy that last quarter, GDP didn\u2019t grow. It was flat. We have to make our economy grow again. We\u2019re dying. This country is dying. And our workers are losing their jobs, and you\u2019re going\u2026\n\nSTRASSEL: But in terms of\u2026\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m the only one who is going to save Social Security, believe me.\n\nSTRASSEL: OK. But how would you actually do that? Can I ask you? because right now, Social Security and Medicare\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Because you have tremendous waste. I\u2019ll tell you\u2026\n\nSTRASSEL: They take up two-thirds of the federal budget and they\u2019re growing.\n\nTRUMP: You have tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. That we\u2019re taking care of. That we\u2019re taking care of. It\u2019s tremendous. We have in Social Security right now thousand and thousands of people that are over 106 years old. Now, you know they don\u2019t exist. They don\u2019t exist. There\u2019s tremendous waste, fraud and abuse, and we\u2019re going to get it. But we\u2019re not going to hurt the people who have been paying into Social Security their whole life and then all of a sudden they\u2019re supposed to get less. We\u2019re bringing our jobs back. We\u2019re going to make our economy great again.\n\nGARRETT: Senator Cruz.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nJohn mentioned this is about dollars and incentives, we also want to talk about economic growth engagements. You have proposed a consumption tax, you called it the \u201cback tax. \u201d Some analysts compare it more to an attributed \u201cvalue added tax.\u201d\n\nFrom the perspective from economic growth in building wages, how does that work and how would you address those loan standing conservative concerns that something approaching the \u201cvalue added tax\u201d would be used to constantly increase those race to pay for future government spending and become an escalator of taxation not of growth?\n\nCRUZ: Well, let me say it at the outset that everyone here understands \u2013 everyone understands that how \u2013 that the middle class has been left behind in the last seven years of the Obama economy and we\u2019ve got to bring jobs back. We\u2019ve got to get people back to work. We\u2019ve got to get wages going up again. We\u2019ve got to get people moving from part time work to full time work.\n\nWe all agree on that but it\u2019s not going to be solved with magic pixie dust. It\u2019s just going to be solved by declaring into the air, \u201clet there be jobs.\u201d We actually have to understand the principles that made America great in the first place.\n\nNow, where do you get economic growth? If you look at cause and effect over our nation\u2019s history, every time we lessen the burden of Washington on small business owners, on job creators, we see incredible economic growth. You do that through tax reform and regulatory reform.\n\nMy tax plan \u2013 typical family of four , first 36,000 dollars you earn, you pay nothing in taxes \u2013 no income taxes, no pay role taxes, no nothing. Above ten percent, everyone pays the same simple flat ten percent income rate, it\u2019s flat and fair. You can fill out your taxes on a postcard and we abolish the IRS. If you want to see the post card, I\u2019ve got it on my website.\n\nGARRETT: Now the question \u2013 conservatives have sort of this idea conceptually for a long time but especially on this consumption value added tax system. In Europe where it exist, it has become an escalator of taxation to feed government spending and that\u2019s why conservatives have long resisted it. Why and what would you do as president to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen? CRUZ: Now Major, the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT. A VAT in Europe is a sales tax. The business flat tax is not a sales tax, it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business.\n\nOne of the things that\u2019s critical is we\u2019re doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax, with abolishing the Obamacare taxes, with abolishing the payroll taxes which are the biggest taxes paid by most working Americans and with abolishing the death tax which is cruel and unfair. And you asked about economic growth, the non-partisan tax foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would product 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone\u2019s income by double digits.\n\nThat\u2019s how you turn the country around, not just hoping and praying for it but implementing policies that work.\n\nSTRASSEL: OK, I have a question, a related tax question.\n\nSenator Rubio, you have the highest tax rate of anyone up on the stage in terms of the top tax rates, 35 percent. Some economists say, \u201cit would limit its potential to boost economic growth.\u201d You do that, so that you will have more revenue to pay for a tripling of the Child Tax Credit.\n\nNormally, it\u2019s liberals who like to use the tax code to insert social policy. Why should conservatives who want to tax adopt the other side\u2019s approach?\n\nRUBIO: Well, because I\u2019m influencing social policy, this is their money. This is the money of parents. You don\u2019t earn the tax credit unless you\u2019re working. That\u2019s your money, it doesn\u2019t belong to government.\n\nHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand, if a business takes their money and they invest in the piece of the equipment, they get to write to off their taxes. But if a parent takes money that they have earned to work and invests in their children, they don\u2019t? This makes no sense.\n\nParenting is the most important job any of us will ever have. Family formation is the most important thing in society. So what my tax plan does, is it does create \u2013 especially for working families, an additional Child Tax Credit. So that parents who are working get to keep more of their own money, not the government\u2019s money to invest in their children to go to school, to go a private school, to buy a new back pack.\n\nLet me tell you, if you\u2019re a parent that\u2019s struggling, then you know that fifty dollars a month is the difference between a new pair of shoes this month or not getting a new pair of shoes for your kids. I\u2019m going to have a tax plan that is pro-family because the family is the most important institution in society. You cannot have a strong country without strong families.\n\n(APPLAUSE) STRASSEL: Governor Kasich, this on is on size (ph) of government. In 2013 you pushed through a Medicaid reform in yours state over the rejections of many of the republicans in your state. Total enrollment and overall cost of program have gone well beyond what anyone had expected including yourself. How can you argue that this overall growth fits in with conservative ambition to significantly cut back on the size of federal welfare programs?\n\nKASICH: Yeah. Well, first of all, those numbers incorrect. We are \u2014 our Medicaid programs are coming in below cost estimates, and our Medicaid program in the second year grew at 2.5 percent.\n\nAnd Kimberly, let me tell you, when we expand Medicaid and we treat the mentally ill, then they don\u2019t live under a bridge or live in a prison, where they cost $22,500 a year.\n\nWhen we take the drug addicted and we treat them in the prisons, we stop the revolving door of people in and out of prisons and we save $22,500 a year.\n\nGuess what else? They get their lives back. And the working poor, they\u2019re now getting health care. And you know that about a third of the people who are now getting that health care are people who are suffering very serious illnesses, particularly cancer.\n\nSo, what I would tell you is, we\u2019ve gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. We\u2019ve cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion. We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private sector jobs since I\u2019ve been governor.\n\nOur credit is strong. Our pensions are strong. And frankly, we leave no one behind. Economic growth is not an end unto itself. We want everyone to rise, and we will make them personally responsible for the help that they get.\n\nAnd that is exactly the program we\u2019re driving in Ohio. And, boy, people ought to look at Ohio, because it has got a good formula.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGARRETT: Governor Bush, a question for you \u2014 but if you want to jump in, please.\n\nBUSH: I\u2019d like \u2014 can I \u2014 can I\u2026\n\nGARRETT: Jump in, and then I\u2019ve got a question for you.\n\nBUSH: Look I admire the fact that Governor Kasich is supporting spending more money on drug treatment and mental health. I think that\u2019s a high priority all across this country, but expanding Obamacare is what we\u2019re talking about, and Obamacare\u2019s expansion, even though the federal government is paying for the great majority of it, is creating further debt on the backs of our children and grandchildren. We should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWhen I was \u2014 as a private citizen, Florida was confronted with the choice. The governor was supportive of doing what John did. So was the Florida Senate. A committed speaker of the House asked me to go as a private citizen to make the case against the expansion.\n\nI did, and it wasn\u2019t expanded there, just as it wasn\u2019t expanded in South Carolina under Governor Haley.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGARRETT: Real quickly, jump in, because I have got a question for Governor Bush, but jump in.\n\nKASICH: Yeah, let me say a couple of things.\n\nFirst of all, when Jeb was governor, his first four years as governor, he expand \u2014 his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine. OK? It\u2019s just a fact.\n\nNow, with Obamacare, I\u2019ve not only sued the administration, I did not set up an exchange. And he knows that I\u2019m not for Obamacare, never have been. But here\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about Medicaid.\n\nYou know who expanded Medicaid five times to try to help the folks and give them opportunity so that you could rise and get a job? President Ronald Reagan.\n\nNow, the fact of the matter is, we expanded to get people on their feet, and once they\u2019re on their feet, we are giving them the training and the efforts that they need to be able to get work and pull out of that situation.\n\nGARRETT: Understood, Governor Kasich.\n\nKASICH: That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in our state.\n\nBUSH: South Carolina \u2014 South Carolinians need to know this, because the Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank him right at the bottom.\n\nGARRETT: Yeah, Governor Bush, fine.\n\nBUSH: And Governor Haley is ranked at the top.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGARRETT: Let me get in a question from\u2026\n\nBUSH: No. He mentioned my name.\n\nGARRETT: I understand, I understand. BUSH: Let me finish, though. No, no, no \u2014 hey, wait, wait, wait. Just hold Major, hold Major. Hold on, Major.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nBUSH: South Carolinians want to make that they elect the most conservative governor or candidate that can win.\n\nKASICH: Let me \u2014 let\u2019s tell you\u2026\n\nGARRETT: I have a question on economic growth, Governor Bush.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: Major \u2014 Major, we can\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019ve got to \u2014 look, I have got to correct the record. And the fact of the matter is, we went from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus. We\u2019re up 400,000 jobs. Our credit is rock solid.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\nGARRETT: A (inaudible), Governor.\n\nKASICH: Look, the bottom line is the people of this \u2014 of this country, and this state want to see everybody rise, and they want to see unity, and I don\u2019t want to get into all this fighting tonight because people are frankly sick of the negative campaigning.\n\nGARRETT: I know, understood. Governor Bush.\n\nKASICH: And I\u2019m going to stay positive about what I want to do from the\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGARRETT: Governor Bush, from the perspective economic growth \u2014 viewed from this perspective of economic growth, you have proposed a tax on hedge fund managers.\n\nThe Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative tax group you\u2019re probably aware of, has said no Republican should be for higher taxes on capital gains. And many conservatives wonder if this proposal of yours would undermine not only that philosophy, but undercut your projection of 4 percent economic growth annually under your presidency?\n\nBUSH: Of course, not. It won\u2019t have an impact on hedge funds managers paying ordinary income. In fact, it\u2019s not just hedge fund people, but people that are doing \u2014 they\u2019re in the business of investing other people\u2019s money, getting capital gains treatment is not appropriate.\n\nThey should be paying ordinary income. That\u2019s their business. They\u2019re grateful to be able to make a lot of money, I\u2019m sure. And what we do is lower the rates. It\u2019s not the end of the world that private equity people and hedge fund folks that are, right now, getting capital gains treatment for the income they earn, pay ordinary income like everybody else in this room.\n\nBUSH: That\u2019s not a problem at all. What we need to do is reform the tax code to simplify the rates, to shift power away from Washington, D.C. That\u2019s what I did as governor of the state of Florida, $19 billion dollars of tax cuts, and it stimulated seven out of the eight years. Florida led the nation in job growth.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Dr. Carson, before we go to break, could you give us your sense of this conversation about either MedicAid, or economic growth through taxation?\n\nCARSON: Well, first of all, let me just mention on the tax issue. Ben Carson.com, go read about it because my tax plan has been praised by Kato, by Wall Street Journal. Forbes said it is the best, the most pro-growth tax plan, and it\u2019s based on real fairness for everybody. Starts at the 150% poverty level, but even the people below that have to pay something because everybody has to have skin in the game, and the millions of people can\u2019t, you know, talk about what other people have to pay and have no skin in the game.\n\nAnd, it deals with corporate tax rate, and makes it the same as everybody else\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nCARSON: \u2026 Everybody pays exactly the same.\n\nDICKERSON: Doctor\u2026\n\nCARSON: \u2026 And, as far as Medicare and MedicAid, my main goal is to get rid of Obamacare, and put the care back in the hands of (INAUDIBLE)\u2026\n\nGARRETT: \u2026 Dr. Carson\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: \u2026 Dr. Carson, I\u2019m sorry we have to go to a commercial. The free market wants what it wants.\n\nBack soon with the 2016 Republican debate in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nDICKERSON: Welcome back. We\u2019ll begin the second half of the debate with one of the hottest issues in the Republican campaign, immigration. But before I turn it back to Major Garrett and Kim Strassel, I have one question for Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump, in the Republican National Committee\u2019s Spanish language response to the State of the Union, Congressman Diaz-Balart said, quote \u201cIt\u2019s essential that we find a legislative solution,\u201d talking about immigration, \u201cto offer a permanent and humane solution to those who live in the shadows. What does that mean to you, a humane solution to those who live in the shadows?\n\nTRUMP: I want everybody taken care of, but we have to take care of our people in this country. We\u2019re not taking care of our people. We have no border. We have no control. People are flooding across. We can\u2019t have it. We either have a border, and I\u2019m very strongly \u2014 I\u2019m not proposing. I will build a wall. I will build a wall.\n\nRemember this, the wall will be paid for by Mexico. We are not being treated right.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWe are not being treated properly. If we don\u2019t have borders, if we don\u2019t have strength, we don\u2019t have a country. People are flowing across. We have to take care of our people. Believe me.\n\nGARRETT: Senator Rubio\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nFor the purposes of the lines \u2014 lines you would draw legislatively as a president on immigration reform, define amnesty.\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that \u2014 I\u2019ve never supported that. I do not support that. I think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws. What I think is clear about this issue to begin with is we\u2019re not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first, illegal immigration is brought under control.\n\nYou go back to 1986 when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border. It didn\u2019t happen, and as a result, people have lost trust in the federal government. It is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law, but actually prove to people that it\u2019s working.\n\nThey want to see the wall built. They want to see the additional border agents. They want to see e-verify. They want to see an entry- exit tracking system. Forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and over-staying visas. And only after all of that is in place, then we\u2019ll see what the American people are willing to support on this issue.\n\nI think the American people will be very reasonable, but responsible, about how you handle someone who has been here a long time, who can pass a background check, who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit. But you can\u2019t do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTRASSEL: Senator Cruz. Senator Cruz, you have promised to deport illegal aliens. You have also promised to reverse President Obama\u2019s executive action that gives temporary amnesty to illegals brought here by their parent as children. As president, you would have the names and addresses of the some 800,000 of those that have registered under that action. Now, you have said that in this country, we shouldn\u2019t go door to door look for illegals, but in this case you would have a list. Would you use it?\n\nCRUZ: Well, you know, your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage. You know, in a Republican primary, everyone talks tough on immigration. Everyone is against illegal immigration in a Republican primary. But as voters, we\u2019ve been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they don\u2019t walk the walk.\n\nThere are sharp differences on amnesty. If you look at the folks on this stage, when Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and establishment Republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan, I stood with Jeff Sessions and Steve King and the American people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTRASSEL: So would you \u2014 would you use the addresses?\n\nCRUZ: Now that moment\u2026\n\nSTRASSEL: Would you pick them up?\n\nCRUZ: That moment was what Reagan would call \u201ca time for choosing.\u201d When it comes to deciding which side of the line you\u2019re on, the Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan\u2026\n\n(BOOING)\n\nCRUZ: \u2026 apparently supported by the donor class, which is why Washington supported it. The Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan passed the Senate and it was on the verge of passing the House.\n\nHouse leadership intended to take it up and pass it with the Democrats overruling most of the Republicans. And the question for anyone on illegal immigration is where were you in that fight? Where did you stand?\n\nYou are right. There is a difference between Senator Rubio and me on this question.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSTRASSEL: Senator Rubio, your reply.\n\nRUBIO: We\u2019re going to have to do this again, OK? When that issue was being debated, Ted Cruz, at a committee hearing, very passionately said, I want immigration reform to pass, I want people to be able to come out of the shadows. And he proposed an amendment that would legalized people here.\n\nNot only that, he proposed doubling the number of green cards. He proposed a 500 percent increase on guest workers. Now his position is different. Now he is a passionate opponent of all those things.\n\nSo he either wasn\u2019t telling the truth then or he isn\u2019t telling the truth now, but to argue he is a purist on immigration is just not true.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: Major, I get a response to that.\n\nGARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz.\n\nSTRASSEL: All right. Senator Cruz. Your response, Senator Cruz.\n\nCRUZ: You know, the lines are very, very clear. Marco right now supports citizenship for 12 million people here illegally. I oppose citizenship. Marco stood on the debate stage and said that.\n\nBut I would note not only that, Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty. In the state of Florida, as speaker of the house, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants. In addition to that, Marco went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.\n\nI have promised to rescind every single illegal executive action, including that one.\n\n(MIX OF APPLAUSE AND BOOING)\n\nCRUZ: And on the question\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRUBIO: Well, first of all, I don\u2019t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn\u2019t speak Spanish. And second of all, the other point that I would make\u2026\n\nCRUZ: (SPEAKING SPANISH).\n\nRUBIO: Look, this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies. He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nRUBIO: He lies about Planned Parenthood. He lies about marriage. He\u2019s lying about all sorts of things. And now he makes things up. The bottom line is this is a campaign and people are watching it. And they see the truth behind all these issues.\n\nAnd here is the truth, Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country\u2026\n\nCRUZ: That is simply\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRUBIO: \u2026 and only now does he say\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCRUZ: That is absolutely false. What he said is knowingly false. And I would note, if you want to assess \u2014 if you want to assess\u2026\n\nRUBIO: Well, we\u2019ll put on our Web site, marcorubio.com. We\u2019re going to\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCRUZ: \u2026 who is telling the truth\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCRUZ: If you want to assess who is telling the truth\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nCRUZ: \u2026 then you should look to Jeff Sessions, who said, without Ted Cruz the Rubio-Schumer amnesty bill would have passed, and Ted was responsible. You should look to Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin that said\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nGARRETT: Governor Bush, I want to bring this out to a little wider philosophical aspect, if you will.\n\nBUSH: Thank you.\n\nGARRETT: You have said illegal immigrants, quote, \u201cbroke the law but it\u2019s not a felony,\u201d still quoting you, \u201cit\u2019s an act of love, it\u2019s an act of commitment to your family.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has, as you are well aware, denounced that statement over and over. Do you still believe it? What does that mean to you? And how does that inform your approach to immigration reform?\n\nBUSH: Great question. I feel like I have to get into my inner Chris Christie, and point out that the reason why I should be president is listening to two senators talk about arcane amendments to bills that didn\u2019t pass.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBUSH: This is \u2014 this is the problem. We need a leader to fix this problem. And I have a detailed plan to do just that, including controlling the border, dealing with the visa over-stayers, making sure that we have a path to legal status, not to citizenship, for those that come out from the shadows and pay a fine, learn English, don\u2019t commit crimes, work and pay taxes.\n\nThat is the better approach.\n\nGARRETT: Fundamentally, do you believe this rhetoric is insufficiently compassionate to this issue?\n\nBUSH: The great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice. They want to come to provide for their families. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right.\n\nWe should pick who comes to our country. We should control our border. Coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally. But the motivation, they\u2019re not all rapists, as you-know- who said. They\u2019re not that.\n\nThese are people that are coming to provide for their families. And we should show a little more respect for the fact that they\u2019re struggling. It doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be controlling the border. That\u2019s exactly what we should be doing.\n\nGARRETT: Mr. Trump\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Look\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 when I announced that I was running for president on June 16th, illegal immigration wasn\u2019t even a subject. If I didn\u2019t bring it up, we wouldn\u2019t even be talking.\n\nTRUMP: Now I don\u2019t often agree with Marco, and I don\u2019t often agree with Ted, but I can in this case. The weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is Jeb Bush. They come out of an act of love, whether you like it or not. He is so weak on illegal immigration it\u2019s laughable, and everybody knows it.\n\nBUSH: \u2026 So, you know\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nBUSH: \u2026 This is the standard operating procedure, to disparage me. That\u2019s fine\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 Spend a little more money on the commercials\u2026\n\nBUSH: \u2026 But, if you want to talk about weakness, you want to talk about weakness? It\u2019s weak to disparage women.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: (INAUDIBLE). I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\n\nBUSH: It\u2019s weak to denigrate the disabled. And, it\u2019s really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 I never called him \u2014 I don\u2019t call him..\n\nBUSH: \u2026 That is outrageous. The guys an American hero.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: He also said about language\u2026\n\nBUSH: \u2026 The simple fact is I\u2019ve also laid out my plans on (INAUDIBLE) immigration\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 Language. Two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody, and that\u2019s fine. Nobody reports that. He gets up and says that, and then he tells me, oh, my language was a little bit rough\u2026\n\nSTRASSEL: \u2026 OK\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 My language. Give me a break\u2026\n\nGARRET: \u2026 Governor Kasich, here in South Carolina earlier this week you said the idea, the concept of deporting 11 million undocumented workers\u2026\n\nBUSH: (INAUDIBLE) Just, for the record (INAUDIBLE) make sure my mother\u2019s listening, if she\u2019s watching the debate. I didn\u2019t say that I was going to moon somebody\u2026\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 You did say it, You did say it. Been reported in 10 different news\u2026\n\nGARRET: \u2026 We will leave the moon metaphors to be adjudicated later, I assure you. Governor Kasich, you said earlier this week in South Carolina, the concept, the idea of deporting 11 million undocumented workers in this country is nuts. Why is it you are so opposed to that idea? Senator Cruz has said it\u2019s a simple application of existing law. The application of that is not inhumane, it is just. Why do you disagree?\n\nKASICH: Before I get to that, this is the ninth or tenth debate. What I\u2019ve been watching here, this back and forth, and these attacks, some of them are personal. I think we\u2019re fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don\u2019t stop this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKASICH: I mean, the fact is \u2014 you know what? I would suggest why don\u2019t we take off all the negative ads, and all the negative comments down from television and let us just talk about what we\u2019re for, and let\u2019s sell that, and the Republican party will be stronger as a result\u2026\n\nGARRET: \u2026What are you for on immigration?\n\nKASICH: \u2026 (OFF MIKE) (INAUDIBLE) First of all, I\u2019m for sealing the border, OK? And, then I\u2019m for a guest worker program. People can come in, work, and go back home. We haven\u2019t closed the border because special interests, I believe, blocked it. Then, we have 11 and a half million people here. If they have not committed a crime since they\u2019ve been here, make them pay a fine, and some back taxes, and give them a path to legalization, never to citizenship.\n\nIt is not going to happen that we\u2019re going to run around and try to drag 11 and a half million people out of their homes.\n\nI\u2019ll tell you this. Within the first hundred days I will send a plan like this to the congress of the United States, and if I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll bet you dollar to donuts right now, it will pass.\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nThat is a reasonable proposal that the people of this country, in my judgement, will support, and so will the bulk of the congress of the United States.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSTRASSEL: Moving subjects. Dr. Carson, this week Morgan Stanley agreed to pay a $3.2 billion dollar fine to state and federal authorities for contributing to the mortgage crisis. You have a lot of Democrats out saying that we should be jailing more executives, so two questions.\n\nShould financial executives be held legally responsible for financial crisis, and do you think fines like these are an effective way to deter companies from future behavior like that?\n\nCARSON: Well, first of all, please go to my website, Bencarson.com and read my immigration policy, OK? Because it actually makes sense.\n\nNow, the \u2014 as far as these fines are concerned, you know? Here\u2019s the big problem. We\u2019ve got all these government regulators, and all they\u2019re doing is running around looking for people to fine. And, we\u2019ve got 645 different federal agencies, and sub-agencies. Way, way too many, and they don\u2019t have anything else to do.\n\nI think what we really need to do is start trimming the regulatory agencies rather than going after the people who are trying to increase the viability, economic viability of our society. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t some people out there who are doing bad things. But, I\u2019m not sure that the way to solve that problem is by increasing all the regulatory burden. You know, when you consider how much regulations cost us each year, you know? $2 trillion dollars per family, $24,000 per family, that happens to be the same level as the poverty level\u2026\n\n(BELL RINGING)\n\nCARSON: \u2026 For a family of four. If you want to get rid of poverty, get rid of all the regulations.\n\nDICKERSON: Senator Cruz, I have a question for you. Speaker Paul Ryan has made a big commitment to trying to lift the 50 million poor out of poverty. Arthur Brooks, who is the president of the American Enterprise Institute, says, quote, \u201cIf we are not warriors for the poor every day, free enterprise has no matter.\u201d How you have been in your campaign a warrior for the poor?\n\nCRUZ: I think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the Obama economy had been the most vulnerable. It\u2019s been young people. It\u2019s been Hispanics. It\u2019s been African-Americans. It\u2019s been single moms. We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today in any year since 1977.\n\nAnd the sad reality is big government, massive taxes, massive regulation, doesn\u2019t work. What we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth, let \u2014 small businesses are the heart of the economy. Two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses. If we want to lift people out of poverty \u2014 you know, I think of these issues from the perspective of my dad.\n\nMy dad fled Cuba in 1957. He was just 18. He couldn\u2019t speak English. He had nothing. He had $100 in his underwear. And he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school. Today, my dad is a pastor. He travels the country preaching the gospel.\n\nNow, I think about all of these issues. How would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes? If we had Obamacare in place right now, the odds are very high my father would have been laid off because it\u2019s teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off. If he didn\u2019t get laid off, the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28, 29 hours a week.\n\nWe need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work.\n\nGARRETT: Mr. Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI was with you in Pendleton, South Carolina earlier this week at the Rodeo Arena. It was a bit chilly there. You promised the crowd and they rose to their feet that if Ford or a company like were to move a factory to Mexico, you would try to stop it or threaten them with a 35 percent tax or tariff on every car sold. TRUMP: Or a tax.\n\nGARRETT: Right. So my question is, based on your understanding of the presidency, where do you derive that power? Would you need the consent of Congress to go along? And do you see the presidency as a perch from which you can cajole and/or threaten private industry to do something you think is better for the U.S. economy?\n\nTRUMP: I would build consensus with Congress and Congress would agree with me. I\u2019ll give you an example because I don\u2019t like the idea of using executive orders like our president. It is a disaster what he\u2019s doing. I would build consensus, but consensus means you have to work hard. You have to cajole. You have to get them into the Oval Office and get them all together, and you have to make deals.\n\nLet me just tell you, I mentioned before, China \u2014 big Chinese company bought the Chicago Exchange. Kerry is moving \u2014 and if you saw the people, because they have a video of the announcement that Carrier is moving to Mexico, OK?\n\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you what. I would go right now to Carrier and I would say I am going to work awfully hard. You\u2019re going to make air conditioners now in Mexico. You\u2019re going to get all of these 1400 people that are being laid off \u2014 they\u2019re laid off. They were crying. They were \u2014 it was a very sad situation. You\u2019re going to go to Mexico. You\u2019re going to make air conditioners in Mexico, you\u2019re going to put them across our border with no tax.\n\nI\u2019m going to tell them right now, I am going to get consensus from Congress and we\u2019re going to tax you when those air conditioners come. So stay where you are or build in the United States because we are killing ourselves with trade pacts that are no good for us and no good for our workers.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Alright. Mr. Trump, thank you so much. We\u2019re going to take a break for a moment. We\u2019ll be back in a moment with the CBS News Republican debate.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nDICKERSON: We\u2019re back now from Greenville, South Carolina with the candidates for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nMr. Trump, I have a question for you. Presidents have to, on the one hand, be firm, but also be flexible.\n\nYou have been flexible and changed your opinion on a number of things from abortion to Hillary Clinton. But you have said, rightly, that it\u2019s just like Ronald Reagan, who changed his mind on things.\n\nBut at the same time, you\u2019re criticizing Senator Cruz for what you say is a change on immigration. He disputes that, of course.\n\nSo, why is your change of opinion make you like Reagan, and when he changes his opinion, it\u2019s a huge character flaw?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTRUMP: John, in life you have flexibility. You do have flexibility. When you\u2019re fighting wars, you\u2019re going one way, you have a plan. It\u2019s a beautiful plan. It can\u2019t lose. The enemy makes a change, and all of a sudden you have to change.\n\nYou have to have flexibility. In Ronald Reagan, though, in terms of what we\u2019re talking about, was the great example. He was a somewhat liberal Democrat who became a somewhat, pretty strong conservative. He became \u2014 most importantly he became a great president. He made many of the changes that I\u2019ve made \u2014 I mean, I\u2019ve seen as a grew up, I\u2019ve seen, and as I get older and wiser, and I feel that I am a conservative.\n\nNow, I also feel I\u2019m a common-sense conservative, because some of the views I don\u2019t agree with. And I think a lot of people agree with me, obviously, based on what\u2019s happening.\n\nDICKERSON: Which conservative idea don\u2019t you agree with?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think these people always hit me with eminent domain, and frankly, I\u2019m not in love with eminent domain. But eminent domain is something you need very strongly.\n\nWhen Jeb had said, \u201cYou used eminent domain privately for a parking lot.\u201d It wasn\u2019t for a parking lot. The state of New Jersey \u2014 too bad Chris Christie is not here, he could tell you \u2014 the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people.\n\nI mean, it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development. Now, just so you understand, I got hit very hard. It\u2019s private, it\u2019s private eminent domain. You understand that they took over a stadium in Texas, and they used private eminent domain, but he just found that out after he made the charge.\n\nDICKERSON: All right. Governor Bush, I think by \u201cthey,\u201d he is referring to your brother, these on the hook for your brother.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah. Well, Jeb, wouldn\u2019t have known about it.\n\nBUSH: So, there \u2014 so, there is all sorts of intrigue about where I disagree with my brother, there would be one right there. You should not use eminent domain for private purposes.\n\nA baseball stadium or a parking lot for a limo\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTRUMP: You shouldn\u2019t have used it then, Jeb.\n\nDICKERSON: But that was his brother.\n\nBUSH: It\u2019s very different. Transmission lines, pipe lines, bridges, and highways. All of that is proper use of imminent domain. Not to take an elderly woman\u2019s\u2019 home to build a parking lot so that high-rollers can come from New York City to build casinos in Atlantic City.\n\nSTRASSEL: Senator Cruz, you were mentioned in the mix here, your response?\n\nCRUZ: You know flexibility is a good thing but it shouldn\u2019t \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t be flexible on core principles. I like Donald, he is an amazing entertainer but his policies for most of his life\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Thank you very much, I appreciate it.\n\nCRUZ: For most of his life his policies have been very very liberal. For most of his life, he has described himself as very pro- choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion. Right now today as a candidate, he supports federal tax payer funding for Planned Parenthood. I disagree with him on that.\n\nThat\u2019s a matter of principle and I\u2019ll tell you\u2026\n\nTRUMP: You probably are worse than Jeb Bush. You are single biggest liar. This guys lied \u2013 let me just tell you, this guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa and he just continues. Today, we had robo-calls saying. \u201cDonald Trump is not going to run in South Carolina,\u201d \u2014 where I\u2019m leading by a lot.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not going to vote for Ted Cruz. This is the same thing he did to Ben Carson. This guy will say anything, nasty guy. Now I know why he doesn\u2019t have one endorsement from any of his colleagues.\n\nCRUZ: Don, I need to go on\u2026\n\nTRUMP: He\u2019s a nasty guy.\n\nCRUZ: I will say, it is fairly remarkable to see Donald defending Ben after he called, \u201cpathological,\u201d and compared him to a child molester. Both of which were offensive and wrong.\n\nBut let me say this \u2013 you notice Donald didn\u2019t disagree with the substance that he supports taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. And Donald has this weird pattern, when you point to his own record he screams, \u201cliar, liar, liar.\u201d You want to go\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Where did I support it? Where did I\u2026\n\nCRUZ: You want to go\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Again, where did I support it?\n\nCRUZ: If you want to watch the video, go to our website at Tedcruz.org.\n\nTRUMP: Hey Ted, where I support it?\n\nCRUZ: You can see it out of Donald\u2019s own mouth.\n\nTRUMP: Where did I support?\n\nCRUZ: You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood. You went on\u2026\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s a lot of lies.\n\nCRUZ: You said, \u201cPlanned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: It does do wonderful things but not as it relates to abortion.\n\nCRUZ: So I\u2019ll tell you what\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with women\u2019s health.\n\nCRUZ: You see you and I\u2026\n\nTRUMP: But not when it comes to abortion.\n\nCRUZ: Don, the reasoned principle matters. The reasoned principle matters sadly was illustrated by the first questions today. The next president is going to appoint, one, two, three, four Supreme Court Justices.\n\nIf Donald Trump is president, he will appoint liberals. If Donald Trump is president, your Second Amendment will gone\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: Hold on\u2026\n\nCRUZL You know how I know that?\n\nDICKERSON: Hold on gentleman, I\u2019m going to turn this car around.\n\nTRUMP: Ted Cruz told your brother that he wanted John Roberts to be on the United States Supreme Court. They both pushed him, he twice approved Obamacare.\n\nDICKERSON: All right gentlemen.\n\nBUSH: My name was mentioned twice.\n\nDICKERSON: Well hold on. We\u2019re going to \u2014 gentleman, we\u2019re in danger of driving this into the dirt.\n\nDICKERSON: Senator Rubio, I\u2019d like you to jump in here\u2026\n\nBUSH: He called me a liar.\n\nDICKERSON: I understand, you\u2019re on deck governor.\n\nBUSH: Also, he talked about one of my heroes, Ronald Reagan.\n\nRonald Reagan, was a liberal maybe in the 1950\u2019s. He was a conservative reformed governor for eight years before he became president and no one should suggest he made an evolution for political purposes. He was a conservative and he didn\u2019t tear down people like Donald Trump is. He tore down the Berlin Wall.\n\nTRUMP: OK, governor.\n\nBUSH: He was a great guy..\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Senator Cruz, 30 seconds on this one.\n\nCRUZ: I did not nominate John Roberts. I would not have nominated John Roberts.\n\nTRUMP: You pushed him. You pushed him.\n\nCRUZ: I supported\u2026\n\nTRUMP: You worked with him and you pushed him. Why do you lie?\n\nCRUZ: You need to learn to not interrupt people.\n\nTRUMP: Why do you lie?\n\nCRUZ: Donald, adults learn\u2026\n\nTRUMP: You pushed him.\n\nCRUZ: Adults learn not to interrupt people.\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, yeah, I know, you\u2019re an adult.\n\nCRUZ: I did not nominate him. I would not have nominated him. I would\u2019ve nominated my former boss Liberman (ph) who was Justice Scalia\u2019s first law clerk. And you know how I know that Donald\u2019s Supreme Court Justices will be liberals? Because his entire life he support liberals from Jimmy Carter, to Hillary Clinton, to John Kerry.\n\nIn 2004, he contributed to John Kerry. Nobody who cares about judges would contribute to John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, and Harry Reid.\n\nDICKERSON: We\u2019re going to switch\u2026\n\nCRUZ: That\u2019s what Donald Trump does.\n\nDICKERSON: We\u2019re going to switch here to Senator Marco Rubio.\n\nSenator Marco Rubio, please weigh in.\n\nRUBIO: On anything I want?\n\nDICKERSON: I thought you had a point?\n\nRUBIO: Well, let me talk about poverty.\n\nDICKERSON: I thought you had a point you wanted to make.\n\nRUBIO: I do.\n\nBUSH: That was me.\n\nRUBIO: I had something important.\n\nDICKERSON: You\u2019re on deck sir.\n\nRUBIO: The issue of poverty is critical, because for me, poverty is the \u2014 is \u2014 is free enterprise not reaching people. Today, we have antipoverty programs that don\u2019t cure poverty. We don\u2019t cure poverty in America. Our anti-poverty programs have become, in some instances, a way of life, a lifestyle.\n\nNow, we do need anti-poverty programs, you can\u2019t have free enterprise programs without them, but not as a way of life. And so I have a very specific proposal on this and I don\u2019t \u2014 in 60 seconds, I can\u2019t describe it all, but it basically turns the program over to states. It allows states to design innovative programs that cure poverty, because I think Nikki Haley will do a better job curing poverty than Barack Obama.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Senator, I wanted to ask you, just going back to immigration, in the last debate, you listed your series of accomplishments in the Senate. One thing you left off was \u2014 was immigration reform. Is it the case that in your list of accomplishments you can\u2019t mention that?\n\nRUBIO: Well, no. It\u2019s not the case. It didn\u2019t pass and we haven\u2019t solved immigration in this country. It\u2019s still a problem. It is worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago. And it has to be confronted and solved.\n\nBut the only way forward on this issue \u2014 you asked a question about flexibility. Let me tell you about that. One of the things that you need in leadership is the ability to understand that to get things done, you must figure out the way to get it done. You will not pass comprehensive immigration reform. People do not trust the federal government.\n\nThey want to see the law being enforced. They want to see illegal immigration come under control. They want to see that wall. They want to see e-verify. They want to see all of these things working and then they will have a conversation with you about what do you do with people that have been here a long time that are otherwise, you know, not criminals. But they\u2019re not going to do it until you first enforce the law.\n\nDICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I have\u2026\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDr. Carson, I have a question for you. Candidates are\u2026\n\nCARSON: Before you ask the question, can I respond to the \u2014 you know, they mentioned my name a couple of times.\n\nDICKERSON: Alright. You have 30 seconds, Doctor.\n\nCARSON: Alright. Well, first of all, you know, so many people have said to me, \u201cYou need to scream and jump and down \u2014 jump up and down like everybody else.\u201d Is that really what you want? What we just saw? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nAnd you know, I \u2014 when I got into this race, I decided to look under the hood of the engine of what runs Washington, D.C., and my first inclination was to run away, but I didn\u2019t do it because I\u2019m thinking about our children and fact that we are the United States of America. And anybody up here is going to be much better than what\u2019s going to come on the other side. And what happened tonight with \u2014 with Justice Scalia tells you that we cannot afford to lose this election and we cannot be tearing each other down.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Dr. Carson, I \u2014 let me ask you a different question. When you were \u2014 you were the first one, really, to talk about political correctness. Everybody now talks about it, but that was really what sparked your \u2014 your rise. Politicians are often accused of glossing over any hard choices people have to make, just always selling happy, nice things. So in the \u2014 in the spirit of saying something that might be politically incorrect, tell the voters something that they need to hear but that might be politically incorrect?\n\nCARSON: Well, first of all, I\u2019m not a politician, so I\u2019m never going to become a politician. But here\u2019s what \u2014 here\u2019s what people need to know. People need to know that free college is not \u2014 it\u2019s a non-starter. You know, you have to look at our economic situation. We\u2019re on the verge of economic collapse and, you know, we\u2019re \u2014 it\u2019s not just the $19 trillion, but it\u2019s also the $200 trillion in unfunded liabilities.\n\nWhat we need to think about is what does that do to the average person? When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy, it causes the central bank to keep the \u2014 the rates low, and who does does that affect? Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg, that\u2019s gone. That part of the American dream is gone.\n\nAll of these things are disappearing, and Bernie Sanders and people like Hillary Clinton blame it on the rich. They say those evil rich people, if we take their money we can solve the problem. It\u2019s not the evil rich people. It\u2019s the irresponsible evil government.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich, you\u2019ve been described as the Democrats\u2019 favorite Republican. You talked about in New Hampshire, Democrats would come up to you and say, \u201cI hope you win.\u201d Why will that help you win a Republican nomination?\n\nKASICH: You know, John, I think all people are the same. Look, I did 106 town halls and I\u2019ve been doing them left and right here in South Carolina. The first thing we have to do is grow the economy, and I know the formula because I was chairman in Washington when we balanced the budget and created so many jobs, and the same that we\u2019ve been able to do in Ohio.\n\nKASICH: You need common sense regulations so small business can flourish, you need lower taxes both on business and individuals, and you need a fiscal plan to be able to get ourselves in a situation where people can predict a little bit about the future when it comes to the fiscal issues.\n\nAnd when you have that formula, combined with workforce that\u2019s trained, you can explode the economy and create many jobs. I have done it twice, and I want to go back to Washington and do it again.\n\nJohn, the thing is, is I think that there are people now, these blue-collar Democrats \u2014 my dad was a blue-collar Democrat \u2014 the Democratic party has left them. When they\u2019re arguing about being socialists, they\u2019ve left \u2014 they have lost those blue-collar Democrats.\n\nAnd you know what I think they get out of me \u2014 is my sense of what they get out of me, and it\u2019s embarrassment about campaigns, you brag about yourself.\n\nBut I think I\u2019m a uniter, I think people sense it. I think they know I have the experience, and that I\u2019m a man that can give people hope and a sense that they have the opportunity rise. And I\u2019ll tell you, I love these blue-collar Democrats, because they\u2019re going to vote for us come next fall, promise you that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: Mr. Trump, let me ask you a question. Presidents in both parties say that the one thing you need in your administration is somebody who can tell you you\u2019re wrong.\n\nYou don\u2019t necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you you\u2019re wrong a lot. Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said, \u201cDonald Trump, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d and you listened to them?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I would say my wife tells me I\u2019m wrong all the time. And I listen.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDICKERSON: About what?\n\nTRUMP: Oh, let me just say \u2014 look, I am very open \u2014 I hired top people. I\u2019ve had great success. I built a great, great company. I don\u2019t need to do this. I\u2019m self-funding. I\u2019m spending a lot of money. I\u2019ve spent \u2014 like in New Hampshire, I spent $3 million. Jeb bush spent $44 million. He came in five, and I came in No. 1.\n\nThat\u2019s what the country needs, folks. I spent $3, he spends 42 of their money, of special interest money. And it\u2019s just \u2014 this is not going to make \u2014 excuse me. This is not going to make our country great again.\n\nThis is not what we need in our country. We need people that know what the hell they\u2019re doing. And politicians, they\u2019re all talk, they\u2019re no action. And that\u2019s why people are supporting me.\n\nI do listen to people. I hire experts. I hire top, top people. And I do listen. And you know what? Sometimes they\u2019re wrong. You have to know what to do, when to do it. But sometimes they\u2019re wrong.\n\nDICKERSON: Let me \u2014 something, in talking to voters that they wish somebody would tell you to cut it out is the profanity. What\u2019s your reaction to that?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Well, I\u2019ll tell you \u2014 over the years, I\u2019ve made many speeches. People have asked me, big companies have asked me to make speeches, and friends of mine that run big companies on success.\n\nAnd occasion, in order to sort of really highlight something, I\u2019ll use a profanity. One of the profanities that I got credited with using, that I didn\u2019t use, was a very bad word, two weeks ago, that I never used.\n\nI said, \u201cYou.\u201d And everybody said \u201cOh, he didn\u2019t say anything wrong.\u201d But you bleeped it, so everyone thinks I said the \u2014 I didn\u2019t say anything. I never said the word.\n\nIt is very unfair, that criticism. Now, I will say this, with all of that being said, I have said I will not do it at all, because if I say a word that\u2019s a little bit off color, a little bit, it ends up being a headline.\n\nI will not do it again. I was a very good student at a great school not using \u2014 by the way \u2014 not using profanity is very easy.\n\nDICKERSON: All right. OK. Governor Bush, I\u2019d like to ask you\u2026\n\nBUSH: Yeah, well, I have got to respond to this.\n\nDICKERSON: Well, can I \u2014 how about you respond, and then you can answer the question I\u2019m about to ask you.\n\nBUSH: Sounds like a good plan.\n\nDICKERSON: It\u2019ll be\u2026\n\nBUSH: Or you could ask me two questions, so I could get two minutes instead of one.\n\nDICKERSON: If we adjudicate this, the night will be over.\n\nGovernor, in 2012, you said that your father and Ronald Reagan would have a hard time in today\u2019s Republican Party, based on their records of trying to find accommodation and finding some degree of common ground.\n\nDo you still feel that way?\n\nBUSH: I think the dysfunction in Washington is really dangerous, that\u2019s what I think. And we need a proven leader that has a record of solving problems, someone who doesn\u2019t cut and run; someone who could be a commander-in-chief to unite our country around common purposes; someone who doesn\u2019t disparage people.\n\nSomeone that doesn\u2019t brag, for example, that he has been bankrupt four times and it was great, because he could use the legal system.\n\nSomeone\u2026\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s not \u2014 let me respond. That\u2019s another lie. I never went bankrupt!\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nDICKERSON: Hold on, Mr. Trump.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: No, but it\u2019s another lie.\n\nDICKERSON: Hold on, Mr. Trump.\n\nTRUMP: No, but it\u2019s another lie. This guy doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. Just a lie.\n\nBUSH: We need someone with a proven record to be able to forge consensus to solve problems.\n\nAnd right now, both Republicans and Democrats in Washington don\u2019t get it. People are struggling \u2014 63 percent of Americans can\u2019t make a $500 car payment. Most Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. And we need someone has a proven record of growing the economy, reforming the things that are broken.\n\nAnd I\u2019m that person.\n\nDICKERSON: OK, Mr. Trump, your response.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nTRUMP: Let me just tell you. Jeb goes around saying, just like the biggest business leaders in this country, I\u2019ve used the laws of the land to chapter \u2014 I bought a company, I threw it immediately into a chapter, I made a great deal. I uses the laws to my benefit, because I run a company.\n\nBUSH: Yeah\u2026\n\nTRUMP: Excuse me, Jeb!\n\nBUSH: Yeah.\n\nTRUMP: I never went bankrupt, never.\n\nNow \u2014 but you don\u2019t want to say that. Now, let me just say, I\u2019ve used it, just like the biggest leaders in the country. Let me tell you something \u2014 Florida.\n\nTRUMP: Florida, he put so much debt on Florida. You know, we keep saying he\u2019s a wonderful governor, wonderful governor. He put so much debt on Florida, and he increased spending so much that as soon as he got out of office, Florida crashed.\n\nI happened to be there. It\u2019s my second home. Florida crashed. He didn\u2019t do a good job as governor.\n\nBUSH: Here we go.\n\nTRUMP: And you haven\u2019t \u2014 excuse me, you haven\u2019t heard that. You listen to the good record in Florida. You take a look at what happened, as soon as that year ended he got out, Florida crashed. Too much debt.\n\nHe loaded it up with debt, and his spending went through the roof.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nTRUMP: By the way\u2026\n\nDICKERSON: The bells are ringing, sir.\n\nTRUMP: \u2026 he was not a good governor.\n\nBUSH: Here\u2019s the record. Here\u2019s the record. We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years. When I left there was $9 billion of reserves, 35 percent of general revenue. No state came close to that.\n\nTRUMP: Take a look at your numbers.\n\nBUSH: When I \u2014 during my time, we were one of the two states to go to AAA bond rating. We didn\u2019t go bankrupt like Trump did and call it success when people are laid off, when vendors don\u2019t get paid. That\u2019s not success.\n\nWhat we did was create an environment where people had a chance to have income. Personal income during my time went up by 4.4 percent.\n\nTRUMP: Florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office.\n\nBUSH: The government grew by\u2026 TRUMP: Went right down because of what he did to it.\n\nBUSH: \u2026 half of that.\n\nDICKERSON: All right. Thank you.\n\nSenator Rubio, I want to ask you a 30-second question, no president can\u2026\n\nRUBIO: Thirty seconds.\n\nDICKERSON: No \u2014 well, I\u2019ll ask the question, you do what you want.\n\nRUBIO: I speak fast.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDICKERSON: No president can know everything, right? So a smart leader knows how to ask questions. So if you could talk to any previous president, what\u2019s the smart question you would ask about that job that you would want to know?\n\nRUBIO: Well, I think one of the presidents \u2014 well, the president I grew up under was Ronald Reagan. And Reagan had a vision for America\u2019s future. And if you think about what Ronald Reagan inherited, it\u2019s not unlike what the next president is going to inherit.\n\nThis is the worst president we\u2019ve had in 35 years, 35 years back would have made it Jimmy Carter. That\u2019s what Ronald Reagan inherited. And I think the question you would ask is how did you inspire again the American people to believe in the future?\n\nHow did you \u2014 what did it take to ensure that the American people, despite all of the difficulties of the time \u2014 you know, you look back at that time, the American military was in decline. Our standing in the world was in decline. We had hostages being held in Iran. Our economy was in bad shape.\n\nThe American people were scared about the future. They were scared about what kind of country their children were going to live in and inherit. And yet somehow Ronald Reagan was able to instill in our nation and in our people a sense of optimism.\n\nAnd he turned America around because of that vision and ultimately because of that leadership. I wish Ronald Reagan was still around. This country needs someone just like that.\n\nAnd if our next president is even half the president Ronald Reagan was, America is going to be greater than it has ever been.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nDICKERSON: All right. That\u2019s going to have to be it there, Senator Rubio. We have got to go to a break. We will be right back with the CBS News Republican <Debate in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nDICKERSON: Time now for closing statements. You will each have one minute, and we\u2019ll begin with Governor Kasich.\n\nKASICH: Well, I want to thank the people of South Carolina. You\u2019ve been fantastic. And look, what I want you to know is I\u2019m going to send a lot of power, money and influence back to where we all live. But as I\u2019ve traveled around South Carolina, I\u2019ve noticed something. You know, it\u2019s that people have a sense that you\u2019re not going to wait on a president. You know, when I was a kid, we didn\u2019t wait on presidents to come to that little blue-collar town and fix things.\n\nYou know, the Lord made all of us special. The Lord wants us to be connected. I believe we\u2019re part of a very big mosaic. And I\u2019ll send the power back. And whoever gets elected president here, hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and Social Security and the border.\n\nBut the spirit of the America rests in all of us. It\u2019s in our guts. It\u2019s taking care of our children. It\u2019s taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband. It\u2019s fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs. You see, I think what the Lord wants is for to us engage, and in America, the spirit of America doesn\u2019t come from the top down. The spirit of America rests in us. And I want to call on everyone in America to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone.\n\nThank you all very much.
