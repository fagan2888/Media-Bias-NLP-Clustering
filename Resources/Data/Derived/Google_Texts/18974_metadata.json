Bloomberg News\n\nCorporate interest in frontier markets has been growing this year but as companies adapt to the changing nature of world markets their focus is shifting away from some of the perennial favorites.\n\nThe latest Frontier Market Sentiment Index, prepared exclusively for WSJ Frontiers by Frontier Strategy Group, presents a picture of a corporate world that is rapidly reassessing its plans for future investment in light of sharp changes in key economic and business drivers around the world.\n\nCompanies appear to be paying more attention to some countries, such as Venezuela and Argentina, that have faced considerable headwinds recently.\n\nAt the same time, former favorites such as Vietnam appear to be losing some of their luster.\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to sign up for WSJ Frontiers\u2019 weekly newsletter\n\nThe index is based on information gathered from FSG\u2019s roughly 200 multinational clients, which include companies such as Astra Zeneca, Johnson Controls, Danone and Cisco. It identifies which frontier-market countries major American and European companies are watching and measures the change in the attention they are paying to different countries. By pinpointing which countries multinationals are focusing on, the index provides insight into potential corporate investment plans.\n\nCorporate sentiment is calculated as the percentage of companies that include a country on their watch-list. If 50 of the 200 companies are watching a particular country, the sentiment index score would be 25%.\n\nAmong the top 10 there have been some abrupt changes since the previous version of the index was released in January. Angola has jumped from fourteenth to fifth place, Algeria leapt into sixth place from 18th and Venezuela rocketed up from 10th to third. Vietnam tumbled from second to eighth and Nigeria, which had held the top spot since the index was launched in June 2014, has been nudged into second place by Argentina, which vaulted from fourth to first place.\n\nOil seems to be playing a significant part in the changes in corporate sentiment\u2014as it has in equity market performance across the frontier markets. With global oil prices having settled at around half the level they hit in mid 2014, the frontier countries whose economies rely heavily on oil exports have seen their stock markets slump over the past eight months.\n\nThe FM Sentiment Index suggests companies are also concerned about the prospects for many of the oil-exporting frontier markets. Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan all saw notable declines in sentiment.\n\nSurprisingly, though, some oil exporters made a strong showing among the 10 countries that saw the sharpest increase in attention from companies considering foreign investment. Venezuela, Ecuador, Algeria and Angola round out the top five after the highest gainer, Argentina.\n\nJoel Whitaker, FSG\u2019s global head of research, says conversations with FSG\u2019s clients reveal a range of reasons for the intensity of focus on what he calls \u201cworrisome\u201d markets. \u201cIn the economies facing liquidity or balance of payments crises as a result of lower oil prices this may be an indicator of companies\u2019 wishful thinking for near-term resilience or of building a business case for exit,\u201d he says. In many cases, though, the companies involved are in industries that are less driven by oil, such as healthcare and technology, that tend to be only very indirectly driven by economic cycles, Whitaker adds.\n\nThose companies may be looking for ways to leverage the investments they have already made in struggling frontier economies, taking advantage of lower currencies or a more welcoming investment environment to build market share in anticipation of an eventual recovery. \u201cThey have an existing footprint, they have the relationships, the established facilities and a pretty good sense of the competitive environment,\u201d says Whitaker.\n\nIt\u2019s not, however, a vote in favor of the macro economy, Whitaker cautions. \u201cIt\u2019s smart companies finding smart ways to do business in those markets.\u201d\n\nArgentina, which saw the sharpest increase in corporate sentiment, is getting a great deal of attention from portfolio and corporate investors alike. Chad Cleaver, lead manager of Chicago-based Driehaus Capital Management\u2019s frontier- and emerging-markets fund explains the focus on Argentina: \u201cWith the coming presidential election, there is a real prospect of reform, political change, a more-moderate government,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect a significant acceleration of growth right away but we do see a normalization of the risk premium. We\u2019re interested in banks and property companies that would benefit from the normalization of the cost of equity.\u201d\n\nCleaver is also intensifying his focus on South Asia, a region that is experiencing a convincing increase in corporate sentiment. Sri Lanka, which was among the worst performers in January\u2019s index as uncertainty over its presidential election peaked, is seeing interest recover. Bangladesh is also beginning to stabilize after a bout of politically driven upheaval, while Pakistan is gaining more attention as investors and companies alike begin to recognize its market\u2019s potential.\n\nSoutheast Asia is on the opposite tack. Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos all saw less interest from corporations. Vietnam, long a favorite among frontier investors, suffered the second-worst decline of any of the markets in the index.\n\nFSG\u2019s Whitaker believes Vietnam\u2019s waning appeal is probably due to skepticism that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will ever become a reality. Companies are also tiring of a \u201crepeating cycle of over-enthusiasm and disappointment\u201d in Vietnam, Whitaker comments.\n\nJai Thampi, head of consumer electronics producer Belkin International\u2019s international networking business, has reduced his focus on Vietnam\u2019s mass-market space over the past nine months. \u201cCompetition from Chinese products has compressed margins there and many smaller retailers have been forced out of business,\u201d he says. \u201cOverall, the sentiment toward the market is down. We\u2019re setting our expectations very low there at the moment.\u201d Thampi does see opportunities in the premium end of the market, though, and notes that Belkin remains committed to Vietnam in the long term.\n\nKazakhstan\u2019s heavy dependence on oil is sapping investor enthusiasm for the country. Reuters\n\nKazakhstan, a country whose economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, suffered the biggest decline in sentiment. Emre Tuncalp, managing partner of Washington-based risk consultant Sidar Global, says his clients have cooled noticeably toward Kazakhstan and adds that a key factor is the Central Asian nation\u2019s dependence on Russia.\n\nZoran Milojevic, a director at frontier- and emerging-markets brokerage Auerbach Grayson, says last year\u2019s 20% devaluation of Kazakhstan\u2019s currency, the tenge, \u201ccaused the economy to come to a standstill from a GDP growth of 4% plus in 2014 to an expected 1% in 2015.\u201d He adds that the \u201ceconomy has been hit hard as cheap Russian, Ukrainian, Belarussian and Georgian products are hitting shelves and are being priced 50% cheaper then locally produced Kazakh products.\u201d\n\nOther worries persist for Kazakhstan, too. FSG has slashed its GDP growth forecast and projects at least three years of slow growth. \u201cThe banking sector is fragile [and the country] is facing a serious drain on reserves as it spends them to keep the tenge afloat, the group\u2019s analysts note.\n\nNigeria also suffered a decline in sentiment, almost certainly prompted by uncertainty around the presidential election, which took place in late March. The decline was enough to knock Africa\u2019s biggest economy out of the top spot it has held since the FM Sentiment Index launched in June 2014.\n\nKwame Dougan, head of a U.S.-based fund that invests in technology firms in West Africa, says perceptions about Nigeria have been affected by factors such as electoral uncertainty and Boko Haram. The real concerns for investors, though, are currency fluctuation and electricity shortages, he believes. \u201cThat\u2019s what increases the cost of doing business,\u201d he says.\n\nBelkin\u2019s Thampi believes the long-term prospects for Nigeria remain good. \u201cWe believe the ups and downs there are short-term noise,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s still on our priority list and on our radar for long-term investments\u201d\n\nJim Perry, a senior vice president at spirits and wine-maker Brown-Forman, says the peaceful handover of power in Nigeria has done a great deal to ease investors\u2019 concerns about the country: \u201cPeople were surprised and impressed by how smooth the election was. [It] bodes really well for the economy,\u201d he says.\n\nNigeria is already a large market for Jack Daniels, Brown-Forman\u2019s biggest-selling brand, but Perry anticipates it will continue expanding. \u201cWe are continuing to grow our investment,\u201d he notes.\n\nWrite to Dan Keeler at dan.keeler@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Nigeria has lost its crown as the most-watched frontier market in the latest WSJ Frontiers/FSG Frontier Markets Sentiment Index.
