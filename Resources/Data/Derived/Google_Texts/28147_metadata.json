Creighton, an avid hiker and biker, was devastated to see his hometown of Ojai, Calif., withering away in the parched heat, so he decided to do something about it. Creighton\u2019s project has garnered national attention\u2013some positive, and some, well, less positive \u2014 but the 23-year-old Californian doesn\u2019t mind, as long as it means that more people are thinking about the issue of water conservation.\n\nSalon spoke with him about social media activism, his haters and the ice bucket challenge. This interview has been lightly edited.\n\nWhat prompted you to undertake this challenge?\n\nCalifornia is in an historic drought right now; it\u2019s so devastating. And I spend a lot of time outdoors. I hike. I run. I ride my bike and I\u2019m always at the beach. So seeing everything dry up in my town of Ojai earlier this summer, I decided to stop showering for a week. And after I did that, it turned into a month and I just kind of kept going. By day 50, I decided to start a campaign on Instagram where using photos I uploaded if people would re-post it with the hashtag #OneDayDirtier within that 48 hour timespan, I would go one more day without showering on their behalf. And that\u2019s how this all started.\n\nThe whole thing was to use social media to bring awareness to the drought that California is having because I realized that people, especially my age \u2014 I\u2019m 23 years old \u2014 they don\u2019t necessarily pay attention to a lot of important issues going on because they\u2019re so focused on whether it\u2019s Facebook or Instagram or Twitter. And we are in an age where people spend a lot of their time focused on social media. So I thought, what better way to bring awareness to the drought then to bring it into social media in that way.\n\nWhat has been the general reaction?\n\nThe general reaction in my community has been great. People are really supportive. They think it\u2019s really awesome. Ever since it\u2019s kind of gone national, the reaction has been interesting. It\u2019s definitely different by whatever region people are in. There are some people that have surprised me that I\u2019ve read comments from all over the country, people that are really not supportive. They actually kind of hate what I\u2019m doing which is surprising to me because it really doesn\u2019t affect them. But I don\u2019t focus on that and I\u2019m really lucky to have so many people that have started following me on Instagram, which is @Creigh, and commenting me and sending support and really nice messages about what I\u2019m doing and the whole point is to get people to be talking about unconventional ways to save water. I\u2019m not asking other people to give up showering. I\u2019m not saying that by me not showering for 128 days will solve the water crisis we\u2019re having in California, but the whole point is to create buzz and get people talking.\n\nWhat are the specific rules of your challenge?\n\nFor what I\u2019m doing with the no showering or bathing thing, is I can only bathe myself in water that\u2019s already there. So I\u2019m not taking showers and I\u2019m not bathing or hosing myself off or anything. I\u2019ll go to the beach or to water holes or to friends\u2019 swimming pools and things like that. I even went so far as to\u2014I was walking in my friend Jennifer\u2019s neighborhood and her neighbors had their sprinklers on and (laughing) I even went in those one time. The whole point is\u2014it\u2019s meant to be a fun and funny way to bring awareness to the drought. I don\u2019t mind that people are poking holes and making fun of me; that\u2019s the point. It\u2019s supposed to be kind of funny what I\u2019m doing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cody Creighton's #OneDayDirtier campaign aims to raise awareness about water conservation", "title": "Meet the man who refuses to shower for 128 days", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Cody Creighton's #OneDayDirtier campaign aims to raise awareness about water conservation", "title": "Meet the man who refuses to shower for 128 days", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/21/meet_the_man_who_refuses_to_shower_for_128_days/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/cody_creighton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cody Creighton's #OneDayDirtier campaign aims to raise awareness about water conservation", "title": "Meet the man who refuses to shower for 128 days", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/cody_creighton.jpg", "creator": "@@joannarothkopf", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joanna Rothkopf", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California Drought, cody creighton, Q&A, water conservation", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e18\"", "article_summary": "Salon spoke with him about social media activism, his haters and the ice bucket challenge.\nAnd we are in an age where people spend a lot of their time focused on social media.\nSo I thought, what better way to bring awareness to the drought then to bring it into social media in that way.\nThey actually kind of hate what I\u2019m doing which is surprising to me because it really doesn\u2019t affect them.\nIt\u2019s supposed to be kind of funny what I\u2019m doing."}
