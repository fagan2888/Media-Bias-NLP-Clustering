Now, unless you live in la-la-land, you’re well aware of the brutal beheading that happened in Moore, Oklahoma this past Friday.

Depending on where you get your news, you might or might not know the religion that the culprit confesses.

So, in light of the lack of credible intel that comes forth from the "mainstream media", let’s play a game, shall we? Let’s play, “Guess The Religion Of The Whiny Murderous D-bag Who Cut An Innocent Woman’s Head Off?”

Are you ready? Okay, lets go:

Was the Beheader into:1. Hinduism?2. Buddhism?3. Pentecostalism?4. Rastafarianism?5. Judaism?6. Shintoism?7. Korean Shamanism?8. Jainism?9. Caodaism?10. Or Islam?

Before the reports started rolling in about the idiot’s religious affiliation, as soon as I heard how he murdered his co-worker I knew it could only be one religious persuasion that goes there nowadays -- and I was right: it was none other than Islam.

I don’t know why this continues to shock people, because their head wizard beheaded people in his inglorious day and they’re just following his head trail.
