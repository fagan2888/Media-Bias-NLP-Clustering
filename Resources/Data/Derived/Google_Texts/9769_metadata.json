Sutherland\u2019s score is well above the norm for most industries, especially healthcare. NPS, developed by Bain and Company, measures client loyalty and the potential for market growth. As the healthcare industry works to adopt a more client-centric stance, gaining client loyalty is a pivotal concern.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a company with solutions that help our clients become more responsive to the needs of their customers, this score is an achievement we are especially proud of,\u201d said Amy Grazer, Sutherland Healthcare Solutions\u2019 Head of Strategic Initiatives and Brand. \u201cIt speaks not only to Sutherland\u2019s ongoing commitment to our clients, but also to the ability of our solutions to improve the experience of the end users our clients serve.\u201d\n\nIndeed, bringing the experience of the end-user to the center of the healthcare conversation is more vital now than ever. As the impacts of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) continue to ripple through the healthcare ecosystem, provider organizations in particular are vulnerable to changing demands from consumers and new reimbursement schemes.\n\nWhile noting that this year\u2019s NPS represents Sutherland\u2019s third consecutive year of strong scores, Ms. Grazer stressed that the score resulted from very specific efforts:\n\nSutherland focused on sustained client engagement\n\nSutherland tailored its outreach so each client received the level of engagement they needed\n\nSutherland doubled down on client dialogue, ensuring that client pain points were communicated to the right people at the right time\n\nSutherland Healthcare Solutions CEO Thomas Laur added to Ms. Grazer\u2019s comments, \u201cso much of today\u2019s healthcare landscape is opaque. But one thing is abundantly clear: exchanges are bringing more consumers to market, and regulations are fostering more consumer-driven care. Sutherland Healthcare Solutions\u2019 most recent NPS makes us so proud because it is a direct vote of confidence from clients who thrive in this increasingly competitive, consumer-focused space.\u201d\n\nTo download a white paper detailing the relationship between NPS, customer-centricity and growth, click here.
