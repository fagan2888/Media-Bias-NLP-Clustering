Some flat-out refused to touch the subject.\n\nThe cautious approach underscored how delicate the subject is for some presidential prospects, especially those with email-related controversies of their own. And politically, there\u2019s an upside to keeping a low profile while Clinton struggles in the spotlight.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nClinton held a news conference, her first in about two years, in New York on Tuesday to defend her email practices. She said she chose to exclusively use a personal email account for reasons of convenience, but she also insisted her actions were entirely legal and that her nonpersonal emails would be made available to the public.\n\nHer answers at the news conference didn\u2019t do much to mollify critics, and she drew plenty of scorn from the Republican National Committee and other quarters.\n\nA few long-shot GOP presidential contenders also slammed her: Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina tweeted \u201cIn effect, @HillaryClinton told us to trust her. Nothing in her track record suggests we should do so.\u201d Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum issued a statement that blasted her \u201clapse in judgment.\u201d And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee suggested during a radio interview with conservative host Hugh Hewitt that she is \u201ctruth challenged,\u201d though he demurred when asked whether she is a \u201cliar.\u201d\n\nBut for the most part, whether it was on social media or in response to interview requests, 2016 hopefuls stayed silent.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of the first Republicans to criticize Clinton when news of the emails surfaced last week, wasn\u2019t expected to weigh in Tuesday. Neither was firebrand conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has weighed in before, but he didn\u2019t respond when asked for comment after the news conference Tuesday.\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul, often a vociferous critic of Clinton, ultimately ripped her remarks during a Fox News appearance Tuesday night, calling for an independent investigation, but for several hours after her appearance his usually aggressive team had no comment. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio also did not take on Clinton\u2019s comments in the wake of the news conference, although he had already addressed the issue more broadly in radio interviews.\n\nRepublican operatives say that, for now, many candidates may feel it\u2019s wiser to wait instead of weighing in and becoming the story. If the potential 2016 rivals go on offense, that could allow Clinton to try to play the sympathy card.\n\n\u201cNever interrupt your enemy when they\u2019re setting a dumpster fire on their campaign,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a veteran Florida GOP operative. \u201cPiling on her gives her the excuse to say, \u2018Republicans are attacking me,\u2019 when she\u2019s doing the job for us.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, a number of the GOP candidates risk reminding the public of their own tech-related woes. Governors in particular have exposure when it comes to public access to their emails \u2014 whereas members of Congress are for the most part exempt from federal open records laws.\n\nClinton remains by far the dominant 2016 hopeful on the Democratic side, and three potential rivals in her party all declined to engage Tuesday.\n\nThe three, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, all appeared Tuesday at a gathering of the International Association of Fire Fighters ahead of Clinton\u2019s mid-afternoon news conference.\n\nO\u2019Malley brushed off questions about Clinton as he walked from the hotel to his car. Sanders twice declined to comment on the Clinton email saga, telling a group of reporters, \u201cI really don\u2019t want to talk about Hillary Clinton.\u201d And Webb said that while her news conference provided \u201ca good opportunity for Secretary Clinton to come forward and explain the situation she\u2019s been in,\u201d the email controversy was between her and the news media.\n\nAsked for reaction after Clinton talked to reporters, Sanders\u2019 spokesman had no comment and Webb\u2019s said the former senator hadn\u2019t watched the news conference. A spokeswoman for O\u2019Malley didn\u2019t respond when asked for further comment.\n\nLike many other rank-and-file Democrats, these three possible candidates have been very reluctant to publicly criticize Clinton over emails or much of anything else. O\u2019Malley has suggested he will more aggressively draw \u201cdistinctions\u201d with Clinton if he decides to run.\n\nThe people most willing to take shots at Clinton right now come from the more official arms of the GOP. The Republican National Committee, state parties and GOP research arms were out with scathing pushback minutes after the former secretary of state\u2019s news conference.\n\nAlthough Clinton said she didn\u2019t email classified information, GOP officials jabbed her on that issue in particular. \u201cIf she had an ounce of respect for the American people, she would have apologized for putting our national security at risk for \u2018convenience,\u2019\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement.\n\nClinton was asked how she determined which emails she turned over to the State Department for eventual public release, and whether she deleted any. The former secretary of state said that all federal officials have discretion in which emails they save versus those they delete.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough for Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann.\n\n\u201cMrs. Clinton said nothing to assuage concerns that she is hiding important State Department emails on her private server, and worse, she admitted to deleting emails,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nJonathan Topaz contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The cautious approach underscored how delicate email is for some prospects.", "title": "2016ers mostly mum as Clinton faces the cameras", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/hillary-clinton-email-2016-115959.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/10/150310_ted_cruz_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton 2016,Hillary Clinton,2016 Elections,Jeb Bush,Carly Fiorina,Bernie Sanders 2016,Carly Fiorina 2016,Martin O'Malley,Elections,Bernie Sanders,Jim Webb,Jim Webb 2016,Rand Paul,Martin O'Malley 2016,Rand Paul 2016,Jeb Bush 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The cautious approach underscored how delicate email is for some prospects.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe00\"", "article_summary": "2016ers mostly mum as Clinton faces the cameras The cautious approach underscored how delicate email is for some presidential prospects.\nHer answers at the news conference didn\u2019t do much to mollify critics, and she drew plenty of scorn from the Republican National Committee and other quarters.\nAlthough Clinton said she didn\u2019t email classified information, GOP officials jabbed her on that issue in particular.\nThe people most willing to take shots at Clinton right now come from the more official arms of the GOP.\nLike many other rank-and-file Democrats, these three possible candidates have been very reluctant to publicly criticize Clinton over emails or much of anything else."}
