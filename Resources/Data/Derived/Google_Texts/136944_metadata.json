Better pay attention \u2014 and not just for the purposes of marital harmony.\n\nA new study finds that people who have breathing problems while sleeping and those who don\u2019t get enough deep sleep are at higher risk for dementia, according to a new study published in the journal Neurology.\n\nScientists are increasingly finding that good sleep is crucial to brain health. Previous studies have suggested sleep quality and duration are connected to memory problems and dementia, but researchers haven\u2019t understood exactly why. This study is the first to show how sleep disturbances cause changes in the brain that lead to memory problems, said lead author Rebecca Gelber, of the VA Pacific Islands Health Care System in Honolulu.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nFor the study, 167 Japanese American men \u2014 average age, 84 \u2014 underwent a series of sleep tests at home. Researchers followed them until all of them died an average of six years later. The researchers then performed autopsies on their brains to look for signs of damage.\n\nThe group of men with the lowest blood oxygen levels at night were four times more likely to have brain damage caused by microinfarcts \u2014 mini-strokes that often proceed dementia. In addition, the men who spent the least amount of time in deep, restorative slumber were more likely to show loss of brain cells and brain atrophy.\n\n\u201cThis is important because it lends insight into how these brain lesions, which are so common and detrimental to brain function, may develop,\u201d Gelber said.\n\nThe study authors said the lower levels of oxygen in the blood could be caused by sleep apnea and conditions such as emphysema. We\u2019ve known for years that sleep apnea \u2014 a disorder where breathing periodically stops during sleep \u2014 raises your risk of heart attack, weight gain, acid reflux and a number of other health problems. Even so, an estimated 80 percent of men and 90 percent of women with the disorder aren\u2019t diagnosed.\n\nBut some experts caution reading too much into this one study.\n\n\u201cThe researchers found no association between sleep disturbance and levels of plaques and tangles in the brain, which are the hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common cause of dementia,\u201d said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. \u201cIn addition, the researchers measured episodes of sleep apnea, looking for an association with dementia-related brain changes, and did not find a significant relationship.\u201d Also, all of the subjects were older Japanese Americans, added Fargo, and the results need to be confirmed in a larger, more diverse group.\n\nBut since prior studies have shown that treating sleep apnea may improve cognition, and because the condition is solidly linked to a host of other health problems, it\u2019s especially important that older people talk to their doctors if they have the following signs or symptoms:\n\nSigns of Sleep Apnea\n\nLoud and chronic (ongoing) snoring\n\nPauses during snoring, followed by choking or gasping\n\nMorning headaches\n\nTrouble concentrating\n\nFeeling irritable or depressed, or having mood swings or personality changes\n\nWaking up frequently to urinate\n\nDry mouth or sore throat when you wake up\n\nSource: National Institutes of Health\n\nPhoto: PearlJackson/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Does your spouse\u00a0complain that you snore loudly\u00a0or gasp in your sleep?
