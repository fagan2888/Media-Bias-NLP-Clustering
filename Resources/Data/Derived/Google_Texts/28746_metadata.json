That's less than five months before open enrollment in Obamacare plans for 2016 is set to begin, complicating the ability of affected states to implement a fix to keep subsidies flowing.\n\nIf the court rules for the plaintiffs, more than an estimated 8 million people would drop their individual insurance plans because they would become unaffordable without the subsidies, and because retail prices could significantly rise for the remaining nonsubsidized customers.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim the Affordable Care Act doesn't allow subsidies for customers of a federally run exchange, because there is no explicit language in the law authorizing such help. The ACA does explicitly say that the tax credits can go to to customers of exchanges established by a state, if those people earn between 100 and 400 percent of the poverty level.\n\nThe Obama administration argues the ACA allows subsidies regardless of whether the customer is on a federal or state exchange.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "An online broker says it can help states set up their own Obamacare exchange in just 60 days, protecting subsidies for residents.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "A company says it can help states protect Obamacare subsidies for residents by setting up an insurance exchange in just two months.", "title": "Can this save Obamacare from the Supreme Court?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/16/could-these-guys-help-save-obamacare-from-the-supreme-court.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/02/25/102456096-healthcare-signup.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A company says it can help states protect Obamacare subsidies for residents by setting up an insurance exchange in just two months.", "title": "Could these guys help save Obamacare from the Supreme Court?", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/16/could-these-guys-help-save-obamacare-from-the-supreme-court.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/02/25/102456096-healthcare-signup.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Insurance, Health Care, Obamacare, Supreme Court (U.S.), Health Insurance, US: News, Politics, Barack Obama, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-04-16T14:47:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Insurance", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T14:47:00-0400", "tag": "Barack Obama"}, "pageNodeId": 102590651, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, King v.
