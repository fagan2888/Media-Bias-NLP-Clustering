That mission is glowing white hot in the eyes of 10 Arkansas senators right now, who are threatening to vote against a Medicaid expansion bill financed by Obamacare that\u2019s been proposed by Gov. Asa Hutchinson. If the program, named Arkansas Works, were to fail \u2014 it\u2019s otherwise very popular among the state legislature \u2014 it would cause a $150 million deficit in the state budget, leaving many crucial government services and health care for children, the blind, disabled and elderly to face steep budget cuts across the board.\n\nTo pass, the bill needs approval from 75 percent of the Senate, or 27 of 35 votes.\n\nHutchinson has been doing his best to convince the \u201cTea Party Ten\u201d that their political move would do damage to the state\u2019s highway building program. Monday, Hutchinson released a statement appealing to the senators sense of decency for the young.\n\n\u201cTo say I am concerned with some of these reductions is an understatement,\u201d reads the statement by Hutchinson. \u201cOne such reduction includes a proposed $10 million cut to our state\u2019s foster care system.\u201d\n\nSen. Bart Hester, one of the 10 senators, in an interview with THV11 in Little Rock said he thinks Hutchinson is making a bluff. He said there is \u201cplenty of money out there in surplus, and if there\u2019s a budget cut to the foster care system it\u2019s because the Governor wanted it, not because we had to.\u201d\n\nHe was later quoted in the Democrat-Gazette.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing some pretty hard chicken right now with both people\u2019s feet on the accelerator. I think the only thing that\u2019s going to bring resolution to this is a crash.\u201d\n\nMore than 250,000 Arkansans are enrolled in the Private Option, which is now being called Arkansas Works. Because of that, Arkansas\u2019s uninsured rate fell from 22.5 to 9.1 percent since 2013. Still, Hester and the other members of the \u201cTea Party Ten\u201d are willing to bring this to a \u201ccrash\u201d in a game of chicken. Politics, y\u2019all.\n\nThat crash would end all medical coverage for 400,000 Arkansas children, more than 100,000 adults, and 60,000 elderly.\n\nY\u2019know, political moves like this really shouldn\u2019t baffle me anyone. I\u2019m young, I guess I have that naive fire in me that gets mad at silly things like kicking vulnerable, needy people out in the street to fend for themselves. Things like ignoring the very people senators were elected to serve their better interests for.\n\nAh, but it gets better. If the Tea Party Ten get their way, the proposed budget cuts could increase the Arkansas Department of Corrections expenses by as much as $8 million a year. So yeah, while we\u2019re abandoning the medical needs of foster children and the elderly, we\u2019ll instead raise money spent on criminals.\n\nIn this disaster scenario, the senators believe there will be other avenues to make up the deficit and continue to fund government services. Some of Hester\u2019s ideas include proposing to sell War Memorial Stadium and AETN. Even the governor has said those aren\u2019t realistic.\n\nThe Arkansas Works bill itself isn\u2019t a slam dunk, either, but perhaps it\u2019s realistic for the state that voted Hutchinson in, who campaigned against Obamacare in the first place.\n\nAccording to the proposal, Hutchinson says participants who make at least 100 percent of the federal poverty level should pay a premium equal to 2 percent of their income. People who are 21 and older will have to enroll in their employer\u2019s health insurance, if available and if the employer agrees to participate, with the program paying for premiums and co-pays. The bill would also require that unemployed participants be referred to the Department of Workforce Services for job training and job search programs.\n\nThe senate has until June to figure out a compromise, or bow to the whim of 10 senators and the defunding Medicaid. Hutchinson only has to convince two to vote in favor of Arkansas Works, however.\n\nThis was written on Tuesday, April 12, so things may have changed by the time you read this in the paper.\n\nThanks for reading.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3"}, "article_summary": "Republican obstructionism is so hot right now, especially so for 10 Arkansas Tea Party senators.\nStill, Hester and the other members of the \u201cTea Party Ten\u201d are willing to bring this to a \u201ccrash\u201d in a game of chicken.\nHutchinson has been doing his best to convince the \u201cTea Party Ten\u201d that their political move would do damage to the state\u2019s highway building program.\nIf the Tea Party Ten get their way, the proposed budget cuts could increase the Arkansas Department of Corrections expenses by as much as $8 million a year.\nThat mission is glowing white hot in the eyes of 10 Arkansas senators right now, who are threatening to vote against a Medicaid expansion bill financed by Obamacare that\u2019s been proposed by Gov."}
