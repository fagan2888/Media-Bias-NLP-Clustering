I flung the ... trial with the dogs ... I'd I can reply came and then I look that the social right feel was an all boy howdy ... do with old building ... behind the wall and you know will abandon us a while ago it appeared to move one though ... you know and then I learned that the Dodgers get to give you a feeling that for ... no oil group is the feeling to ... cut the back ... half ... alright I buy the idea of ... the ... fattest cell bio feelings By Bayou ... reminding myself of the law Johnny Miz doing that ... but alright ... by ... nineteen forty eight your kid has ... been going up substantially in Harlem ... he went to good high school but you are forced to drop out ... and ten years later you graduate from Harvard University what what is the chain of events that leads somewhere along the way somebody discovered ... that young Thomas old was a very bright kid ... how did this happen ... I think nobody discover that ... I just prefer the ... and of ... at some point ... I decided I would apply to Harvard ... had I known of then when I don't now how we realize the AUD will hopelessly against the ... of the fourth is indicted know I went ahead and that that's that ... and the degree with which you graduated from Harvard University was a degree in economics yet ... so that interest in economics declared itself early in your life ... how ... it was this was the summit to which I did the best ... I really was a no brainer ... he came to an economics of all things can easily see in actually I guess it made sense was not everything tour Harvard the business of the time or now ... ok ... now you've also written that throughout your twenties ... you were a Marxist yes ... what did that to you was that fair Harvard's work ... no heaven no that was though I was the ... twenty years all ... of the old heifers came across with a Buy marks ... and what he said seem to ... explain ... the world around me ... and of one of the reasons is that ... like many kids didn't now feel really getting any alternative explanation ... and so it's like you you have to have a candidate to be the can ... so what was going ... up ... you grow up in Harlem he went to Howard before going to ... Harvard as they are largely in a can of black world an African-American book when you say marks explain the world around you ... this ... do you mean to say that he explained the world of segregation ... will with nowhere for them ... my first job ... of without the Western Union message ... I was sixteen years though ... but first full time ... and I it's true of on some evenings come home with the taken the subway which would make with those days ... I would splurge and take the fifth Avenue bus with a fifteen cent ... Dallas feel you know ... to get a good tip ... in the snow so it was a was that we caught up in twenty thirteen goal we have to have you plan ... to poll a glass glad glittering places ... we would turn left the fifty seventh Street ... go up in more green places including Connie hall ... and we turned up ... to full and prompt from a freckle of ... Broadway and then out to Riverside drive ... all the fancy stuff there ... and end ... of two ... hundred thirty fifth really coming off a bye Dot ... Emilee The D The tenements ... and of course is where I live ... what what what what is this ... and the of of ... more things which seem to explain ... the ... so ... what ... what converted to ... you graduate from Harvard ... a Marxist ... you remain a Marxist throughout your twenties you've written that you have a summer job ... in Washington in nineteen sixty nine ... in nineteen sixty nineteen sixty a bigger part in nineteen sixty ... that helped to or that ... while the just change your view is undeniably explain that ... um ... I'm not with losses of the cable bill the Friedman school ... of but I didn't that what what is somewhere the gun ... with about deliveries I know that Saddam is really about this ... that is ... Milton Friedman didn't area but the federal government the federal government is that that was that the federal government of doing it ... up up up up ... so what what was that in about the job while I was that my job was to look good to study minimum wage ... of steady in in Puerto Rico ... because the ... night sky with that as the cab reasonable part of labor is yet to collect the statistics for somebody on ... the floor for report ... on ... and I I notice that they can raise the minimum wage the two of them plumbing kept going now ... and that was a tough economic was saying that was why would the ... door to a theory ... the ... um ... the the the unions and ... said that the ... reason was going down was that the new a ... hurricane came through a series of hurricanes ... and during that time the click of the beta ... and that it destroyed if the server came in the field ... so the was less for quiet in the process ... and so the question for which the bills and Friday ... and I and I thought I'd be kind of Chicago that that that could've been theories ... that must be some factual thing you'll be different ... at least a possible site for the whole summer ... trying to figure out what what the hell would I pass this ... and finally I came in one day NML school group in the office but haven't ... will we be on statistics ... on the amount of sugar cane ... standing in the field before that before the horror came came through ... and I'm waiting for the congratulations like the look of ... the stock ... and there are a like ... this it is the most coveted were roller ball ... I realize ... I was concerned as to whether the wall was a ... beneficial not been officials low income people ... they were concerned because this law that provided one-third of the income of the biggest apartment labor ... and once you begin to see that the government agencies have their own self interest quite aside for what it what it with a theoretically supposed to be doing ... so they were behaving precisely is a ... neoclassical that precisely is Milton Friedman would have predicted they were in pursuit of their own incentive that's right ... she didn't want to work trying to ... do we're not trying to establish justice on the face of the year they were trying to hold on to pretty good job yes God ... does he mention Chicago ... you graduate from Harvard ... and the new study ... for your doctor you begin a Columbia and then you move to Chicago ... he moved to Chicago because the great Lakes economists the Nobel Prize winner George stake lagoon and Colombia to Chicago ... you studied with George stickler ... and Milton Friedman founders of the Chicago school of Economics and higher ... and higher you must be the only one who ever graduated after starting with those people ... who walked away from the University of Chicago still a Marxist ... what have I come out of left I went back to God with the and the phone I see ok the truth is that it was that with that with the matter for the work and I was doing ok ... are ... you consider yourself a member of the Chicago school ... I suppose so on ... inequality was taken for both go for a few topics from basic economics ... you know ... that from country to country they're a lot of disparities in wealth ... and many of them are extreme ... the per capita GDP of China's less than one fourth that of Japan ... that of India's barely ten percent of that of Japan annual offer number of comparisons like that and basic economics ... Quoc quoting basic economics ... many find such disparities both puzzling ... and troubling ... the more fundamental question might be next ... was there ever ... any realistic chance that the nations of the world would of had similar prospects ... of economic development ... what is that such a good question ... because it means you don't have to look for a bogeyman to explain why everybody that make and save money ... while having to say well ... you talk about a number of factors ... that ... including factors as ... basic as ... waterways mountains explain ... geographical to frontier of India in the middle ... of the though there are rumors for example on all the confidence that the office the river ... of the Zaire maroon the central Africa ... which is well on the topic of the Mississippi ... but the impact of the basal a hundred fifty miles ... or more than thirty cataracts ... I may fall to the waterfall to total almost a thousand feet ... the Mississippi River Falls an array of four inches per mile ... upgrade and they are not the same room or in terms of the will to transport anything ... back in for ... one one never can open up an entire continent the other does no good goal for trade especially for ... all advantage of going all the kinds of things they're all there'll always anomaly is what what what I mentioned is that the ... we like ninety percent of all the tornadoes in the entire world ... the placement in the United States ... of ... that ... of most of the guises and the entire world ... are in Yellowstone National Park ... of those are the first is a strange planet ... we picked the wrong planet there we own ... inequality within the United States basic economics again and cooling it on ... although people and in the top income bracket on the bobbin income brackets ... the rich and the pore as they are often called ... may be discussed as if they were different classes of people ... often they are in fact the same people at different stages of their last clothes quo ... so ... getting worked up about income inequality ... is pointless ill informed ... by of all yes ... all and sometimes it's simply a propaganda trick the patio and doing ... why I read to Katie's the snow ... hit area Thomas Piketty the French economist's publish a book this year called capital was right and I and the ... star on the World doing so ... he talks about how the top ten to settle separate from the rest of us may ... play with will fall from the parents ... and then outfits that I wanted though will refer to turn though ... that fifty six percent of all American households ... will be in the top ten percent ... at some point a rather new lives ... usually when they're older ... while overhead ... or have over half will be in the top dollar ... this ... um other than that actually in the end of the top one percent is even more incredible ... of ... all the people in the top one percent ... up on the course of a decade ... of the majority of the great majority of the a one year ... only thirteen percent ... of their ... two years ... and so were talking about people who will the spike in income in one year ... for some reason or of the inherited something ... awe so they're the opening of the other they have assets accumulated over the years Lee Solomon that one here ... during the lunch I haven't checked but I would be surprised ... if I hit my income peak ... of one eyed Weisel White House on the Stanford campus ... of up and have never been knew that's the ... of ... note ... at him cause he was also will continue for another house ... I'll why go right ... so ... the kitty and a grungy race ... picketed because they're the question to him ... as I understand it ... his ... basic argument ... is that the return on capital ... examine over many decades throughout the Western world ... the return on capital ... exceeds ... the rate of economic growth ... and ... therefore holders of capital will get richer faster ... than anybody else ... and holders of capital tend to be consistent over time one family shifting capital to the next generation to the next ... and so you get Social ... you get income inequality ... which breeds class distinctions political tensions and so forth ... and palms soles answer to this is ... what one word with the myth ... that all would corporate you'll lifetime ... mobile Mo Mo so much ... of the disparity ... consists of different people a different phase of the line ... moreover over time ... the devil back in nineteen fifty one ... of people reach their peak income between thirty five forty four years of age and all people in that bracket made about sixty percent more than people who were in their early twenties ... go for a few years ... and now all of them making more than twice as much as people ... in the twenties ... to go forward ... another decade or so and now the whole bracket who built the full forty five to fifty four ... and how to make it three times the people in a low ... dollar limited means is that as time goes on the advantages of you may mixture of ... awe and then and ... emerging ... account for less and less cost machines provide the power ... of what you have to more and more ... we would do more complicated things experience and knowledge that are more and more every motive to crawl yet and when you think about it ... if you we met major ... adult ... oh ... well life and beginning in eighteen ... that means the sum of man forty years old ... has more than ten times the resume and twenty years though ... so it is nothing mysterious about NAO ... and nothing troubling ... DuPont Paul couldn't in York Times quote Mr pick a nice contribution is serious discourse changing scholarship ... can somebody get a closeup on the level of dialogue on Tom's face as I recall improvement of ... serious discourse changing scholarship and conservatives are ... they or offline clothes quo ... are you sure fun ... to go ... more detail what do I discovered that there are the momentum on among one of them for Devlin says that the ... Underwood who were the highest income bracket ... low with a two point five percent ... the Internal Revenue record shows that the nineteen thirties to the highest income bracket ... the six to produce ... so I'm not sure how many it is what wobbly when you actually check the footnotes yes I know that the that that that ... the that the level that will turn you into a semi convert to a time ... market failure and government failure physics economics quote the imperfections of the marketplace has led many to see government interventions as necessary ... and beneficial ... Franklin Roosevelt would of said so and ... many sense ... yet the imperfection of two ... imperfections of the market must be weighed against the imperfections ... of the government ... explain ... the little it amazes me that you'll think that if you say the market for free that means the government that ... they deal with so much more rational and sports ... I mean when babe Ruth one of this photo ... that is that we us in a pensioner from economic time that ... the cost will depend to the maestro ago ... not like is like in the home was babe Ruth to ... ok ... ok ... let's apply this this notion of boat wing market failure against government failure in a couple specific instances ... Dodd Frank ... signed into law by President Obama in July twenty first twenty ten quote I'm quoting now the name of this fact ... the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to promote financial stability the United States but improving accountability ... and transparency in the financial system and to end too big ... to fail clothes ... quo ... your favorite of course ... a lot of a remaining this in a preamble that this one again and the VIX will take some of the law that the ... the problem for you ... and Dodd Frank is an example of ... what ... one thing for example of why ... by the government doesn't happen that who ... will work with this takes ... the view that we who live that two men who did the most ... to bring on the housing collapse with this economy ... has still not recovered ... I would've said ... on the Chris Dodd and bloody Friday ... the center of Connecticut at the time Barney Frank longtime Massachusetts Congressman for both retired incident when a good good with that with that but the only left this behind his the legacy ... and they did so well ... off the bed is the law by having the government on the right ... risky loans ... and buy back the power of the dumber be used to force private lenders ... underwriting ... risky low because if they didn't ... um it be set upon by the it but what fun ... of by the Federal Reserve ... and dad Reno ... threatened to prosecute those who wear make enough loans ... to low income people so Senator Dodd and Congressman Frank U N enacted legislation and leaned on regulators to use the coercive power of the federal government ... to force the financial industry to take on more risk that wanted to yes ... and then they enacted the legislation ... to penalize him financial industry for taking on too much for that ... and none of this the president does is rich is mad ... for you good news to the tothe madness and yet ... what but I just feel that the icy water flow with the federal government is now ... one of the supporting local own house loan ... what will with three percent now ... which ... here we go and a guide us I hope ... why don't they learn ... as they do ... we learned that the game the political benefits of doing things like that ... and when it blows up of the things they can blame someone else ... and then think about Leah make the same mistakes which held the same benefit ... all right ... Obamacare signed into law by President Obama March twenty third twenty ten the formal name the Patient Protection and Affordable Care ... Act ... and Bisserbe Last represents an example of June dishes government intervention ... in a market where food was pricing ordinary people out of hell ... when you laughing ... I ... it really is amazing Audis Khan Yuzo plays ... up ... people actually the premiums have gone up ... we were that is that if they have gone up because the deductibles of one of ... every day that is officially high deductible I would be willing to set up an insurance company ... and ensure you are ten dollars a month for everything imaginable ... I sale you know what will the million dollar deductible caught up in that you could go to boy or you are going for ... it to can happen to you ... and your ribbon day the ninth ... day to nine hundred thousand dollars with ... out you know I still would be laid out a penny ... okay ... so ... by the way now that debate Republicans of one of both houses ... of Congress the new ... Congress will be sworn in in January and the debate now is ... should Obamacare be fixed or repeal the outright ... appeal to ride the that will fix this ... all right ... the Federal Reserve Bank the Wall Street Journal earlier this month pulled Federal Reserve officials are seriously considering dropping an assurance ... that short-term interest rates will stay near zero for quote a considerable time ... these into magical word that the Fed has been using again and again in recent months ... to keep the rates near zero for a considerable time another ... thinking about dropping the phrase ... as they look more competently for rate increases around the middle of next year question one ... since the financial crisis of two thousand and eight how does the Fed service ... badly ... the ... Mike even the issues raised lol ... yet if resembled depriving a whole generation what would these in return on when you they say it which would normally ... go into the marketplace and earned them a decent rate of infant ... but now although the Federal Reserve is keeping the interest rate Lowenthal they will get it ... and that something that entrepreneur of the older people that that's true but somewhat unfair it's the it's the it's a bit allocate the resources ... if if if someone wants to set up of the moves ... and willing to pay five percent ... off lawful money to do that ... up up and the government come in and falls impulses brings it down to virtually zero ... the move in the low investments will not go with a would've gone all ordinarily in a free market so they're messing around with the whole system of pricing yes and and who knows the celebrations of the year taking place ... all right ... the counterargument photon has ... been into thousandeight we had a very serious crisis it was a shock to the financial system ... and the whole economy ... and to legislation was enacted ... requiring of the Federal Reserve not only price stability ... but to do what it could to ... encourage maximum possible employment ... and so the Fed is saying we just have to have easy money ... because ... even let us grant that Dr souls right ... that the government is largely responsible for the mess in the first place by ... monkey around in housing credit all ... people are out of work ... ordinary Americans are hurting we the Fed have to ... keep money easy in this economy ... to keep the economy least sputtering along so more ordinary people don't hurt worse ... it sounds good ... by going here it's it's it's it's it's all it's only if you look at history ... that that that that this is a problem ... for Goebel invisible God would call the forgotten Depression ... I am read about but I dunno what it's about ... and so now when Warren Harding take things off of ... things grants new poker and I think so ... of what market and the Audi take take ... the offer for the nineteen twenty ... one ... love autumn what was like locusts ... that yes ... um flooding did absolutely nothing ... except cut back government spending because ... the new world less taxes coming in for the cuts but to spend the ... dollars due to a change in with listings and say oh my God the one we're all in the manner of the following year the pottery was around six percent ... I'm a year after that it was around four ... and putting to death with nothing again ... so when people think they'd like to go but has to do something I think ... the deal the study would have from the Gabba does something stupid or what have we don't do anything ... and four hundred and fifty years ... ago when I say did nothing when there was a depression ... no depression drools hundred fifty years ... what ever the bed of the great depression of the nineteen ... thirties in which the government did more than that of a double for ... its entire history ... Honda both Hoover and Roosevelt ... you know I mean we've never had this discussion what caused ... all these years later ... the Great Depression is still uses as implicit and sometimes even ... sometimes you're going gets weird explosively beneath the in line at the bottom of all these economic updates even now ... yes ... new content ... against everything children learn from kindergarten on about the benevolence of Franklin Roosevelt ... you contend that we would of been better off if what ... what I did question of if it's what you ... do when you see that the stock market price of crude ninety to October nineteen twenty nine right ... two months later ... unemployment peaked ... at nine percent ... and that is still incomplete declining ... and by June of nineteen thirty was down to six point three percent ... that was when the first Goldman events into place ... and within six months he was in double digits ... an estate in double digits ... for the entire decade ... of the nineteen thirties ... so we had had ... I'm ... stumbling here because the making of this mental experiment as a goal if we had had ... Calvin Coolidge oh yes four terms in a row is another Franklin Roosevelt ... and Calvin Coolidge ... who was reticent in every way including reticent to have the federal government ... to anything ... he was and he was a ... Warren Harding a certain moral failings of the Calvin Coolidge was was Warren Harding with personal rectitude yet ... the country with and better off ... absolutely love one that I'd I'd ... Harding after all who was eligible to run for office again ... this thing the thing was I got to the Russell is the ... right yes ... Harding died in the college became president but ... for ... many that you want residency in his own right he ... was the only serve one term is alright ... and they would but in the run again in twenty eight he decided not to ... if you stayed on I'm sure he would he would never done what go with it ... time you have a fast I have never heard that what the F in American history ... under the earthquake that what a ... immigration basic economics The Wealth ... won only two percent of immigrants from Japan the United States go on welfare while forty six percent of the immigrants from allowance do ... there is no single pattern that applies to all immigrants ... everything depends on which immigrants are talking about ... and which periods of history ... ok ... here's this time ... the period is ... today ... and the immigrants were talking about are the roughly eleven million but seems to be the best estimate ... roughly the eleven million who were in this country illegally ... overwhelmingly from Mexico ... president Obama has issued an executive order protecting about five million of them from deportation another legal penalties ... a humane act ... what what what wave of immigration debate is ... the talk about immigrants in the abstract and there are no immigrants in the abstract is that passage in the case ... and we don't know who will people a lot ... but the measure they may all BPA the universe to Chicago ... with the Fisher calls it ... all they may or may have an effect the people who love ... amazes sociologists Berklee with faces and get the ball on here ... as soon as possible ... of ... what we don't know that that that's one of the problem of the Lowell folk on immigration policy ... we don't have a immigration policy ... Leslie control the border ... it doesn't matter what follows is ... everybody was across the board across ... the aisle policy is just what the words on paper ... okay so I think I hear you I'd I think they can deduce from that set of comments to policies ... one is for sure you can control the border Yeh that's just opting to get control of order ... but from that point forward ... you are is dubious ... about the editorial position of the Wall Street Journal The which is consistently borrow immigrant ... as you are dubious of the president of United States ... because your point is neither one of them really knows in enough detail to ... hold these eleven million people or or whether they're doing that good or harm to the economy ... so during that same and you don't buy the Wall Street Journal argument ... now that I'm that surely they're doing more good than harm for economic good than harm you don't buy the no ... but doing it writing or ... talk about having people in agriculture ... in the country this had a chronic sleep loss ... of agricultural output for decades on it costing the taxpayers billions upon billions of dollars that because the federal government subsidizes they have the surplus for ... it ... and as that God I die I'd I'd I think of the of the federal government ... subsidizes the water ... that creates this live close to them some is again ... I I the eye the the the the ... any discussion of of people in the abstract drives me crazy ... because there are no abstract people ... hundred years ago people understood that and so when there was a debate about immigration ... there was a multi volume ... set of Colmes ... about the characteristics of the immigrants from various countries ... where where will the tunnel the kids doing school Taylor gets to be picky ... yes they say will take some ... yes but they better do was good yet ... okay ... so what kind of debate would you like ... Congress doesn't mention him only go just is just fall into the control of Republicans both houses ... Republicans are bball move much legislation because the president canceled veto at what tended to be sure they have looked at the hearing should they hold on and agreed they should find out ... what kind of people haha lovely people the we know about now on the kids go to school ... what is that crime rate ... with the disease rate ... although thing that matters ... you know I know that they brought all these kids the city is just too well ... you know kids do grow up ... in a hell of a cute ... we don't know maybe maybe that's a good thing maybe it's a bit that we'll have a clue ... grace Tom sold for for once in a quota column you wrote ... instead of basic economics will come back to the store ... a whole new road earlier this month ... Nicholas Christoph columnist for the New York cops caught on your skin enough for the first time ... readers of your column will know ... new York Times writer Nicholas Kristof in Corning New asserts that there is over well and put your calling him ... overwhelming evidence the centuries of racial subjugation still shape ... in equity in the twenty first century ... quote closing low and he mentions open court the lingering effects of slavery clothes quo ... and now this is Tom soul ... if we wanted to be serious about ... evidence ... we might compare where blacks to the hundred years after the end of slavery ... with where they stood after thirty years of the liberal welfare state ... explain ... well and ninety six The was to be almost a hundred years ... after the end of slavery ... twenty two percent of black kids ... grow for homes with only one pair ... just twenty two percent yes for other five were homes with both her yet ... up thirty years later after the liberal welfare state ... that number had more than tripled ... and so was a willingness to PIA ... we we can ... speculate on how much that twenty two percent was due to a legacy of slavery ... we know that that ... cheerfully when I do like to play with him due to legacy will hold a fifth of policy ... and then you can look at so many all the way ... of ... education ... of five high school in New York and you know what you get into all we're bypassing are a tough exam ... off in twenty twelve ... the percentage of black ... students would ... cut and the five high school ... was less than one tenth ... of a percentage of black students would cut the size of high school ... thirty three years earlier ... the two of the Dunbar high school a walk which would ideally like high school for over a long time ... in nineteen ninety three ... the number Albaugh kids out of them are high school when on the college ... was less ... than it was sixty years earlier ... which would of been in the depth of the great depression ... so as you can run through a whole bunch of other things like that ... color that in the housing projects of ... the housing projects in the first death with twentieth century ... to win that first hundred years after slavery ... of ... work ... heck did not know ... that high crime rates ... the murder rates ... of the graffiti ... of all the rest of the week was so that none of that was the ... of people up but the New York Times auction ... the softer results at Old labors ... of Opel pointed out that ... on Saturday mornings it was common in the housing project of its earlier during flow for parents ... to leave it goes on a lot ... because some of the parents could afford televisions um could ... see the ones that only the doors unlocked and the kids have appealed to come down and watched TV with them when thou the latest figures show that the ... most people below the poverty line have to TV sets the table ... but they would there be a good doing a lot ... and public housing price ...
