North American insurers are largely secure, although investment income remains a concern. Still, \u201ca jittery start won\u2019t make a year of jitters,\u201d S&P wrote.Elsewhere, Asia-Pacific insurers are expected to endure more volatile capital and investment earnings over the next two years, though premium growth is expected. Some insurers, however, have been seen to turn to \u201crisky assets\u201d in an attempt to increase returns, which \u201ccould lead to capital erosion in the event of market dislocation.\u201dWestern European insurers will be particularly affected by consistent low interest rates, especially life insurers with diversified risk interest and relatively weak capital positions.Central and Eastern European insurance companies, as well as those in the Middle East and Africa regions, will need to focus on the effects of regulation and oil price concerns, which \u201cadds another wrinkle as capital and solvency requirements come into play.\u201dLatin America may prove the exception to the rule. Insurers in Mexico and Brazil in particular are expected to benefit from higher interest rates.Although not included in the report, Standard & Poor\u2019s has also commented recently on the American health insurance market. In a separate analysis, the agency suggests that it will take longer than anticipated for the individual health market to stabilize and for insurers to realize profits.In fact, S&P does not expect a stable market until 2018 \u2013 two years longer than projected when the Affordable Care Act went into effect.Deep Banerjee, an author on the report and the director of S&P Ratings Services, said insurers did not have enough data to properly set premium prices in 2014 and 2015, and the resulting high claims activity has set companies back. As these claims level off \u2013 and as the risk pool matures and demand wanes \u2013 insurers will be in a better position to make a profit.Banerjee also said 2017 \u201cis a key year because now insurers can price more accurately.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/insurers-face-widespread-financial-downgrades-in-tough-2016-sandp-31643.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_stock-market-exchange-finance-downward-000075365951_Small.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "A new analysis from Standard & Poor\u2019s reveals underwriting deterioration and waning capital could force credit reevaluation for insurers worldwide", "title": "Insurers face widespread financial downgrades in \u201ctough\u201d 2016: S&P"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new analysis from Standard & Poor\u2019s reveals underwriting deterioration and waning capital could force credit reevaluation for insurers worldwide", "title": "Insurers face widespread financial downgrades in \u201ctough\u201d 2016: S&P", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/insurers-face-widespread-financial-downgrades-in-tough-2016-sandp-31643.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_stock-market-exchange-finance-downward-000075365951_Small.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A new analysis from Standard & Poor\u2019s reveals underwriting deterioration and waning capital could force credit reevaluation for insurers worldwide", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "article_summary": "Insurers in Mexico and Brazil in particular are expected to benefit from higher interest rates.Although not included in the report, Standard & Poor\u2019s has also commented recently on the American health insurance market.\nNorth American insurers are largely secure, although investment income remains a concern.\nStill, \u201ca jittery start won\u2019t make a year of jitters,\u201d S&P wrote.Elsewhere, Asia-Pacific insurers are expected to endure more volatile capital and investment earnings over the next two years, though premium growth is expected.\nAs these claims level off \u2013 and as the risk pool matures and demand wanes \u2013 insurers will be in a better position to make a profit.Banerjee also said 2017 \u201cis a key year because now insurers can price more accurately.\u201d\nIn a separate analysis, the agency suggests that it will take longer than anticipated for the individual health market to stabilize and for insurers to realize profits.In fact, S&P does not expect a stable market until 2018 \u2013 two years longer than projected when the Affordable Care Act went into effect.Deep Banerjee, an author on the report and the director of S&P Ratings Services, said insurers did not have enough data to properly set premium prices in 2014 and 2015, and the resulting high claims activity has set companies back."}
