Slate, Mother Jones and some other national outlets, qualifying it to be called viral, according to PR Daily. Other states are trying the same thing, based on the Colorado campaign\u2019s success, the site reported.\n\n\u201cGot Insurance? was simple, edgy, and fun by design, and that contributed to the project\u2019s success far beyond our original expectations,\u201d Amy Runyon-Harms, the executive director of ProgressNow, said in a statement.\n\nRagan\u2019s PR Daily:\n\nHow do you appeal to the tough-to-reach, even-tougher-to-impress audience of 20- and 30- somethings and women of all ages on the dry subject of health insurance? Answer: With fun, humor, and a fine sense of the ridiculous.\n\nThe spoof of the venerable two-word ad campaign for milk. \u201cGot Insurance?\u201d was the sequel to the same two groups\u2019 \u201cThanks Obamacare\u201d campaign in 2011.\n\n\u201cOur objective was simple: to inform as many Coloradans as possible about their new health insurance options available via Connect For Health Colorado,\u201d stated Adam Fox of Colorado Consumer Health Initiative. \u201cBecause the message of Got Insurance? was effective across the nation, the campaign grew beyond Colorado, and helped raise awareness about health care reform from coast to coast. We\u2019ve received requests from other states for creative materials from the campaign to help them promote reform in their own states.\u201d\n\nBesides Fox, PR Daily also congratulated ProgressNow\u2019s Jen Caltrider.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s ever had their content go viral will tell you it\u2019s not easy, but we were in the right place at the right time with the right message,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, a creative project meant for Colorado consumption has been seen by millions of Americans\u2013many more than the entire population of our state. Our fun and slightly provocative message filled a role at a key moment in the rollout of Obamacare. Today, millions of eyeballs later and with more Coloradans insured than ever before, we know we made the right decision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "The Colorado campaign for the Affordable Care Act, \"Got Insurance,\" was picked as the best cause advocacy in social media by the trade publication PR Daily.", "title": "Colorado's \"Got Insurance\" gets honor", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/02/05/colorados-got-insurance-got-recognition-campaign-saavy/117075/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/02/Fullscreen-capture-242015-61932-PM-495x288.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The Colorado campaign for the Affordable Care Act, \"Got Insurance,\" was picked as the best cause advocacy in social media by the trade publication PR Daily.", "creator": "@joeybunch", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/02/05/colorados-got-insurance-got-recognition-campaign-saavy/117075/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/02/Fullscreen-capture-242015-61932-PM-495x288.jpg", "title": "Colorado\u2019s \u201cGot Insurance?\u201d got recognition for campaign savvy", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Colorado Health Initiative,Got Milk?,PR Daily,ProgressNow", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Colorado campaign for the Affordable Care Act, \"Got Insurance,\" was picked as the best cause advocacy in social media by the trade publication PR Daily."}, "article_summary": "\u201cOur objective was simple: to inform as many Coloradans as possible about their new health insurance options available via Connect For Health Colorado,\u201d stated Adam Fox of Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.\nSlate, Mother Jones and some other national outlets, qualifying it to be called viral, according to PR Daily.\nRagan\u2019s PR Daily, the public relations trade publication behind the award, said the campaign was \u201csimplicity itself\u201d with \u201cedgy content,\u201d built on a satirical website.\nRagan\u2019s PR Daily:How do you appeal to the tough-to-reach, even-tougher-to-impress audience of 20- and 30- somethings and women of all ages on the dry subject of health insurance?\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s ever had their content go viral will tell you it\u2019s not easy, but we were in the right place at the right time with the right message,\u201d she said in a statement."}
