She is still in good health. But when it happens, we both know that she wants above all to die quickly and without pain. She wants no heroic measures. Because my brother and I know this, and because she has the proper legal documents, she is likely to die as she wishes.\n\nMy mother is unusual. Not in what she wants \u2014 a Pew Research Center study indicates that 57 percent of Americans would ask their doctor to stop treatment so they could die if they had an incurable disease and were suffering a great deal of pain. What sets my mom apart is that she has been unafraid to talk to us about her wishes.\n\nMost Americans don\u2019t do that. Of adults 75 and over, the study found that only 17 percent had talked to their families about their end-of-life wishes. It is an uncomfortable conversation. It always seems too early to talk to a loved one about how she wants to die \u2014 until it\u2019s too late, and she can no longer make decisions for herself.\n\nBut perhaps soon, more Americans will be like my mom. On Jan. 1, Medicare will begin reimbursing doctors and other health professionals for time spent talking to patients about their end-of-life wishes. This is a big deal, but far from enough. End-of-life conversations need to become something families just do.\n\nThere\u2019s one place in America like that now: La Crosse, Wis.\n\nLa Crosse started down this path in 1984, when Bernard Hammes, a philosopher by training, was hired as director of medical humanities at the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation. His job was to work with medical personnel to improve their skills and help them make decisions in ethically fraught situations.\n\nIn one two-month period, Hammes saw three very elderly patients who had suffered devastating strokes and kidney failure, were being kept alive with dialysis, and could not speak for themselves. If the doctors stopped dialysis, the patients would die. But even on dialysis, the patients would never recover from their strokes.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cNone of the families had ever talked with the parent about the parent\u2019s perspective on dialysis and when to stop,\u201d Hammes said. \u201cFamilies were going to have to live with the question of \u2018did I do the right thing for my mom or father?\u2019 and they would never know the answer.\u201d These patients had not gotten sick suddenly. They had long, progressive illnesses and had been in care at Gundersen for years \u2014 and no one had thought to begin that conversation.\n\nThe lack of communication is often catastrophic for patients who do not want heroic measures. When family members don\u2019t know a relative\u2019s wishes, they often feel they must show their love by asking that everything be done. Anything short of the maximum seems like abandonment or betrayal.\n\nAnd that makes the choice also terrible for families. \u201cI witnessed frequent and repeated moral distress that health professionals and families had making decisions when there were no good decisions,\u201d Hammes said. \u201cIt was almost exclusively based on the fact that we didn\u2019t know what the patient wanted.\u201d\n\nResearch shows that families who are unaware of a patient\u2019s wishes suffer much more stress, anxiety and depression than those who are aware. \u201cIt was a difference of night and day,\u201d said Hammes. \u201cThe difference it makes in people\u2019s lives is so clear and big that not to do it seems cruel.\u201d\n\nHammes started a program to begin end-of-life conversations with dialysis patients and their families. Within two years, he said, almost all the families of dialysis patients knew their loved one\u2019s wishes.\n\nIn 1991, Gundersen set up a task force to spread the program throughout La Crosse, which included the Franciscan Hospital and the Skemp Clinic, alongside the Gundersen Lutheran Medical Foundation\u2019s hospital and clinic. All four collaborated, along with nursing homes, hospices and smaller hospitals.\n\nThe goal was not simply to have people fill out an advance directive and put it in their medical records. A written directive alone, members of the task force reasoned, could do more harm than good if it came as a surprise to the family, said Hammes. \u201cWe don\u2019t think mom understood what she signed,\u201d was a common response.\n\nJust as important as the legal document was a conversation with the patient and her family. The patient would need to understand the options \u2014 for example, that \u201cdo everything necessary to keep me alive\u201d can mean intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which on a frail elderly person can break her ribs and sternum; those who survive it often do so with abdominal bleeding and neurological damage. And the family had to agree to support the patient\u2019s decisions.\n\n\u201cWe really changed the nature of the question,\u201d said Hammes. \u201cIt\u2019s not: \u2018How do you fill out this legal document,\u2019 but \u2018What does good care look like if you become ill and may not recover?\u2019 At the most basic human level, what families face in those moments is, \u2018What does it mean to love my mom or dad when they\u2019re not going to recover, but we could still do some things to keep them alive? What does it mean to take good care of my mom at this point?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe task force brought its message to local churches, senior centers and community groups. Inside health care organizations, it became evident that doctors didn\u2019t have time for these conversations, but also that doctors weren\u2019t required. Instead, the task force trained nurses, social workers and chaplains.\n\nToday, Hammes said, 96 percent of people who die in La Crosse County have had a conversation with relatives about how they want to spend their last days, and those wishes have been entered into their electronic medical records.\n\nRelated More From Fixes Read previous contributions to this series.\n\nPresident Obama tried to include reimbursement for end-of-life conversations in the Affordable Care Act. Sarah Palin derailed it with a single Facebook post: \u201cThe America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama\u2019s \u2018death panel\u2019 so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their \u201clevel of productivity in society,\u201d whether they are worthy of health care.\u201d With that, she gave a rallying cry to the anti-ObamaCare right. Palin\u2019s post won PolitiFact\u2019s 2009 \u201cLie of the Year\u201d award.\n\nA year later, the Obama administration tried again to cover advance care planning decisions. Again, it proved too politically toxic.\n\nToday the political climate has improved. Advance care planning is no longer coupled to Obamacare, and Medicare\u2019s decision to cover end-of-life conversations will have a ripple effect. Some private insurers already cover these conversations, and when Medicare starts, the rest will most likely follow. Last Thursday, WPS Health Solutions, Wisconsin\u2019s largest nonprofit insurer, announced that its WPS Health Insurance and Arise Health Plan would begin to cover advance care planning conversations as of September.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, has introduced legislation each year to reimburse and encourage care planning conversations, on a scale going beyond what Medicare is proposing. This year, his Care Planning Act has three Democratic and three Republican original co-sponsors and the endorsement of dozens of organizations.\n\nThe issue is personal for Warner. His mother had Alzheimer\u2019s disease for 11 years before her death in 2010, and during the last eight or nine years she didn\u2019t speak. \u201cMy father and sister took care of my mom 24/7 at home with a little bit of extra help until the last week or two,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a well-informed citizen\u201d \u2014 exceedingly so; for much of that time he was governor of the state \u2014 \u201cbut we never had the conversation in our own family. Even though both of Mom\u2019s parents had Alzheimer\u2019s, we never sat down with my mom and asked her and thought this fully through. It is not always the easiest thing to talk through.\u201d\n\nGunderson has bundled its strategies, training curriculum and materials into a package called Respecting Choices, which, according to Hammes, is being used in about 125 American hospitals and several other countries. The program is also being studied in a randomized control trial with sites in six European countries.\n\nOthers are now spreading Gundersen\u2019s program. Minnesota was the first of a half-dozen states to establish a program called Honoring Choices. One other was Wisconsin; John Maycroft, the director of policy development and initiatives at the Wisconsin Medical Society, said that Honoring Choices Wisconsin works with 28 health care organizations \u2014 covering about half the state\u2019s patients \u2014 to train staff to use Respecting Choices. The group also helps health care organizations make these conversations a part of routine care \u2014 for example, by finding a physician to champion it at each site. It trains advocates for it in community settings like churches, and makes videos for Wisconsin public television.\n\nAs Respecting Choices spreads, it encounters a major obstacle that was not present in La Crosse. At Gundersen and the other founding organizations, doctors and other staff members did not (and still do not) bill for each procedure, a system called fee-for-service. Instead, they draw salaries. This mattered because insurers and Medicare don\u2019t reimburse health care personnel for having these conversations \u2014 it\u2019s unbillable time. Because staff members in La Crosse are largely salaried, that\u2019s not an issue for them.\n\nBut fee-for-service does matter on another level, even in La Crosse: Having end-of-life conversations often results in patients choosing less invasive health care. Gundersen spends less than the vast majority of American hospitals to care for inpatients in the last two years of their life; in 2010, for example, its spending was 40 percent below the national average. (The end-of-life conversations were not the only factor, but they were undoubtedly a major one.)\n\nSince the last two years of life for patients with chronic illness are responsible for a third of Medicare\u2019s costs, eliminating unwanted invasive care is great for taxpayers. But it\u2019s not as great for hospitals, which take in less money if they can\u2019t fill those beds. Although hospitals are switching slowly \u2014 too slowly \u2014 to value-based medicine, which pays according to quality, not quantity, of care, most hospitals still have a perverse incentive to provide as much medical care as possible.\n\nEven so, many fee-for-service hospitals are beginning to adopt advance care planning. \u201cSo many clinicians have the experience of performing CPR on a 90-year-old woman with heart disease,\u201d said Maycroft. \u201cThey remember what they felt and saw in the patient, and they\u2019re doing that because they never had a conversation. This is really important. It affects everyone in the world \u2014 literally. That\u2019s what motivates people to do this.\u201d\n\nJoin Fixes on Facebook and follow updates on twitter.com/nytimesfixes.
