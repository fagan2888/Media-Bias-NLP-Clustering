In what seemed like a shift in tone, he also said he is \u201call ears\u201d if \u201csomeone comes up with a better plan\u201d than Common Core.\n\nThe former governor suggested that one of his biggest challenges as he moves toward formally announcing a presidential campaign is public speaking. He is the first of half-a-dozen potential presidential candidates who will address the Club\u2019s three-day conference at The Breakers Resort. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has the Friday night dinnertime slot.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be during your time here \u2026 a lot better speakers than me,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIf I could get better at, I\u2019d be all-in on that. Trust me. But the simple fact is: I got to be governor of this purple state \u2013 this wacky, wonderful state \u2013 for eight years. I ran as a conservative \u2026 and I had a chance to do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of my job is to be able to tell the full story,\u201d he added.\n\nBush, out of office for eight years now, presented himself as a movement conservative during his time leading Florida.\n\n\u201cIn my second year, we actually by executive order got rid of affirmative action,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cThis was not an easy thing to do, but we eliminated race as a criteria for admissions in our university system. And we eliminated procurement policies that had set-asides and higher prices for minority-owned businesses.\u201d\n\nHe added that he enacted policies to help minority students and businesses succeed without handouts. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to have a lower standard to get in the university,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to have higher achievement to be able to go to universities.\u201d\n\nBush noted that he cut the size of Florida\u2019s state workforce by 13,000 as governor. He said he \u201ctook on the trial lawyers\u201d and governed \u201cfrugally.\u201d He trashed successor Charlie Crist\u2014then a Republican, now a Democrat\u2014as \u201ca complete disaster\u201d who undid some of his best accomplishments.\n\n\u201cIn Florida, we cut taxes every year I was governor,\u201d Bush said. \u201cEvery year!\u201d\n\nIn what could have been an implicit knock at New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who has seen his state\u2019s credit rating cut six times since he took office, Bush notes that Florida was the only state that went up to a AAA bond rating during his two terms.\n\nHe boasted of 2,500 separate line item vetoes, including programs proposed by Republicans. \u201cThey called me Veto Corleone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was so much fun to do.\u201d\n\nAfter his speech, he answered questions for half an hour.\n\nClub for Growth President David McIntosh posed questions that had been submitted by the audience, many of whom max out personally to whichever candidates the group endorses. In his introduction, the former Indiana congressman praised Bush\u2019s tenure as governor and fondly remembered working with the Floridian when he was an aide in George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration.\n\nBut after Bush\u2019s defense of his record in Florida, McIntosh declared at the start of his first question: \u201cMany of us, we\u2019ve watched you over the last several years where it seems some of your federal policy provisions seem to be more pro-government than what you did as governor.\u201d\n\nDuring the ensuing questions, Bush heaped praise on the Club and tried to give the impression that he is with the group on its biggest issues.\n\nThe Club is focused on economic freedom \u2013 opposing corporate welfare, promoting free markets and supporting low taxes \u2014 and at times it has been at odds with Republican leadership. The group has backed many insurgent conservative challengers against establishment favorites, including throwing early support behind Marco Rubio over Crist in the 2010 Senate race in Florida.\n\nOne of the Club\u2019s top priorities is killing the Export-Import Bank, which manages to survive in part because the U.S. Chamber of Commerce backs it.\n\n\u201cI think most of these things should be phased out,\u201d Bush said. \u201cEx-Im is a smaller one \u2026 We should find ways to lessen the contingent liability of the federal government.\u201d\n\nHe said the powers of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to issue government-backed loans also \u201cneed to be reviewed.\u201d Bush also complained that both parties have wrongly used the tax code to advance their social agendas.\n\n\u201cStop using the tax code to be able to create social policy,\u201d he said to applause.\n\nThis position could potentially be in conflict with Bush\u2019s previously espoused support for so-called \u201creform conservatism.\u201d Many of the scholars in that movement advocate various tax breaks and incentives to encourage family cohesion and other social policies.\n\nAsked if he would consider eliminating the Internal Revenue Service to put in place a national flat tax, Bush was noncommittal \u2013 promising to outline a detailed tax policy should he become a candidate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that yet.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s father famously dismissed supply-side theory as \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d in the 1980 GOP primaries. Bush presented himself as more in the mold of Ronald Reagan. \u201cSupply side initiatives have been successful in the past,\u201d the younger Bush professed Thursday.\n\nAfter delivering his answer about Common Core, Bush interjected: \u201cCan we do immigration? Because I\u2019m all-in on that too!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe system we have today is broken because we don\u2019t enforce the law,\u201d Bush declared, not answering any specific question. \u201cFor the people that are already here \u2026 my belief is that we need to give people a path to legal status. You pay your fines. You get a traditional work permit. You come out from the shadows. You pay taxes. You don\u2019t receive government assistance. You learn English. You don\u2019t commit crimes. Any of those things that you don\u2019t do would be a deportable offense. And since you\u2019re out of the shadows, it would be easier to do.\u201d\n\nBush then declared that he will not recant his position to win the nomination.\n\n\u201cWe need to get beyond this political fighting that creates a wedge issue that makes it harder for conservatives to win,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not backing down from something that is a core belief. Are we all supposed to just cower because at the moment people are all upset about something? No way. No how.\u201d\n\nAsked about Obamacare, Bush said that he thinks the Supreme Court will rule against the government in King vs. Burwell this June, potentially invalidating health care subsidies for as many as 7 million Americans.\n\n\u201cIf they do, that creates an opportunity for Republicans to offer an alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be for something. We need to be as focused on the replacement as we are for the repeal.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have a specific plan yet, but he said it would give people more choices and lower premiums. \u201cRepublicans should have this ready to go if this happens in the summer,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom here, Bush heads to Washington. He will address the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u2013 who are also addressing CPAC \u2013 come before the Club for Growth\u2019s meeting on Saturday.\n\nAt CPAC, Bush will spend all 20 minutes of his allotted time taking questions from Fox News host Sean Hannity. He not only expects, but wants, to again field the questions on immigration and Common Core. His team believes he must clear the air.\n\nAs part of his immigration monologue, Bush ripped Obama for his executive action to defer deportations and for fighting a federal court ruling that stayed its implementation.\n\n\u201cMy head explodes every time I watch the news,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get all upset about that because this president has trampled all over the Constitution on a regular basis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The ex-governor tackles Common Core and pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.", "title": "Bush says Florida years show he's no moderate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/jeb-bush-cpac-2015-115577.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/26/150226_jeb_bush_ap_3_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "CPAC,Club For Growth,Elections,Republicans,2016 Elections,Jeb Bush,Jeb Bush 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The ex-governor tackles Common Core and pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0e80\"", "article_summary": "Bush says Florida years show he's no moderatePALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 Jeb Bush complained Thursday night that \u201cthe narratives\u201d about his time as governor of Florida make him sound like a moderate when he was, in fact, very conservative.\n\u201cIn Florida, we cut taxes every year I was governor,\u201d Bush said.\nBush, out of office for eight years now, presented himself as a movement conservative during his time leading Florida.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need to have a lower standard to get in the university,\u201d he said.\nAsked if he would consider eliminating the Internal Revenue Service to put in place a national flat tax, Bush was noncommittal \u2013 promising to outline a detailed tax policy should he become a candidate."}
