If more and more people come and say they\u2019re hungry then I set up tables on the street with a sign and feed the people,\u201d Jackson said in an interview with Atlanta Progressive News.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a community activist. A civil rights activist,\u201d Joyce Dorsey, who is president of the Fulton County Community Action Authority and a close friend to Jackson, said.\n\nThe current trouble started in 2012, when heavy rains caused flooding in homes near Turner Field. Acres of parking lots surrounding the stadium created massive runoff.\n\nJackson didn\u2019t have flooding in her home, but some of her neighbors did.\n\nA few of them sued the City, and the Department of Watershed Management set out to develop a comprehensive plan to fix the stormwater problem.\n\nIn just two years the Department made real progress, diverting 13.34 million gallons of rainwater by installing numerous rain gardens and bioswales, repaving six miles of roads with permeable material, and constructing a five-million gallon water storage vault under one of the Turner Field parking lots, according to a Department report.\n\nThen, in September 2014, the Watershed Department unveiled a new plan: citing a need to divert ten million more gallons of water, Watershed Management Commissioner Jo Ann Macrina proposed to construct another underground storage vault in a Summerhill park, as well as a system of \u201ccapacity relief ponds\u201d in place of homes that had flooded.\n\nIn other words: save homes from flooding by demolishing them and replacing them with ponds.\n\nThis makes little sense considering the City didn\u2019t implement the full plan put forth by a design and engineering firm it contracted to respond to the flooding problem.\n\nGresham, Smith and Partners created a comprehensive plan that included the rainwater gardens and bioswales, permeable pavers, and underground vaults already mentioned.\n\nBut it also proposed to replace a portion of Turner Field\u2019s giant parking lot with a large greenspace that could curb runoff by absorbing water.\n\n\u201cPaying homage to the Braves while providing stormwater retention and green infrastructure, the Proposed Atlanta Fulton County Wet Pond will include jogging trails, walkways, recreation areas, and an elevated amphitheater for outdoor entertainment,\u201d the project description read.\n\nBut the Department of Watershed Management never greenlighted this part of the firm\u2019s proposal, and instead came up with its own plan to demolish twenty-nine houses.\n\nDorsey told APN that in May of this year, 2015, the City offered 212,000 dollars for Jackson\u2019s home and gave the elderly woman sixty days to make a decision.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s lived here for forty-seven years. She\u2019s lived in this community all her life. She\u2019s ninety-three years old, and you\u2019re talking about sixty days to figure out how to leave?\u201d Dorsey said.\n\nJackson\u2019s family fears what will happen if she has to move to another neighborhood where she doesn\u2019t have friends or support.\n\nSummerhill and Peoplestown are gentrifying, and housing prices have spiked.\n\nDorsey says the family hasn\u2019t had success finding a comparable house for $212,000 in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cI want to be right here in this community where I was born. I don\u2019t have no business being in nobody else\u2019s community,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nHer family is in the process of getting a second appraisal on Jackson\u2019s house.\n\nJackson\u2019s neighbors have had similar frustrations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like dealing with the mob. It\u2019s not a negotiation. It\u2019s their way or no way,\u201d Dwayne Adgar, who lives near Jackson on Ormond Street, told APN.\n\nAdgar says Markus Butts, a Watershed Department manager, told residents at a City Council meeting last year that the City appraiser would use \u201cGrant Park prices,\u201d meaning homes in nearby, affluent Grant Park would be included in a sales comparison to determine home values.\n\nAdgar\u2019s appraisal included no Grant Park houses; instead, the appraiser listed five comparisons that were riddled with problems.\n\nOn the list was a house that sold for 91,000 dollars in 2013 and was flipped for 293,000 dollars in 2014.\n\nInstead of using the lastest sale price, the appraiser used the much lower one, saying it was a better comparison because the higher price accounted for the cost of renovations. The appraiser apparently didn\u2019t consider how high demand has inflated housing prices all over Atlanta, regardless of physical improvements.\n\nThe list also included a house that, according to the appraiser\u2019s own description, is in \u201can area that is not as desirable as the main project area on Ormond Street. This type of analysis is the opposite of what Butts promised. That house sold for 106,000 dollars.\n\nThe highest priced house on the list was 155,000 dollars, and had not yet been sold at the time of the appraisal. It was under contract for that amount, and therefore subject to change.\n\nBased on these questionable sources, the city initially offered Adgar 122,000 dollars. Adgar emailed a complaint to Butts, Councilwoman Carla Smith (District 1), and two employees of an acquisitions company that was handling the process on behalf of the City. He says he never received a response to his email.\n\nThree months later, on August 17, 2015, he received a letter with an offer of $148,925\u2013\u2013still less than what he says he needs in order to stay in the neighborhood.\n\nThe letter gave him until August 31 to send a \u201csatisfactory reply\u201d or else face \u201clegal proceedings.\u201d\n\nAnother neighbor, Malcolm Jones, said he never even saw an official appraisal from the city.\n\n\u201cThey just sent me an offer in the low 100s and gave me ten days to get my own appraisal\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m bear-hunting with a water pistol. I\u2019m defenseless,\u201d Jones said.\n\nA City of Atlanta spokesperson wanted to comment when contacted on Friday afternoon, but was unable to reach officials because it was Labor Day weekend and many people were already out of the office.\n\nMs. Jackson and her neighbors are running out of time. The Urban Design Commission (UDC) will consider whether to grant a permit to demolish their homes on Wednesday, September 09, 2015. The UDC meeting will take place at 4pm in the Old Council Chambers at Atlanta City Hall.\n\nAPN\u2019s Editor, who served on the FACAA Board of Directors with Jackson, has created a Facebook event page for the Commission meeting here:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/115892555431365/\n\nMs. Jackson demurred at many points during her interview, saying that she isn\u2019t trying to a point finger at anyone or start any trouble.\n\nShe just wants to stay in her home, or at least be treated to a fair relocation.\n\nHer daughter, Cheryl Ansley-Calhoun, was more forthright.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for her. She\u2019s taken care of everybody for so long. Now it\u2019s time for all of us to take care of her,\u201d Ansley-Calhoun said.\n\n(END/2015)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3e32\"", "article_summary": "The UDC meeting will take place at 4pm in the Old Council Chambers at Atlanta City Hall.\nI don\u2019t have no business being in nobody else\u2019s community,\u201d Jackson said.\nA civil rights activist,\u201d Joyce Dorsey, who is president of the Fulton County Community Action Authority and a close friend to Jackson, said.\nA few of them sued the City, and the Department of Watershed Management set out to develop a comprehensive plan to fix the stormwater problem.\n(APN) ATLANTA \u2014 One of Atlanta\u2019s most revered community leaders\u2013Mattie Jackson, 93\u2013is in danger of losing her home to eminent domain as the City moves forward with plans to bulldoze two city blocks in Summerhill-Peoplestown in order to install stormwater detention ponds."}
