Per capita highway funding for Arizona dropped by 8 percent in that time, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nThe reductions translate to millions of dollars.\n\n\u201cIf you lose that kind of money, you just can\u2019t make it up,\u201d Maricopa Association of Governments Director Eric Anderson said.\n\nThe association, which oversees transportation planning for metropolitan Phoenix and areas of Pinal County, has had to defer more than a dozen projects. They range from adding lanes to major interstates to building a new freeway to relieve congestion on Interstate 10, the major east-west corridor for the region.\n\nCompounding the problem, Arizona taxes on fuel and vehicle licenses and other fees haven\u2019t generated the necessary revenue to keep up with maintenance needs of the state\u2019s road system, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. \u201cIt\u2019s really a trend we\u2019ve seen over the last few years but not something we\u2019re surprised with,\u201d ADOT spokeswoman Laura Douglas said.\n\nIt\u2019s also been difficult to stretch transportation dollars outside of metropolitan areas, where there aren\u2019t as many alternative sources of funding, she said. The department has shifted to focus on maintenance over expansion.\n\n\u201cWe really saw that shift to a preservation-based system, which means to really ensure we are protecting the infrastructure we have in place,\u201d Douglas said.\n\nThe lagging federal funds over the last few years have led to \u201ceither lower than expected or, in some cases, absolute declines in revenue,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cCongress needs to either increase revenue in the Federal Highway Trust Fund or find some other ways to fund transportation in this country.\u201d\n\nPrevious local solutions haven\u2019t fixed the funding problem either, Anderson said. Revenue from a Maricopa County voter-approved 0.5 percent sales tax for transportation needs has fallen short of expectations by about $1.2 billion, and the gap is growing, he said.\n\nTransportation planners are considering other ways to help commuters while dream highway projects get put on the backburner. Anderson said officials continue to look at technology in traffic systems to help smooth out traffic flows.\n\n\u201cEven if we had more money, it\u2019s always more prudent to think how can we get more of out of what we have versus building new stuff,\u201d Anderson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Federal spending on roads and highways has dipped in Arizona, meaning congested freeways and bottlenecked interchanges in metro Phoenix aren't likely to be upgraded any time soon.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Federal spending on roads and highways has dipped in Arizona, meaning congested freeways and bottlenecked interchanges in metro Phoenix aren\u2019t likely to be upgraded any time soon.", "title": "Declining highway funds prevent road upgrades in Arizona", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/21/declining-highway-funds-prevent-road-upgrades-in-a/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/21/dadbfa3f61afc7086e0f6a706700e787.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/21/dadbfa3f61afc7086e0f6a706700e787.jpg", "description": "Federal spending on roads and highways has dipped in Arizona, meaning congested freeways and bottlenecked interchanges in metro Phoenix aren't likely to be upgraded any time soon.", "card": "summary", "title": "Declining highway funds prevent road upgrades in Arizona"}, "Author": "TERRY TANG", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Per capita highway funding for Arizona dropped by 8 percent in that time, according to the Federal Highway Administration.\nRevenue to Arizona from the Federal Highway Trust Fund declined 3 percent during the five-year period ending in 2013, the latest year for which federal numbers were available.\nThe lagging federal funds over the last few years have led to \u201ceither lower than expected or, in some cases, absolute declines in revenue,\u201d Anderson said.\nTransportation planners are considering other ways to help commuters while dream highway projects get put on the backburner.\nPHOENIX (AP) - Federal spending on roads and highways has dipped in Arizona, meaning congested freeways and bottlenecked interchanges in metro Phoenix aren\u2019t likely to be upgraded any time soon."}
