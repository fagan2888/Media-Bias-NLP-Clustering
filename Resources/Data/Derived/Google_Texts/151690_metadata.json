Each team plays 12 matches to qualify for each competition\u2019s playoffs to determine the winning alliance. Robots score points by stacking totes on scoring platforms located on specific spots on the 54-by-27-foot playing field and capping those stacks with recycling containers and properly disposing of pool noodles that represent litter. In keeping with the game\u2019s recycling theme, all game pieces used are reusable or recycled by teams back at their schools.\n\nOn March 8 and 9, a district competition was held at Mount Olive High School. In the field of 38 teams from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware were 14 teams from Central Jersey, including Team 41: Watchung Hills Regional H.S.; Team 56: Bound Brook H.S.; Team 136: Plainfield H.S.; Team 224: Piscataway H.S.; Team 293: Hopewell Valley Central H.S.; Team 303: Bridgewater-Raritan Regional H.S.; Team 869: Middlesex H.S.; Team 1228: Rahway H.S.; Team 1257: Union County Vo-Tech H.S.; Team 1279: Immaculata H.S.
