The point guard played some of his best basketball of the season during the span, and because of that he is The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In three games, Paul averaged 29.7 points, 12.0 assists and 2.3 steals. He shot 53.2 percent from the field, including 47.4 percent from 3-point range, and he didn\u2019t miss a free throw \u2014 on an average of 10 attempts per game.\n\nBackground: We\u2019ve all seen \u201cThe Crossover,\u201d the move Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry put on Paul that put him on the ground. But despite that one moment of shame, Paul has been brilliant. Never more has that been apparent than recently, just when the Clippers need it in the middle of a playoff race. Since December, Paul\u2019s performance has improved every month, and the Clippers are benefiting.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: Is there a question about whether Paul is the best point guard in the NBA? Sure there is. Curry is just one of a new wave of young players pushing for that crown. But do you still want Paul as your team leader, running the show? Absolutely. He\u2019s every bit as effective as he had ever been, and this past week showed it. Furthermore, Paul\u2019s performance is peaking at the right time, and because of that the Clippers will be a sleeper team in the Western Conference playoffs.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Chris Paul,NBA,spotlight", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "In three games, Chris Paul averaged 29.7 points, 12.0 assists and 2.3 steals.", "title": "Chris Paul: Spotlight on the Clippers point guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/04/04/chris-paul-spotlight-on-the-clippers-point-guard/12800/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/04/Chris-Paul.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "In three games, Chris Paul averaged 29.7 points, 12.0 assists and 2.3 steals.", "title": "Chris Paul: Spotlight on the Clippers point guard", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2015/04/04/chris-paul-spotlight-on-the-clippers-point-guard/12800/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2015/04/Chris-Paul.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "In three games, Chris Paul averaged 29.7 points, 12.0 assists and 2.3 steals."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd935c\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on\u2026 Chris Paul, point guard, ClippersWhen: The March 28-April 3 evaluation period brought us the return of an old friend \u2014 Chris Paul.\nDempsey\u2019s take: Is there a question about whether Paul is the best point guard in the NBA?\nThe point guard played some of his best basketball of the season during the span, and because of that he is The Denver Post\u2019s NBA player of the week.\nSince December, Paul\u2019s performance has improved every month, and the Clippers are benefiting.\nFurthermore, Paul\u2019s performance is peaking at the right time, and because of that the Clippers will be a sleeper team in the Western Conference playoffs."}
