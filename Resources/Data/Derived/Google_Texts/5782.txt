Pierre, SD

The Powerball odds have now swung in your favor, thanks to the new rules launched Sunday.

The new rules are designed to increase your odds at winning smaller prizes, while decreasing chances of winning the big jackpot.

Under the new game, your chances of winning a prize go from about 1 in 32 to about 1 in 25, with the odds of winning the jackpot going from 1 in 175 million to 1 in 292 million.

The Powerball's third-place prize also shoots up from $10,000 to $50,000. The pool of white ball numbers will also increase, while the number of Powerball numbers will decrease.

The drawing for the first revised game is October 7.
