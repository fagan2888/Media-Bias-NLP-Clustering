Florida cop kills family dog standing next to 2-year-old child [WKMG-TV]

A Florida family intends to take legal action after a local sheriff’s deputy shot and killed the family dog while the family’s 2-year-old child sat dangerously close by.

WKMG-TV reported on Monday that a deputy from the Brevard County Sheriff’s Department arrived at the unidentified family’s home after a neighbor reported seeing the boy unattended.

Officials said the dog, Brownie, behaved aggressively toward the deputy, forcing him to fire. But neighbors and relatives rejected the department’s story, saying the child’s mother was sitting 15 feet away in a car port. They also accused the unidentified deputy of being the aggressor.

“The dog’s first thought is, Hey you’re walking up to me with a gun,’ and the dog growls,” one family member, Robert Gringas, told WKMG. “The dog didn’t lunge at him, the dog didn’t do anything. The dog just growled and then he put two bullets in him.”

The boy, who was in his stroller at the time of the shooting, was not injured. The deputy finished his shift and has not been disciplined as of Tuesday evening.
