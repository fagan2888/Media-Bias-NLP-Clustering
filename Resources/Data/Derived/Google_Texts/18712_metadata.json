Republicans and other critics of health care reform are cynically pointing to their problems as evidence that the whole reform effort is a waste of money that ought to be repealed.\n\nThey neglect to mention that the nonprofit plans, known as health insurance cooperatives, were created as a weak, underfunded alternative to a much stronger option that the Republicans blocked from passage.\n\nBack in 2009, while the reform law was being debated in Congress, most Democrats were pushing for a so-called public option, a government-run plan that consumers could choose as an alternative to private insurance. Such a plan would not have to generate profits and would have stronger bargaining powers to obtain discounts from health care providers, enabling it to charge lower premiums than private plans.\n\nWhen it became clear that no public plan could survive a Republican filibuster, Senator Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat, proposed setting up these cooperatives to compete with the profit-making plans. They, too, were presumed able to charge lower premiums because they would not have to earn profits. The co-op provision was included in the reform law enacted in March 2010.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nCo-ops have been created in 23 states, enrolling more than a million people as of March 25. However, eight of these co-ops \u2014 in Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, New York, Nevada, Tennessee and Oregon \u2014 have announced this year that they are closing, and many of the remaining co-ops are losing money, too.\n\nTheir problems have been attributed to wrong estimates for how many people might enroll and to setting premiums too low to cover the cost of care, as well as severe reductions in the amount of money available to the co-ops from federal loans and for risk adjustment payments, both the result of Republican opposition to supporting the plans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe overriding problem was the difficulty in setting up the co-ops from scratch to compete against entrenched insurance companies with deep pockets. Still, with capable management and adequate funding, nonprofit cooperative plans can succeed for patients and providers. Group Health Cooperative, based in Seattle, has been in business for 70 years. It provides coverage and care for around 600,000 people in Washington and Idaho.\n\nThe co-op closures will mean that hundreds of thousands of people covered by those plans will have to sign up with other plans, probably with higher premiums.\n\nRepublicans and other critics have been trying for four years to destroy health care reform. Three years ago the Supreme Court rejected their efforts to declare the health care reform law unconstitutional and this past June it rejected their attempt to invalidate subsidies to help buy insurance on the federal exchange used by most states.\n\nNow they are after smaller game, the co-ops. The Obama administration should see if there are ways to buttress the remaining co-ops financially. Even if some of the co-ops close, their enrollees will be able to find other sound health coverage thanks to the reform law Republicans were unable to repeal.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151020032118, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans are now going after nonprofit insurance plans.", "title": "A New Attack on Health Care Reform", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/opinion/a-new-attack-on-health-care-reform.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003985735"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/20/opinion/20tue1web/20tue1web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/opinion/a-new-attack-on-health-care-reform.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003985735", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/opinion/a-new-attack-on-health-care-reform.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "A New Attack on Health Care Reform", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 20, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Editorials,Health Insurance and Managed Care,United States Politics and Government,Republican Party,Cooperatives,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Cooperative", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/20/opinion/20tue1web/20tue1web-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Republicans are now going after nonprofit insurance plans.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/20/opinion/20tue1web/20tue1web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Republicans are now going after nonprofit insurance plans.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 20, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-11-02", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "published": "2015-10-20", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "20tue1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20151102050004, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/20/opinion/a-new-attack-on-health-care-reform.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/20/opinion/20tue1web/20tue1web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Republicans are now going after nonprofit insurance plans.", "title": "A New Attack on Health Care Reform"}, "pdate": 20151020, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003985735, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "A New Attack on Health Care Reform", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc96e\"", "article_summary": "Republicans and other critics of health care reform are cynically pointing to their problems as evidence that the whole reform effort is a waste of money that ought to be repealed.\nRepublicans and other critics have been trying for four years to destroy health care reform.\nPhotoIn recent months, several nonprofit insurance plans that were created to compete with for-profit insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act have run into financial difficulties.\nEven if some of the co-ops close, their enrollees will be able to find other sound health coverage thanks to the reform law Republicans were unable to repeal.\nThe co-op provision was included in the reform law enacted in March 2010."}
