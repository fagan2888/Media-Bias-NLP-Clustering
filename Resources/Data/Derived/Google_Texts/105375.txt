COUNCIL BLUFFS — If a robotic arm worked for Tony Stark in “Iron Man,” it can work for engineering students at Abraham Lincoln High School in Council Bluffs.

On Thursday, Ellison Technologies Automation donated a robot cell to the school's engineering academy. It will be used by students in the computer integrated manufacturing course and will assist them in learning manufacturing processes, said Justin Heckman, who teaches science and engineering classes at Abraham Lincoln.

Greg Olenick, vice president and general manager for the engineering company, said the robotic arm is the same machinery that Stark uses to repair his armor in the “Iron Man” movie.

The donation to Abraham Lincoln began with a conversation between Heckman and Olenick.

Heckman asked Olenick: “Do you have any robots just sitting around and gathering dust?”

The company had a robotic arm that costs about $60,000 that was equipped with a special gripper. In fact, only about 10 are used across the United States, Olenick said.

Heckman said students will use the robot to help produce wooden iPhone cases, which may be customized and later sold. Other options, including a golf club head or light switch, were considered.

For 16-year-old Matt Cumberland, a junior engineering student, operating the robotic arm showcased technological advances and the department's educational opportunities.

He said the engineering program “really works my brain the way it needs to be worked.”

Olenick said the equipment shows the community the reality of manufacturing work. Often, he said, people have an image of a dirty environment.

“We thought this was a great opportunity to show what manufacturing is today,” he said. “Jobs robots do today are jobs that are hard to fill.”
