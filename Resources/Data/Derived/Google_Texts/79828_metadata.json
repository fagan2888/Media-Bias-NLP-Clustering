Valbuena connected for his team-leading 10th homer in the first.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something to it, the way things ended last year,\u201d Rasmus said of homering against his former team. \u201cI was happy to help my team rather than do something against them.\u201d\n\nMcHugh (5-1) allowed two runs and six hits. He struck out nine.\n\n\u201cThree or four (times) they had guys on second with nobody out,\u201d McHugh said. \u201cYou have to pitch in high stress situations. But we were able to battle through it. We\u2019ve been doing it all year. Making a pitch when we need it.\u201d\n\nThe right-hander was coming off his worst start of the season after being tagged for seven runs against San Francisco, a loss that ended a streak of a win in 11 straight decisions.\n\n\u201cHe was under duress every inning,\u201d Houston manager A.J. Hinch said. \u201cHe had the leadoff batter on base the first four innings. That\u2019s not easy. He got out of it a couple of times. A couple of times they scored. But they never really got to him. He controlled the damage.\u201d\n\nMcHugh is 14-7 with a 2.80 ERA in his last 27 starts dating to last May 27.\n\nPat Neshek was perfect in the eighth and Luke Gregerson pitched the ninth for his 10th save.\n\nIn improving the AL\u2019s top record to 25-13, Houston matched the 1998 club for best 38-game start in franchise history. It was the Astros\u2019 first four-game sweep of the Blue Jays and second sweep of Toronto after taking a three-game series in June 2005.\n\nThe Blue Jays tied it at one on Jose Bautista\u2019s sacrifice fly in the third.\n\nRyan Goins\u2019 sacrifice fly in the fourth gave Toronto a 2-1 lead, but Jonathan Villar\u2019s RBI double to left knotted it at 2 in the bottom half.\n\nToronto went 1-6 on its road trip.\n\n\u201cWe just got our butt whooped here,\u201d Toronto manager John Gibbons said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to dissect it any more than that. That\u2019s just the way it goes sometimes.\u201d\n\nJake Marisnick upped Houston\u2019s lead to 4-2 with a sacrifice fly in the seventh.\n\nMark Buehrle (5-3) had a third straight solid outing, giving up four runs and six hits with five strikeouts in a season-high eight innings.\n\nIt was Buehrle\u2019s first complete game since July 25, 2013, against the Astros. Buehrle has allowed seven runs in 19 innings over his last three starts after being tagged for 13 runs in 10 innings in the prior two starts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d Buehrle said of how Toronto\u2019s been playing. \u201cI\u2019m stating the obvious right now when I say that we stink. We are not playing very good in every aspect. When we\u2019re pitching good, we\u2019re not hitting. When we hit and score runs, which we have done most of the year, we are not doing a good job of pitching.\u201d\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nBlue Jays: 2B Devon Travis did not play after leaving Saturday\u2019s game with left shoulder irritation after striking out in the seventh.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBlue Jays: RHP Aaron Sanchez (3-3) will try to bounce back after allowing a season-high five runs in a loss to Baltimore Wednesday as Toronto opens a four-game series at home against the Angels.\n\nAstros: RHP Lance McCullers will make his MLB debut Monday to start a three-game series against Oakland. McCullers, who was the 41st pick in the 2012 draft, was promoted to Triple-A Fresno Thursday from Double-A Corpus Christi, but he did not pitch a game for Fresno.\n\n\u201cIt feels good to walk in here and know I\u2019ve accomplished my life long goal,\u201d McCullers said. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising because I had just gotten to Fresno and expected to be there.\u201d\n\nHOMER HAPPY\n\nValbuena and Morgan Ensberg, who had 11 in in 2006, are the only third baseman in Astros history to record 10 homers in the club\u2019s first 38 games. Of Valbuena\u2019s 10 long balls, nine have been solo shots. Rasmus\u2019 homer was his third go-ahead homer this season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just as in his last start, Collin McHugh said things were tough from the first pitch.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Just as in his last start, Collin McHugh said things were tough from the first pitch.", "title": "McHugh leads Astros to 4-2 win over Blue Jays", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/17/mchugh-leads-astros-to-4-2-win-over-blue-jays/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/17/f7593ab41045c216760f6a706700af2c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/17/f7593ab41045c216760f6a706700af2c.jpg", "description": "Just as in his last start, Collin McHugh said things were tough from the first pitch.", "card": "summary", "title": "McHugh leads Astros to 4-2 win over Blue Jays"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "McHugh pitched seven strong innings and Luis Valbuena and Colby Rasmus each homered, leading the Houston Astros over the Toronto Blue Jays 4-2 on Sunday for their fifth straight win.\nIt was the Astros\u2019 first four-game sweep of the Blue Jays and second sweep of Toronto after taking a three-game series in June 2005.\nThis time, though, McHugh was able to keep it close until the Astros scored some runs.\nHOUSTON (AP) - Just as in his last start, Collin McHugh said things were tough from the first pitch.\nThe Blue Jays tied it at one on Jose Bautista\u2019s sacrifice fly in the third."}
