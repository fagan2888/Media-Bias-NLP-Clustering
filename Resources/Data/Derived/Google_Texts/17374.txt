Sen. Ted Cruz blasted the Obama administration Saturday for its reluctance to fight or even define the threat of the Islamic State in the U.S. and abroad.

Speaking at FreedomWorks' Rising Tide Summit in Iowa, Cruz vowed that any individuals who pledged allegiance to the Islamic State would be "signing their death warrant."

"We will carpet bomb them into oblivion," Cruz said of the radical Islamic terrorists' group stronghold in the Middle East.

"I don't know if sand can glow in the dark, but we're going to find out."
