The popular Mr. Pizza on Springwood Ave a convenient store that sits in the middle of one of Asbury Park's toughest neighborhoods. 081815 (Photo: Tom Spader/Gannett)Buy Photo\n\nASBURY PARK \u2013 One by one, flour-coated wings and thighs are dropped into the hot, bubbling oil of the deep fryer.\n\nThe aroma of frying chicken fills the convenience store as customers come and go through the door propped open on a hot August afternoon.\n\nSome are hand-fanning themselves as they wait for their food in the unairconditioned blue and gray-painted corner store.\n\n\u201cLet me get a three piece,\u201d a man in black basketball shorts and a white T-shirt said to \u201cNick.\u201d Everyone that came in seemed to be on a first name basis with the 47-year-old Middle Eastern owner of Mr. Pizza.\n\nNick Ismael had to move fast.\n\nIt was 1 p.m., and the lunch rush quickly depleted the fried chicken in the heated display case.\n\nGranddaughters run historic Asbury Park fortunetelling shop\n\n\u201cWe have our own spices, and we make this chicken taste better than everybody else\u2019s,\u201d Ismael said. \u201cThat\u2019s why everybody comes here.\u201d\n\nIsmael also serves other hot foods including pizza \u2014 which he initially thought would be the big seller when he named his store Mr. Pizza. But while the chicken is king, he has no plans to rename the store Mr. Chicken.\n\nBuy Photo Asbury Park NJ Nick Ismael owner of Mr. Pizza on Springwood Ave. in Asbury Park.

That\u2019s how he came up with items for his menu.\n\nIsmael and a friend were working in the kitchen at Mr. Spot Pizza on Memorial Drive in Asbury Park and wanted a place of their own.\n\nSo they found a building for sale at the corner of Springwood and Ridge, took out a bank loan and bought the shop that was formerly a Jamaican restaurant. The two men opened Mr. Pizza in 2000.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t that familiar with Asbury Park,\u201d said Ismael, who was living in the Clifton area at the time. \u201cI was just lucky to get a location that was nice.\u201d\n\nIsmael said he spent about three months fixing up the building before opening Mr. Pizza. Today, the convenience store is the go-to spot on Springwood Avenue.\n\nThe store thrives even though it is centered in a tough neighborhood known for poverty, shootings and drugs.\n\nCondos, hotel planned for Asbury Park eyesore\n\nCrime has fluctuated over the years, Ismael said. However, he believes there was more crime in the earlier years of Mr. Pizza.\n\nIsmael remains committed to serving this southwest Asbury Park community where there are plenty of families but few merchants.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows us, and we get respect and I think that\u2019s the main reason I get the same customers every day,\u201d said the married father of three.\n\nBuy Photo Asbury Park NJ Nick Ismael owner of Mr. Pizza on Springwood Ave. in Asbury Park.

Five Asbury Park men were arrested and charged in connection with the incident.\n\nIn April 2014, a large fight erupted outside of Mr. Pizza resulting in several arrests and injuries, police say.\n\nOn any given day, foot patrol officers are seen walking near the corner of Springwood and Ridge, where Mr. Pizza building sits. Across the street are three boarded up vacant houses where squatters are known to sleep.\n\nAsbury Park: Johnny Mac's decor must go\n\nYet, Mr. Pizza is one of few eateries in Asbury Park that stays open until 2 a.m.\n\nIsmael said most community members respect his business enough to keep trouble outside. And he noted that his business has never been robbed.\n\nOccasionally, he has to call the police on disorderly people or tell people to leave if they are loitering\n\n\u201cI take care of my own business, I worry about what\u2019s happening in my business,\u201d Ismael said. \u201cWhat they are doing outside, I let the cops take care of that.\u201d\n\nDespite the challenges of the neighborhood, Ismael said he has never considered leaving.\n\nSimilar to any other business in an urban community, Ismael is meeting a need and has a customer base that depends on him every day of the week.\n\nMr. Pizza is so essential to the neighborhood that some customers get upset when it closes early for holidays, Ismael said.\n\n\u201cI think people are so used to us, and it makes it harder for them if I\u2019m not there,\u201d Ismael said.\n\nBuy Photo Asbury Park NJ Nick Ismael owner of Mr. Pizza on Springwood Ave. in Asbury Park.

He has donated food to area Little Leagues, churches and events.\n\nAnd when his regular patrons are short on cash, he allows them to take their items and pay him later.\n\n\u201cYou gotta give back to the community,\u201d Ismael said.\n\nRising from rock bottom: The fight is one to save homeless youth at the Shore\n\nIsmael said he watched many of his customers grow up from children to young adults.\n\nJamarri Harbison, 19, remembers riding to Mr. Pizza on two wheels to get candy when he was younger.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the best store in town,\u201d Harbison said, as he walked out the store with a box of chicken and an Arizona Fruit Punch. \u201cThey\u2019ve got good chicken.\u201d\n\nNicquel Terry; nterry@gannettnj.com; 732-643-4023\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
