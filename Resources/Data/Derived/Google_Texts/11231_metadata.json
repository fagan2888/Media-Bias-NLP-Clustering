He\u2019s an assistant professor of religious studies at James Madison University.\n\nThe connection between his day job and his new book? He sees our societal preoccupation with \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d foods, our serial demonization of MSG, carbohydrates, processed foods, salt, cholesterol, sugar, gluten and so on as a cultlike obsession built not on science but on myths and superstition.\n\nLevinovitz has written an angry, funny and highly readable condemnation of the \u201cfearmongering\u201d nutrition business \u2013 which he says is not just wrong but detrimental to public health.\n\n\u201cEvery food is a potential demon,\u201d he writes. \u201cTalking about food this way . . . creates neurotic eaters who see foods as pure or impure, natural or processed, good or evil.\u201d\n\nAnd while he admits there is a \u201csignificant minority\u201d of people who are healthier when they avoid gluten, he argues, \u201cAnxiety about what you eat can produce precisely the same symptoms linked to gluten sensitivity.\u201d\n\nHe recounts tales of scientific studies that don\u2019t prove what policymakers say they prove, and he peppers the book with anecdotes such as the grain-abstaining monks of ancient China and a Duke University diet guru who whipped his female clients.\n\nThe book concludes with a 26-page, handsome presentation of his own \u201cscientifically proven revolution in healthy eating!\u201d: the UNpacked Diet, in which you eat all you want of anything as long as it hasn\u2019t been packaged in plastic, aluminum foil or other \u201chazardous\u201d modern materials. (Those would be pretty much anything except your grandmother\u2019s glass jars.) It\u2019s a hilarious, pitch-perfect parody \u2013 which he then debunks, point by point, in the same way he took apart paleo, gluten-free, rice, low-salt and other diets.\n\nContraception\n\n\u201cStill Paying for Birth Control? Stop That Right Now,\u201d Women\u2019s Health\n\nIt\u2019s fair to assume that the editors at Women\u2019s Health magazine are reasonably savvy about issues involving gynecology and reproductive rights. So when one of those editors called her new insurance company about a mail-order prescription for her birth control, she was surprised to have the company say that birth control wasn\u2019t covered. She\u2019d have to pay $200.\n\nActually, that\u2019s against the law, as Korin Miller notes after relaying the anecdote on Womenshealthmag.com. \u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, women with health insurance are entitled to important preventative services, such as birth control and well-woman visits with no co-pay or deductible,\u201d she writes.\n\nApparently, a lot of women have been accepting similar rejections from their insurers. So last week the Obama administration issued a \u201cguidance\u201d to \u201celiminate any ambiguity,\u201d the Health and Human Services Department said. \u201cInsurers must cover without cost-sharing at least one form of contraception in each of the methods that the Food and Drug Administration has identified,\u201d the directive says, \u201cincluding the ring, the patch and intrauterine devices.\u201d\n\nFor good measure, the guidance goes on to remind insurers that if a woman is at an increased risk for having the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 cancer-susceptibility gene, the company must cover preventive screening, genetic counseling and genetic testing.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://delonline.us/1Hi8y81", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Two recent pieces of media focus on myths about what you eat; paying for birth control.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600071892", "og": {"site_name": "delawareonline", "description": "Two recent pieces of media focus on myths about what you eat; paying for birth control.", "title": "Recent media: Myths about diet; free birth control", "url": "http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/health/2015/05/20/recent-media-myths-diet-free-birth-control/27668737/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/delawareonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two recent pieces of media focus on myths about what you eat; paying for birth control.", "creator": "@delawareonline", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b6a3d7813445917ec040a0f77253baa6f911aa92/c=0-248-1000-1248&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/20/Wilmington/B9317405199Z.1_20150520171903_000_G18ARKNE9.1-0.jpg", "title": "Recent media: Myths about diet; free birth control", "site": "@delawareonline", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "p": {"domain_verify": "815a1068696ac12ba65bd5231740d78d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 175037755863662}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "So when one of those editors called her new insurance company about a mail-order prescription for her birth control, she was surprised to have the company say that birth control wasn\u2019t covered.\n\u201cThe Gluten Lie and Other Myths About What You Eat\u201d by Alan LevinovitzTwo recent pieces of media focus on gluten and the myths about what you eat, and whether you have to pay for birth control.\nContraception\u201cStill Paying for Birth Control?\nNutrition\u201cThe Gluten Lie and Other Myths About What You Eat\u201d by Alan LevinovitzAlan Levinovitz, author of \u201cThe Gluten Lie and Other Myths About What You Eat,\u201d is not \u2013 and does not claim to be \u2013 a nutritionist.\n\u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, women with health insurance are entitled to important preventative services, such as birth control and well-woman visits with no co-pay or deductible,\u201d she writes."}
