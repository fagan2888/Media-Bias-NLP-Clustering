But there\u2019s a problem: The site has been flagged as completely inaccurate and missing massive chunks of data.\n\nRelated: $45 Billion Wasted in Redundant Federal Programs\n\nSeriously. Only between 2 percent and 7 percent of entries listed on the site were accurate in 2012, according to a new Government Accountability Office report. The auditors found incomplete or inaccurate information on grants and loans totaling $619 billion.\n\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work - agencies are directed to report most of the grants they award directly to the website. They\u2019re supposed to include the amount of the grant, the name of the recipient, where the awardee is based, etc. However, auditors say that agencies seem to be confused about the reporting guidelines set by the Office of Management and Budget. And that confusion has led to serious discrepancies posted on the website.\n\nFor example, the Health and Human Services and Interior Departments both failed to accurately report billions of dollars in spending, auditors said. Even the White House didn\u2019t accurately report spending from its own programs.\n\nThe issue is the lack of uniform reporting guidelines said Carol Cha, GAO official who authored the report. She clarified that they aren\u2019t saying $619 billion is actually unaccounted for within the federal government, it\u2019s just not detailed accurately on the website.\n\nRelated: Government Blatantly Wastes $30 Billion This Year\n\nThis is still a huge deal, since having significant information missing from a website aimed at transparency not only negates its purpose but raises even more questions about government competency.\n\nThough many agencies failed to send in accurate information, the auditors blame the Office of Management and Budget for not clarifying reporting guidelines.\n\nCha said most of the agencies weren\u2019t even aware that such information was missing and many went back and corrected any inaccuracies. She noted that after the report came out, the total expenditures on the website increased by 23 percent.\n\nThe most common error by agencies was entering the wrong \"place of performance\" of the federal contracts.\n\nRelated: Federal Government Pays Workers $5Million Not to Work\n\nOther mistakes included not listing who won the contract or entering the wrong price or date.\n\n\u201cOMB needs to do a better job of clarifying what the reporting guidelines are,\u201d Cha said. GAO also recommended that OMB develop an enforcement mechanism to make sure agencies are following the guidelines.\n\nOMB generally agreed with the report and said it would further clarify how agencies should be reporting their awards and grants. It is also planning to re-launch a new version of the website with \"enhanced data and usability.\"\n\nThis story was updated at 4:15 p.m.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The government\u2019s attempt at making federal spending more transparent is failing misera", "title": "Government Spending Website Is Off by $619 Billion", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/06/Government-Spending-Website-619-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05112012_Congress_Spending_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/06/Government-Spending-Website-619-Billion", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05112012_Congress_Spending_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The government\u2019s attempt at making federal spending more transparent is failing misera", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb065\"", "article_summary": "The government\u2019s attempt at making federal spending more transparent is failing miserably.\nShe clarified that they aren\u2019t saying $619 billion is actually unaccounted for within the federal government, it\u2019s just not detailed accurately on the website.\nEven the White House didn\u2019t accurately report spending from its own programs.\nFor example, the Health and Human Services and Interior Departments both failed to accurately report billions of dollars in spending, auditors said.\nOnly between 2 percent and 7 percent of entries listed on the site were accurate in 2012, according to a new Government Accountability Office report."}
