But digging into the survey data shows that ObamaCare has actually succeeded at making Americans more dependent on government:\n\nIf you do the math, you\u2019ll notice that the number of people who are on Medicaid has increased by over 29 percent since Q3 2013. No doubt this is due in large part to the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion. Then there are the \u201cself-paid\u201d insured who have increased 23 percent. But as John Graham notes, \u201c\u2018Self-paid\u2019 is actually a misnomer, because most of these people are in Obamacare health-insurance exchanges, where almost all of them receive subsidies.\u201d\n\nThen there is Medicare enrollment\u2014which has increased about 17 percent. That\u2019s not the fault of ObamaCare. This increase is probably due to the big uptick in people who have joined Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) since 2009. SSDI recipients are usually eligible for Medicare after a two-year wait period. Of course, they wouldn\u2019t be going on SSDI if the economy had recovered quickly after 2009. We can thank the Obama Administration\u2019s economic policy for the fact that it didn\u2019t.\n\nSo, when Obama says that 10.3 million Americans have gained health coverage, what he means is that about 10.3 million have become more dependent on government.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/storage/Welfare-Dependecy.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1421862585956", "description": "During last night&#8217;s State of the Union speech , President Obama made one grandiose claim...", "title": "ObamaCare's 'Success' Is One of Making Americans More Dependent on Government\u00a0 - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "So, when Obama says that 10.3 million Americans have gained health coverage, what he means is that about 10.3 million have become more dependent on government.\nThis increase is probably due to the big uptick in people who have joined Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) since 2009.\nBut digging into the survey data shows that ObamaCare has actually succeeded at making Americans more dependent on government:If you do the math, you\u2019ll notice that the number of people who are on Medicaid has increased by over 29 percent since Q3 2013.\nWe can thank the Obama Administration\u2019s economic policy for the fact that it didn\u2019t.\nOf course, they wouldn\u2019t be going on SSDI if the economy had recovered quickly after 2009."}
