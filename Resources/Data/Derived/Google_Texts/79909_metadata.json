But \u201cthe last few years have seen it crawl from under the shadowy bridges patrolled by anonymous trolls,\u201d he argued, \u201cand emerge into the sunshine of social media, where people proudly trumpet their ethical outrage.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Wayne cites a study that made the rounds last year \u2014 presumably because it was so outraging? \u2014 arguing that \u201cAnger is More Influential Than Joy.\u201d\n\nHe has a point: Social media really does seem to have upped the outrage quotient in public discourse. Angry denunciation, evidently, is highly \u201cshareable,\u201d as digital gurus like to say.\n\nWhy is that? Surely there are many reasons, but the most interesting one is also, curiously, the most upbeat: Haterade helps us make friends.\n\nThat, at least, is the suggestion of an earlier study with the fabulous title \u201cInterpersonal chemistry through negativity: Bonding by sharing negative attitudes about others.\u201d\n\nThat research, described here by Aaron Retica, writing for The New York Times Magazine, suggested that \u201cone of the surest routes to friendship is disliking the same things about other people.\u201d\n\nNotably, the study included asking subjects whether they thought they would enjoy meeting someone whose likes and dislikes they\u2019d learned about. Turned out shared negativity was a stronger indicator of getting along than mutual enthusiasm.\n\nAnd if you think about the vitriol in your own social media feeds, doesn\u2019t this ring true? Nobody spewing venom about political figures, celebrities, tech companies, or current events is changing anyone else\u2019s mind. Thus, we unfriend or ignore those whose outrage we disagree with.\n\nBut when others\u2019 outrage echoes our own, it\u2019s different. Maybe they (we) are properly signalling to the like-minded about our common ground \u2014 that is, where we can all come together and hate the same things.\n\nLately, for instance, I\u2019ve noticed a lot of Facebook and Twitter contacts endorsing a boycott of Hobby Lobby, in connection with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that such private firms can opt out of covering birth control under the Affordable Care Act if religious objections come into play. More specifically, I\u2019ve noticed this boycott idea being pushed by people who I am quite sure have never visited a Hobby Lobby in their lives.\n\n(I suppose this falls into the category that writer Tom Vanderbilt suggested on Twitter recently ought to be called the \u201cfauxcott.\u201d Useless as a practical tactic, it functions purely as a way to announce outrage \u2014 and perhaps find community in discontent.)\n\nAnd, really, it\u2019s not particularly outrageous to concede that what we\u2019re against says as much as what we are for: \u201cFandom involves anti-fandom,\u201d as a scholar on both subjects once put it. \u201cThink of the Star Wars fan who hates Trek, since his galaxy isn\u2019t big enough for both franchises.\u201d Presumably similar logic applies to the MSNBC zealot who can\u2019t stop attacking FOX News, and vice versa.\n\nAgain, the opposite of a fan club is not wholly new. But such scenarios do seem more prevalent, for reasons both technical and cultural. Even more recently, and even more bluntly, a post on the online magazine The Toast invited writers to share \u201cThe Books You Hate The Most.\u201d Specifically: \u201cThe books we hate so much it makes us glad to exist, that we can play host to so pure and so fervent a hatred it feels like a blessing.\u201d There are about 1,400 responses so far.\n\nOutrage may also be underrated as a creative spark: The critic A.O. Scott once argued that Margaret Thatcher enraged so many people who channeled their anger and talent into art that she functioned as a kind of \u201canti-muse.\u201d Even here, I\u2019d argue that shared outrage was crucial: Surely a community of creative vitriol-makers and their like-minded fans depends largely on a common enemy.\n\nNone of this, of course, is an endorsement of outrage, which does cheapen and darken social-media discourse, and in most cases has no particular effect apart from ruining everyone\u2019s day. But still. It\u2019s worth recognizing that outrage isn\u2019t just a social dissolvent \u2014 it\u2019s also a social glue.\n\nSo if you find the trend hateful \u2014 well, maybe you should go online and declare your disgust? You might even make some friends who are outraged by outrage, too.\n\nWrite to me at rwalkeryn@yahoo.com or find me on Twitter, @notrobwalker. RSS lover?
