Nearly 11 percent of Waimanalo families live at or below the federal poverty level.\n\n\u201cSubstance abuse, violence and poverty were and continue to be familiar stains on our community,\u201d Noa Dettweiler-Pavia, chairman of the capital campaign, said in a speech Wednesday at a blessing ceremony for the effort. \u201cWhile not as vivid as the azure of our ocean, if your eyes linger, you\u2019ll notice the backyard tents along Kalanianaole Highway, the shattered car-window glass at the beach parking lot and the empty dime bags in the gutter behind Shima\u2019s,\u201d he said, referring to Waimanalo\u2019s only supermarket.\n\nDettweiler-Pavia, also vice president and general counsel for the Bishop Museum, recounted for the crowed how his childhood in Waimanalo holds idyllic memories of picking lilikoi along the back roads and crayfish in the streams.\n\nVisits to the health center are among those memories. \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know the reasons behind it: because we were poor and had nowhere else to obtain health care,\u201d he said.\n\nThe health center has always carried out a mission to \u201cimprove the health and wellness of individuals and their ohana, regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s the only medical facility in the community. The next closest is Castle Medical Center in Kailua - about four miles away.\n\nA nearby plot next to the fire station has been acquired, with construction scheduled to begin next year.\n\n__\n\nFollow Jennifer Sinco Kelleher at http://www.twitter.com/JenHapa .", "article_metadata": {"description": "A tiny health center in a small windward Oahu community has a big goal: Raise $13 million for its first major expansion since it was founded in 1989.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A tiny health center in a small windward Oahu community has a big goal: Raise $13 million for its first major expansion since it was founded in 1989.", "title": "Waimanalo Health Center launches $13M expansion campaign", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/12/waimanalo-health-center-launches-13m-expansion-cam/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/12/89ffd53c3f4e321a790f6a706700844b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/12/89ffd53c3f4e321a790f6a706700844b.jpg", "description": "A tiny health center in a small windward Oahu community has a big goal: Raise $13 million for its first major expansion since it was founded in 1989.", "card": "summary", "title": "Waimanalo Health Center launches $13M expansion campaign"}, "Author": "JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The health center has always carried out a mission to \u201cimprove the health and wellness of individuals and their ohana, regardless of their ability to pay,\u201d he said.\nThe Waimanalo Health Center is currently a cluster of portable buildings that, according to the facility, is inefficiently configured and inadequately sized based on U.S. standards for patient care.\nWAIMANALO, Hawaii (AP) - A tiny health center in a small windward Oahu community has a big goal: Raise $13 million for its first major expansion since it was founded in 1989.\nThe next closest is Castle Medical Center in Kailua - about four miles away.\nVisits to the health center are among those memories."}
