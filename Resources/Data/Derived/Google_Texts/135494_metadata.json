I just watched the Interview and I laughed my butt off!!! Thanks YouTube!!' said one happy customer, while another said paying $5.99 to watch the film was 'totally worth it.'\n\nThis in contrast to Variety critic Scott Foundas who said in his review of the film that 'North Korea is right to object,' before then going on to warn readers eager to see the film that 'an evening of cinematic waterboarding awaits.'\n\nAlso expressing their excitement over the comedy's release on social media were stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, who have frequently taken to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook over the past two days to remind everyone how happy they are to see the film released, and, in Rogen's case, suggest that fans check it out on the big screen.\n\n'I need to say that a comedy is best viewed in a theater full of people, so if you can, I'd watch it like that. Or call some friends over,' he said just hours before his surprise appearance Wednesday night.\n\nFranco decided to take a much different approach, as the actor continued his current social media strategy of really utilizing his keyboard's caps lock and punctuation keys, writing on Instagram; 'Merry X-mas MERICA!!!!!!THE INTERVIEW IS LIVE!!!!!! !!!Watch it here!!!Thank you SONY!!!!!!!!'\n\nThere were also a few American flag emojis to really make the post pop.\n\nAnd as an added bonus for Sony, the studio will now go down in the history books for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online, as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms - theaters, online and video on demand.\n\n'It has always been Sony's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film,' Sony Pictures chair and CEO Michael Lynton said in a statement.\n\n'We chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day, and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release.'\n\nEven more impressive however is how quickly the studio managed to pull this all together after initially deciding to hold off on distributing the film last week.\n\nSony only announced on Tuesday that the film would play in selected theaters and be released to video on demand on Thursday.\n\nAs for the big online announcement, that was confirmed less than an hour before the movie appeared on Google Play, YouTube, Microsoft Xbox Video and a Sony website created for the film, with the option of renting the film for $5.99 or downloading it for $16.99.\n\nLaughing and laughing: James Franco and Rogen (above in a still from the film) have also be using their social media accounts to share how happy they are to see the film be released\n\nAnd while many are not doubt eager to learn how many views, and how much dough, Sony will make off of online streaming, the studio has said at this time there is no plan to release the numbers, a move very similar to that practiced by Netflix.", "article_metadata":
