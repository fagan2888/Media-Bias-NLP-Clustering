NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices and world stock markets jumped on Friday, providing some relief to bruised investors as frigid weather across the United States and Europe boosted energy demand.

After dropping earlier this week to 2014 lows, the S&P 500 has recovered in the past two sessions to end the week 1.4 percent higher. It is still down 6.7 percent in 2016 after the brutal selloff that began at the start of the year.
