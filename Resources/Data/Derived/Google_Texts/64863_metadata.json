And just as the article was grabbing attention on social media came the news that only a few miles away from Ferguson, police had shot another young black man dead.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon Equipped Ferguson\u2019s Police Department\n\nThe victim of Tuesday\u2019s shooting was, unlike Brown, armed. A police officer reportedly shot the man as he brandished a knife. But the second death helped make Dutta\u2019s article an immediate sensation on social media and online news sites. Its headline seemed as though it was intended to provoke: \u201cI\u2019m a cop. If you don\u2019t want to get hurt, don\u2019t challenge me\u201d.\n\nThe possibility that the Post\u2019s editors had sexed-up the headline in order to attract readers was easily dismissed after just a few paragraphs.\n\n\u201cRegardless of what happened with Mike Brown, in the overwhelming majority of cases it is not the cops, but the people they stop, who can prevent detentions from turning into tragedies,\u201d Dutta wrote. The idea that it is a citizen\u2019s responsibility not to be injured by a police officer didn\u2019t sit well with many people who read Dutta\u2019s piece.\n\nRelated: Ferguson Could End Militarization of Local Police Forces\n\n\u201cCop Writes Washington Post Op-Ed Defending Police Brutality,\u201d was the headline on Benjamin Freed\u2019s Washingtonian blog post.\n\n\u201cWe need to change the relationship between police and civilians from one of distrust to one of mutual respect, but given recent events, I don\u2019t know how we could,\u201d wrote Joanna Rothkopf in Salon.\n\nThe angriest reactions, though, were reserved for Dutta\u2019s advice to the general public.\n\n\u201c[H]ere is the bottom line: if you don\u2019t want to get shot, tased, pepper-sprayed, struck with a baton or thrown to the ground, just do what I tell you. Don\u2019t argue with me, don\u2019t call me names, don\u2019t tell me that I can\u2019t stop you, don\u2019t say I\u2019m a racist pig, don\u2019t threaten that you\u2019ll sue me and take away my badge. Don\u2019t scream at me that you pay my salary, and don\u2019t even think of aggressively walking towards me. Most field stops are complete in minutes. How difficult is it to cooperate for that long?\u201d\n\nRelated: Petition Call on Obama to Demilitarize Ferguson Police\n\nEven if you are convinced that the officer is behaving illegally, Dutta wrote, compliance is the best route to take.\n\n\u201cBut if you believe (or know) that the cop stopping you is violating your rights or is acting like a bully, I guarantee that the situation will not become easier if you show your anger and resentment.\u201d\n\nDo Everything I Say, and I Won\u2019t Kill You headlined Gawker\u2019s take on the article. If You Don\u2019t Want to Get Shot, Shut Up, wrote the Huffington Post.\n\nIn his defense, Dutta argued that cops should be held to high standards and that citizens should be free to sue the police for overstepping their authority. He tried to explain why it\u2019s best for citizens being detained to obey without question by pointing out that cops conducting what might seem to be random stops might actually be looking for a violent criminal, and are therefore in a heightened state of alertness for possible dangers.\n\nHowever, days after the shooting death of an unarmed teenager in Ferguson, and with images of police armed to the teeth responding to unarmed protestors with tear gas and rubber bullets, Dutta\u2019s piece appears to have had exactly the opposite effect its author intended.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With riots over a police officer\u2019s killing of teenager Michael Brown still a nightly occurrence in Ferguson, Missouri, police in nearby North St. Louis shot dead another young black man Tuesday afternoon.
