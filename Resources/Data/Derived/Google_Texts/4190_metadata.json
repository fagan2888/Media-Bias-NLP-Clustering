But last year, 2,900 babies were born and just as many are expected this year.\n\n\u201cAs the economy booms and becomes successful, people feel a lot more comfortable and maybe a little more relaxed,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cAnd what do you know? Babies happen!\u201d\n\nJust ask Walnut Creek business owner Sarah Appel.\n\nAppel owns a baby and toddler clothing business and says more babies being born is great for her bottom line.\n\nHer equestrian-inspired baby clothing line Mini Britches is already thriving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our first year and we\u2019re sold out,\u201d she said.\n\nWith other hospitals like UC San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente also seeing a rise in births, it may still be too early to definitively blame the baby boom on the economy. Other factors could include a growing Bay Area population, more people enrolling in medical coverage because of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and one idea just for fun \u2014 the Giants winning the World Series nine months ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bay Area hospital delivery rooms are keeping busy with a rise in births after a slowdown during the recession.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/06/15/bay-area-baby-boom-possibly-triggered-by-improving-economy/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/136331973.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/136331973.jpg?w=1500", "height": 1113}, "type": "article", "description": "Bay Area hospital delivery rooms are keeping busy with a rise in births after a slowdown during the recession.", "title": "Bay Area Baby Boom Possibly Triggered By Improving Economy"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/136331973.jpg?w=1500", "title": "Bay Area Baby Boom Possibly Triggered By Improving Economy", "site": "cbssf", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bay Area hospital delivery rooms are keeping busy with a rise in births after a slowdown during the recession."}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of SF", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS San Francisco", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "keywords": "health, local, news, syndicated local, babies, baby boom, births, economy, healthcare, hospitals, john muir, recession, walnut creek", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/73943609873d357bc6a7462619ad7be9?s=16", "news_keywords": "babies, baby boom, births, economy, healthcare, hospitals, john muir, recession, walnut creek"}, "article_summary": "There are baby carriages everywhere and the numbers at area hospitals point to a possible baby boom.\nWALNUT CREEK (CBS SF) \u2014 Bay Area hospital delivery rooms are keeping busy with a rise in births after a slowdown during the recession.\n\u201cAnd if the economy is good, it definitely helps out.\u201dTake a look around Walnut Creek and you can\u2019t help but think, the economy must be great.\nJohn Muir Hospital in Walnut Creek was averaging about 2,500 births in the years after the recession.\nWith other hospitals like UC San Francisco and Kaiser Permanente also seeing a rise in births, it may still be too early to definitively blame the baby boom on the economy."}
