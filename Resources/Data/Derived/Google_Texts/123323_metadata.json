Van de Water, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in an issue brief last October.\n\n\"In comparison, 43 percent of employees work 40 hours a week, and another several percent work 41 to 44 hours a week. Thus, raising the threshold to 40 hours would place more than five times as many workers at risk of having their hours reduced.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The group is targeting a rule that defines full-time work as 30 hours per week.", "description": "The group is targeting a rule that defines full-time work as 30 hours per week.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Elise Viebeck", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The group is targeting a rule that defines full-time work as 30 hours per week.", "title": "Lobbyists push to change ObamaCare's definition of full-time work", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/218325-big-k-street-push-to-change-o-care-30-hour-rule", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/218325-big-k-street-push-to-change-o-care-30-hour-rule", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-19T11:12-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elise Viebeck", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-19T11:12:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/218325-big-k-street-push-to-change-o-care-30-hour-rule", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The group is targeting a rule that defines full-time work as 30 hours per week.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lobbyists push to change ObamaCare's definition of full-time work"}, "dcterms.title": "Lobbyists push to change ObamaCare's definition of full-time work"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28ed\"", "article_summary": "Major advocates for private industry are forming a new lobbying coalition to push to raise ObamaCare's definition of full-time work to 40 hours a week.\n\"In comparison, 43 percent of employees work 40 hours a week, and another several percent work 41 to 44 hours a week.\nThus, raising the threshold to 40 hours would place more than five times as many workers at risk of having their hours reduced.\"\nThe groups argue that ObamaCare sets an unreasonable standard when it requires employers to offer health coverage to employees who work 30 hours a week or more.\nDefenders of the rule say it is not causing a significant shift to part-time work, and that raising the threshold to 40 hours would make such a shift more likely."}
