This year should be no different,\" Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain John McCainOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return Groups urge Senate to oppose defense language on for-profit colleges MORE (R-Ariz.) said Tuesday at the American Action Foundation.\n\nMcCain argued that vetoing the bill \u2014 which only authorizes but does not appropriate funds \u2014 would be a misplaced move.\n\n\"The NDAA is a policy bill. It does not spend a dollar. It provides the Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform with the authorities and support they need to defend the nation. It is not the place for fights over government spending,\" he said.\n\nThe same White House veto warning was issued to the House as it began debate on its version last month, but the bill passed 269-151, with 41 Democrats voting in favor despite the warning and strong opposition from the Democratic leadership.\n\nThe Senate's bill passed the Armed Services Committee with a bipartisan vote of 22-4, with four Democrats voting against, including ranking member Jack Reed Jack ReedGroups urge Senate to oppose defense language on for-profit colleges Reid throws wrench into Clinton vice presidential picks House, Senate at odds on new authority for cyber war unit MORE (R.I.). Eight Democrats voted in favor.\n\nSo far, the House defense policy bill, the Senate defense policy bill and the House defense appropriations bill all assume funding at the $612 billion level, with $523 billion for base defense spending and $89 billion in the war funding account.\n\nThe White House also objects to using the war funding account, known as overseas contingency operations, to supplant the base budget since it only assumes short-term funding and Pentagon budgeters plan years ahead.\n\nThe bill also ignores many reforms recommended in the White House's defense budget request, such as the retirement of some weapons systems, military base closures, and cuts to military benefits and compensation.\n\nThe bill also would impose tougher restrictions on Guantanamo Bay detainee transfers, but gives the president a way to lift those restrictions that OMB calls \"unnecessary and overly restrictive.\"\n\nThe bill also would withhold half of $300 million in authorized military aid to Ukrainian forces unless 20 percent of that was spent on lethal weapons, which OMB said \"forces the hand of the Administration\" on a \"decision that should rest with the Executive Branch.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Senate will begin debate of the bill Wednesday.", "description": "The Senate will begin debate of the bill Wednesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kristina Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Senate will begin debate of the bill Wednesday.", "title": "White House reminds Senate of defense veto threat", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/budget-appropriations/243862-white-house-issues-veto-threat-over-senate-defense", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/getty-2011-12-26-pentagon-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/budget-appropriations/243862-white-house-issues-veto-threat-over-senate-defense", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-03T09:26-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kristina Wong", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "John McCain,John McCain, Jack Reed,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-03T09:26:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/budget-appropriations/243862-white-house-issues-veto-threat-over-senate-defense", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Senate will begin debate of the bill Wednesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "White House reminds Senate of defense veto threat"}, "dcterms.title": "White House reminds Senate of defense veto threat"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e45\"", "article_summary": "The White House reissued a veto threat of the Senate's defense policy bill on Tuesday evening, as the chamber prepared to consider it.\nSo far, the House defense policy bill, the Senate defense policy bill and the House defense appropriations bill all assume funding at the $612 billion level, with $523 billion for base defense spending and $89 billion in the war funding account.\nHowever, Republicans are still expecting the annual defense policy bill, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, to pass.\nThe White House also objects to using the war funding account, known as overseas contingency operations, to supplant the base budget since it only assumes short-term funding and Pentagon budgeters plan years ahead.\n\"The NDAA is a policy bill."}
