Navigating our healthcare system is frustrating and time-consuming enough when you're healthy. But what if you get a serious diagnosis? You'll probably have to deal with multiple doctors' offices and their front-desk staffs, a hospital or clinic that may not be familiar, and a sudden deluge of paperwork, phone calls, and appointments. The chances for confusion and miscommunication multiply all along the chain -- and this can lead to problems ranging from annoying clerical mistakes to serious medical errors.

A 2013 study in the Journal of Patient Safety estimated that 400,000 people die every year in the United States from medical error. On this show we'll talk about how to protect your health with Leslie Michelson. He's dedicated his life's work to helping people navigate our challenging healthcare system. Michelson's written The Patient's Playbook, distilling the tools and techniques he's learned in 30 years of experience.
