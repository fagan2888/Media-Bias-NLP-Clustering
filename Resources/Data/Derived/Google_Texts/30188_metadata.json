We let the Islamic state build up its money, capability and strength and weapons while it was still in Syria,\u201d Carter said in an October 7 interview with the Fort-Worth Star Telegram, \u201cThen when [ISIS] moved into Iraq, the Sunni Muslims didn\u2019t object to their being there and about a third of the territory in Iraq was abandoned.\u201d\n\nCarter said ground troops could enable the mission to succeed, but that troops would only help Iraq, not Syria, where ISIS originated.\n\nCarter\u2019s comments come as ISIS forces advance further into Kobani, a Kurdish town in Syria bordering on Turkey. Gen. Martin Dempsey told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz on October 7he is \u201cfearful\u201d a full ISIS takeover of Kobani could be imminent.\n\nCarter's dissatisfaction with Obama's ISIS strategy may be indicative of his feelings toward the president's Middle East policy as whole, which he implied lacked focus.\n\n\u201cIt changes from time to time,\u201d Carter told the Star Telegram. \u201cI noticed that two of his secretaries of defense, after they got out of office, were very critical of the lack of positive action on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nCarter also criticized the president\u2019s counter-terrorism drone policy. In 2013, Attorney General Eric Holder sent a letter to Congress informing them that four Americans had been killed in drone strikes targeting terrorists in the Middle East. Carter told the Star-Telegram that the deaths of these Americans \"violate our Constitution and human rights.\"\n\n\u201cI really object to the killing of people, particularly Americans overseas who haven\u2019t been brought to justice and put on trial,\u201d he explained.\n\nAlthough as Democrats they share the same party affiliation and have held the same title, this is not the first time Carter has criticized Obama. In an interview with Parade Magazine last October he characterized the implementation of the Affordable Care Act as \u201cquestionable at best,\u201d although he cited the legislation as one of Obama's main accomplishments.\n\nCarter, who is 90, served one term as president, from 1977 until 1981. According to the Star-Telegram, he was in Fort Worth participating in a Habitat for Humanity Project.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Jimmy Carter Criticizes Obama on Drones, ISIS", "description": "Jimmy Carter Criticizes Obama on Drones, ISIS", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Former President Jimmy Carter believes the Obama administration \u201cwaited too long\u201d to act on ISIS, allowing the group to shore up the funding and resources for its success in taking over parts of Iraq.\n\u201cFirst of all, we waited too long.
