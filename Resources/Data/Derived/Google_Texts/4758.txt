Yes, the 2014 North Carolina Senate race is long over, but it seems after all the numbers were crunched, Kay Hagan still lost to Republican Sen-elect Thom Tillis with an electorate that was more diverse than in 2010.

Still, even with 950,000 more people voting this year than in 2010–and breaking for Democrats–Democratic turnout was still the lowest in three decades.

In fact, Cohn noted that a failure to turn out youth voters is what killed Hagan; black and white voter turnout was equal (via NYT):
