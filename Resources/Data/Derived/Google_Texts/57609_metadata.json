One firefighter was taken to a hospital with what officials described as a minor medical condition.\n\nBy 4 p.m., fire officials said they had contained the fire but that it would likely take the rest of the day to completely extinguish it and determine the cause.\n\n\u201cWe have turned the corner where we\u2019re closer to getting the fire out,\u201d said Robert Rodriguez, chief fire marshal and spokesman for the Alexandria fire department. \u201cIt is a large fire and it\u2019s always safety in numbers, but we can\u2019t work [the firefighters] to death.\u201d\n\nThe first call for the fire went out at about 11:45 a.m., and within an hour the inferno sent an enormous plume of black smoke high into the air, making a starkly ugly contrast with the clear blue, late-summer sky. The plume could be seen for several miles, and the smell of smoke was noticeable as far away as the Springfield Mixing Bowl.\n\nSherry McDonald, 50, from West Springfield, said she was shopping in Kingstowne, about 3 miles away from the warehouse, when she saw the fire.\n\n\u201cOh, my God, it was huge,\u201d Ms. McDonald said as she watched firefighters spraying the warehouse with water. \u201cWe wanted to snoop. We wanted to get closer. How often do you get this big a fire?\u201d\n\nChief Rodriguez said the fire was the largest in Alexandria since a four-alarm blaze two years ago. He said that fire was in an apartment complex just around the corner from the warehouse.\n\nMr. Rodriguez said a partial roof collapse at the warehouse complicated suppression efforts, as did the heat and the water main break.\n\nPrince George\u2019s County Fire Chief Marc S. Bashoor said his crews were called in to assist with supply line work to get water to the fire.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s standard mutual aid,\u201d he said.\n\nArlington and Fairfax counties also sent assistance.\n\nFirefighting efforts snarled early afternoon traffic in the West End and Landmark neighborhoods of Alexandria and closed nearby exits to the Capital Beltway.\n\nAround the intersection of South Van Dorn Street and South Pickett Street, orange water hoses snaked along the road, while dozens of emergency and fire vehicles stood sentry around the burning warehouse.\n\nAt South Port Apartments, a community separated by several feet and a tree line from the warehouse, dozens of residents stood watching the billowing smoke or used their phones to record the flames leaping from the warehouse roof.\n\nWatching from her ground-level porch, 37-year-old Michelle Smith said she heard odd sounds on Sunday coming from the warehouse.\n\n\u201cIt was outside and it sounded like a fuse blew,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cToday I kept hearing something that sounded like boom, boom, boom.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Mitchelle, 49, said he also heard a succession of \u201cpop, pop, pop\u201d on Monday morning. The Alexandria resident who lives within walking distance of the warehouse said he was on his way to breakfast when he heard the noise. Then he noticed the flames.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fire,\u201d he said. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t help but see it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Firefighters in Alexandria on Monday battled a massive six-alarm blaze at a construction warehouse.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Firefighters in Alexandria on Monday battled a massive six-alarm blaze at a construction warehouse.", "title": "Firefighters battle 6-alarm blaze at Alexandria warehouse", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/2/firefighters-battle-6-alarm-blaze-alexandria-wareh/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/fire_006.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/02/fire_006.jpg", "description": "Firefighters in Alexandria on Monday battled a massive six-alarm blaze at a construction warehouse.", "card": "summary", "title": "Firefighters battle 6-alarm blaze at Alexandria warehouse"}, "Author": "Meredith Somers", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Disaster Accident, Robert Rodriguez, Sherry Mcdonald"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab98\"", "article_summary": "\u201cToday I kept hearing something that sounded like boom, boom, boom.\u201dJeffrey Mitchelle, 49, said he also heard a succession of \u201cpop, pop, pop\u201d on Monday morning.\nTwo hundred firefighters battled a massive six-alarm blaze in Alexandria on Monday that heavily damaged a construction warehouse and threatened a neighboring apartment community.\n\u201cOh, my God, it was huge,\u201d Ms. McDonald said as she watched firefighters spraying the warehouse with water.\nThe Alexandria resident who lives within walking distance of the warehouse said he was on his way to breakfast when he heard the noise.\nHow often do you get this big a fire?\u201dChief Rodriguez said the fire was the largest in Alexandria since a four-alarm blaze two years ago."}
