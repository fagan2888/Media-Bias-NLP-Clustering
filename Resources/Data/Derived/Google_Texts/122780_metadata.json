The petition was created by Sycamore Trust, an alumni organization dedicated to preserving and protecting the Catholic identity of the University of Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cThese people are angered because they feel Biden goes against many Catholic principals and beliefs the award should uphold,\u201d Gower said in an email. \u201cFor example, Biden does not support pro-life policies and is for same-sex marriage. The petition declares, \u2018We should seek to honor those who act to protect human life and dignity, from conception to natural death, who respect true marriage and the family,\u2019 which they feel Biden does not.\u201d\n\nBill Dempsey, the creator of the petition and member of Sycamore Trust, said the group rarely proposes petitions, but that this was a particularly egregious case that he felt the group needed to combine their voices of protest and share their reasons.\n\n\u201cThis action is even more objectionable than was the honoring of President Obama, who is not Catholic and whose opposition to the Church, so far as it was known at the time, was limited to abortion,\u201d Dempsey said in an email. \u201cVice President Biden\u2019s opposition is broad. He is the highest-ranking Catholic pro-choice politician who also supports same-sex marriage, public funding of embryonic stem cell research and the Obamacare contraception mandate that Notre Dame is fighting in court. [Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades] is plainly right in condemning Notre Dame\u2019s action as scandalous.\u201d\n\nDempsey said the decision to award Biden the medal shows that Notre Dame does not take seriously the Church teachings that Biden rejects.\n\n\u201cNotre Dame\u2019s action will confirm in their error Catholics who share Biden\u2019s dissenting views and arm dissenting Catholic politicians in their opposition to Church position,\u201d Dempsey said. \u201cBesides, what I find incomprehensible is that [University President Fr. John Jenkins] would take this action knowing full well that it would once again open a breach with Notre Dame\u2019s bishop and once again bring strife into an occasion that should be one of unalloyed celebration for graduating seniors and their families.\u201d\n\nGower said the original goal of the petition was 1,000 signatures. However, as of April 6 the petition has over 2,400 signatures that range from members of the Notre Dame community to people in foreign countries.\n\nDempsey said Sycamore Trust did not propose rescinding the award because they thought it would be futile.\n\n\u201cWhat we hope is that the fellows and trustees will take appropriate action to insure against a repetition and to repair relations with Bishop Rhoades,\u201d Dempsey said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The student newspaper of Notre Dame and St. Mary's", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "The Observer", "description": "The announcement of the 2016 Laetare Medal recipients, Vice President Joe Biden and former Speaker of the House John Boehner, came with no lack of controversy in\u00a0the Notre Dame community, and one of the strongest responses came in the form of a national petition opposing Biden as a candidate for the medal.
