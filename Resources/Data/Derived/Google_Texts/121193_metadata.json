Although the projections are vague, they provide something of an annual report card on the nation\u2019s complex system.\n\nThis year\u2019s analysis is mixed.\n\nAfter years of very slow growth, stemming largely from the recession, healthcare spending is expected to pick up to an average annual rate of 5.7% over the next decade, or 1.1 percentage points higher than overall economic growth.\n\nThe spending growth is driven by the recovering economy and by the expansion in insurance coverage that began this year under the Affordable Care Act, according to analysts. The health law allows Americans in most states to get guaranteed coverage through a commercial health plan or through Medicaid. (Some states whose political leaders oppose the law have not expanded their Medicaid programs to cover all their poorest residents, an option under the law.)\n\nThe acceleration in spending will push the country\u2019s total healthcare tab to more than $5 trillion in 2023, or about 19.3% of the economy. That is up from 17.6% this year, already far more than that of any other industrialized nation.\n\nAnalysts also expect the government\u2019s share of that bill to increase, as more Americans age into Medicare or get subsidized coverage through Medicaid or the new insurance marketplaces created by the health law.\n\nBut the authors of the report do not expect healthcare spending to return to its explosive growth of the two decades before the 2008 recession.\n\nSean Keehan, another government economist who worked on the report, said that rising use of generic drugs, increasing price pressure on hospitals and doctors, and growing popularity of high-deductible health plans that force consumers to pay more out of pocket for their care would restrain spending.\n\nOther experts believe that changes in the way care is delivered are beginning to have an effect as well. Insurance companies are increasingly rewarding medical providers who deliver better-quality, more efficient care rather than simply do more procedures.\n\nAnd Medicare, the insurer for older Americans, has lower costs than commercial coverage available through an employer.\n\nThese are all hopeful signs, said Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit group that analyzes health policy and is not affiliated with healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente.\n\nLike many experts, Levitt said policymakers must work to further slow rising medical costs, which continue to take a larger share of workers\u2019 pay.\n\n\u201cThe fact that health spending is expected to grow slowly doesn\u2019t help someone whose paycheck is growing even more slowly,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cNow is not the time to take the foot off the brake.\u201d\n\nnoam.levey@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Nation's healthcare changes may rein in costs in long run, report says", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "National healthcare spending will continue to rise in coming years, but at a slower rate than in the previous two decades, according to a government analysis of the nation\u2019s $3-trillion healthcare tab.", "title": "Nation's healthcare changes may rein in costs in long run, report says", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-healthcare-spending-20140903-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54076f59/turbine/la-na-nn-healthcare-spending-20140903", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Healthcare costs, Affordable Care Act", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81257021", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-09-03", "Description": "National healthcare spending will continue to rise in coming years, but at a slower rate than in the previous two decades, according to a government analysis of the nation\u2019s $3-trillion healthcare tab.
