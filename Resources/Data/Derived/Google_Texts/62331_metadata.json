Peskov said the investigation into Pugachev had nothing to do with his relationship with Putin.\n\n\"Investigative or search actions, of course, aren\u2019t related to the extent to which there were friendly or unfriendly relations\" with Putin, Peskov said.\n\nKREMLIN BANKER\n\nSince leaving Russia in 2011, Pugachev, 52, has accused Putin's allies of bringing his multi-billion dollar business empire to its knees before picking off some of its best assets.\n\nPugachev founded Mezhprombank, or International Industrial Bank, in 1992, just a year after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It grew to become one of Russia\u2019s biggest banks.\n\nPugachev's business empire had stakes in the \u2018Northern\u2019 and \u2018Baltic\u2019 shipyards, the latter of which built the Tsar\u2019s battleships and Soviet nuclear-powered icebreakers, and a giant Siberian coal deposit.\n\nEdward Kehoe, a lawyer at King & Spalding who is representing Pugachev, said the claim against Russia alleged violations of a Russian-French bilateral investment treaty and international law.\n\n\"These cases do take a while,\" Kehoe said. \"We can expect, if history is a guide, for a case of this type that it could be at least two to three years before we would expect an award.\"\n\nPugachev, who became a French citizen in 2009, said the Kremlin stripped him of his assets without paying compensation. Pugachev defied a British judge's order to stay in Britain and fled to France this year. His lawyers said he feared for his life after devices were found under his car.\n\n\"The reason Mr Pugachev left was that he was in real fear for his life,\" said Nick Cherryman, one of Pugachev's lawyers. \"It is not very pleasant to find black boxes underneath your car.\"\n\nAfter helping Putin ascend to Russia's top job in 1999 during the last days of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, Pugachev fell out with some of Putin's most powerful allies in the years after the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRussian authorities say Pugachev, who once represented Siberia's Tuva Republic in the upper house of parliament, helped himself to over $700 million in Russian central bank bailout money intended to help Mezhprombank through the crisis.\n\nInterpol has issued an arrest warrant for Pugachev at Russia's request.\n\nPugachev's notice of arbitration was delivered to Putin and Russia's ministers of economy, finance, justice and foreign affairs, his lawyers said.\n\n(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Sonya Hepinstall)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "PARIS (Reuters) - Sergei Pugachev, a tycoon once dubbed \"Putin's banker\" because of hi", "title": "Exclusive: 'Putin's banker' Pugachev files $12 billion claim against Russia", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/21/Exclusive-Putins-banker-Pugachev-files-10-billion-claim-against-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-pugachev_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/21/Exclusive-Putins-banker-Pugachev-files-10-billion-claim-against-Russia", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/russia-pugachev_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "PARIS (Reuters) - Sergei Pugachev, a tycoon once dubbed \"Putin's banker\" because of hi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd117\"", "article_summary": "When asked about the Pugachev claim, Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said he had \"no comment\" but said that official investigations were ongoing.\n\"Investigative or search actions, of course, aren\u2019t related to the extent to which there were friendly or unfriendly relations\" with Putin, Peskov said.\nPARIS (Reuters) - Sergei Pugachev, a tycoon once dubbed \"Putin's banker\" because of his influence in the Kremlin, has filed a $12 billion claim against Russia after his business empire was carved up when he fell out of favour with President Vladimir Putin.\nKREMLIN BANKERSince leaving Russia in 2011, Pugachev, 52, has accused Putin's allies of bringing his multi-billion dollar business empire to its knees before picking off some of its best assets.\nPugachev's business empire had stakes in the \u2018Northern\u2019 and \u2018Baltic\u2019 shipyards, the latter of which built the Tsar\u2019s battleships and Soviet nuclear-powered icebreakers, and a giant Siberian coal deposit."}
