They also found that the productivity trend line became more positive over time, conceivably related to relatively slow growth in health spending in the United States in the later years being studied.\n\nThe study data were culled from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) File for 2002\u201311; the cohorts ranged from 403,253 patient stays at 3,315 hospitals for heart attacks to 906,918 stays at 3,621 hospitals for heart failure.\n\n\u201cThe pattern of growth documented here suggests that in recent years, hospitals have not suffered from a so-called cost disease, where heavy reliance on labor limits opportunities for efficiencies stemming from technological improvement,\u201d observe the authors. \u201cOur study finds that concerns about linking provider payment to economywide productivity growth may be overstated.\u201d\n\nThe authors are affiliated with the Leonard D.
