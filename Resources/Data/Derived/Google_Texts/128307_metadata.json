Gilmore was convicted Friday of setting fire and doing about $10 million in damage to a downtown Fort Collins mixed-use complex. ( V. RICHARD HARO )\n\nMore than a month after his latest trial began, Benjamin Gilmore was found guilty on Friday of deliberately igniting the 2011 Penny Flats fire.\n\nGilmore, 31, had been on trial since Sept. 16. The jury found him guilty of arson, burglary and criminal mischief, but not guilty on four other counts, including attempted murder.\n\nThe fire initially started Oct. 24, 2011, in a structure at 311 N. Mason St. in downtown Fort Collins, but it spread to the mixed-use Penny Flats complex next door. Damages to the property were estimated at $10 million.\n\nThis is the second time Gilmore had been tried for the same seven counts. The jury was unable to reach a verdict following a 16-day trial in August 2012. The former beekeeper had also been linked to the Occupy protests occurring at the time the fire occurred.\n\nAccording to archive accounts of the incident, a key piece of evidence at the time of Gilmore's arrest was a Rolex watch bearing his name that had been found in the debris near the scaffolding used to access the start of the fire. Gilmore had been shown in the days before to have worn the watch at a Fort Collins City Council meeting, but afterward had injuries to his legs and apparent burn injuries to his hands. He told police at the time he had acquired the injuries at the Occupy Fort Collins bonfire.\n\nGilmore will be sentenced Dec. 12 at 1:30 p.m.\n\nAlex Burness can be reached at", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_24342719/fort-collins-man-found-guilty-arson", "modificationDate": "2013-10-19T12:05:14-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1018/20131018__19RHAGIL_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "More than a month after his latest trial began, Benjamin Gilmore was found guilty on Friday of deliberately igniting the 2011 Penny Flats fire.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:24342719:view"}, "startDate": "2013-10-19T12:04:30-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_24342719/fort-collins-man-found-guilty-arson", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1018/20131018__19RHAGIL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "More than a month after his latest trial began, Benjamin Gilmore was found guilty on Friday of deliberately igniting the 2011 Penny Flats fire.", "title": "Fort Collins man found guilty of arson"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "More than a month after his latest trial began, Benjamin Gilmore was found guilty on Friday of deliberately igniting the 2011 Penny Flats fire.", "title": "Fort Collins man found guilty of arson", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_24342719/fort-collins-man-found-guilty-arson", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1018/20131018__19RHAGIL.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-19T12:04:30-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2023-10-19T12:04:30-0600", "sailthru.title": "Fort Collins man found guilty of arson", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Alex Burness", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1018/20131018__19RHAGIL.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-10-19T12:06:55-0600", "news_keywords": "News, News news, Loveland Colorado News news, Loveland Colorado news, News Loveland news, News Colorado news, US News news, world News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd353a\"", "article_summary": "Gilmore was convicted Friday of setting fire and doing about $10 million in damage to a downtown Fort Collins mixed-use complex.\nHe told police at the time he had acquired the injuries at the Occupy Fort Collins bonfire.\nThe jury found him guilty of arson, burglary and criminal mischief, but not guilty on four other counts, including attempted murder.\nThe fire initially started Oct. 24, 2011, in a structure at 311 N.
