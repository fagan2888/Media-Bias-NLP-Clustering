In his most recent forecast from January, his model predicted a 45.66 percent share of the presidential vote for the Democratic candidate, less than the 49 percent it predicted in 2012.\n\nThe other two models, unlike Fair\u2019s, consider the incumbent president\u2019s approval rating. In both cases, Obama\u2019s improving favorability helps his party\u2019s chances of winning the White House. But only one of those models predicts a Democratic win.\n\nEmory University\u2019s Alan Abramowitz, whose model has correctly predicted every outcome since 1992, forecasts a Republican win.\n\nIt measures the incumbent president's job-approval rating by the end of June of the election year; the economy's growth during the first half of year, especially during the second quarter; and how long the incumbent party has been in the White House.\n\nBy this methodology, the Democratic candidate can expect to receive 48.7 percent of the vote \u2014 with Obama's approval rating at 50 percent \u2014 according to his most recent calculation.\n\nBut since that prediction, Obama\u2019s approval rating has ticked up to 52 percent.\n\nMoody\u2019s arrives at a similar result, but one that is better for Democrats.\n\nThat model, which hasn\u2019t missed an election since it was created in 1980, awards Electoral College votes to each party based on state-by-state outcomes. The most important economic variable is income growth by state, including job and wage growth, hours worked and the quality of the jobs being created in the two years leading up to an election. The model also factors in home and gasoline prices on a state level, as well as presidential approval numbers.\n\nThe Moody\u2019s equation also includes an additional dummy variable that penalizes Democrat incumbents, stemming from the theory that Democrats and Democrat-leaning independent voters are more likely to switch sides and vote for a Republican candidate than vice versa.\n\nMoody\u2019s latest model, set for release this week, shows that the Democratic nominee would take 332 electoral votes compared to 206 for the Republican nominee.\n\nThe main driver of the change was the president's approval rating, a first-time variable added into the model this year, White said.\n\nThe president's approval rating has risen 3 percentage points since the first model was released in August.\n\nWhite says the unruly GOP primary may be helping Obama.\n\n\u201cThe gains lately could be construed as a reflection of what a mess the primary process has become in recent weeks,\u201d he said. Trump, who has high unfavorable ratings among some voter groups, could be giving Obama\u2019s approval rating a boost.\n\nAbramowitz told The Atlanta-Journal Constitution last week that \u201call the noise being made by the presidential campaign, especially by the Republican campaign, has taken attention away from what may turn out to be more significant for the general election \u2014 Barack Obama Barack ObamaNorth Korea calls Obama\u2019s Hiroshima trip \u2018childish\u2019 Sanders takes different position on superdelegates than he did in 2008 Ryan seeks to put stamp on GOP in Trump era MORE\u2019s rising approval rating.\u201d\n\nHis research has found that the president\u2019s approval rating is an essential predictor of the election results even when the president is not on the ballot, and Obama's has risen to its highest level in many months.\n\nWhite said that one of the most frequently asked questions he gets is whether a Trump variable could be added into the model to test out how his brand of fireworks factors in.\n\nNo way, he said.\n\n\u201cThe model doesn\u2019t know or care if there are two or 10 candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cIt knows the economics and whether marginal swing voters will keep the incumbent party in or not.\u201d\n\nIn fact, their models are designed to sweep away the effects of boisterous personalities and the usual ebbs and flows of a long presidential campaign season and instead track specific economic factors that voters deem most important.\n\nJustin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has researched the reliability of economic models, said that while every election is different the \u201cpoint of the statistical models is to try to find the underlying similarity across all of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the logic that says that these models should have worked over the past few decades also says that they should work in this election cycle, too,\u201d he told The Hill.\n\n\u201cThere's no reason to think the models should do better or worse in 2016,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Some wonder if personalities will trump the economy in 2016.", "description": "Some wonder if personalities will trump the economy in 2016.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Vicki Needham", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Some wonder if personalities will trump the economy in 2016.", "title": "Economic models predict GOP White House, even with Trump", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/275084-models-predict-gop-white-house-even-with-trump", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/1obama-clinton-trump-cruz_040416getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-04T13:40:23-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-04-04T13:40-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/275084-models-predict-gop-white-house-even-with-trump", "dcterms.date": "2016-04-04T12:40-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz,Moody's", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-04T12:40:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T13:40:23-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/275084-models-predict-gop-white-house-even-with-trump", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Some wonder if personalities will trump the economy in 2016.", "card": "summary", "title": "Economic models predict GOP White House, even with Trump"}, "dcterms.title": "Economic models predict GOP White House, even with Trump"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6803\"", "article_summary": "Republicans are expected to win the White House under two economic models that have accurately forecast presidential elections for decades.\nTrump, who has high unfavorable ratings among some voter groups, could be giving Obama\u2019s approval rating a boost.\nA third model run by Moody\u2019s Analytics predicts Democrats will win the White House, in part because of President Obama\u2019s rising approval rating.\nBut since that prediction, Obama\u2019s approval rating has ticked up to 52 percent.\nBy this methodology, the Democratic candidate can expect to receive 48.7 percent of the vote \u2014 with Obama's approval rating at 50 percent \u2014 according to his most recent calculation."}
