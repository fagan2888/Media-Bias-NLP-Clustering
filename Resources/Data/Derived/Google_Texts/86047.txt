DETROIT (AP) - Authorities say a man has been killed and his 4-year-old son hurt after being shot by two men wearing masks in Detroit.

Detroit police say the father and son were playing outside their west side home Saturday afternoon when a gray Chevrolet Equinox pulled up. The two masked men got out and started shooting.

Police spokeswoman Nicole Kirkwood tells reporters the 24-year-old man died of gunshot wounds and the boy was taken to the hospital. He is listed in temporary serious condition.
