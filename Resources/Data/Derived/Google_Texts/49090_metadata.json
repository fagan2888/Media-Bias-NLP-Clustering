But winds were powerful and gusty throughout the state.\n\nTemperatures this February have averaged 4.9 degrees above the 36.6 degree average for the month. But February is unlikely to top the record average for the month, 43.7 degrees, set in 1954, Frieden said.\n\nRain turning to snow is expected to begin Monday evening and continue into Tuesday.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or @dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Snow expected to follow Sunday\u2019s sunny skies in Denver", "title": "Snow expected to follow Sunday\u2019s sunny skies in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/21/snow-expected-to-follow-sundays-sunny-skies-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160218__Denver_weather_sloans_Lakep1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160218__Denver_weather_sloans_Lakep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T10:04:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:05:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rain turning to snow is expected to begin Monday evening and continue into Tuesday.\nBut February is unlikely to top the record average for the month, 43.7 degrees, set in 1954, Frieden said.\nSunday will be sunny with a high temperature close to 50 degrees, but 2 to 4 inches of snow is expected to hit the metro area by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.\nTemperatures this February have averaged 4.9 degrees above the 36.6 degree average for the month.\n\u201cWe rebound after that for Wednesday and the weekend,\u201d said Kyle Frieden, NWS meteorologist."}
