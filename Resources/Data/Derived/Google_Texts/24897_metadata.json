Andrew Cuomo has been granted a waiver for carrying a firearm at government offices in violation of state law.\n\nCuomo appointed Jerome Hauer to take over the state\u2019s Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services in 2011, according to the Albany Times Union.\n\nThe Albany, N.Y.-based newspaper reported in early January that Hauer used his firearm\u2019s laser sight as a pointer device during a meeting with a delegation of Swedish security professionals \u2014 with his loaded 9-mm Glock still attached.\n\nPeople sitting across from Hauer \u201cmoved quickly out of the line of the laser when he brought out the gun,\u201d and three of the Swedes \u201cwere rattled when the gun\u2019s laser tracked across one of their heads before Hauer found the map of New York, at which he wanted to point,\u201d the Times Union report.\n\nThe meeting took place on Oct. 24, but the incident didn\u2019t come to light until last month.\n\nUS Army builds 300-acre eerily fake American city to train soldiers\n\nOn Wednesday, the Times Union reported:\n\nCuomo defended Hauer at a news conference Wednesday. The governor said he\u2019s comfortable with commissioners carrying weapons to work as long as they have gun permits. He qualified the response by adding \u201cif they are licensed and in that field of work.\u201d Hauer is not a law enforcement officer or working in law enforcement, although his official vehicle has emergency lights and sirens. Despite the lack of a waiver before January, several witnesses said he has been carrying a gun on the job since Cuomo appointed him in 2011.\n\nOne of the basic rules of firearm safety is to never draw a weapon unless you intend to use it \u2014 as a weapon, not as a pointer. And never point a weapon at anything you don\u2019t intend to destroy.\n\nCuomo\u2019s crusade against firearms apparently applies to all New Yorkers except those he blesses, and Hauer is one of the blessed.\n\nNow he has a gun and a car with lights and a siren, which makes me feel very safe \u2014 because I don\u2019t live in New York.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A top aide to strict gun-grabbing New York Gov.
