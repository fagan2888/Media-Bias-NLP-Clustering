Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania found that patients of color were less likely to trust their white doctors compared to whites.\n\nLooking at the most current data available on patient experience, race and racism, in a university press release lead researcher Abigail Sewell says that they found that \u201cminorities in general don\u2019t have a lot of faith that they\u2019re receiving the best care they could. \u201d\n\nSome of the main issues stem from patients feeling that white doctors lack cultural competency and interpersonal skills when talking to them about their health and how to better it.\n\n\u201cI think more important, the fact that they think their doctors don\u2019t care means they feel their doctors aren\u2019t taking into consideration their personal lives,\u201d Sewell added.\n\nOne example that Sewell gave to illuminate this doctor-patient disconnect was a story of an older female patient. In an interview, the woman recalled that her doctor told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to lift more than five pounds in the upcoming few weeks. However, this patient was responsible for taking care of her 18-month grandchild, which consisting of lifting the toddler who weighed around 20 pounds.\n\nBut what was this grandmother going to do? Not watch her grandchild? What if her providing childcare was the main way that the child\u2019s parents could go to work and make an income?\n\nSewell explains, \u201cDoctors are trained to see symptoms, they\u2019re trained to follow a set of recommended behavior\u201d perhaps without asking the \u201cright\u201d questions or taking into account the actual everyday lives and responsibilities these patients have.\n\nSewell says that doctors having better \u201cstructural competency\u201d can make a huge difference in improving patients\u2019 health and closing this mistrust gap. This term, which is beginning to gain popularity in the public health realm, refers to the ability for doctors to provide health care that prioritizes a patient\u2019s race, where they live, whether they live in poverty, certain cultural practices and the policies that affect patients when providing health care.\n\n\u201cThe very likelihood of being sick is actually shaped by the world that we live in, not just the biological processes,\u201d Sewell said. \u201cStructural competency aims to develop a language at a level above the patient.\u201d\n\nWe know that patient-doctor mistrust is not stranger to the Black community. From the Tuskegee experiments to Henrietta Lacks cervical cells to even more recent studies citing racial bias in the doctor\u2019s office, African-Americans seem to have always been at odds with the health care system\u2013this study continue to highlight that legacy.\n\n[SOURCE: EUREKA ALERT]\n\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nStudy Finds Racism is Alive and Well on AirBnB\n\nAbortion Hit An All-Time Low, But Black Women Still Have Highest Rates\n\nLife Under the Affordable Care Act: Meet Some of The Newly Insured\n\nAlso On HelloBeautiful:", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "You Don't Say?
