Former Speaker John Boehner continued sniping at Ted Cruz, relishing the fact that the Texas Senator didn’t win the Republican nomination.

“Thank God that guy from Texas didn’t win,” he said during a conversation at the SALT Conference in Las Vegas, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

Boehner admitted that he got in trouble from Satanists after he described the Texas senator as “Lucifer in the Flesh.”

“I got criticized by some Satanic organization for giving Lucifer a bad name,” he joked.

But he was serious about his criticism of Cruz’s politics, calling the 2013 government shutdown effort to defund Obamacare the “dumbest thing I ever saw.”

While Boehner didn’t endorse Trump, he pointed out that the billionaire had won the Republican nomination and could beat Hillary Clinton in November.

“Anyone who thinks Donald Trump can’t win — just watch,” he said.
