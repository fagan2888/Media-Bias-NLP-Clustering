While the Beaufort County town of Belhaven has made strides to reopen Vidant Pungo Hospital, some issues continue to stand in their way. But the mayor and the people who want to see it open again are not backing down.

The major issue, Belhaven Mayor Adam O'Neal said at a meeting Tuesday night, is that Pantego Creek LLC owns the hospital property. Despite months of negotiations, O'Neal says they still haven't reached an agreement to deed the building over to the town.

The Pungo Medical Center Board met Tuesday evening in Belhaven. A packed room of people voiced their frustration that no progress has been made in months and months of meetings with the LLC to get the deed to the property.

You may recall, the Belhaven hospital was closed July 1, 2014, after failed negotiations. Since then there's been one obstacle after another for the town and Vidant Health to move forward.

As recently as January, the town hired a Florida company to manage the hospital when it reopens. Mayor O'Neal stressed Tuesday that the four managers of Pantego Creek LLC are the latest obstacles standing in the way of getting the hospital open.

He believes it's a stalling tactic, to allow Vidant Health to open up a new clinic before the town gets a chance to reopen the hospital.

"The clinic that they're building is nothing more than a doctor's office," says O'Neal. "All they're doing is taking the three doctor's offices that they currently own and putting them into one building."

Since the hospital's closure, the board says they've taken a big economic blow. That's in addition to the 100 jobs reported to have been lost.
