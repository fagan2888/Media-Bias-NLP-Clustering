PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) — A 46-year-old man has been arrested in connection to a string of fires near Lake Pueblo State Park.

The man was arrested on investigation of second-degree arson. The Pueblo County Sheriff’s Office says that there may be a second suspect.

Officials say firefighters were dispatched Saturday to a brush fire in the Rush Creek Wildlife Area in the state park. While crews were responding, reports came in of at least five other small fires burning in the same area along Highway 96.

Pueblo County Emergency Services Bureau Chief Mark Mears says there were nine separate fires started, consuming a total of 15 acres of grassland. No structures were threatened.

Sheriff’s deputies arrested the suspect near the entrance to the Lake Pueblo State Park after a traffic stop.
