Read it there.\n\nAfter two long, drawn-out, bipartisan, and totally lost wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that aren\u2019t even over yet, it\u2019s finally clear exactly why American foreign policy has gone so tragically wrong in the 21st century.\n\nThe culprit, at least according to the leading lights of the Republican Party and the Obama administration, is what Gov. Chris Christie excoriated last summer as \u201cthis strain of libertarianism that\u2019s going through both parties...a very dangerous thought.\u201d\n\nLibertarians, says Gov. Rick Perry, are just nouveau isolationists and \u201cisolationist policies make the threat of terrorism even greater.\u201d Writing in National Journal,Washington Post columnist and former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson compared libertarian pols like Sen. Rand Paul to isolationist Sen. Robert Taft, who notoriously opposed American intervention in World War II and attacked the Nuremberg Trials as illegitimate.\n\nYou got that? It\u2019s not our go-it-alone crusaderism and robust military presence all over the world that has managed to lower America\u2019s \u201cfavorability\u201d in the eyes of longtime allies and client states such as Britain, Germany, Japan, and Egypt. It\u2019s our hypothetical willingness to stop being globo-cop that\u2019s the issue, not our very real attempts to nation-build and even region-sculpt in parts of the world that have asked us to leave.\n\nTo hear the Dick Cheneys and Rick Perrys and John McCains of the world tell it, folks such as Paul, who explicitly calls for military, economic, and political \u201ccontainment\u201d of \u201cradical Islam,\u201d are \u201ccuriously blind,\u201d desperate to withdraw to a \u201cFortress America,\u201d and just flat-out \u201ccrazy.\u201d\n\nForget for the moment that under both Republican and Democratic commanders-in-chief, libertarians had exactly zero influence on foreign policy\u2014except perhaps for Paul\u2019s leading role in scuttling Obama\u2019s attempt to enter the Syrian civil war last fall.\n\n\u201cIsolationism is not an option,\u201d Obama told the graduating class of West Point earlier this year in a speech that, like most commencement addresses, was mercifully being forgotten even as it was being delivered. Every problem doesn\u2019t have a military solution, explained the man who tripled troop strength in Afghanistan to no observable change in the fortunes of the war there and dispatched planes and people to Libya for...what reason again?\n\nNo, said Obama, every problem doesn\u2019t have a military solution, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t go to war without notifying Congress or worrying about what it will cost in lives and dollars. Obama\u2019s speech was a meringue of meaninglessness, and in that sense was a perfect encapsulation of his disastrous foreign policy.\n\nAmerica will act in concert with the nations of the word, said Obama, except when it doesn\u2019t want to. Because lots of people die in war, we\u2019ll act only when U.S. national interests are at stake.\n\nBut global warming is a national interest and \u201cAmerica\u2019s support for democracy and human rights goes beyond idealism\u2014it is a matter of national security.\u201d So that\u2019s why U.S. special forces were dispatched to Nigeria (even before that country approved such a helping hand) and why American soldiers are traipsing around Africa looking for warlord Joseph Kony.\n\nAnd troops\u2014well, advisers\u2014are going back to Iraq, six years after this president was elected on a promise to get us out of there.\n\nObama\u2019s foreign policy certainly hasn\u2019t lacked for the use of force. It has, however, lacked for successes, as became clear during an unintentionally hilarious yet telling State Department press conference in May. State\u2019s Jen Psaki said that, in her view, \u201cthe president doesn\u2019t give himself enough credit for what he\u2019s done around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cCredit for what?\u201d one reporter interrupted. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, credit for what?\u201d The others in the room started laughing.\n\nAround the same time, NBC\u2019s Richard Engel, who is not known as a staunch critic for the administration, was asked to name a few countries with which relations have improved under Obama. His reply? \u201cI think you would be hard pressed to find that...I think the reason is our allies have become confused.\"\n\nFirst under Bush and now under Obama, the one constant in American foreign policy is a lack of any conceivable constraint on whatever the president deems expedient at any moment in time. This is disastrous, especially when it comes to military and covert actions, because it precludes any serious public discussion and prioritization.\n\nThat\u2019s not just bad for the U.S. It\u2019s also bad for our allies, who have no framework by which to structure their own actions and expectations. The president is allowed to both declare red lines and then to ignore them when they are crossed, to dispatch troops or planes or supplies according to whim. In all of this, Obama in no way represents a break from Bush, but perfect continuity.\n\nAs The Daily Beast \u2019s Eli Lake wrote for Reason back in 2010, the roots of this particularly strident new sense of imperial power can be traced back to the authorization of use of military force (AUMF) signed into law just a few days after the 9/11 attacks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/07/19/lets-try-a-libertarian-foreign-policy", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Don\u2019t believe haters like Rick Perry and Chris Christie.
