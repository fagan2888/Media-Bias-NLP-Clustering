DAYTONA TIMES

The Daytona Beach Regional Library at City Island has been added as a site where questions about the Affordable Care Act can be answered.

As first reported in the Daytona Times this month, 82,000 Volusia County residents who have no health insurance have six months to get insurance or could face a $95 fee, according to Joyce Case of the Health Planning Council of Northeast Florida, which has an office in Daytona Beach.

Case is the project director for the Navigator program in which eight people called navigators will be working with her to identify and assist uninsured families in understanding their insurance options through the Federal I nsurance Marketplace. Navigators provide guidance in completing the application.

The Federal Insurance Marketplace, located at website www.HealthCare.gov, opened Oct. 1. Those without insurance have until March 31, 2014 to sign up for insurance before they face penalties. For those who sign up, coverage can begin as early as Jan. 1, 2014.

More sessions

Last week, The Daytona Times reported three events were scheduled this month where residents can meet the navigators and get their questions answered. Since then, more locations, times and dates have been added.

Suzan Howes, regional librarian for the Daytona Beach Regional Library at City Island, said informational sessions are scheduled this month on Tuesdays, 9-11 a.m. and 5-7 p.m. Oct. 22 and 29 (a Spanish-speaking assistance will be available at the 5 p.m. presentations), and Saturdays, 9 a.m.-noon Oct. 19 and 26.

Howes hopes that after the informational sessions are complete in October, there will be a navigator at the library on a regular schedule to work with residents one on one until open enrollment closes March 31.
