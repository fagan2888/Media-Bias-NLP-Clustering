But apparently one intern from CNN didn\u2019t get the memo. He was removed from the Supreme Court press room today after he was caught with a GoPro strapped to his chest.\n\nPolitico first reported on the incident this afternoon. CNN claims that the intern, Walbert Castillo, didn\u2019t intend to record the SCOTUS proceedings before he was kicked out earlier today. Apparently Castillo was using the GoPro for an unrelated segment on CNN and forgot that he had it on when acting as a \u201crunner\u201d for the day.\n\n\u201cRunners\u201d sit and listen to decisions from the Court and rush outside to tell their producers and on-camera talent about rulings in a race to get that info on the air. This system is the reason that so many media outlets got the Obamacare decision so spectacularly wrong in 2012 when every network was rushing to get the news out first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPolitico got a statement from CNN that says they \u201cmisunderstood the rules about recording inside the Supreme Court\u2019s Public Information Office and acted inappropriately. We\u2019ve taken the necessary action to remedy this situation. We profusely apologize to the Court.\u201d\n\nSo why does the Supreme Court hate cameras? Because they think America is too dumb to understand their opinions, basically. Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the Court\u2019s most conservative members, and vocal opponent of cameras in the courtroom, explained the rationale in 2012:\n\nSponsored\n\nIf I really thought it would educate the American people I\u2019d be all for it. If the American people sat down and watched our proceedings gavel to gavel they would never again ask \u2014 as I\u2019m sometimes asked, \u2018Justice Scalia, why do you have to be a lawyer to be on the Supreme Court? The Constitution doesn\u2019t say so\u2019 \u2014 no the Constitution doesn\u2019t say so, but if you know what our real business is, if you know that we\u2019re not usually contemplating our navel \u2018should there be a right to this or that, should there be a right to abortion, should there be a right to homos-...\u2019 that\u2019s not usually what we\u2019re doing. [...] We\u2019re usually dealing with dulls stuff that only a lawyer could understand, and perhaps get interested in. If the American people saw all of that, they would be educated.\n\nUm, sure Justice Scalia.\n\nThe ironic thing? Scalia seems to be arguing that if you take video clips of Court proceedings out of context it can represent a distorted view of what\u2019s being said. But you\u2019ll notice that I did my best to transcribe his words and because he cut off his own use of a word that starts with homo, it appears like he\u2019s asking \u201cshould there be a right to homos?\u201d\n\nNow, given Scalia\u2019s record on human rights, I can\u2019t say for sure that he wasn\u2019t literally asking that question. But you actually get a better feel for the context of his quote by watching the video.\n\nMake no mistake that televised proceedings from the Supreme Court seem inevitable. Another hidden camera made its way inside the Supreme Court just last year. As cameras keep getting smaller and more stealth it\u2019s only a matter of time. And when they\u2019re finally allowed openly in the courtroom, let Walbert Castillo\u2019s \u201caccident\u201d be remembered as one of the first shots across the bow.\n\nAdvertisement", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "supreme court, scotus, Gizmodo", "author": "Matt Novak", "og": {"site_name": "Gizmodo", "description": "The US Supreme Court forbids cameras in the courtroom.
