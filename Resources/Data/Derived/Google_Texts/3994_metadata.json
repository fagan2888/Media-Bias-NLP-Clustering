(In fact, when it comes to governing during crisis, you could argue that only a few others, like Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt, had it worse.) Still, even though the president has already had more than his fair share of bad weeks, the past seven days or so have to rank among the administration\u2019s very worst.\n\nObviously there was his party\u2019s failure during Tuesday\u2019s elections, which handed full control of Congress (and many state governments) to the GOP. That was awful enough to inspire the Washington Post\u2019s E.J. Dionne to describe 2014 as even worse for Dems than the disaster of 2010. But there was also the news that the conservative Supreme Court would take a crack at further weakening the Affordable Care Act by striking down its subsidies while also upholding its mandate, which would leave millions of Americans forced to buy insurance without the subsidies needed to make the law work. Put these two things together, and you see an Obama legacy now very much in doubt.\n\nJudging by his post-election press conference on Wednesday, the wave of bad news hasn\u2019t really dampened the president\u2019s spirits. But some of his biggest supporters aren\u2019t nearly as confident that, in the end, everything will work out. For example, Andrew Sullivan, who has long been one of Obama\u2019s most loyal defenders, was utterly baffled by the outcome on Tuesday. In his election-recap post (straightforwardly titled \u201cWhere did Obama go wrong?\u201d) Sullivan tries to figure out how, exactly, the man who was so beloved in 2009 had so dramatically lost the public\u2019s favor. He grants that Obama isn\u2019t always the best at messaging and pure politics, but insists that there is no \u201csubstantive reason why Obama has lost altitude.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Sullivan\u2019s piece doesn\u2019t answer the question, opting instead to explain why various decisions the president made were the \u201cleast worst\u201d possible. He cites globalization, Islamic extremism, ideological polarization and the increasingly extreme GOP as structural forces keeping Obama from doing much more than he has already. \u201c[Obama] never promised us perfection,\u201d Sullivan writes, \u201cmerely endurance and persistence in substantively changing the nation and the world for the better.\u201d Within the political framework of the present moment, Sullivan basically argues, Obama\u2019s accomplished much of what one could realistically expect.\n\nThat may well be true. But if Sullivan and his ilk want to understand where the president went wrong, I\u2019d suggest they examine whether, in the present circumstances, Obama\u2019s simply playing the hand he was dealt was enough. For a self-described conservative like Sullivan, who rejects experimentation and wants progress to be orderly and incremental, Obama\u2019s penchant for working from within the system rather than trying to disrupt it is a real plus. A chief question of his presidency, however, is whether this temperamental conservatism was the wrong fit for the current era, when major reforms are so desperately needed.\n\nPerhaps tellingly, this question has hounded left-of-center observers of the president from the beginning. Candidate Obama spoke a lot about \u201cchange\u201d; and as an individual he was certainly different from the presidential aspirants that came before. He talked a good game about wanting a \u201ctransformational\u201d presidency, too. Being a Bill Clinton-like manager of the status quo, he said, would not be enough. Yet the Columbia- and Harvard-educated Obama was hardly an outsider. He was a striver, a climber, a product of that status quo. He was someone who learned the rules of the game, followed them, and then won. Would he really want to shake things up?", "article_metadata": {"description": "As his presidency once again teeters on the brink, it's time to look seriously at how it became undone", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As his presidency once again teeters on the brink, it's time to look seriously at how it became undone", "title": "Where Obama went wrong: How failing to \u201cseize the radical moment\u201d explains his terrible week", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/08/where_obama_went_wrong_how_failing_to_seize_the_radical_moment_explains_his_terrible_week/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/barack_obama13.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As his presidency once again teeters on the brink, it's time to look seriously at how it became undone", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/barack_obama13.jpg", "title": "Where Obama went wrong: How failing to \u201cseize the radical moment\u201d explains his terrible week", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Where Obama went wrong: How failing to \u201cseize the radical moment\u201d explains his terrible week", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Affordable Care Act, Andrew Sullivan, Barack Obama, Editor's Picks, Harper's, herbert hoover, kevin baker, Midterms, Obamacare, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In his election-recap post (straightforwardly titled \u201cWhere did Obama go wrong?\u201d) Sullivan tries to figure out how, exactly, the man who was so beloved in 2009 had so dramatically lost the public\u2019s favor.\nPut these two things together, and you see an Obama legacy now very much in doubt.\nCandidate Obama spoke a lot about \u201cchange\u201d; and as an individual he was certainly different from the presidential aspirants that came before.\nObviously there was his party\u2019s failure during Tuesday\u2019s elections, which handed full control of Congress (and many state governments) to the GOP.\nFor example, Andrew Sullivan, who has long been one of Obama\u2019s most loyal defenders, was utterly baffled by the outcome on Tuesday."}
