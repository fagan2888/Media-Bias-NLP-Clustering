The program involved 40 to 60 minutes of balance and leg-strengthening exercises, and about 13 percent of the sessions were supervised by a physical therapist. The study found that the patients in the exercise program experienced fewer falls (up to 70 percent less) than those who didn\u2019t exercise \u2014 but only for people with a less severe form of Parkinson\u2019s. Patients with severe Parkinson\u2019s, on the other hand, weren\u2019t so impacted by exercise.\n\n\u201cThese results suggest that minimally supervised exercise programs aimed at reducing falls in people with Parkinson\u2019s should be started early in the disease process,\u201d Colleen Canning of the University of Sydney in Australia, and lead author of the study, said in a press release.\n\nAlong with impaired motor skills and slower decision-making, Parkinson\u2019s disease, which involves the degeneration of nerve cells in the part of the brain that controls movement, can often create a risk for falling. Often, patients suffering from the disease first experience weakness in their limbs as well as trembling, which gets worse as time goes on. Depression and cognitive and emotional issues often go hand in hand with this disorder.\n\nBut falling is one of the riskier effects, with about 60 percent of Parkinson\u2019s patients falling at least once a year, and up to two-thirds of them falling consistently. \u201cThe resulting injuries, pain, limitations of activity, and fear of falling again can really affect people\u2019s health and well-being,\u201d Canning said in the press release.\n\nIf exercise is the single best preventive treatment for any disease out there, then it surely can help reduce falls and improve not only the physical state, but also mental and emotional state, of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Take Dr. Donald Cantway for example; he's a retired emergency room physician in his 70s living with Parkinson\u2019s. With the help of a new exercise regimen, as well as a neurostimulator in his brain that helps lessen the effects of tremors and slowed movements, Cantway has seen a drastic improvement in his condition.\n\nIt\u2019s been known for quite some time that moderate, consistent exercise reduces the risk of pretty much every chronic disease out there, including cancer, obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and Alzheimer\u2019s. Parkinson\u2019s is no exception to the rule. Cantway, who has become a cross-country skier, told Steamboat Today in an interview that \u201cParkinson\u2019s takes away your fine motor movements, and exercises that require big motions help.\u201d Cross country skiing is \u201cideal,\u201d he notes, though \u201cthe only problem is that if you fall down, it can be hard to get up\u2026 Exercises designed to improve balance and mobility \u2014 those are the things you lose.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "parkinson's, exercise", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The tremors and slowed movements of Parkinson\u2019s disease can be reduced through exercise, according to a new study.", "title": "Exercise Improves Quality Of Life In Parkinson\u2019s Patients", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/parkinsons-disease-patients-improve-strength-quality-life-exercise-316164", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/03/swimming.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The tremors and slowed movements of Parkinson\u2019s disease can be reduced through exercise, according to a new study.", "title": "Exercise Improves Quality Of Life In Parkinson\u2019s Patients", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/parkinsons-disease-patients-improve-strength-quality-life-exercise-316164", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/03/swimming.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/03/swimming.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-01-03T18:01:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-04T11:47:11-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The tremors and slowed movements of Parkinson\u2019s disease can be reduced through exercise, according to a new study."}, "article_summary": "But falling is one of the riskier effects, with about 60 percent of Parkinson\u2019s patients falling at least once a year, and up to two-thirds of them falling consistently.\nA new study published in the journal Neurology, from the American Academy of Neurology, shows that exercise can significantly improve symptoms in Parkinson\u2019s patients, including strengthening their balance, ability to move around, and even their overall quality of life.\nFor the study, researchers examined 231 people who had Parkinson\u2019s disease; one group received usual treatment, while another group participated in an exercise program three times a week over the course of six months.\nPatients with severe Parkinson\u2019s, on the other hand, weren\u2019t so impacted by exercise.\nThe study found that the patients in the exercise program experienced fewer falls (up to 70 percent less) than those who didn\u2019t exercise \u2014 but only for people with a less severe form of Parkinson\u2019s."}
