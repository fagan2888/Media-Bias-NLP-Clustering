Not long ago the prediction would have been bold but now it seems almost pass\u00e9, as more evidence mounts that the warm, wet conditions for life as we know it prevail throughout the cosmos. Surely simple, single-celled life should be common out there, waiting to be found by a rover in subsurface brines on Mars or by a mission sent to probe the oceans of the icy moons Europa or even via space telescopes gazing at Earth-like planets orbiting faraway stars. NASA generously funds all these efforts.\n\nThe possible existence of intelligent aliens and extraterrestrial civilizations, on the other hand, remains much more controversial and is scarcely funded at all. Even so, for more than a half-century a small, scattered contingent of astronomers has gone against the grain, engaging in a search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). SETI chiefly looks for chatty cosmic cultures that might be beaming messages around our region of the galaxy using radio waves or laser pulses. But its interstellar eavesdropping has yet to detect any signals that withstand close scrutiny. Even if brimming with life, to us, the galaxy seems to be a very quiet, rather lonely place.\n\nNow, new results suggest this loneliness may extend out into the universe far beyond our galaxy or, instead, that some of our preconceptions about the behaviors of alien civilizations are deeply flawed. After examining some 100,000 nearby large galaxies a team of researchers lead by The Pennsylvania State University astronomer Jason Wright has concluded that none of them contain any obvious signs of highly advanced technological civilizations. Published in The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, it is by far the largest of study of its kind to date\u2014earlier research had only cursorily investigated about a hundred galaxies.\n\nMore heat than light\n\nUnlike traditional SETI surveys, Wright and his team did not seek messages from the stars. Instead, they looked for the thermodynamic consequences of galactic-scale colonization, based on an idea put forth in 1960 by the physicist Freeman Dyson. Dyson postulated that a growing technological culture would ultimately be limited by access to energy, and that advanced, energy-hungry civilizations would be driven to harvest all the available light from their stars. To do that, they might dismantle a planet or two as feedstock for building star-enveloping swarms of solar collectors. A star\u2019s light would fade as it was encased in such a \u201cDyson sphere,\u201d but Dyson noted the constructions could be detected by the mid-infrared glow of their radiated waste heat\u2014essentially the same phenomenon that causes your computer to warm up when it\u2019s running. In 1963 the Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev extended these ideas by developing a tripartite classification system for a civilization\u2019s energy use. A \u201ctype 1\u201d civilization would harness all the energy of its home planet whereas a type 2 uses all the energy of its star, perhaps by building a Dyson sphere around it. A type 3 civilization would be capable of using all the energy of its galaxy, presumably by encasing all its stars in Dyson spheres.\n\nUnable to secure funding from standard sources such as NASA or the National Science Foundation, Wright\u2019s group instead turned to the Templeton Foundation, a private organization with a history of supporting controversial and speculative research. With that funding the team searched for type 3 civilizations in an all-sky catalogue from NASA\u2019s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). They looked for objects that were optically dim but bright in the mid-infrared\u2014the expected signature of a galaxy filled with starlight-absorbing, heat-emitting Dyson spheres. After using software to automatically sift through some 100 million objects in the WISE catalogue, Wright\u2019s student Roger Griffith examined the remaining candidates by hand, culling those that weren\u2019t galaxies or that were obvious instrumental artifacts.\n\nThe result was about 100,000 galaxies, with about 50 in particular that emitted much more heat than light. Jessica Maldonado, a student at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, then scoured the astronomical literature to determine what was already known about those top candidates. Many of them were well studied, and can be explained as pairs of galaxies in the process of merging or as isolated \u201cstarburst\u201d galaxies\u2014two processes that can heat galactic quantities of light-blocking dust to generate powerful infrared glows. According to the researchers, an additional 90 galaxies with less extreme heat-to-light ratios warrant further study but, by and large, the results are null. \u201cOn Kardashev\u2019s scale, a type 3 civilization uses energy equal to all the starlight produced by one galaxy,\u201d Wright says. That would equate to an infrared-bright galaxy seemingly bereft of stars. \u201cWe looked at the nearest, largest 100,000 galaxies we could find in the WISE catalogue and we never saw that. One hundred thousand galaxies and not one had that signature. We didn\u2019t find any type 3s in our sample because there aren\u2019t any.\u201d\n\nEven if advanced civilizations do not build Dyson spheres, Wright\u2019s null result also applies to any other energy-intensive \u201castroengineering\u201d taking place at galactic scales. \u201cLooking for the absence of light as well as the waste heat like Wright and his colleagues have done is really cool,\u201d says James Annis, an astrophysicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory who in the late 1990s used different methods to survey more than a hundred nearby galaxies for type 3s. \u201cIn some sense it doesn\u2019t matter how a galactic civilization gets or uses its power because the second law of thermodynamics makes energy use hard to hide. They could construct Dyson spheres, they could get power from rotating black holes, they could build giant computer networks in the cold outskirts of galaxies, and all of that would produce waste heat. Wright\u2019s team went right to the peak of the curve for where you\u2019d expect to see any sort of waste heat, and they\u2019re just not seeing anything obvious.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the largest astrobiology study to date, scientists found no signs of advanced life in 100 nearby galaxies", "title": "The universe is a lonely place: Searches for alien civilization come up empty", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In the largest astrobiology study to date, scientists found no signs of advanced life in 100 nearby galaxies", "title": "The universe is a lonely place: Searches for alien civilization come up empty", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/the_universe_is_a_lonely_place_searches_for_alien_civilization_come_up_empty_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-17-at-3.38.20-PM-e1429299565832.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the largest astrobiology study to date, scientists found no signs of advanced life in 100 nearby galaxies", "title": "The universe is a lonely place: Searches for alien civilization come up empty", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-17-at-3.38.20-PM-e1429299565832.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lee Billings", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, alien, Astrobiology, Science, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6d6\"", "article_summary": "In 1963 the Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev extended these ideas by developing a tripartite classification system for a civilization\u2019s energy use.\n\u201cOn Kardashev\u2019s scale, a type 3 civilization uses energy equal to all the starlight produced by one galaxy,\u201d Wright says.\nEven if brimming with life, to us, the galaxy seems to be a very quiet, rather lonely place.\nA type 3 civilization would be capable of using all the energy of its galaxy, presumably by encasing all its stars in Dyson spheres.\nWith that funding the team searched for type 3 civilizations in an all-sky catalogue from NASA\u2019s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)."}
