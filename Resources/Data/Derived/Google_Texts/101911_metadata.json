At the same time, the increase in electronic filing increased dramatically. In 2014, 80 percent of all taxpayers\u2014or 117 million taxpayers\u2014filed returns electronically. In addition, 71.2 million tax professionals e-filed.\n\n\n\nSource: efile.com\n\nThe IRS receives about 100 million phone calls a year from taxpayers, some of which are answered by an automated system.\n\nIn the past, the Republican House would have to negotiate the proposed cuts with the Senate, formerly controlled by Democrats who would traditionally reject the cuts. This year, however, with Republicans in full control of Congress, the agency is likely heading for another budget slashing.\n\nOn top of the cuts, the GOP proposal also takes a swipe at Obamacare through a provision that would stop the IRS from enforcing the law\u2019s individual mandate-a key staple of the law.\n\nThe IRS plays a major role in the entire Obamacare implementation. Under the law, the IRS is tasked with enforcing at least 40 new provisions\u2014a massive undertaking. The latest GOP budget proposal was immediately attacked by Democrats, agency advocates and union organizations.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union came out swinging against the proposal\u2014saying the cuts would be extremely damaging to the agency\u2019s overall efforts.\n\n\u201cSlashing the IRS budget by almost $840 million below the current level and $2.8 billion below the President\u2019s request will further degrade its already impaired ability to provide taxpayers with the assistance they need and fairly enforce the tax laws enacted by Congress,\u201d National President Colleen M. Kelley wrote in a letter to the members of the financial services subcommittee.\n\nThe group issued similar warnings last year, when Congress cut the IRS budget by $346 million. At the time, tax advocate Nina Olson warned that the cuts severely hampered the agency\u2019s ability to respond to taxpayers during the 2015 tax filing season.\n\n\"We do not think it is acceptable for the government to tell millions of taxpayers who seek help each year, in essence, 'We\u2019re sorry. You\u2019re on your own,'\" Olson said in the National Taxpayer Advocate 2014 annual report to Congress.\n\nIf the GOP\u2019s proposed budget goes through, taxpayers can expect next year\u2019s filing season to be even worse.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican budgeteers are once again taking aim at the Internal Revenue Service\u2014which", "title": "GOP Threatens More Cuts at the Struggling IRS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/11/GOP-Threatens-More-Cuts-Struggling-IRS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-05-30T210345Z_1_CBRE94T1MIL00_RTROPTP_2_USA-TAX-IRS-CRITERIA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/11/GOP-Threatens-More-Cuts-Struggling-IRS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-05-30T210345Z_1_CBRE94T1MIL00_RTROPTP_2_USA-TAX-IRS-CRITERIA.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican budgeteers are once again taking aim at the Internal Revenue Service\u2014which", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1a1b\"", "article_summary": "The Wall Street Journal reports that between 1997 and 2012, the IRS budget increased 64 percent to $11.8 billion in nominal dollars.\nThe group issued similar warnings last year, when Congress cut the IRS budget by $346 million.\n\u201cEvery day, Americans are making tough decisions about their own budgets and rightfully expect federal agencies to do the same,\u201d said Representative Ander Crenshaw, a Florida Republican who oversees the IRS budget.\nIn addition, 71.2 million tax professionals e-filed.\nIn the past, the Republican House would have to negotiate the proposed cuts with the Senate, formerly controlled by Democrats who would traditionally reject the cuts."}
