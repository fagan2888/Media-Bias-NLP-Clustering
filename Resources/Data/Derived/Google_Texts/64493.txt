[WATCH] Francesca Chambers on Obamacare: Administration ‘shot itself in the foot’ with under 26 policy

Letting young people stay on their parents’ insurance until they’re 26 was not a smart way for the Obama administration to build a healthcare system, Red Alert Politics editor Francesca Chambers argued Tuesday night on Fusion. In fact, the administration ‘shot itself in the foot.’

Francesca appeared on the new TV network’s America with Jorge Ramos on Tuesday evening, alongside John Della Volpe from the Harvard University Institute of Politics and New Hampshire state Rep. Marilinda Garcia (R). Fusion, owned jointly by Disney-ABC and Univision, is specifically targeted to young people and covers news, politics and popular culture.

The host asked his guests what political topics young people are most passionate about in the United States right now — because it often seems as if they’re not passionate about anything. Francesca said that older generations are often bad at reaching out to Millennials, but noted that young people do care about healthcare and higher education.



“Obamacare lets young people under the age of 26 stay on their parents’ healthcare…so that was one of the ways I think that the Obama administration shot themselves in the foot with getting young people to sign up for Obamacare,” she told the host.

Ramos also asked his guests to break down the recent Rolling Stone article that advocated for socialism. Francesca pointed out that young people would love to do whatever they want and still be assured of a job, but that in reality a system like that doesn’t actually work.

“The author has basically created a Neverland here that couldn’t possibly exist in a fully-functioning society,” Francesca said. “And in fact, the Soviet Union tried to do this in the ’80s.”

She added that even simple things, like nice designer jeans, had to be acquired on the black market in the Soviet Union.
