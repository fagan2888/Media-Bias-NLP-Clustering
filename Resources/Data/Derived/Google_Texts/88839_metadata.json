(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\n4158401\n\nThe president of the Claremont Institute in California is calling for a conservative movement that is centered on defending the U.S. Constitution.\n\nBrian T. Kennedy knows government ought to be limited, as boundaries have always exalted the notion of natural or human rights from the Declaration of Independence.\n\n\u201cThere was one conservative movement that was adequate to fight the Cold War and to elect Ronald Reagan,\u201d said Kennedy, who is also the publisher of The Claremont Review of Books. \u201cThey were against communism abroad and socialism at home.That was perfect for that time, but having won the Cold War, the conservative movement didn\u2019t quite know how to dismantle big government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re left today, by and large, with a political class that has made, in some ways, peace with big government. But in the hands of Barack Obama, big government has gotten much more intrusive and Obamacare is simply the most dramatic manifestation of that progressive ideal begun 100 years ago,\u201d he continued.\n\nHe discusses the challenge of how, as more Americans become reliant on government programs and the notion of self-government is eroded, most Republicans now don\u2019t believe they can win elections without giving out government entitlements.\n\n\u201cThe tea party is a manifestation of a part of the Republican base that wants there to be a Constitution again, and wants that Constitution to be adhered to,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nOptimistic that good Americans will rise up for the U.S. Constitution, Kennedy admits, \u201cthere is this strange notion that the more educated we become, the more we ought to rely on Ph.Ds and bureaucrats to run our lives, rather than self-government and the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe interview concludes with a sobering discussion of a need for a new foreign policy that recognizes the reality of a \u201cdangerous world.\u201d\n\nHe wonders if America was self-deceived by \u201cwinning the Cold War\u201d since \u201cthe Soviet Union, in reorganizing, took one step back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe took ten. We built down our military, didn\u2019t pursue a missile defense and yet, need a strong military and intellectual strategy that takes into account Russia, China and their allies, the Islamic world.\u201d\n\nWATCH PART 2:\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "Conservative leader calls for a new movement to stop the loss of self-government", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The president of the Claremont Institute in California is calling for a conservative movement that is centered on defending the U.S. Constitution.
