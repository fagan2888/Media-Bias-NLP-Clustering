That couldn't be further from the truth since most states that have accepted the expansion money are experiencing skyrocketing Medicaid costs, which are throwing their budgets into turmoil.\n\n\n\nWhile the federal government has said it will pick up most of the tab of expanding Medicaid in the beginning, that funding will gradually decrease each year, placing a larger burden on state taxpayers for years and years to come.\n\n\n\nIn Illinois, the state's projected cost of expanding Medicaid has increased from $573 million to $2 billion between 2017 and 2020. Kentucky could also be looking at an annual cost of $363 million by 2021.\n\n\n\nThen there's Ohio, where Gov. John Kasich predicted his state's Medicaid expansion would cost $14 billion from 2014 to 2020. But new estimates show the expanded program is now on track to cost $28.5 billion by 2020.\n\n\n\nTranslation: The future budgets of states that accepted the Medicaid expansion are now in significant peril.\n\n\n\nWe don't want the same thing happening here in Wisconsin. According to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, state medical assistance expenditures already are at $8.5 billion, and are expected to increase by nearly $1.9 billion over the biennium. If we accepted the expansion money, that number could be significantly higher based off of what is happening in other states.\n\n\n\nAnother reason it was wise to reject the Medicaid expansion dollars is the federal government's notorious track record of making commitments it does not keep.\n\n\n\nJust as one example, many Obamacare co-ops have been forced to close down because they were receiving much less in \"risk corridor\" payments than promised.\n\n\n\nThe risk corridor program was created to safeguard insurers from heavy losses by shifting money from insurance companies doing well to those performing poorly. But the amount of money coming in was so small the program could only pay about 12 percent of the $2.87 billion that was requested, leaving gaping holes in the budgets of numerous co-ops.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report released last month by the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the heavy costs of the failed co-ops will be borne by taxpayers, doctors, patients and other insurers. None of the unsuccessful co-ops have repaid a single dollar, principal or interest, of the $1.2 billion in federal solvency and start-up loans they received.\n\n\n\nThe investigation by the subcommittee also suggests that no significant share of the loans will ever be repaid. In other words, taxpayers will be taking a hit in their pocketbooks once again.\n\n\n\nYet, even with all these red flags, Democratic elected officials in Wisconsin continue to push for Gov. Scott Walker to accept the Medicaid expansion.\n\n\n\nTheir efforts are now focused on promoting the SAME Act, legislation introduced by U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and other Democratic lawmakers that would allow states that refused the Medicaid expansion after the original 2014 deadline to receive the same level of federal funding as states that initially accepted the expansion.\n\n\n\nIn typical Democrat fashion, Baldwin has not disclosed how the federal government will be paying for any of the states that decide to show up late to the party. However, I will give you the answer: It's you, the taxpayer.\n\n\n\nHere in Wisconsin, we have been working hard to come up with responsible solutions to ensure all residents have access to quality health care.\n\n\n\nDue to Gov. Walker's Entitlement Reform Plan that was signed into law in 2013, all eligible adults living in poverty are covered by BadgerCare, the state's version of Medicaid. Those above 100 percent of the federal poverty line are able to obtain subsidies and private coverage through the federal health insurance exchange.\n\n\n\nBy making those changes, the number of uninsured adults in the state has been reduced by 224,580.\n\n\n\nEven though Wisconsin has declined to take the federal expansion money, we are the only state in the nation that doesn't have a coverage cap when it comes to health insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. No other state that has taken the Medicaid expansion funds can boast about having no coverage gap like we can in Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nThe program we designed ensures that every person has access to coverage whether it be through the federal exchange or BadgerCare.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the decision not to take the expansion, Wisconsin citizens are much better off in the long run from both a financial and overall coverage standpoint.\n\n\n\nFacts are stubborn things, and they clearly show Wisconsin made the correct choice for our future by not accepting the expansion money.\n\n\n\n-- Sanfelippo, R-New Berlin, represents the 15th Assembly District.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "John Kasich predicted his state's Medicaid expansion would cost $14 billion from 2014 to 2020.\nOne of the most disingenuous claims coming from expansion supporters is that taking the \"free\" federal dollars would cost Wisconsin nothing.\nFacts are stubborn things, and they clearly show Wisconsin made the correct choice for our future by not accepting the expansion money.\nIf we accepted the expansion money, that number could be significantly higher based off of what is happening in other states.\nTranslation: The future budgets of states that accepted the Medicaid expansion are now in significant peril."}
