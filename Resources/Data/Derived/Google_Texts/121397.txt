Former Kiss lead guitarist Ace Frehley has been hospitalized for exhaustion and was forced to cancel Saturday's show in Poughkeepsie, New York.

KISS is set to perform July 25 at Intrust Bank Arena in Wichita.

A post on Frehley's website and Facebook page says he was admitted to Wilkes-Barre General Hospital after Friday's show at the F.M. Kirby Center in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

The post says that his symptoms were due to "exhaustion and dehydration." Frehley was otherwise given "a clean bill of health."

His website says Frehley "reluctantly" agreed to cancel Saturday night's sold-out show at The Chance in Poughkeepsie.

According to his website, Frehley had to cancel a show April 9 in New Hope, Pennsylvania, after a band member was sick.

The 64-year-old has been touring all month. Messages were left with a manager for Frehley and a hospital spokesperson.
