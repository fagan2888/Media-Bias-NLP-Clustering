Instead of doing something about these children who are at the border, they want to deport hundreds of thousands of the people who are already here.\"\n\nThe move could stymie bipartisan efforts to cool the immigration surge with just a few days before Congress adjourns for the month.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, says he will not approve immigration reform until changes are made. (Charlie Neibergall/ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nCruz and other conservatives have blamed Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals \u2014 which holds off deportation for some undocumented immigrants who came here relatively young \u2014 for the surge of Central American children crossing the Mexican border unaccompanied and without documents.\n\nThe conservative's office didn't immediately return a request for comment. A spokeswoman told Politico on Wednesday that Cruz was drafting legislation that would stop expanded funding toward deferred action.\n\nUntil then, Cruz refuses to support any kind of immigration reform, such as amending a 2008 law that current allows minors wait years in the U.S. before seeing a judge. The change, pushed by Texas Democrat Rep. Henry Cuellar and Republican Sen. John Cornyn, would shorten the wait time for an undocumented minor to appear in court.\n\nImmigrants who have been caught crossing the border illegally are housed inside the McAllen Border Patrol Station in McAllen, Tex. The Texas senator and representative are pushing for immigrants to be deported faster. (Rick Loomis/AP)\n\nThe bill will likely be merged with the $3.7 billion in emergency funds Obama has requested to speed up the deportation process by sending more immigration judges to the area.\n\nBut the clock is ticking for not just the Texans' amendment but the cash influx. Congress officially adjourns next Friday until the second week of September.\n\nIt's the second time in a year that the Tea Party powerhouse from Texas has tried ending one of the President's initiatives by tacking it on to a bill.\n\nIn September 2013, Cruz rallied Tea Party-leaning members of both chambers to block any budget bill that didn't include repealing Obamacare. Without a budget for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, the government shut down for 16 days.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "TERENCE CULLEN", "twitter": {"description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blasted Republican Ted Cruz and the GOP Thursday morning calling his colleague's political tactics \"high-stakes\" poker.", "title": "Harry Reid, Ted Cruz face off over immigration", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/harry-reid-ted-cruz-face-immigration-article-1.1870662", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1870660.1405618235!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/senate-birth-control.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Terence Cullen", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-17T17:36:39", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/harry-reid-ted-cruz-face-immigration-article-1.1870662", "parsely-title": "Harry Reid, Ted Cruz face off over immigration", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-17T13:36:39-0400", "sailthru.title": "Harry Reid, Ted Cruz face off over immigration", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1870660.1405618235!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/senate-birth-control.jpg", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blasted Republican Ted Cruz and the GOP Thursday morning calling his colleague's political tactics \"high-stakes\" poker.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blasted Republican Ted Cruz and the GOP Thursday morning calling his colleague's political tactics \"high-stakes\" poker.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blasted Republican Ted Cruz and the GOP Thursday morning calling his colleague's political tactics \"high-stakes\" poker.", "title": "Harry Reid, Ted Cruz face off over immigration", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/harry-reid-ted-cruz-face-immigration-article-1.1870662", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1870660.1405618235!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/senate-birth-control.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "TERENCE CULLEN", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1870660.1405618235!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/senate-birth-control.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf427\"", "article_summary": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blasted Republican Ted Cruz and the GOP Thursday morning calling his colleague's political tactics \"high-stakes\" poker.\nU.S. Sen.
