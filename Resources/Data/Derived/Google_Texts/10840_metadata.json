EPA chief Gina McCarthy told reporters that the rule will not expand the government\u2019s authority over water.\n\nBarrasso\u2019s amendment matches a bill he introduced in June to block the rule.\n\n\u201cThey want to include ditches and other dry areas where water flows only for a short duration after a rainfall,\u201d he said on the Senate floor shortly after introducing the bill. \u201cBut the government wants to control even that.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy tried to address some claims about the proposal Tuesday that she called \u201cludicrous.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people say that EPA is going to be regulating small, unconnected waters, including puddles on lawns, driveways and playgrounds,\u201d she told reporters, picking some examples of what she has heard about the rule. \u201cNow, that\u2019s just silly.\u201d\n\nAt least 40 senators \u2014 all Republicans \u2014 have endorsed legislation to stop the proposed rule, along with a majority of the House.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, House Republicans introduced a funding bill for EPA that would block funding to work on the rule.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
