Sociedad had goalie Geronimo Rulli sent off with a direct red card for fouling Marco Asensio in the 41st.\n\nIn the capital, Madrid\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo saw his scoring run end after eight goals in his previous two matches.\n\nBut Navas, who had been seconds away from being sent to Manchester United at the close of the summer window as part of Madrid\u2019s failed transfer for David de Gea, extended the club record to a fifth consecutive clean sheet.\n\n\u201cI had the chance to stay where I wanted to be and I will give it my all to remain here,\u201d Navas said. \u201cIt was complicated because you know it is an awkward situation. But that is the past and I try to focus on the present, which is all that matters.\u201d\n\nThe son of the Syrian refugee tripped by a Hungarian journalist accompanied Ronaldo on the pitch before the match, receiving applause from the crowd. During that pre-game introduction, Madrid\u2019s and Granada\u2019s players wore t-shirts supporting the thousands of refugees fleeing to Europe from the Syrian war.\n\nMadrid also invited his father Osama Abdul Mohsen and brother to the match. Osama Abdul Mohsen had arrived to the capital earlier this week after a Spanish football academy offered to help them rebuild their life.\n\nGranada\u2019s promising performance was a surprise at Madrid, where last season it lost by the humbling score of 9-1.\n\nGranada coach Jose Sandoval said his team had been motivated by tweets published by Madrid which had asked its supporters to guess how many goals the team would score.\n\n\u201cThey showed a lack of respect for us, they underestimated us,\u201d Sandoval said. \u201cI am pleased with the looseness my players showed today. If we had had some luck we could have gotten a different result.\u201d\n\nThe visitors\u2019 best opportunity came in the 20th when striker Youssef El Arabi had a goal waived off for a questionable offside call.\n\nNavas had his turn to rush out and smother Isaac Success\u2019 effort in the 39th. Success went close in the 53rd when he chipped the ball over the bar after El Arabi set him up.\n\nThe Nigerian forward was left to rue his miss moments later when Benzema broke the deadlock by nodding in Francisco \u201cIsco\u201d Alarcon\u2019s cross from inside the six-yard box.\n\n\u201cI would have liked to have scored more goals, but you have to give credit to Granada,\u201d said Madrid coach Rafa Benitez, who is undefeated in five matches at this new club.\n\nAt Eibar, Correa scored the first ball he touched in the 62nd, deftly separating from a defender to score after Torres chased down a long ball and laid off for the Argentine. Correa returned the favor by playing Torres through for him to lift the ball over sliding \u2018keeper Asier Riesgo in the 77th.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Karim Benzema scored to help Real Madrid eke out a 1-0 win over Granada on Saturday and take the overnight lead of the Spanish league, while Fernando Torres netted one goal and set up another to lift Atletico Madrid into second place.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Karim Benzema scored to help Real Madrid eke out a 1-0 win over Granada on Saturday and take the overnight lead of the Spanish league, while Fernando Torres netted one goal and set up another to lift Atletico Madrid into second place.", "title": "Madrid edges Granada 1-0, Atletico wins 2-0 at Eibar", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/19/benzema-goal-gives-madrid-1-0-win-over-granada-in-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/19/56dce6002d60772a820f6a706700dfb0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/19/56dce6002d60772a820f6a706700dfb0.jpg", "description": "Karim Benzema scored to help Real Madrid eke out a 1-0 win over Granada on Saturday and take the overnight lead of the Spanish league, while Fernando Torres netted one goal and set up another to lift", "card": "summary", "title": "Madrid edges Granada 1-0, Atletico wins 2-0 at Eibar"}, "Author": "JOSEPH WILSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Madrid has 10 points, one more than Atletico and Barcelona, which can reclaim the league lead against Levante on Sunday.\nTorres and Angel Correa both went on as second-half substitutes and inspired Atletico to a 2-0 win at Eibar, leaving Diego Simeone\u2019s side ahead of Barcelona on goal difference.\nGranada\u2019s promising performance was a surprise at Madrid, where last season it lost by the humbling score of 9-1.\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) - Karim Benzema scored to help Real Madrid eke out a 1-0 win over Granada on Saturday and take the overnight lead of the Spanish league, while Fernando Torres netted one goal and set up another to lift Atletico Madrid into second place.\nCorrea returned the favor by playing Torres through for him to lift the ball over sliding \u2018keeper Asier Riesgo in the 77th."}
