It also reflects slowing growth. Employers hired 8.6 percent more new grads in 2014 and 9.6 percent more in 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s still a competitive job market, and the ability of students to find jobs will depend on both their majors (those with business, engineering, and computer science degrees are most in demand), and their locations. A recent NerdWallet analysis found that Arlington, Virginia; Madison, Wisconsin; and Washington, D.C., are the best cities for 2016 grads looking for work.\n\nEarlier research by NACE found that the level of starting salaries varied by major. Engineering students can expect the highest starting salary, an average of $64,891, up from $62,998 last year. Education majors, by comparison, were projected to earn an average of $34,891 in their first year in the work force.\n\nOnce they land that first job, today\u2019s college grads aren\u2019t likely to stay put for very long. More than 70 percent of recent grads leave their first job within their first year, according to data from Express Employment Professionals.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Employers expect to hire more new grads this year than they did last year, although th", "title": "Good News on Jobs for the Class of 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/07/Good-News-Jobs-Class-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10012014_Graduation_Ceremony.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/07/Good-News-Jobs-Class-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10012014_Graduation_Ceremony.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Employers expect to hire more new grads this year than they did last year, although th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Companies plan on hiring 5.2 percent more members of the Class of 2016 than they did members of the Class of 2015, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers\u2019 Job Outlook 2016 Spring Update.\nA recent NerdWallet analysis found that Arlington, Virginia; Madison, Wisconsin; and Washington, D.C., are the best cities for 2016 grads looking for work.\nMore than 70 percent of recent grads leave their first job within their first year, according to data from Express Employment Professionals.\nOnce they land that first job, today\u2019s college grads aren\u2019t likely to stay put for very long.\nEducation majors, by comparison, were projected to earn an average of $34,891 in their first year in the work force."}
