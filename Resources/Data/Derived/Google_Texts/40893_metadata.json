Symbols from various Confederate flags are evident in the flags of Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Arkansas.\n\nAll these states were among those that seceded from the union in 1860-1861 and joined the pro-slavery Confederate States of America that was defeated by the anti-slavery union in the American Civil War.\n\nRepresentative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who pushed last year for his state\u2019s flag to be removed from the Capitol, praised Miller's announcement as a step toward removing all signs of the \u201cConfederate revolt against our own country.\u201d\n\nCriticism over public display of the Confederate flag intensified last year after a white man who gunned down nine black churchgoers in South Carolina was pictured on social media with it.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told a weekly news conference that he supports the decision to change the display. It is expected to be installed once renovations of the tunnel are finished later this year.\n\n(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/US-Capitol-replacing-flag-display-over-Confederate-imagery", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A display of U.S.", "title": "U.S. Capitol replacing flag display over Confederate imagery"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/21/US-Capitol-replacing-flag-display-over-Confederate-imagery", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A display of U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Only the Mississippi state flag still depicts the Confederate battle flag, in the top left corner.\n\"I am well aware of how many Americans negatively view the Confederate flag, and, personally, I am very sympathetic to these views,\" she said.\nSymbols from various Confederate flags are evident in the flags of Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Arkansas.\nLawmakers who choose to hang their home states' flags outside their offices may still do so.\nMichigan Republican Representative Miller said in a statement that she decided to replace the display because of the controversy surrounding the Confederate flag, which is widely seen today as a symbol of racism and slavery."}
