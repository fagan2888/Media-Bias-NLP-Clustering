For the last 29 years the "Boat Parade of Lights" has taken place around the bay.

It's an opportunity for owners to deck out their boats with Christmas decorations and holiday spirit.

This year over 55 boats were registered for the parade, which is the largest number of participants they've ever had.

Over 2,000 people were estimated to have been in attendance.

It's the second year WJHG's Paris Janos had the opportunity to emcee the event, along with Veronica Kemeny.

'We want to make Panama city the best place to live," said Kemeny. "And tonight we actually set the stage that we are the best boat parade of the south."

Committee members said Saturday's boat stand-outs were a minion themed boat and a 120 foot Air force boat that was covered with drones.
