Freedom Rock Church teamed up with the Boys and Girls Club for Operation Freedom Cares.

Freedom Rock started Freedom Cares to go out in the community and serve. This event is reaching out to those that may be in need. The church collected canned goods to be able to serve the community a free soup lunch. Minister Marco Smith says it's their duty to serve the community.

"Weâ€™re offering here a free bowl of soup to the community of Lauderdale County to those individuals that necessarily need a meal, necessarily dependent on a meal, but we want you to come out and participate in what the community calls for a responsibility to serve," Smith says.

Smith says the church will continue to do outreach programs throughout the community.
