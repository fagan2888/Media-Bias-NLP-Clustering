Amtrak passengers say they were stuck on a train for hours as it sat idled between Newton and Emporia.

Passengers tell KAKE News they boarded the train in Chicago Saturday afternoon at about 2:30 p.m. The train was scheduled to arrive in Newton around 3:30 a.m.

But passengers say the train faced numerous delays.

They say it sat at the Chicago station for about four hours before finally leaving Saturday evening. They say the train was then delayed again somewhere in the Topeka area in the early morning hours. They say it then stopped on the tracks between Newton and Emporia at about 6:30 a.m. That's where they say they were stuck for almost six hours until early Sunday afternoon.

Passengers say they were told by Amtrak attendants on the train that there was a train with a broken engine on the tracks in front of them.

An Amtrak representative confirmed to KAKE News there was a "disabled freight train on the main line." She said as soon as it was cleared, "the train will continue on to its destination."

Passengers said, before they arrived in Newton at around 12:30 p.m., that the 9-hour total trip delay had grown to be too much for many people on board. The passengers were on the train for a total of 20 hours.

They said the electricity had gone off on and off, making it uncomfortable inside the train cars. They also said bathrooms had become very dirty. At about 11 a.m., they say, they were offered a snack: crackers and water.
