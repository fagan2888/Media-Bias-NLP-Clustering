When the 90 days have passed, Obama may then actually sign the deal, triggering the next step in the TPP\u2019s journey toward enactment.\n\nIn the same deal with Congress, the president was granted \u201cfast-track\u201d trade authority, which allows him to present a trade deal directly to Congress for a vote, with no possibility of amendment. Fast-track is widely seen as improving the chances of the package gaining legislators\u2019 ultimate approval. Congress will have 45 legislative days to consider the deal before it comes to the floor.\n\nThe arrangement means that the deal will likely come before Congress in March, just as presidential candidates are barnstorming the country hoping to nail down primary election victories. Candidates on both sides of the Democratic-Republican divide are likely to make opposition to the deal central to their stump speeches. Arguably the most visible candidate in either race, real estate billionaire Donald Trump has made criticism of the Obama administration\u2019s negotiations with other countries a centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nEarly reaction to the deal broke along some unusual lines in today\u2019s highly partisan political climate. The White House, which negotiated the deal through the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, obviously supports it, as do many conservatives in Congress, as well as large segments of the business community.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan Sends a Signal to the GOP\u2019s Right Wing\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, the newly elected leader of a body that has done its utmost to block initiatives arising from the White House over the past several years, said he is \u201chopeful\u201d about the deal.\n\n\"I look forward to reviewing the details of the agreement that was released today,\u201d Ryan said in a statement.\n\n\u201cEnactment of TPP is going to require the administration to fully explain the benefits of this agreement and what it will mean for American families. I continue to reserve judgement on the path ahead. But I remain hopeful that our negotiators reached an agreement that the House can support because a successful TPP would mean more good jobs for American workers and greater U.S. influence in the world.\u201d\n\nBusiness Forward, an advocacy group representing small and mid-sized companies, released statements from 50 senior executives singing the praises of the deal.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Is Now Losing to a Guy Who Isn\u2019t Even Trying\n\nHowever, Obama\u2019s trade pact will likely face significant opposition from the president\u2019s natural allies. The top candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have already come out against the deal, and multiple groups on the left side of the political spectrum \u2013 from environmentalists to labor unions to online activists -- are all mobilizing against the deal.\n\n\u201cNow that we can read the final TPP text, it's obvious why it was kept in total secrecy for so long: this agreement is a wish list for powerful special interests and multinational corporations,\u201d said Evan Greer, campaign director of Fight for the Future. \u201cThe Intellectual Property chapter confirms our worst [fears] about the TPP's impact on our basic right to express ourselves and access information on the Internet. If U.S. Congress signs this agreement despite its blatant corruption, they'll be signing a death warrant for the open Internet and putting the future of free speech in peril.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe TPP is an act of climate denial,\u201d said Jason Kowalski, policy director for the environmental group 350. \u201cWhile the text is full of handouts to the fossil fuel industry, it doesn\u2019t mention the words climate change once. The agreement would give fossil fuel companies the extraordinary ability to sue local governments that try and keep fossil fuels in the ground. If a province puts a moratorium on fracking, corporations can sue; if a community tries to stop a coal mine, corporations can overrule them. In short, these rules undermine countries\u2019 ability to do what scientists say is the single most important thing we can do to combat the climate crisis: keep fossil fuels in the ground.\u201d\n\nWhile opponents of the deal are mobilizing to fight it, the biggest thing the TPP has in its favor is widespread public indifference to it. A Monmouth University poll released Thursday found that 60 percent of American have no opinion on the impact the deal would have if it is allowed to go through.\n\nThe survey found that the vast majority of people in the U.S. know very little about the deal, with 12 percent saying they have heard \u201c a lot\u201d about the deal, 47 percent saying they had heard \u201ca little,\u201d and 41 percent reporting they\u2019d heard \u201cnothing at all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the full-text release of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Thursday, the Obama administration is expected to inform Congress of the president\u2019s intention to sign the agreement, starting a 90-day countdown that will likely put the bill before Congress in the heat of the primary election season.", "title": "How the TPP Trade Deal Could Blow Up the Primaries", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/05/How-TPP-Trade-Deal-Could-Blow-Primaries", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-11-15T134459Z_2_CBRE9AE11U600_RTROPTP_2_USA-RETAIL-SHIPPING.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/05/How-TPP-Trade-Deal-Could-Blow-Primaries", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-11-15T134459Z_2_CBRE9AE11U600_RTROPTP_2_USA-RETAIL-SHIPPING.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With the full-text release of the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on Thursday, the Obama administration is expected to inform Congress of the president\u2019s intention to sign the agreement, starting a 90-day countdown that will likely put the bill before Congress in the heat of the primary election season.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In the same deal with Congress, the president was granted \u201cfast-track\u201d trade authority, which allows him to present a trade deal directly to Congress for a vote, with no possibility of amendment.\nWhen the 90 days have passed, Obama may then actually sign the deal, triggering the next step in the TPP\u2019s journey toward enactment.\nCandidates on both sides of the Democratic-Republican divide are likely to make opposition to the deal central to their stump speeches.\nCongress will have 45 legislative days to consider the deal before it comes to the floor.\nThe arrangement means that the deal will likely come before Congress in March, just as presidential candidates are barnstorming the country hoping to nail down primary election victories."}
