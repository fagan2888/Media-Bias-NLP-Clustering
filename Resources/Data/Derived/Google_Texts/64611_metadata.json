His son Mark contacted me with the news. He was a good friend, and I will sorely miss him.\n\nI\u2019ll write more when I have time to review his career, and I assume that there will also be an obit in the Times, where he once served on the editorial board. I first met Jerry in 1976, when the grad students at MIT and Harvard threw a celebration of the bicentennial of The Wealth of Nations. Jerry came, dressed up in a frock coat and wig, and delivered a series of economics one-liners; I was one of the joke-writers. He wrote up the experience for New York magazine, and I\u2019ll see if I can find it.\n\nIt shocks me, however, that I never knew that he coined the joke \u201cAssume a can opener.\u201d\n\nJerry had an amazing career and life. He wrote books about business and economics that were both informative and fun; he had a terrific TV show, \u201cAdam Smith\u2019s Money World\u201d; and he branched out in many ways. I loved his book Powers of Mind, about his journey through mysticism and alternative lifestyles \u2014 not what you expect from someone who also writes about money!\n\nI reconnected with Jerry when Robin and I moved to Princeton; it turned out that he and his wife Sallylived nearby, and we became very good friends.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to say, and I\u2019m tearing up. So consider this just a sad announcement, a placeholder for more to come.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140103100124, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 3, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Jerry Goodman Is Dead ( 20140103 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "A friend, gone too soon.", "title": "Jerry Goodman Is Dead", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/jerry-goodman-is-dead/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "A friend, gone too soon.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 3, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1388761284, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-01-03T15:01:24-05:00"}, "utime": 20140103150124, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140103, "pdate": 20140103, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "A friend, gone too soon.", "title": "Jerry Goodman Is Dead", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/jerry-goodman-is-dead/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/jerry-goodman-is-dead/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Jerry Goodman Is Dead", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd47c\"", "article_summary": "Jerry Goodman, better known under his nom de plume Adam Smith, has died of complications related to cancer.\nJerry came, dressed up in a frock coat and wig, and delivered a series of economics one-liners; I was one of the joke-writers.\nI first met Jerry in 1976, when the grad students at MIT and Harvard threw a celebration of the bicentennial of The Wealth of Nations.\nI reconnected with Jerry when Robin and I moved to Princeton; it turned out that he and his wife Sallylived nearby, and we became very good friends.\nHe wrote up the experience for New York magazine, and I\u2019ll see if I can find it."}
