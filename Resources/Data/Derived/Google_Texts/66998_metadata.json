They have been identified as Jonathan Lawrence Green, Jose Luis Hernandez and Jose Angel Martinez Jr., all 25 years old. Green was driving the car.\n\nHernandez is a local rapper and goes by the name \"Low Key.\" He has performed at several local venues, including Celebrity Theatre.\n\nAt this point it's not known why the driver failed to stop at the red light. Police said that is part of the ongoing investigation.\n\n\"We're assessing everyone involved as much as we can to find out if there was any alcohol any impairment involved, at this point we've not determined that alcohol is a factor as far as the driver of the SUV,\" Holmes said.\n\nHe went on to say the driver did admit to running the red light and was detained. He has since been released pending biological testing, Holmes said. Charges are pending.\n\n\"He is facing charges anywhere from possible manslaughter to vehicular homicide,\" Holmes said.\n\nThe intersection was closed for several hours and reopened around 10 a.m.\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
