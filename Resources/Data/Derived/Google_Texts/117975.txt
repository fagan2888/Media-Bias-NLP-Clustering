Re: “Why Bowe Bergdahl faces a worse charge than desertion,” Dec. 20 Noah Feldman column.

Noah Feldman’s suggestion that “misbehavior before the enemy” is an obscure charge does not acknowledge the articles regarding Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl that have already been reported but now seem to be suppressed. Any citizen or soldier who has knowingly assisted to “aid and abet the enemy” may be charged with “misbehavior” or “treason.” The penalty for treason can be more severe than misbehavior.

The early reports of Bergdahl’s aiding his captors in undermining armed forces’ security are no longer being discussed — and most likely for good reason, namely security. I do not doubt that the military knows much more than the press about Bergdahl’s “misbehavior” before the enemy. Feldman could be correct that Bergdahl won’t be charged with “misbehavior.” However, the investigation could also escalate to the charge of treason as well. Let’s see what the Army finally decides.
