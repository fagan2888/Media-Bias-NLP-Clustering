The degree will allow Zamora-Flores to act as a primary care provider for patients at Edinburg Children\u2019s Clinic, where she has worked since 2001.\n\nThe Edinburg native said that she wanted to earn her DNP because she believed in its purpose and approach.\n\nZamora-Flores said the DNP program brings a \u201cmore holistic approach\u201d to nursing assessment and decisions \u2014 looking at a patient\u2019s family and background, or, economic factors such as whether they have electricity or running water.\n\n\u201cThose things matter when you\u2019re making a decision or trying to determine why a patient isn\u2019t getting well, whereas the physician model tends to be a bit more focused on the patient at that moment in time,\u201d she said.\n\nA DNP degree also has a strong focus on management of a practice, including creating a timely flow of patients, understanding and explaining the Affordable Health Care Act and incorporating new information systems such as electronic medical charts. That gives them more access and decision-making power in their treatment, Zamora-Flores said.\n\n\u201cIn the DNP program, we put a lot of emphasis on what\u2019s called \u2018patient-centered care\u2019 where the patient has to be a key player in decisions regarding their health, and have access to their health information,\u201d she said.\n\nThe DNP program is not offered at any colleges in the Valley. But with the new University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley medical school\u2019s creation, Rodriguez said, administrators expect to begin enrolling students in a DNP program in 2017.\n\n\u201cUT-RGV has a vision for research,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWe want our university to be on the map as far as research is concerned. We want it to be on the map for scholarship as well, and inter-professional education.\u201d\n\nRodriguez said research at the UTPA Border Health Office has made a direct impact improving patients\u2019 care \u2014 not just locally, but throughout Texas. The office was charged by the state legislature in 1999 to develop a program wherein school nurses would screen for Acanthosis Nigricans, a condition where the skin on the nape of the neck darkens, an indicator of insulin resistance and diabetes.\n\n\u201cUTPA Border Health Office was instrumental in getting legislation for school nurses in Texas to screen for this marker,\u201d she said.\n\nTitles aside, both women agreed that the point of the DNP, as for all nurses, is to make people well \u2014 whether on a micro- or macro-scale.\n\n\u201cTo be a nurse, you have to love people, Rodriguez said. \u201cYou have to like to work with people. You have to have compassion.\n\n\u201cYou have to care to be a nurse. Not everybody can do it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Valley Morning Star", "description": "You can call Dora Zamora-Flores \u201cdoctor,\u201d but don\u2019t mistake her for a professor or physician.", "title": "Meet Dr. Nurse: Dora Zamora-Flores", "url": "http://www.valleymorningstar.com/news/slice_of_life/article_e498a95a-edf1-11e3-8d19-0017a43b2370.html", "image": "http://www.aim-ads.com/multimedia-themonitor-com/wwwroot/star_icon.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@valleystar", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 333523476743065}, "keywords": "slice_of_life", "google-site-verification": "BXTS2lONfpmhbwkgYeWd5fN5Kfc5F3ATaP0EA89JLjA", "news_keywords": "slice_of_life", "description": "You can call Dora Zamora-Flores \u201cdoctor,\u201d but don\u2019t mistake her for a professor or physician."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8249\"", "article_summary": "The DNP program is not offered at any colleges in the Valley.\nBut with the new University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley medical school\u2019s creation, Rodriguez said, administrators expect to begin enrolling students in a DNP program in 2017.\nShe is now one of 10 nurses in the Rio Grande Valley with the distinction, according to University of Texas-Pan American assistant professor Melinda Rodriguez.\n\u201cUTPA Border Health Office was instrumental in getting legislation for school nurses in Texas to screen for this marker,\u201d she said.\nThe degree will allow Zamora-Flores to act as a primary care provider for patients at Edinburg Children\u2019s Clinic, where she has worked since 2001."}
