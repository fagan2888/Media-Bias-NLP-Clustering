The HPV vaccine helps prevent several forms of cancer, including cervical cancer, a particularly important advance in Florida, which has one of the highest rates of cervical cancer in the country.\n\nNearly a decade later, the vaccine\u2019s promise is far from fulfilled.\n\nVaccination rates remain low nationally, with Florida near the bottom. According to 2013 statistics, 50 percent of girls ages 13 to 17 in Florida had received the first dose of the vaccine, which is given in a three-dose regimen. Only 34 percent of girls in the state had completed all three doses.\n\nFor Florida boys age 13 to 17, 29 percent had received the first dose in Florida, and only 13 percent had received all three doses.\n\nThe medical community, including Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, is working hard to dramatically raise those rates in the next five years, to an 80 percent rate in both girls and boys for all three doses.\n\nOne tactic: More of an emphasis on HPV as a vital tool in preventing cancer, and less emphasis on sex.\n\nThe vaccine does target cancers that are transmitted through sexual activity, a connection that has turned off some parents who were concerned vaccinating their children was tantamount to telling their children it was OK to have sex.\n\n\u201cIt was put forth very much in the popular press as a vaccine against a sexually transmitted infection rather than how we should be presenting this vaccine, which is a vaccine against cancers of many different types which are associated with HPV,\u201d said Susan Vadaparampil, senior member at the Moffitt Cancer Center\u2019s Division of Population Science.\n\nSome pediatricians and family doctors haven\u2019t done a good enough job of reaching out to their patients and their parents to convince them of the safety and the benefits of the vaccine, said Debbie Saslow, the director of the Breast and Gynecologic Cancer for the American Cancer Society.\n\nThe HPV vaccine helps prevent cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer in females and penile cancer in males. The vaccine can prevent anal and mouth and throat cancer in both males and females.\n\n\u201cThere is a disconnect with the public, but there\u2019s a bigger disconnect with the providers,\u201d Saslow said.\n\nPediatricians know the childhood diseases, such as mumps, measles and chickenpox, Saslow said. But the HPV virus doesn\u2019t manifest into cancer until a person is an adult.\n\n\u201cThey (pediatricians) have the ability to prevent cancer in these kids, but the cancer is not happening until the kids are adults,\u201d Saslow said. \u201cSo there is that disconnect.\u201d\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends giving the vaccine as early as age 11 or 12 so the recepient has time to develop an immune response before becoming sexually active, but because the virus doesn\u2019t become cancer until adulthood, pediatricians and patients may think that inoculating the child with the HPV vaccine can wait, Saslow said.\n\n\u201cThey view the HPV vaccine as either optional or something that can wait another year or two or three,\u201d Saslow said.\n\nThere are other barriers that prevent the conversation about HPV vaccine between doctor and patient, experts said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of competing demands for a provider\u2019s attention,\u201d Vadaparampil said. \u201cThere are many things that are mandatory or must be done that have to, in essence, take priority over recommending the vaccine.\u201d\n\nGene Hiben, a Florida pediatrician for 20 years who is based in Temple Terrace, said he has had parents take their child out of his practice when he brings up the HPV vaccine.\n\n\u201cFrom my side of the table, sometimes there are certain communities or certain populations that are just flat out, \u2018No way, no how, you\u2019re never going to do this to my kid,\u2019\u201d Hiben said. \u201cYou run the risk (of upsetting) them to bring it up to them. If every time somebody is in with their kid I\u2019m pushing HPV vaccine, it will make people uncomfortable enough that they will go elsewhere. There are certain populations that you might back off just a little bit. They\u2019re not going to give in on this one, so you don\u2019t even mention it anymore.\u201d\n\nOverall, Hiben said, it is getting easier to discuss the topic than when the vaccine was first introduced. Hiben said most parents of the patients he sees now are willing to have their child receive the HPV vaccine.\n\nThe Moffitt Cancer Center has received a grant from the National Cancer Institute to help improve the state\u2019s HPV vaccination rate. The Moffitt Cancer Center hosted a conference earlier this month with health experts from throughout the country to address HPV, and the center has created a group, Partnership to Immunize Teens and Children Against HVP or PITCH, to create a strategy to increase HVP vaccination rates, Vadaparampil said.\n\n\u201cHPV is a very common sexually transmitted infection,\u201d Vadaparampil said. \u201cThe estimates are that at some point in their lifetime 80 percent of people will have had an HPV infection. Those folks where the infection remains and they don\u2019t clear it, there\u2019s the potential to develop HPV-related cancers.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine is recommended for females ages 9 up to 26 and for males ages nine up to 21. The target age to get vaccinated, however, is 11 to 12 years old for both males and females because the vaccine is most effective at that age, Vadaparampil and Saslow said.\n\nThe vaccine is administered in a series of three doses given within six months. The cost for each dose is about $130. Most insurance plans cover the vaccine shots. For children who are under insured or have no insurance, there is assistance through government plans, such as the Vaccines for Children Program, Vadaparampil said the goal of having 80 percent of adolescent boys and girls receive all three doses by 2020 is ambitious but doable.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of work to do in a relatively short amount of time,\u201d Vadaparampil said.\n\npatino@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7659\n\nTwitter: @jpatinoTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 25 Jan 2015 14:11:27 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 When a vaccine for the human papillomavirus was made available in 2006, doctors hailed it as a medical breakthrough.
