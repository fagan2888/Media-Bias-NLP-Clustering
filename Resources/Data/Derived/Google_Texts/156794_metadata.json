Those videos have raised questions about whether Planned Parenthood is selling aborted fetal body parts to researchers for profit.\n\nDavid Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, called Planned Parenthood\u2019s policy change an \u201cadmission of guilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor three months, Planned Parenthood has tried to pass off its baby-parts-for-money scheme as totally legitimate,\u201d Daleiden said in a statement. \u201cToday, Planned Parenthood\u2019s latest PR stunt of so-called \u2018policy\u2019 change is an admission of guilt.\u201d\n\nIn an Oct. 13 letter addressed to the National Institutes of Health, Planned Parenthood\u2019s president, Cecile Richards, called allegations against the group \u201ccategorically false\u201d and said the reason behind the policy change relating their tissue donation practice is to \u201ctake away any basis for attacking Planned Parenthood to advance an anti-abortion political agenda.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Richards said:\n\nIn order to completely debunk the disingenuous argument that our opponents have been using\u2014and to reveal the true political purpose of these attacks\u2014our Federation has decided, going forward, that any Planned Parenthood health center that is involved in donating tissue after an abortion for medical research will follow the model already in place at one of our two affiliates currently facilitating donations for fetal tissue research. That affiliate accepts no reimbursement for its reasonable expenses.\n\nDaleiden\u2019s statement argued that Planned Parenthood\u2019s action vindicated the Center for Medical Progress:\n\nIf the money Planned Parenthood has been receiving for baby body parts were truly legitimate \u2018reimbursement,\u2019 why cancel it? This proves what [the Center for Medical Progress] has been saying all along\u2014Planned Parenthood incurs no actual costs, and the payments for harvested fetal parts have always been an extra profit margin.\n\nWhile it is illegal to profit off the sale of aborted body parts, organizations can accept \u201creasonable\u201d reimbursements for such donations, according to The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Hans von Spakovsky. Currently, three congressional committees are investigating Planned Parenthood and its tissue donation practices.\n\nThe chairman for one of those committees, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, credited the House\u2019s investigative work for pressuring Planned Parenthood to make this change.\n\n\u201cThis is a good, tangible result of the collective efforts of the House in investigating Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Chaffetz, chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. \u201cIt is helpful in taking away some questions surrounding their transactions involving fetal tissue.\u201d\n\nChaffetz said his committee will continue its probe into the group and whether or not it should receive taxpayer subsidies. Aides for the two additional committees investigating Planned Parenthood, the Judiciary Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, also confirmed that their investigations will continue.\n\nIn the letter, Richards stressed her decision to change the policy surrounding tissue donation does not admit any wrongdoing, and that other abortion providers should not feel pressured to follow suit.\n\n\u201c[O]ur decision not to take any reimbursement for expenses should not be interpreted as a suggestion that anyone else should not take reimbursement or that the law in this area isn\u2019t strong,\u201d she said. \u201cOur decision is first and foremost about preserving the ability of our patients to donate tissue, and to expose our opponents\u2019 false charges about this limited but important work.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced today it would no longer accept reimbursements for tissue donated to researchers from aborted babies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced today it would no longer accept reimbursements for tissue donated to researchers from aborted babies.", "title": "Planned Parenthood\u2019s Policy Change \u2018Admission of Guilt\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/PPPolicy_101315.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-14T10:28:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1G3vde4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Planned Parenthood Federation of America announced today it would no longer accept reimbursements for tissue donated to researchers from aborted babies.", "title": "Planned Parenthood\u2019s Policy Change \u2018Admission of Guilt\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/PPPolicy_101315.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-10-13T14:39:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-14T10:28:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "planned parenthood, abortion, planned parenthood abortion, abortion, fetal tissue donation, cecile richards letter, NIH"}, "article_summary": "David Daleiden, founder of the Center for Medical Progress, called Planned Parenthood\u2019s policy change an \u201cadmission of guilt.\u201d\u201cFor three months, Planned Parenthood has tried to pass off its baby-parts-for-money scheme as totally legitimate,\u201d Daleiden said in a statement.\nThose videos have raised questions about whether Planned Parenthood is selling aborted fetal body parts to researchers for profit.\nThe chairman for one of those committees, Rep.
