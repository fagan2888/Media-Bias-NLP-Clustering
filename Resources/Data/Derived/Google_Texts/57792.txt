At least three people have been confirmed dead in Mississippi after multiple tornadoes swept through the state.

Greg Flynn, a spokesman for the Mississippi Emergency management Agency, says at least one death was confirmed in Marshall County Wednesday. He says there are reports of other deaths, but could not confirm any more.

An official says a 7-year-old boy was killed during a tornado Wednesday in Holly Springs, Mississippi.

Marshall County Coroner James Anderson says the child was inside a car with relatives when the storm picked up and tossed the vehicle.

He could not say how many others were in the car, but noted all were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. He did not have any further details about their conditions.

Flynn also reports more than 40 injuries in six counties but that number could rise as the night goes on.

The Benton County Sheriff's Office, which neighbors Marshall County, also confirmed at least two dead and between two and four people reported missing.

The Benton County Sheriff's Office says search-and-rescue crews are currently doing a house-by-house search to make sure residents are accounted for.
