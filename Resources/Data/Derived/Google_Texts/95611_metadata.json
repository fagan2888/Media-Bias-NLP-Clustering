At private colleges the total often exceeds $50,000 a year. The figure at public institutions is lower, of course, but the upward trajectory has been similar.\n\nBut travel to many schools with a college-age child and you\u2019ll quickly learn that a majority of students do not pay the sticker price. They get a tuition discount, and often a big one. So the actual average cost at any given institution is, well, a mystery.\n\nAnd if you want to know what your cost would be, you\u2019ve pretty much got to apply for admission.\n\nWe\u2019ve long wondered why some universities don\u2019t strike a blow for transparency by simply eliminating a great deal of the subsidy and reducing the sticker price to a figure closer to what the average student pays.\n\nIn other words, publicize a price that is actually meaningful.\n\nWell, it seems that administrators at some small colleges have had the same idea, according to The New York Times. At Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C., for example, tuition has been reset at \u201c$16,500, down 43 percent from the current year\u2019s published price of $29,000.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a tradeoff, of course. The tuition discount rate will drop from 56 percent to 25 percent, according to Converse\u2019s president. But presumably many students were getting discounts that took them only to the neighborhood of $16,500 anyway. Now they know up front what their families will need to come up with. No mystery. No anxiety while awaiting news regarding financial aid.\n\nIn most areas of the economy, providing a good product or service at a modest price is widely admired, but somehow the model was tossed aside in recent decades at many colleges. However, there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be restored.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "An accurate price tag on college tuition", "title": "An accurate price tag on college tuition", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/27/an-accurate-price-tag-on-college-tuition/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131227__OP28TUITIONp1-1.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131227__OP28TUITIONp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-27T17:20:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:38:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ffd\"", "article_summary": "Oh, sure, we all know what the published tuition is at any given institution, as well as room, board and assorted fees.\nThe trouble with the rising cost of college is that no one really knows what college costs.\nBut travel to many schools with a college-age child and you\u2019ll quickly learn that a majority of students do not pay the sticker price.\nAt Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C., for example, tuition has been reset at \u201c$16,500, down 43 percent from the current year\u2019s published price of $29,000.\u201dThere\u2019s a tradeoff, of course.\nWe\u2019ve long wondered why some universities don\u2019t strike a blow for transparency by simply eliminating a great deal of the subsidy and reducing the sticker price to a figure closer to what the average student pays."}
