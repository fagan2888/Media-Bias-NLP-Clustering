That is more than twice as much as the $154 a 27-year-old in Nashville would pay for the same type of policy, and the $138 for a similar person in Tucson.\n\nAcross all 34 insurance marketplaces run by the federal government, the average is $287, about 25 percent cheaper. The reason for the higher prices in some markets? Paltry competition, say Leemore Dafny and Christopher Ody from Northwestern University, and Jonathan Gruber of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Jackson has only two insurers on the marketplace: Humana and Centene. By contrast, four insurance companies slug it out on Nashville\u2019s exchange. In Tucson, there are eight.\n\nJackson\u2019s over-the-top premiums underscore one of the least-heralded shortcomings of the rollout of the Affordable Care Act: the scarcity of insurers on health plan exchanges, which is driving up the price of policies across the country.\n\nThe research by Ms. Dafny, Mr. Gruber and Mr. Ody, to be published by the National Bureau of Economic Research next week, concludes that premiums on the exchanges are 11 percent higher than they would be if all the health insurance companies that sell policies in each state had participated in the new markets for health plans.\n\nMore competition not only would lower premiums, but would also save the federal government money. It would spend $1.7 billion less in subsidies to low- and middle-income Americans buying policies on the health care insurance exchanges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHalf of the population in the states with health exchanges facilitated by the federal government is served by three insurers or fewer,\u201d Ms. Dafny said. \u201cTo have competition on the exchanges you need competitors.\u201d\n\nThe findings are somewhat perplexing, though. By law, 80 to 85 percent of premiums must be devoted to medical spending. Insurers don\u2019t have particularly large profit margins. They have no great incentive to charge customers through the nose.\n\nStill, as Ms. Dafny explains, in markets where there are few insurers competing for business, premiums could rise simply because insurers wouldn\u2019t drive as hard a bargain with hospitals to reduce costs. They could raise premiums to meet hospitals\u2019 demands, without losing customers to the competition.\n\n\u201cA concentrated provider market may be a factor underlying the high premiums,\u201d Ms. Dafny noted.\n\nOf course, you also need competition among providers.\n\nConsider Albany, Ga., which has the highest premiums of all the federally assisted markets, where the 27-year-old would pay $395. It has only one insurer, but also only one hospital. In 2011, the Federal Trade Commission failed to stop the merger of Phoebe-Putney Health System and Palmyra Park Hospital, creating a local monopoly. No matter how many insurers there were, the premiums would probably remain high.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140515112145, "twitter": {"description": "Paltry competition in some markets results in some areas charging much more for the same level of health insurance.", "title": "One Reason Health Insurance Premiums Vary So Much", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/upshot/why-health-insurance-premiums-vary-so-much.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002882051"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "portereduardo", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/upshot/why-health-insurance-premiums-vary-so-much.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002882051", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/upshot/why-health-insurance-premiums-vary-so-much.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 15, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Prices (Fares  Fees and Rates),Health Insurance and Managed Care", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Eduardo Porter", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By EDUARDO PORTER", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Paltry competition in some markets results in some areas charging much more for the same level of health insurance.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Paltry competition in some markets results in some areas charging much more for the same level of health insurance.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/eduardo_porter/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-05-15", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "published": "2014-05-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "slug": "16up-insure", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140515153740, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/upshot/why-health-insurance-premiums-vary-so-much.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Paltry competition in some markets results in some areas charging much more for the same level of health insurance.", "title": "One Reason Health Insurance Premiums Vary So Much"}, "pdate": 20140515, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002882051, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "One Reason Health Insurance Premiums Vary So Much", "col": "Health Policy Perspective", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "It would spend $1.7 billion less in subsidies to low- and middle-income Americans buying policies on the health care insurance exchanges.\n\u201cA concentrated provider market may be a factor underlying the high premiums,\u201d Ms. Dafny noted.\nA 27-year-old in Jackson pays $336 a month for the second-cheapest silver health plan on Mississippi\u2019s s federally run insurance marketplace.\nAcross all 34 insurance marketplaces run by the federal government, the average is $287, about 25 percent cheaper.\nConsider Albany, Ga., which has the highest premiums of all the federally assisted markets, where the 27-year-old would pay $395."}
