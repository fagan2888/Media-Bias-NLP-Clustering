A skier survived an avalanche he triggered Saturday morning on Berthoud Pass in Grand County, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center said.

He deployed his air bag and was not seriously injured, according to the report, which did not cite the skier’s name. The incident happened at 10:30 a.m. on the west side of Bethoud Pass.

The 200-foot slide on a 38-degree angle was estimated at 150 to 180 feet wide and more than 10 feet deep.

“A snowboarder entered first and stopped on a rock outcrop to watch the skier,” the report stated. “Skier was caught and carried but arrested half way down the path. Skier deployed airbag.”

Avalanches are common this time of year in the Colorado high country. The Boulder-based center had reports for five slides Saturday and at least two Sunday. Colorado leads the nation in avalanche deaths with 259 since 1950. Second is Alaska with 141, according to the center. Colorado’s high number is largely attributable to the recreational accessibility of the state’s mountains, officials have said.

There have been five avalanche-related deaths in Colorado since Nov. 21.

The last was on Jan. 7 southeast of the Vail Ski Area. Tony Seibert, the 24-year-old grandson of Vail co-founder Peter Seibert Sr., was killed on a backcountry skiing trip. Three others were injured in the slide.

Avalanche danger remains “considerable” in Vail and Summit County, the Front Front Range and Sawatch mountains, according to the Avalanche information center. The danger is rated as “moderate” in the Steamboat and Flat Tops area of northern Colorado, the northern San Juan Mountains in southern Colorado, as well as the Aspen, Gunnison and Grand Mesa areas.

The Avalanche Information Center urged backcountry travelers to be aware of their surroundings and exercise caution.
