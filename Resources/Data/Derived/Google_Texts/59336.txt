Today President Barack Obama held a rally at the White House for the Affordable Care Act. Toward the end of his speech, he appears to catch a woman — an Obamacare enrollee — on the verge of fainting. “This happens when I talk too long,” Obama quipped.

The woman tweeted afterward she began fainting because she is pregnant and diabetic. She thanked the president for catching her.
