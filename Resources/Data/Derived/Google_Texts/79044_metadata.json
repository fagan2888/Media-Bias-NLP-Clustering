The U.S. beat both easily in exhibition play this summer, then handled the Dominicans again during the group stage in Bilbao.\n\nCurry was just 4 for 17 overall in his first two games, though he shot the ball better over the next three. He saved his best performance for Barcelona, where the Americans are used to them.\n\nHe made consecutive 3s early in the third quarter when the Americans put away the game, the second coming as he was knocked down by a defender who was lucky not to be called for a foul.\n\nGustavo Ayon scored 25 points for Mexico, which won last year\u2019s FIBA Americas tournament to qualify and then advanced as the No. 4 team out of Group D despite a 2-3 record.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 Ayon played for the Atlanta Hawks last season but his season was cut short by right shoulder surgery in February. He is a free agent and showed enough footwork and shooting touch to warrant a look from someone else.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy about my own participation in this game but I know I have to keep working as a team, as a player,\u201d Ayon said through an interpreter.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t prevent what ended up as the usual American romp in Barcelona, where the Dream Team crushed the competition in the 1992 Olympics.\n\nThe Americans averaged 117.3 points and won by 43.8 points a game then at nearby Badalona, but expect things to be a little more difficult at the Palau Sant Jordi, where they would play through the semifinals before advancing to Madrid for the Sept. 14 championship game.\n\n\u201cThey won, so we just have to do the same thing,\u201d center Anthony Davis.\n\nDavis scored only four points and power forward Kenneth Faried had eight after they were the Americans\u2019 dominant players in the first round. The U.S. compensated by making 13 3-pointers, with their top three scorers all perimeter players.\n\n\u201cFor a few games I think our perimeter guys were just really trying to get Anthony off because we had not looked for him and the pendulum went too far, where we\u2019re looking at that too much,\u201d U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \u201cAnd today it\u2019s swinging more into the middle, and if we get that balance then we\u2019ll be a very good \u2014 we think we are a good offensive team \u2014 but we can be an outstanding offensive team if we get that balance.\u201d\n\nThe U.S., which had some poor starts in previous games, surged to a 13-2 lead. After Mexico answered with seven straight, the Americans pushed the score to 23-13 after one period. It stayed in double digits for nearly the entire second quarter, though Ayon had a 10-point period to keep the Americans from getting too far ahead, and it was 42-27 at halftime.\n\nCurry\u2019s consecutive 3s made it 50-27. He had back-to-back baskets again later in the third, including a layup for his only one inside the arc, before DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 basket made it 57-30.\n\nDespite being bordering countries, the teams hadn\u2019t met since the 2007 Olympic qualifying tournament. They hadn\u2019t played in the World Cup since 1967.\n\nJames Harden finished with 12 points for the U.S. Cousins, praised by Krzyzewski for another strong performance, made all five shots and had 11 points and seven rebounds off the bench. Nuggets forward Kenneth Faried had eight points and eight rebounds.\n\nFormer Lincoln High School stars Francisco Cruz, Jorge Gutierrez and Hector Hernandez started for Mexico. Cruz had six points and four rebounds, Gutierrez had seven points and three assists, and Hernandez finished with four rebounds.\n\nFollow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Briancmahoney", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Stephen Curry\u2019s 6 3s send US to FIBA basketball worlds quarters", "title": "Stephen Curry\u2019s 6 3s send US to FIBA basketball worlds quarters", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/06/stephen-currys-6-3s-send-us-to-fiba-basketball-worlds-quarters/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140906_113318_james-harden.jpg", "height": 525}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140906_113318_james-harden.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-06T11:30:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:37:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfade\"", "article_summary": "Gustavo Ayon scored 25 points for Mexico, which won last year\u2019s FIBA Americas tournament to qualify and then advanced as the No.\nCruz had six points and four rebounds, Gutierrez had seven points and three assists, and Hernandez finished with four rebounds.\nHe said his team is improving with every game, just as a similarly young U.S. squad did four years ago in winning gold in Turkey.\nThe U.S. beat both easily in exhibition play this summer, then handled the Dominicans again during the group stage in Bilbao.\nCurry was just 4 for 17 overall in his first two games, though he shot the ball better over the next three."}
