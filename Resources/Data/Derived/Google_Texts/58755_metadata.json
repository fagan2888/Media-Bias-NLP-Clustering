You\u2019re likely to be a lawyer \u2014 the leading profession for federal legislators \u2014 and most everyone hates lawyers, with a Pew survey finding that people rank them at the very bottom in contributing something to society. Is there anything you could do to generate more contempt?\n\nYes \u2014 sue somebody! The speaker of the House, John Boehner, has announced that Republicans in the House are likely to file suit against President Obama. They are doing this because he delayed parts of a law, the Affordable Care Act, that they have tried to repeal more than 50 times. If they win, business owners who have been given some breathing room from providing mandatory health care would have to quickly implement the very thing that Republicans say is a job-killing bullet to the economy.\n\nIt\u2019s head-spinning, all of it. We\u2019ve finally reached the point where the do-nothing, delay-everything, don\u2019t-even-allow-a-vote-on-measures-a-majority-of-Americans-favor Congress has reached its logical position. They will not legislate. But they will litigate.\n\n\u201cTheir big idea has been to sue me,\u201d the president said earlier this month, unable to sustain a giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019re spending time on.\u201d\n\nTo Boehner, the stunt, brought to you by the talk radio and Fox News wacko-sphere, is no laughing matter. He says the imperial president has governed by executive order, overstepping a Congress that will not govern by any order. Obama has issued 182 executive orders in his presidency, through the end of June. The tyrant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe sainted Ronald Reagan issued 381 executive orders. The benign Dwight Eisenhower rolled out 484 of them. And Calvin Coolidge \u2014 Silent Cal, hero of young fogies in bow ties, asleep at the presidential wheel \u2014 signed more than 1,200 executive orders. Sue \u2019em all, retroactively.\n\nSo far, legal experts have reacted to Boehner\u2019s potential lawsuit with the rhetorical equivalent of guffawing until their morning coffee runs out their noses. This might include Chief Justice John Roberts, who has sniffed at another political lawsuit because the plaintiffs lacked standing \u2014 that is, someone seeking \u201crelief for an injury that affects him in a personal and individual way,\u201d as Roberts wrote.\n\nEarlier this week, a federal judge appointed by George W. Bush threw out a lawsuit by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin against a health care provision, saying the Tea Party Republican had failed to show how he had been personally harmed by the law.\n\nSo, what Boehner needs is a plaintiff in a neck brace. Somebody fragile, and sympathetic-looking. He needs that person to be a member of Congress. And he needs that person to have suffered for lack of health insurance because of President Obama. The character played by Matthew McConaughey in \u201cThe Lincoln Lawyer,\u201d an operator who practiced law out of a car, had better stuff to work with than this.\n\nAnother problem: Republicans have complained for decades about \u201cactivist judges\u201d doing the work that legislators are supposed to do. Judges should be referees, not lawmakers or micro-managers. But here, Boehner would be asking a court to step in and require that President Obama\u2019s signature law be managed a certain way.\n\nPresidents routinely delay, modify or defer enforcement of certain laws. President George W. Bush decided \u2014 like some kind of monarch! \u2014 to waive penalty fees on seniors who missed a sign-up deadline for prescription drug coverage in 2006. He was ignoring a part of his own law. And what Wall Street-backed Republican is complaining about the many delays in implementing the Dodd-Frank Act?\n\nThat Bush appointee who threw out Senator Johnson\u2019s claim, Judge William C. Griesbach, sent a warning shot in Boehner\u2019s direction with his language. He wrote that \u201cdisputes between the executive and legislative branches over the extent of their respective powers are to be resolved through the political process, not by decisions issued by federal judges.\u201d\n\nThe political process. You know \u2014 votes and things, lawmaking. That would require the House to do something. Ha! A bill to raise the minimum wage will not even come up for a vote. Immigration reform is dead for the year, Boehner said recently \u2014 no vote allowed. Even a fellow Republican, Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, noted that if Boehner really wanted to do something to prevent the president from issuing more executive orders, he could, um, pass legislation.\n\nToo late for that. After next week, it\u2019s vacation \u2014 for all of August, and into September. That will be followed by another loooooong break, from the first week of October until Election Day in November. This will give Boehner\u2019s nonperforming lawmakers plenty of time to ask a dispirited electorate to return them so they can sit on their hands for another two years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe primaries this year have produced record-low turnout, because of voters who have gotten nothing from their politicians. We could sue them, with standing. Or we could do what they refuse to do \u2014 take a vote of real consequence.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20140725085306, "twitter": {"description": "We\u2019ve finally reached the point where the do-nothing, delay-everything Congress has reached its logical position.", "title": "Congress\u2019s Next Big Idea?
