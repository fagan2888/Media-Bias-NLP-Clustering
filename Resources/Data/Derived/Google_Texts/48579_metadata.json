Maggie Hassan announced she would run against GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte next year, Politico reported that despite this piece of good news in the Democrats\u2019 quest to retake the Senate, \u201ctheir path to victory is being blocked by potentially ruinous primary challenges in other key states.\u201d Pesky voters! Who let them in? More specifically:\n\nIn four key states, each among the Democrats\u2019 best bets to take over Republican seats, upstart challengers are mounting primary contests against the candidates party leaders feel have the best chance next November. In Ohio, 31-year-old Cincinnati City Council member P.G. Sittenfeld is challenging establishment-backed, 75-year-old former Gov. Ted Strickland. In Illinois, former Chicago Urban League president Andrea Zopp is challenging another establishment candidate, Iraq War veteran Rep. Tammy Duckworth. In Pennsylvania, former Rep. Joe Sestak, whose unconventional style has consistently irritated Washington Democrats, is taking on Katie McGinty, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of former Gov. Ed Rendell. And in Florida, liberal firebrand Rep. Alan Grayson is loudly attacking his House colleague Patrick Murphy, the establishment favorite, in the race for Marco Rubio\u2019s seat.\n\nIt would be oversimplifying things to portray these races simply as reflections of Bernie Sanders\u2019 challenge to Hillary Clinton, and nothing more. But given the dynamics of how top-down party endorsements and funding work, and the kind of grass-roots energy needed to challenge them, there is no denying that strong similarities are present.\n\nIn fact, when 78-year-old former Ohio governor Dick Celeste endorsed Sittenfeld recently, he directly invoked what was happening in the presidential race. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the presidential campaigns across the country is a growing level of discontent with party leadership in both parties. And I think it was a mistake for the Democratic Party of Ohio, for example, to make an early endorsement in the Senate race,\u201d Celeste said. \u201cPG Sittenfeld represents a fresh way of moving forward,\u201d he said, pointing to Sittenfeld\u2019s hands-on engagement in dealing with a multitude of urban issues.\n\n\u201cWhat we have here is a race between the future and the past,\u201d Celeste continued. \u201cWhen I say the past, I\u2019m talking about the Democratic Party itself. It is trying to operate in an old way. And that old way was insiders who tried to make decisions and insiders who tried to call the shots. And that\u2019s not what people want.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s different in the different races is sometimes striking\u2014both on the establishment side and amongst the outsiders, who in at least two cases could plausibly have been establishment picks. The strongest establishment candidate, in terms of r\u00e9sum\u00e9, is former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, who lost re-election in 2010, his last time on the ballot. The weakest, Kathleen McGinty, in next-door Pennsylvania, has never won a campaign before. She only ran once, coming in fourth in the 2014 Democratic primary for Pennsylvania governor, with 7.7% of the vote. The other two are two-term congressmembers who\u2019ve never run statewide. If it sounds like a motley crew for the establishment team, with no candidate truly in their prime, well, it is\u2014a further sign of how weak and ineffectual the party establishment is. That alone is reason enough to doubt the soundness of their reasoning, even on their own terms.\n\nIn contrast, party elders are spurning at least three progressive outsider candidates who have complementary strengths that could help anchor the Democratic Party\u2019s growth in years to come. In Ohio, as already suggested, P.G. Sittenfeld is the very epitome of a fresh face, a near-perfect embodiment of the promise that millennials can bring to politics, with a strong sense of how issues that Strickland barely seems to notice are intimately interrelated. Politico noted that \u201cNational Democrats were initially excited when he entered the contest earlier this year. His youth, relatively brief career in politics, his liberal stances \u2014 all set up strong contrasts with well-funded GOP Sen. Rob Portman,\u201d contrasts that are strikingly absent in Strickland, who last won an election a decade ago, having lost in 2010, when John Kasich defeated him in his re-election bid. In Florida, Alan Grayson already has a national reputation as an outspoken, no-nonsense progressive, though he\u2019s adopted a more subtle, get-things-done-incrementally approach in the current GOP-dominated House. Thus he\u2019s been both strikingly more progressive than Patrick Murphy\u2014the Republican-turned-Democrat the establishment is backing\u2014and more effective as well.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the party is shunning both Sestak\u2014a retired admiral who lost by just 2 percent in the GOP\u2019s 2010 wave election \u2013and John Fetterman, the Harvard-educated mayor of Braddock, whose fight to revitalize that Rust Belt town echoes powerfully with the message of Bernie Sanders, whom he has endorsed. In Illinois, though, Zopp\u2019s long experience\u2014in public policy, not politics\u2014is the sort of thing one expects the establishment to value, and perhaps if the establishment were still at the top of its game, they would have backed her\u2014or at least not endorsed someone else. The common thread throughout all these races is not only the inward-looking arrogance of decision-making without public input, but also the lack of any sort of long-term vision guiding party leadership. Even if their anointed candidates all won, it\u2019s extremely dubious they would advance the party\u2019s fortunes in the long run\u2014much less the people they are supposed to serve. Let\u2019s look at each of the four states in turn, to see what sorts of lessons could be learned.\n\nOhio: Sittenfeld vs. Strickland\n\nAt the most obvious level, this race pits an aging, backward-looking insider against a young, forward-thinking outsider. As Celeste said, it\u2019s \u201ca race between the future and the past.\u201d But the past also means an aging candidate significantly at odds with his party\u2019s voting base\u2014though with varying degrees of obfuscation\u2014who has repeatedly refused to debate his opponent\u2026 for good reason, it would seem.\n\nOn guns, Strickland bragged to a radio caller last year, \u201cAs a Congressman I had A and most of the time an A+ rating with the National Rifle Association.\u201d He went on to brag that he voted against the 1994 assault weapons ban that Ohio Gov. John Kasich voted for. As governor, he signed a so-called \u201ccastle doctrine\u201d law that was opposed by Ohio prosecutors and police chiefs associations, who said it would provide legal cover for bad guys hurting folks who had no intention of harming them. He also supported a bill that would allow firearms in family restaurants and bars \u2014 a measure opposed by police groups, which was blocked by the speaker of the state assembly at the end of the 2010 session. He now claims to have undergone a conversion, but even so he admitted, \u201cMy record is mixed and spotty and I could be criticized for that.\u201d\n\nOn the environment, Strickland got a 100 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters just one year out of 12 he spent in Congress, as opposed to seven years with scores in the 60s and 70s, and four in the 80s. He voted repeatedly for coal and fossil fuel subsidies (1993, 1994, 1997, 2001), against higher fuel economy standards (2001, 2003, 2005), and against protecting public forest lands (1999, 2000, 2003), along with a range of other anti-environmental votes.\n\nAlthough Strickland calls himself \u201cpro-choice,\u201d his record is more multiple-choice. He did score 100 percent twice on NARAL\u2019s scorecard, but also scored in the 30s twice, and 60 or lower five times. He cast multiple votes that would restrict abortion rights, including a 1998 vote to override a Clinton veto. As governor, he signed an abortion-ultrasound bill that drew anti-choice activists\u2019 praise.\n\nOn all three of these issues, Sittenfeld\u2019s progressive positions signal a clear-cut break with Strickland. He\u2019s pledged that he will only support a Supreme Court nominee who pledges to uphold Roe v. Wade. He\u2019s got a comprehensive agenda to reduce gun violence: first, by closing loopholes to make background checks truly mandatory; second, by holding gun manufacturers and dealers accountable; and third, by keeping violent weapons out of dangerous hands. On the environment, Sittenfeld has a proven leadership record on the city council, chairing the committee overseeing all environmental issues. When a GOP plan was launched to defund the city\u2019s Office of Environmental Quality (OEQ) as part of a cost-cutting plan, he alerted local activists to fight back, pointing out that \u201cOEQ saves tax-payers more money each year than the Department costs \u2014 so axing it would represent broken fiscal management and in no way be productive for our budget situation.\u201d Regarding global warming, he supports Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan, opposes the Keystone Pipeline, and says \u201cthe need to act has never been more urgent or more important.\u201d\n\nBut beyond these key issue positions, reflecting the vast majority of Ohio\u2019s Democratic base, Sittenfeld has a mature sense of how intricately different issues and ideas interweave and synergize with one another, based on his own lived experience. Before being elected to city council, Sittenfeld served as the assistant director of the Community Learning Center Institute, which played a key role in dramatically transforming the city\u2019s public schools. He described the result in a speech laying out his urban agenda last year:\n\nVirtually all of our schools are new. But instead of using them only during the school day \u2014 and then shooing the kids out of the building and into the streets \u2014 we\u2019ve turned them into bustling, round-the-clock community centers. Co-located health and dental facilities\u2026. adult education programs\u2026 and enhanced cultural and recreational opportunities have removed barriers to student learning, boosted academic achievement, and sparked broader neighborhood revitalization.\n\nRather than seeing education through the narrow lens of high-stakes testing of individual students, destroying neighborhood schools in the process, as has happened in Chicago and other major cities, Cincinnati\u2019s approach was the complete opposite, seeing education as the process of a whole community creating a better future by investing in its children holistically, synergizing different support systems that had previously been disconnected, or even absent. Similarly, a careful reading of his issue agenda shows a constant awareness of how different pieces of the progressive policy puzzle fit together.\n\nUnder the heading of \u201crebuilding the middle class,\u201d he says he will \u201cfight for a livable minimum wage, expanded overtime pay, better child care assistance, family leave, and paid sick days,\u201d and \u201creject bad trade deals that create an uneven playing field for American workers,\u201d pledging to \u201calways be steadfast in standing up for workers\u2019 rights, including collective bargaining,\u201d which Ohio Republicans have fiercely attacked since 2010. At the same time, he won\u2019t be pigeonholed as defending dying industries of the past, saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t rebuild the middle class by yearning for yesterday or clinging to a past that will never return. We must embrace innovation, champion change, and understand the tools of tomorrow, including ensuring fast, affordable internet for all Americans.\u201d\n\nHis positive stance toward innovation is reflected in other issue areas he stresses as well\u2014most notably education and the environment. And he has a detailed urban policy agenda, encompassing four major components: ending mass incarceration, improving police-community relations and better gun safety, jobs and economic opportunity, and improving urban schools and making college affordable. This is not a laundry list of issues in his view, but a tightly interrelated set of concerns. Being grounded in the reality of that interrelation is arguably Sittenfeld\u2019s greatest strength\u2014and given the nature of the Democratic Party\u2019s diverse constituency, it\u2019s just the sort of leadership strength the party desperately needs. \u201cAll of us want our best selves represented by who we cast a vote for,\u201d Celeste said. \u201cAnd I believe PG Sittenfeld represents the best of us.\u201d\n\nBut the party also needs leaders who can bring people together in different ways. And that\u2019s precisely where the outsiders excel over the anointed insiders in the other three states as well.\n\nFlorida: Grayson vs. Murphy\n\nIn Florida, the outsider, Alan Grayson, needs no introduction to most progressives. When he was first elected to Congress in 2008\u2014in a seat no Democrat had won in more than 20 years\u2014Grayson was known as the blogosphere\u2019s representative in Congress. When my old Open Left blogmate, Matt Stoller, posted an interview with Grayson at the site\u2014an interview conducted at Netroots Nation\u2014he wrote, \u201cUsually I have to push candidates to become more aggressive, in Grayson\u2019s case, he pushed me.\u201d Stoller became a senior advisor to Grayson after the election, but we were just one of many sites where his message resonated.\n\nBut Grayson\u2019s campaign announcement video presents a much broader view of who Grayson is, starting with a multi-ethnic, multi-racial working-class childhood in the Bronx, a childhood that helps explain why he\u2019s strongly reminiscent of earlier generations of Democratic activists, lawyers and politicians who never stopped fighting for the people they came from, even as they took on new struggles. Grayson was also seriously ill as a child, and was fortunate that his parents\u2019 union benefits included health care\u2014a gut-level reason he\u2019s such a strong advocate both for workers and union rights, and for universal healthcare.\n\nDuring the Bush years, he made a name for himself representing whistleblowers in the Iraq War. \u201cI\u2019m the attorney of record in every single case now pending in Federal court involving war profiteers in Iraq,\u201d he told Stoller in that interview. \u201cThe Florida civil rights association named me Humanitarian of the Year for my work in this regard, taxpayers against fraud named me lawyer of the year, and I\u2019ve been featured in Vanity Fair magazine, in media like CBS evening news, 60 minutes, and even Dailykos, imagine that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats keep losing Congress because they rally around lame centrists.
