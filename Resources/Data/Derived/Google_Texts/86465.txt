â€” A man was killed Saturday in a shooting at Lyon Park in Durham, according to police.

Officers responding to reports of gunshots on Lakewood Avenue just after 3 p.m. found Quaysean Tymeek Malachi, 20, of High Point, injured from a gunshot wound.

Malachi was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later, Durham police said. A second man was taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

John Edgerton, who lives near Lyon Park, said he heard multiple gunshots.

"I heard what sounded like a bunch of firecrackers," he said. "I counted at least six, but there could have been more. It happened really, really quickly."

Despite the shooting, Edgerton said his neighborhood is a safe one.

"The neighborhood has been very good and very safe," he said. "We have not had problems, but we do hear gunshots occasionally at night."

Edgerton said when he arrived at the shooting scene he saw police focusing a lot of activity by a car with its doors open. He said it also looked like officers were searching for something inside the park.

No charges have been filed.
