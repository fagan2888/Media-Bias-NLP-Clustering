Really? Even John McCain called him a \u201cwacko bird.\u201d This from the man who offered the Vice Presidential nomination to Sarah Palin! If McCain knows anything, it\u2019s his wacko birds.\n\nParadoxically, Toobin\u2019s case appeals to the prejudices of the \u201cliberal elites\u201d Cruz derides. It comes down to this: that but for an aberration in the light of reason, brought on by childhood indoctrination, he could have become a high-flying liberal \u2013 a Cuban-American Barack Obama. He had the right stuff.\n\nCruz is a graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law. Had he been a little older, he might have run into Michelle Robinson (later, Obama) on both campuses. In college he was a champion debater; in Law School he graduated magna cum laude.\n\nHe clerked for a federal Appellate Judge and later for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (William Rehnquist); he is well-connected in elite legal circles, not just conservative ones; he taught at the University of Texas Law School, much as Obama taught at the University of Chicago; and, though still very young, he has had a successful career arguing cases before various state and federal appellate courts and before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAnd did I mention that his wife is a Goldman-Sachs Vice President?\n\nLiberals can\u2019t just dismiss a man like that out of hand. The cream rises to the top, after all; even if, in this instance, the cream looks more like scum.\n\nScum is what Cruz peddles \u2013 to such an extent that even John McCain can\u2019t abide him. He is the GOP establishment\u2019s worst nightmare, the consummate Tea Party politician. No one in Washington is more Tea Partyish than he.\n\nTea Partiers love him, and the Republican leadership fears him. But, to the rest of the world, the man is a joke.\n\nThis is why New Yorker readers wouldn\u2019t be expected to take him seriously, and why Toobin thinks it important to set them straight. He wants them to understand that they have reason to fear him too.\n\nThe gist of his argument comes down to this: Cruz did well in schools right thinking liberals would kill to get their children into. Therefore, he can\u2019t be as much of a dunce as he seems.\n\nDespite the messenger, it is hard to disagree with the message. Cruz really is a walking joke; and since he is also smart, he could become a clear and present danger \u2013 a George W. Bush with brains and without a \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d bone in his body.\n\nThat joke of a man could make the Tea Party a joke to be reckoned with.\n\nIf that happens, it isn\u2019t only right-thinking liberals who should take heed. Everybody should. He could catapult the Tea Party into the White House.\n\nBut what exactly would that mean? Nobody really knows because the Tea Party only exists in the minds of those who identify with it or who vilify it from outside.\n\nDespite its name, it is not really a party. It is not even an organized faction. At most, it is a way of being a Republican; an uneasy way.\n\nTea Party politicians run in Republican primaries, never in Democratic ones; and when they win, they caucus with Republicans, not Democrats. But it is a marriage of necessity. It is the Tea Party\u2019s way of fitting into America\u2019s duopoly party structure.\n\nThanks to the decades long rightward drift of our politics \u2013 a process that has proceeded apace in the Age of Obama \u2014 there is not much light, at the policy level, between Tea Partiers and mainstream Republicans. Neither is there much light between mainstream Republicans and Democrats.\n\nIt is only at an ideological level that differences become apparent. In practice, though, this hardly matters. To the extent that our politics is ideologically driven, it is Tea Party ideology, such as it is, that sets the agenda \u2013 for Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nIt is therefore remarkable that our political scene is as polarized as it has become. Principled political disagreements do not explain the phenomenon. The reasons are more psychological and sociological than political.\n\nIrrational feelings of hostility on the part of persons who unjustifiably feel aggrieved, Nietzsche\u2019s name for this was ressentiment, and anxieties arising out of social dislocation in a world where white-Anglo supremacy seems threatened and where gender norms are in flux, give rise to intensely felt animosities.\n\nThe Tea Party demographic is particularly afflicted.\n\nTheir peculiar animosities energize the Tea Party, but they don\u2019t define it. The Tea Party defines itself \u2013 through a process of self-identification.\n\nIn Congress, there is a Tea Party caucus that Republican legislators join if they wish. Throughout the country, there are grass roots and astro turf organizations that similarly self-identify. And there are unaffiliated individuals.\n\nThey don\u2019t exactly share a common ideology; that would require a degree of thoughtfulness that Tea Party anti-intellectualism excludes. But there are identifiable ideological motifs around which self-identified Tea Partiers gravitate.\n\nThe dominant inflection is libertarian. But Tea Party libertarianism is more visceral than philosophical. Tea Partiers talk an earful about freedom, but what they really want is freedom from government interference in areas that matter to them.\n\nGun ownership matters to them; many of them evidently feel that their identity is somehow bound up with guns. They also care about freedom from government regulations that impede the ability of the rich to enrich themselves further.\n\nOn the other hand, they care very little about the public good, and even less about equality. Neither do they care about well-established scientific findings that conflict with their fervently held, unjustified, false beliefs.\n\nThus many, maybe most, Tea Partiers do not believe that human beings are the principal cause of global warming, notwithstanding overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Since they run for office in general elections, and since they understand that outright denial is too preposterous for public consumption, Tea Party leaders often claim only that the evidence is inconclusive \u2013 intimating that science-based government programs are ploys that \u201cliberal elites\u201d use to keep true Americans down.\n\nTea Party libertarianism is so ungrounded that it is easy for reactionaries with deep pockets to turn Tea Partiers into \u201cuseful idiots.\u201d\n\nAuthentic, principled libertarians defend what the philosopher Robert Nozick called \u201ccapitalist acts between consenting adults.\u201d Tea Party libertarians are not much interested in that: their political consciousness is so warped that they care more about the well being of capitalists themselves.\n\nThe richer they are, the more Tea Partiers look out for their pecuniary interests \u2014 notwithstanding the cultural contradictions that keep plutocrats and rank-and-file Tea Partiers socially apart. \u201cFalse consciousness\u201d is rife in Tea Party circles.\n\nThe arbitrary and selective nature of Tea Party libertarianism is nowhere more evident than when Tea Partiers inveigh against \u201cBig Government.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t all arbitrary because there are a few genuine libertarians within the Tea Party fold who are consistent enough not to be on board with America\u2019s overseas predations \u2013 on the grounds that states given over to war and preparations for war inevitably interfere with the workings of beneficent market mechanisms.\n\nThis is hardly an anti-imperialist reason, but the conclusion they draw from it has much the same effect. In this, they are nearly alone among politicians at the national level. These Tea Partiers put the neocons and liberal interventionists of both major parties to shame.\n\nHowever, most Tea Partiers are fine with imperialism, and with a big military and an ever-expanding national security state. They only take umbrage when they feel that their privacy rights or their economic machinations or their obsessions (for example, with guns) are in jeopardy.\n\nTheir view of gun rights is particularly revealing. They fetishize the Second Amendment \u2014 or rather the bizarre, absolutist interpretation of it advanced by right-wing jurists \u2013 that leads them to conclude that laws regulating gun ownership are abominations unto Heaven.\n\nBut their faith in Constitutional inerrancy and in the sanctity of the original meaning of the Constitution\u2019s words \u2014 as if that were something that can actually be ascertained except in trivial cases \u2014 falters when it comes to such Constitutionally mandated matters as, say, requiring a declaration of war before taking military action or, for that matter, keeping the postal system afloat.\n\nTea Partiers are also averse to state programs that advance the well being of the least well off, especially when they are not white. In this respect, the Tea Party is like many other right-wing political movements throughout the world. It has a xenophobic, nationalistic and, more or less explicitly, racist tinge.\n\nThis is why government programs that ameliorate the hardships undocumented immigrants and racial minorities face draw their special ire. And because they think, incorrectly, that they mainly benefit persons of color, they target welfare state programs too and even labor unions.\n\nWhen pressed, they will say that institutions concocted to make less well-off people better off are counter-productive; that instead of improving the lot of their intended beneficiaries, they make their situation worse. Toobin quotes Cruz making precisely this claim. In the end, though, it comes down to this: most Tea Partiers really really don\u2019t like people who are different from them.\n\nThis attitude is not inherently anti-libertarian. But neither is it libertarian in spirit. Public policies that give expression to Tea Party animosities can \u2013 and often do \u2014 defy the demands of economic rationality.\n\nMost Tea Partiers probably do believe that well-intended state interventions that contravene \u201cmarket logic\u201d typically backfire. But this is not why they want, for example, to militarize the Mexican border. The reason for that is obvious: they want to keep Mexicans and Central Americans out.\n\nTea Partiers call themselves \u201cconservative,\u201d and liberals generally agree. The conventional wisdom has it that there is no force more conservative in American politics.\n\nBut \u201cfree market\u201d libertarianism and conservatism pull in different directions: the one promotes unrelenting change; the other favors stability and order.\n\nMoreover, genuine conservatisms have a hierarchical flavor. In the conservative vision, underlings are deferential to their superiors, and persons at the top exercise a kind of natural authority.\n\nLibertarianism, on the other hand, assumes a social order in which nearly everything is for sale and in which everyone has or ought to have an equal right to engage in market transactions. Deference and noblesse oblige are out; property rights in everything that can be privatized, along with exchange relations governed by contract or functionally equivalent norms, are in.\n\nThe Tea Party also has a theocratic streak. It is not clear how well it coheres with Tea Party libertarianism or with the ressentiments Tea Party rank-and-filers evince, but, at least superficially, it does connect with conservative theory and practice to a degree that the Tea Party\u2019s other ideological motifs do not.\n\nEven this connection is attenuated, however, because Tea Party religiosity derives mainly from radically individualistic religious movements. Max Weber famously argued that aspects of Protestant theology gave rise, centuries ago, to \u201cthe spirit of capitalism\u201d \u2014 and therefore aided in the flourishing of the most destabilizing social and economic order in the history of the world. The Pentecostal and non-mainstream Protestant faiths of many Tea Partiers have a similar cast.\n\nIn Europe and Latin America, and wherever else the Roman Catholic Church or High Church equivalents in other denominations succeeded in implanting themselves, religion became a major force for social order. This is why conservatives traditionally uphold their institutional structures and styles of religious expression.\n\nAnd it is why the Church (whatever church it may be), along with the patriarchal family and the authoritarian state, has served as a bulwark against the untrammeled \u2013 and potentially devastating \u2013 free expression of human nature.\n\nIn modern times, these same institutions also help counter the socially destabilizing consequences of the capitalist mode of production and the form of civilization it sustains.\n\nTo be sure, there are plenty of right-wing Catholics in the Tea Party, but, in the main, Tea Party enthusiasms are low Church \u2014 hardly subversive, but not particularly stabilizing either.\n\nTherefore, even in this respect, there is hardly anything conservative about the Tea Party. If Tea Partiers call themselves \u201cconservatives,\u201d it may just be because they haven\u2019t a clue what conservatism is or what their own political convictions are about.\n\nSurely, this must have dawned on Ted Cruz of Princeton and Harvard Law.\n\nThis is why it is tempting to say that he doesn\u2019t really believe what he preaches, and that he is opportunistically tapping into the base sentiments of benighted voters \u2013 in order to advance his own political career.\n\nBut if there is evidence of this, there is no sign of it is so far in the public domain; certainly, Toobin offered none.\n\nIt is likely, therefore, that Cruz is what he claims to be \u2013 a true believer. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time that a clever mind undertook in all sincerity to defend ludicrous positions. The history of theology offers countless examples.\n\nBut we should not abandon the opportunism hypothesis just yet.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t hard for plutocrats to realize what the Tea Party could do for them. Why wouldn\u2019t careerist politicians draw similar conclusions?\n\nMaybe a lot of them do. There is Michele Bachmann, of course, and plenty more where she came from; but they can\u2019t all be as dumb as the politics they promote. If there is a percentage in seeming idiotic, count on schemers to figure out how to make the most of it.\n\nVery little is known, for example, about David Brat, the economics professor at Randolph-Macon College who defeated Eric Cantor, one of the most powerful \u2013 and noxious \u2013 pillars of the Republican establishment.\n\nCantor\u2019s defeat got a lot of media attention; Brat himself got hardly any at all. But, from what is known, there is reason to think that he might indeed be cut from the same cloth as Cruz.\n\nHe has a theology degree from the Princeton Theological Seminary and a Ph.D. in economics from American University. Getting to the Tea Party from these places is as unlikely as by Cruz\u2019s route.\n\nThe former is a stronghold of the (theologically and politically liberal) Presbyterian Church, the largest Protestant denomination so far to divest from corporations involved in the Israeli occupation of Palestine. The AU economics department is among the most left leaning in the United States.\n\nOne would think that, like Cruz, he would know better than to follow the path of least enlightenment. Maybe he does.\n\nBrat is too much an unknown quantity to say where he stands compared to Cruz. However, he could hardly be more rightwing because there is no room to Cruz\u2019s right. It may be relevant too that, in addition to campaigning against immigration, he also took aim at Wall Street and at Washington\u2019s fondness for crony capitalism.\n\nBut this hardly matters inasmuch as the two of them seem to be brothers under the skin \u2014 two smarties, at least by prevailing Congressional standards, who uphold positions that no one with any smarts at all would ever seriously consider.\n\nIt would be surprising if there aren\u2019t more like them under the broad Tea Party tent.\n\nBut even if they are the only ones, and even if they are not rank dissimulators \u2013 in other words, if they honestly believe what they say they believe \u2014 Toobin is right, though for the wrong reason \u2013 they should not be underestimated.\n\nThere is nothing smart about the positions they favor. And it hardly matters how clever they are or how good they were at school. They are smart in a different way. They know how to prevail, even when they lose; they know how to get their way.\n\nAnyone paying attention to how Republicans, not just Tea Partiers, have been operating since Barack Obama took office \u2013 or to how they operated, less blatantly, when Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton were in their crosshairs \u2013 would see that there is a method to their madness.\n\nThey have been acting on the maxim that unflinching obduracy works.\n\nThis is awful for governance \u2014 except in matters pertaining to the military and the national security state, Republicans have made the American government dysfunctional. Their obduracy doesn\u2019t even help them win elections \u2014 except in jurisdictions where there is a preponderance of retrograde voters.\n\nObduracy therefore still works in Texas; that will only change when that state\u2019s Hispanics assert themselves more effectively. And, thanks to gerrymandering, it works in Virginia\u2019s seventh Congressional district. In more \u201cnormal\u201d cases, it doesn\u2019t work at all; it is a losing strategy.\n\nExcept for one thing: for affecting policy \u2013 in other words, for what politics is ultimately about. For that, there is nothing better \u2013 not in a world where Democrats fear Republicans, Republicans fear their base, and the President remains pathologically aloof.\n\nThe Tea Party gets its way, whether or not Tea Partiers win elections, because it controls the agenda; and it controls the agenda because, in America today, implacable obstinacy works. The more obdurate one is, the more powerful.\n\nRepublicans figured this out long before Ted Cruz or David Brat. The Tea Party only perfected the strategy.\n\nBut because they brought obduracy to a level that is almost sublime, it is fitting to name the strategy after them. Lets therefore call it Tea Party smarts; it\u2019s about knowing how and when to concede nothing, come what may.\n\nTed Cruz exemplifies this cast of mind, and it has brought him far. This is what caught Toobin\u2019s attention, and what he set out to explore and to warn liberals about.\n\nHis article would have been more enlightening had he focused more on how inept Cruz is at implementing the strategy he epitomizes; how he tends to overplay his hand.\n\nThe 2013 government shutdown that Cruz engineered to defund Obamacare is a case in point. It backfired. This is what earned its author the \u201cwacko bird\u201d epithet.\n\nCruz outsmarted himself then. But, to this day, he will not concede the point. He remains too obdurate for that \u2014 or too much the well-launched, self-assured Ivy League lawyer.\n\nIn the end, though, Cruz hardly matters, notwithstanding Toobin\u2019s warning.\n\nWhat matters is that Tea Partyers, energized by their animosities and guided by vague but debilitating ideological commitments, have figured out how to stop opponents in their tracks and, more important, how to set the political agenda. With or without Cruz and his ilk, they have the smarts to do that.\n\nThis is what is truly worrisome; and what we underestimate at our peril.\n\nANDREW LEVINE is a Senior Scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, the author most recently of THE AMERICAN IDEOLOGY (Routledge) and POLITICAL KEY WORDS (Blackwell) as well as of many other books and articles in political philosophy.
