But cutting the ranks of the uninsured \u2014 a chief goal of health care reform \u2014 has apparently not led to the expected decline in visits to hospital emergency rooms.\n\nThe American College of Emergency Physicians \u2014 commonly known as the ACEP \u2014 recently polled 2099 of its members and found most are busier than ever.\n\nThree-fourths of those polled said emergency visits are way up. That\u2019s a big increase since 2013 when less than half reported increases.\n\nThe surge runs contrary to predictions made when the Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, that fewer patients would end up in the ER because they would have greater access to primary and preventative care through private insurance and Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWhat we have come to learn is, unfortunately, the Medicaid card does not at all equal timely access to care,\u201d says Dr. Orlee Panitch, an ER doctor with MEPHealth in Germantown, Maryland and chair of the ACEP\u2019s Emergency Medicine Action Fund, which commissioned the poll.\n\nA December 2014 report by the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services says over half of all Medicaid patients have to wait at least two weeks to get a doctor\u2019s appointment, and over a quarter have faced wait times of more than one month.\n\nPanitch says because of these wait times \u2014 and in some cases concerns about co-pays and deductibles \u2014 many Medicaid patients are putting off medical care until they hit crisis mode and end up in the ER.\n\nThat is a big reason why so many of the doctors polled said they are seeing much sicker patients than ever before.\n\nPanitch says another problem is \u201cthe baby boomers who are aging \u2014 and who have multiple chronic medical problems.\u201d\n\nAt one point it was thought the rise of urgent care centers, retail clinics and even medical help lines might curb ER use, but Panitch says that hasn\u2019t been the case.\n\n\u201cThe urgent care settings have a wonderful service to provide for the care that doesn\u2019t require the heavy lifting,\u201d says Panitch, adding these care centers routinely send patients on to the nearest emergency department.\n\nShe says policy makers dealing with the intricacies of the health care system need to understand the importance of 24/7 emergency rooms, emphasizing they are \u201cproviding a service to these sicker patients that cannot be done in the outpatient world.\u201d\n\nFollow @WTOP on Twitter and WTOP on Facebook.\n\n\u00a9 2015 WTOP.
