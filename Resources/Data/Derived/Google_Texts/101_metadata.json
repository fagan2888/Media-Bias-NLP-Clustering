President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande closed the French borders, declared a state of emergency, and announced that military and police units would be deployed around the city to prevent further attacks. He described the evening\u2019s atrocities as \u201ca horror,\u201d but called for calm and unity. In Washington D.C., President Barack Obama also made statements standing in unequivocal solidarity with the French government and its people. \u201cWe stand prepared and ready to provide whatever assistance the government and people of France need to respond,\u201d he said, as he pledged to \u201cdo whatever it takes to bring these terrorists to justice and go after any terrorist networks that go after our people.\u201d\n\nPerhaps one of the most important points drive home after the attacks was the dissonance present in President Obama\u2019s saying that these were \u201can attack on all of humanity and the universal values we all share.\u201d This, of course, begs the question: Whose humanity? Who has the privilege of being humanized? Why weren\u2019t the recent suicide attacks in Baghdad and Beirut also an attack on humanity?\n\nAs we collectively attempted to make sense of this horrific act of terror, the nature of the response was sadly predictable. ISIS would go on to claim responsibility for the attack, but even before preliminary death tolls had been confirmed, before the hostage situation at the Bataclan concert hall had ended or the identities of the attackers had been released, Islamist extremists had already been implicated. The BBC attempted to link the attacks to the European refugee crisis and deduced radicalized Syrian involvement; CNN also inferred the involvement of Islamists; and conservative Americans were crudely politicizing the attacks around open carry laws and mocking Black American student protesters. But where condemnation was speedy, a contextualization of pertinent cycles of foreign and European policy lagged dramatically.\n\nIn attempting to discuss both historical colonial and present neo-imperial European violence, many people expressed a non-desire to politicize the deaths. But how do we reconcile the dissonance in hastily naming a political perpetrator whilst refusing to analyze the motivations for their actions?\n\nIt is important to honor the individuals who were killed in these acts of violence, and central to honoring their deaths is ensuring that we understand why these attacks may have happened in an effort to prevent further human suffering. Thus, it is important to conceptualize these deaths as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d within the War on Terror. We are unused to classifying western deaths by terror attack as \u201ccollateral damage,\u201d because we are unused to situating ourselves within the paradigm of violence and unused to likening ourselves to similarly victimized Muslim civilians abroad. \u201cCollateral damage,\u201d in our detached wartime vocabulary, connotes unnecessary deaths: it is a term that normalizes both the dehumanization and expendability of the black and brown, foreign Muslim \u201cother.\u201d We cannot properly honor the deaths of Parisians killed in these terror attacks without analyzing our governments\u2019 understanding of the subsequent radicalization that has followed invasions and airstrikes in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria; drone strikes in Somalia, Pakistan, Lebanon, Yemen, and other countries; and the American bombing of the Doctors without Borders hospital in Afghanistan in October.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rush to fit the horrors of Paris into convenient neo-imperial narratives shows a disturbing lack of empathy", "author": "Zoe Samudzi", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The rush to fit the horrors of Paris into convenient neo-imperial narratives shows a disturbing lack of empathy", "title": "Why our conversations about Paris have been broken from the start", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/14/why_our_conversations_about_paris_have_been_broken_from_the_start/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/shutterstock_105530810-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The rush to fit the horrors of Paris into convenient neo-imperial narratives shows a disturbing lack of empathy", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/shutterstock_105530810-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Why our conversations about Paris have been broken from the start", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why our conversations about Paris have been broken from the start", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Islam, Islamophobia, Muslims, Paris, Paris Attacks, Racism, Religion, Terrorism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9386\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Islam, Islamophobia, Muslims, Paris, Paris Attacks, Racism, Religion, Terrorism, News, Politics NewsOn Friday, more than 100 people were killed in a coordinated series of terrorist attacks in the city of Paris.\nIn Washington D.C., President Barack Obama also made statements standing in unequivocal solidarity with the French government and its people.\nIn attempting to discuss both historical colonial and present neo-imperial European violence, many people expressed a non-desire to politicize the deaths.\nThus, it is important to conceptualize these deaths as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d within the War on Terror.\nAs we collectively attempted to make sense of this horrific act of terror, the nature of the response was sadly predictable."}
