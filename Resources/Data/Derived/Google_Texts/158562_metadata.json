He seemed especially irked by the idea of sending ground troops to battle ISIS.\n\n\u201cIf either one of you are elected this time around, and you talk about sending boots on the ground, you\u2019re talking about sending me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I do not appreciate that.\u201d\n\nMurphy, an independent with a libertarian bent, was the wildcard in the debate. On some issues, he sided with Pingree, a progressive Democrat, while on others he agreed with Misiuk, who usually but not always held the Republican Party\u2019s line.\n\nBoth Misiuk and Murphy said they\u2019d welcome the temporary construction jobs created by transporting tar sands through Maine. Pingree opposes the idea, citing environmental concerns and saying Maine should focus instead on renewable energy.\n\nOn the federal legalization of recreational marijuana use, it was Pingree and Murphy who aligned, both saying they\u2019d agree with legalization, while Misiuk was opposed.\n\nOn the Affordable Care Act, Murphy was the only candidate who said he\u2019d support House Republicans\u2019 efforts to repeal and replace the president\u2019s landmark 2010 health care reform bill. Misiuk said that while he opposed some of Obamacare, voting to repeal the law now, four years later, would be fruitless because the reforms contained in the act are too \u201centrenched.\u201d Pingree defended the act, though she said she didn\u2019t think it went far enough.\n\nThe only issue the candidates all agreed on was climate change: All three said they believe the threat of climate change is real and is caused by human activity.\n\nWhile the debate was at times lively, the dynamics of the race heavily favor Pingree. She is buoyed by the tide of liberal voters in the left-leaning southern district and by a significant polling and fundraising advantage over her two challengers.\n\nA University of New Hampshire poll commissioned by the Portland Press Herald late last month showed that Pingree\u2019s lead had only grown since its earlier survey in June, with Pingree leading Misiuk 66 percent to 13 percent, with Murphy barely moving the needle.\n\nOn the campaign finance front, Pingree\u2019s lead is similarly dramatic. By the end of June, when the last filing period ended, the Democrat was sitting on a war chest of more than $314,000. Misiuk had just $1,300 cash on hand, while Murphy\u2019s fundraising effort seems nonexistent.\n\nOutside groups also seem confident that little could be done to change the dynamics of the race: Not a single independent expenditure has been reported in the 1st Congressional District, according to the Federal Election Commission. Contrast that with the 2nd Congressional District, where a tight race has drawn more than $1 million in spending from third-party groups trying to tip the scales.\n\nThe three candidates for the 1st Congressional District will meet twice more for televised debates, first on Thursday, Oct. 9, on MPBN, and later in the month on WCSH-TV.\n\nFollow Mario Moretto on Twitter at @riocarmine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 The first of several debates by the candidates for Maine\u2019s 1st Congressional District revealed differing takes on subjects as varied as recreational marijuana and the best way to combat ISIS terrorists.
