Malave has said she is homeless and depended on panhandling to survive. Now that the panhandling effectively has been banned in the city, Malave spends some nights in a tent.\n\nA Charleston plan to drive away roadside panhandlers is working.\n\nIn the month since city police have been enforcing a new ordinance that effectively bans roadside begging, they have issued only two citations, said Charleston Police Department spokesman Charles Francis.\n\nCity leaders have said the ordinance was necessary because the practice posed a public safety hazard. But some advocates for the homeless say the ordinance doesn\u2019t do anything to help low-income residents, or get to the root causes of homelessness.\n\nThe ordinance, which Charleston police began enforcing on Sept. 18, prohibits anyone \u2014 including panhandlers, people collecting money for charities or those handing out religious fliers or selling newspapers \u2014 from passing items to or from the occupant of a vehicle on a roadway in a traffic lane.\n\nSo people making a donation, and those accepting it, are both violating the ordinance, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 days in jail and a $1,092 fine.\n\nDeputy Police Chief Tony Elder attributes the success of the ordinance to a 30-day education campaign that police launched soon after City Council gave the plan final approval. That campaign included officers talking to panhandlers and people who donate to them and explaining the ordinance, handing out cards that spelled out the rules and placing movable lighted billboards at key intersections announcing the day enforcement would begin.\n\n\u201cWe took the time to educate the public,\u201d Elder said. \u201cFor the most part, voluntary compliance was sought and given.\u201d\n\nAnd most people who responded to a call to the public on social media said they thought begging along roadsides had been eliminated, or nearly so. However, Patricia Cannon Fisher said she thinks the ordinance should be reversed. A lot of people have no empathy for people down on their luck, she said. \u201cIt bothers me that I live in a town where people are so cruel,\u201d she said. \u201cIt seems to me there truly is a war on the poor.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Wendell Gilliard, who is pushing for the state to do more for the homeless, said \u201cthe ordinance is not getting at the root of the problem.\u201d\n\nGilliard said he thinks growth and development are eliminating lower-income housing and pushing people out into the streets. And he\u2019s concerned about the growing number of \u201ctent cities\u201d he sees around Charleston.\n\nHe\u2019s planning to file a bill this year that would give a tax break to developers who replaced low-income housing that they eliminated to make room for development.\n\nHe also said he thinks people handing money to others to try to help them shouldn\u2019t face fines, and the ordinance\u2019s maximum fine of $1,092 is too high.\n\n\u201cCommon sense tells you the person panhandling doesn\u2019t have money for a fine,\u201d he said.\n\nRev. Gordon Cashwell, from the Without Walls Ministry, who works with many homeless people, said he knows people who have panhandled because they really need the money, and others who beg for money to feed addictions.\n\nIt\u2019s important \u201cnot to enable people to get comfortable in a self-destructive lifestyle,\u201d he said. But he thinks many people could do more to help others in need. For instance, he said, churches could do more to provide long-term housing opportunities.\n\n\u201cHanding money to people, I don\u2019t think that significantly helps them,\u201d he said. But now, we\u2019re pushing lower-income people out of the city, Cashwell said. \u201cIf we\u2019re just shifting people around, that\u2019s not what a successful city is.\u201d\n\nReach Diane Knich at (843) 937-5491 or on Twitter @dianeknich.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Education campaign helped stem Charleston panhandling before law took effect, police say, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Gordon Cashwell,Homelessness,panhandle,panhandling ordinance,Wendell Gilliard", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A Charleston plan to drive away roadside panhandlers is working.", "title": "Education campaign helped stem Charleston panhandling before law took effect, police say", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151017/151019443/education-campaign-helped-stem-charleston-panhandling-before-law-took-effect-police-say", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151017/PC16/151019443/AR/0/AR-151019443.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151017/PC16/151019443/AR/0/AR-151019443.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Charleston plan to drive away roadside panhandlers is working.", "title": "Education campaign helped stem Charleston panhandling before law took effect, police say", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151017/PC16/151019443/AR/0/AR-151019443.jpg?201510171918", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151019443}}, "keywords": "Education campaign helped stem Charleston panhandling before law took effect, police say , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Gordon Cashwell,Homelessness,panhandle,panhandling ordinance,Wendell Gilliard", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-17T17:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-17T19:18:00Z", "author": "Diane Knich"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Charleston plan to drive away roadside panhandlers is working."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7784\"", "article_summary": "Angela Malave, 56, of Greenwood used to beg for money daily at the foot of the Legare Bridge in Charleston.\nNow that the panhandling effectively has been banned in the city, Malave spends some nights in a tent.\nBut some advocates for the homeless say the ordinance doesn\u2019t do anything to help low-income residents, or get to the root causes of homelessness.\n\u201cCommon sense tells you the person panhandling doesn\u2019t have money for a fine,\u201d he said.\nCity leaders have said the ordinance was necessary because the practice posed a public safety hazard."}
