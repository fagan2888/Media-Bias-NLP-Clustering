On opening day I witnessed at least 50 people eating lunch in this stuff. They don\u2019t even have respect for their own customers.\u201d\n\nThe San Francisco Peaks are sacred to at least 13 tribes. For years they have been trying to stop the company that owns Arizona Snowbowl, outside Flagstaff, from using reclaimed wastewater for its artificial snow. But earlier this year, having persevered so far in court, the company contracted to buy treated sewage water for 20 more years.\n\nRELATED: San Francisco Peaks to Get 20 More Years of Sewage Snow\n\nThis may have contributed to a recent decision by businessman James Coleman to buy the facility, the Arizona Daily Sun said in an op-ed on November 28.\n\nOn opening day, 20 percent of the ski runs were sheathed in artificial snowpack, the Arizona Daily Sun said, with just three of 40 runs open and all of it made of wastewater, according to Indigenous Action.\n\nAside from the sacredness of the San Francisco Peaks, the potential dangers of using treated wastewater for recreational activities is also a concern. Flagstaff environmental officials are studying antibiotic-resistant bacteria, their presence in recycled wastewater and their impacts on human health, according to a September report in the Arizona Daily Sun.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The polar vortex has not made it to Arizona despite record low temperatures and storms elsewhere in the United States, and Thanksgiving weekend marked the second straight year t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/01/san-francisco-peaks-arizonas-snowbowl-opens-protests-over-thanksgiving-weekend-158078", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2012/02/San-Francisco-Peaks-e1328905237187.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "San Francisco Peaks: Arizona\u2019s Snowbowl Opens to Protests Over Thanksgiving Weekend"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/12/01/san-francisco-peaks-arizonas-snowbowl-opens-protests-over-thanksgiving-weekend-158078", "dc": {"title": "San Francisco Peaks: Arizona\u2019s Snowbowl Opens to Protests Over Thanksgiving Weekend"}, "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-01T16:30-05:00", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "San Francisco Peaks: Arizona\u2019s Snowbowl Opens to Protests Over Thanksgiving Weekend"}, "article_summary": "They don\u2019t even have respect for their own customers.\u201dThe San Francisco Peaks are sacred to at least 13 tribes.\nAside from the sacredness of the San Francisco Peaks, the potential dangers of using treated wastewater for recreational activities is also a concern.\nBut earlier this year, having persevered so far in court, the company contracted to buy treated sewage water for 20 more years.\nFor years they have been trying to stop the company that owns Arizona Snowbowl, outside Flagstaff, from using reclaimed wastewater for its artificial snow.\nThe polar vortex has not made it to Arizona despite record low temperatures and storms elsewhere in the United States, and Thanksgiving weekend marked the second straight year that the sacred San Francisco Peaks were coated in ski snow made from treated wastewater."}
