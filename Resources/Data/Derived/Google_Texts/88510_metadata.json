FEMA, for its part, agreed with the IG\u2019s recommendations and said it\u2019s already in the process of improving the system.\n\nThe flawed IT system is only the latest problem plaguing FEMA. The agency has long been scrutinized for its responses to previous disasters, especially when it comes to administering financial relief.\n\nJust last week, an IG report revealed that auditors who are still reviewing Hurricane Katrina aid relief (from nine years ago) found at least $4.7 million in federal grants for victims in Mississippi had either not been used appropriately or not been used at all.\n\nNow the agency is considering attempting to recoup that money.\n\nRelated: Reckless Federal Shopping Spree Could Squander $50B\n\nSimilarly, just a few years after Hurricane Katrina, auditors revealed that the agency had sent out improper payments to thousands of storm victims \u2013 totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. The agency eventually had to send out letters to the victims asking them to return the millions of dollars deemed questionable \u2013 sometimes years after the checks had already been cashed and the money already spent.\n\nLikewise, an investigation by the Associated Press found that FEMA had misallocated about $5.8 million in the 2012 Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. Now two years later, it\u2019s again asking victims to pay the money back.\n\nThis has caused serious concern among victims \u2013 many of whom may have trouble coming up with their share of the money.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A $240 million dollar \u201chigh tech\u201d system intended to help FEMA deliver supplies to vic", "title": "FEMA\u2019s $240M Disaster Relief System Doesn\u2019t Work", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/02/FEMA-s-240M-Disaster-Relief-System-Doesn-t-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/02/FEMA-s-240M-Disaster-Relief-System-Doesn-t-Work", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A $240 million dollar \u201chigh tech\u201d system intended to help FEMA deliver supplies to vic", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda86c\"", "article_summary": "A $240 million dollar \u201chigh tech\u201d system intended to help FEMA deliver supplies to victims of catastrophic disasters is a complete disaster itself, according to federal auditors.\n\u201cAs presently configured, this supply chain system is not up to that task.\u201dEven if the system worked properly, the auditors said that FEMA doesn\u2019t have enough trained employees to operate it efficiently.\nRelated: GAO Flags FEMA\u2019s Spending PracticesThe IG made 11 recommendations to repair the system and make the coordination and distribution of supplies run smoothly.\nFEMA, for its part, agreed with the IG\u2019s recommendations and said it\u2019s already in the process of improving the system.\nLikewise, an investigation by the Associated Press found that FEMA had misallocated about $5.8 million in the 2012 Hurricane Sandy relief efforts."}
