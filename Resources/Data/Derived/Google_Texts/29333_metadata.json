Did Jeb Bush hold $1 million \u201chostage\u201d for abstinence-only education? WUSF's Lottie Watts runs these claims by Josh Gillin with PolitiFact Florida.\n\nThe 2015 Florida legislative session came screeching to a halt three days early, when House and Senate lawmakers could not agree on health care funding.\n\nThe House wants no part of Medicaid expansion. The Senate has warmed up to the idea of a type of expansion that would steer federal dollars into private healthcare plans. They'll try to get this worked out during a special session that\u2019s scheduled to begin Monday, June 1.\n\nOne of the arguments against Medicaid expansion is that Florida takes billions more from Washington, D.C. than it gives - and that the money being offered to Florida isn't Florida's to take.\n\n\n\nState Rep. Debbie Mayfield, R-Vero Beach, recently tweeted an infographic that shows Florida sends $135 billion to the federal government - and Washington sends $150 billion back to Florida.\n\n\n\nFL is NOT a donor state. Get the facts on federal spending and Medicaid expansion in FL. #sayfie @Florida_Today pic.twitter.com/0rmCdL1z1y\u2014 Rep Debbie Mayfield (@debbie_mayfield) May 4, 2015\n\nAccording to Josh Gillin with PolitiFact Florida, that claim is \u201cMostly True.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of representatives have been sending this out, so we asked the Speaker of the House\u2019s communications office where they got those numbers,\u201d Gillin said. \u201cThey said that $135 billion came from gross tax collections by the IRS - minus average refunds - so it\u2019s kind of a specific way to look at it. And then the $150 billion that the government sends to Florida, it came from a website called USASpending.gov, and that\u2019s a website that tracks federal contracts and loans and grants and public assistance, just all sorts of things here.\u201d\n\nFlorida gets a lot of money for Social Security and Medicare. There\u2019s highway funds, education grants, billions of dollars in federal contracts to private businesses in that number.\n\n\u201cOne expert even pointed out to us you need to keep in mind that the federal government is always running at a deficit these days, so you need to be very careful how you\u2019re parsing this, and not just pull out one program like Medicaid and say that it\u2019s wrong to take money for it, because the state of Florida gets a lot of money for other things,\u201d Gillin said.\n\nExperts told PolitiFact Florida that while the numbers the House is using are valid, if looked at a different way, they might not make the point stated in the infographic.\n\nIn another fact-check, PolitiFact Florida ruled that a claim from a Democratic political action committee that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush held $1 million \u201chostage\u201d for abstinence-only education is \u201cMostly False.\u201d\n\n\n\nEmily\u2019s List said, \"Jeb once held $1 million in family planning grants hostage until the programs receiving the money agreed not to discuss birth control at all.\"\n\nThere are a handful of news stories that say Bush in 2001 asked the Legislature to set aside $1 million for chastity programs out of the state\u2019s almost $5.8 million for family planning. That's a bit different from threatening existing programs with a gag order. More importantly, there's no evidence Bush's proposal went into effect. The health department said no requirements for abstinence programs were passed by lawmakers.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/fl-gets-billions-more-feds-it-gives-mostly-true", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201505/410089951.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "FL Gets Billions More From Feds Than It Gives? \u2018Mostly True\u2019"}, "story_id": 410084186, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "author": "Lottie Watts", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "FL Gets Billions More From Feds Than It Gives? \u2018Mostly True\u2019"}, "nid": 10797, "datePublished": "2015-05-27", "keywords": "PolitiFact Florida, federal funding", "wordCount": 811, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6eb\"", "article_summary": "In another fact-check, PolitiFact Florida ruled that a claim from a Democratic political action committee that former Florida Gov.\nWUSF's Lottie Watts runs these claims by Josh Gillin with PolitiFact Florida.\nGet the facts on federal spending and Medicaid expansion in FL.\nThe House wants no part of Medicaid expansion.\nOne of the arguments against Medicaid expansion is that Florida takes billions more from Washington, D.C. than it gives - and that the money being offered to Florida isn't Florida's to take."}
