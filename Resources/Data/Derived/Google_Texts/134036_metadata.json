These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Nurse practitioners responding to a survey indicated a critical attitude when dealing with overweight and obese patients, researchers reported here.\n\nPeggy Ward-Smith, PhD, RN, associate professor of nursing at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, told MedPage Today more than 50% of the clinicians surveyed agreed with statements that:\n\nOverweight people are not as good as others.\n\nOverweight people are not as successful as others.\n\nOverweight people are tidy.\n\nOverweight people are not as healthy as others.\n\nMost people do not wish to marry an overweight person.\n\nOverweight people have family issues.\n\nOverweight is the result of overeating.\n\nOverweight people are addicted to food.\n\n\"The first step in overcoming this bias is to be aware that we are biased towards overweight people,\" Ward-Smith said at her poster presentation at the annual meeting of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners. \"We are human. Weight biases exist among participants in this study.\"\n\nShe also noted, \"Negative perceptions interfere with providing high quality care for the obese individual.\"\n\n\"We know that it is harder to take care of these patients because they weigh more; they are hard on the equipment and they are hard to move,\" she said in explaining what may be at the root of the problems.\n\nWard-Smith and co-author Jane Peterson, PhD, APRN, clinical associate professor of nursing at the University of Missouri, compiled their survey by interviewing nurse practitioners at the 2012 AANP annual meeting.\n\nThe 19-item, study-specific survey used a 6-point Likert scale. Responses ranged from strongly agree to strongly disagree. No neutral response was provided. The researchers used a survey adapted from the Attitudes Toward Obese Persons and the Beliefs About Obese People, both validated instruments.\n\nThey scrutinized responses of 358 individuals, 94% of whom were women. Five or 1% of the participants were underweight; 172 or 51% were normal weight; 127 or 38% were overweight; 32 or 10% were obese. Another 22 people failed to disclose their personal weight.\n\nAbout 77% of the sample were Caucasian, 9% were African American, 5% were Asian, and 5% were Hispanic.\n\nMartin Murphy, NP, of Swope Health Service in Kansas City, MO, in commenting on the study, told MedPage Today, \"These findings appear to be very accurate, from my own anecdotal experience. We do have a tendency to shame people into losing weight even though in my experience it doesn't often work.\" Murphy did not participate in the study.\n\nWard-Smith noted that in the medical literature, studies show that obese women report experiencing stigma in healthcare and from their healthcare provider. In fact, other research indicated that about one in five overweight patients who experience weight stigma avoid future medical appointments and would seek to find a new provider.\n\n\"Reflection on personnel and workplace environments that foster weight biases can be altered to better meet the health needs of the overweight/obese person,\" she reported as implications of her study.\n\n\"Increasing sensitivity and empathetic support can be a critical aspect in improving the care of these people who struggle to manage their weight,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ed  Susman", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/AANP/46428", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A survey of nurse practitioners appears to show that the healthcare professionals have a disparaging attitude when it comes to their overweight and obese patients, researchers repo", "card": "Summary", "title": "Survey: Nurses Harsh on Overweight Patients"}, "dc.date.issued": "2014-06-21 14:00:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "diabetes,exercisefitness,cardiology,endocrinology,nephrology,obgyn,pediatrics,primarycare,psychiatry,dietnutrition,meetingcoverage,generalpsychiatry,obesity,aanp,eatingdisorders,practicemanagement,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2014-06-21 14:00:00", "sailthru.title": "Survey: Nurses Harsh on Overweight Patients", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A survey of nurse practitioners appears to show that the healthcare professionals have a disparaging attitude when it comes to their overweight and obese patients, researchers repo", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-06-22 14:06:00", "date": "2014-06-21 14:00:00", "sailthru.description": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A survey of nurse practitioners appears to show that the healthcare professionals have a disparaging attitude when it comes to their overweight and obese patients, researchers repo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/AANP/46428", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "type": "article", "description": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A survey of nurse practitioners appears to show that the healthcare professionals have a disparaging attitude when it comes to their overweight and obese patients, researchers repo", "title": "Survey: Nurses Harsh on Overweight Patients"}, "sailthru.featured": 0, "dc.date": "2014-06-21 14:00:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "endocrinology,Other,primarycare,psychiatry,pediatrics,nephrology,cardiology,obstetricsandgynecology,pain_management", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png"}, "article_summary": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Nurse practitioners responding to a survey indicated a critical attitude when dealing with overweight and obese patients, researchers reported here.\nIn fact, other research indicated that about one in five overweight patients who experience weight stigma avoid future medical appointments and would seek to find a new provider.\nWard-Smith noted that in the medical literature, studies show that obese women report experiencing stigma in healthcare and from their healthcare provider.\nWard-Smith and co-author Jane Peterson, PhD, APRN, clinical associate professor of nursing at the University of Missouri, compiled their survey by interviewing nurse practitioners at the 2012 AANP annual meeting.\nThe researchers used a survey adapted from the Attitudes Toward Obese Persons and the Beliefs About Obese People, both validated instruments."}
