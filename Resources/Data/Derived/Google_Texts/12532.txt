Story highlights Former President George W. Bush appears in an ad for his brother, Jeb

The ad is sponsored by Jeb Bush's super PAC, Right to Rise

Washington (CNN) Jeb Bush's super PAC, Right to Rise, is set to begin airing an ad featuring his brother, former President George W. Bush.

"I know Jeb. I know his good heart and his strong backbone," George W. Bush says in the spot. "Jeb will unite our country, he knows how to bring the world together against terror and he knows when tough measures must be taken."

The ad comes as Jeb Bush has firmly embraced his family name and legacy on the campaign trail, something he was hesitant to do last year when he announced his bid.

Following a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses and amid a tough fight in New Hampshire, the Bush family has come to Jeb Bush's aid on the trail. Barbara Bush released a campaign video for her son last month and joined him on the campaign trail in New Hampshire this week.
