(Photo: Erik Hill, AP)\n\nLetter to the editor:\n\nAfter reading the commentary about standardized testing inspiring conformity instead of originality, I was upset. I obediently took my ACT and got accepted to my desired Big 10 school, so I have no sympathy for this generation of whiners (\"Standardized testing afflicts us all: Column\").\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm all for creativity, uniqueness and personality. But when thousands of students are applying to one college, not every admissions board has time to go through \"four 2,500-word research papers,\" as Bard College does, and appreciate every candidate's uniqueness. Too many young people are caught up in the idea of how special they are.\n\nStandardized testing is meant to measure applicants on an equal playing field with their peers, and I see nothing wrong with that.\n\nLexi Diederich; Minneapolis\n\nHow important should standardized tests be in the college admissions process? Comments from Facebook are edited for clarity and grammar:\n\nThe idea that standardized tests can be dismissed out of hand as a one-size-fits-all approach is way too flip. The tests are an objective measure (just as we might have for a driving test) that informs schools who can and can't do the work.\n\nThe tests predict a student's future college performance about as well as high school grades, and both measures taken together are better than either alone.\n\n\u2014 Patrick Mattimore\n\nThe purpose of higher education is to educate knowledgeable, creative and compassionate human beings. It's about more than ensuring an individual makes big money after graduation.\n\nA student body must be composed of more than students who do well on a test. A standardized achievement test cannot measure intangibles such as a candidate's drive and individual determination.\n\n\u2014 Jerry Spiegler\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1btllpx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Letter to the editor:", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Letter to the editor:", "title": "Scrap standardized tests in college admissions?
