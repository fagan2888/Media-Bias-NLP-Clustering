Amphetamine-related deaths rose 89 percent in two years, to 66 in 2013.\n\nNonfatal emergency room visits for amphetamine users increased 85 percent, while ER visits for opioid users jumped 28 percent. By comparison, the average increase was 13 percent for all users at ERs.\n\nThe trend didn\u2019t carry over to hospitalizations, where 56 percent of substance-related hospitalizations were due to alcohol.\n\nThese findings were contained in a report that the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors received on January 26, and show that the area hasn\u2019t gone untouched by a resurgent heroin epidemic that has infiltrated the suburbs. While the Affordable Care Act has allowed the county to dedicate more funding to fighting substance abuse through contract awards and medication-assisted treatment\u2014totaling almost $49 million this year\u2014there is a dearth of residential treatment options, including none for youth.
