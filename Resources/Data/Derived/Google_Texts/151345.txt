A man accused of spraying children with a squirt gun loaded with his semen will go to prison.

Kevin Jaramillo pleaded no contest to charges stemming from two indictments, including child abuse without great bodily harm, criminal sexual contact and sexual exploitation, in an Albuquerque, New Mexico, courtroom Friday.

Under the plea agreement, Jaramillo must serve 18 years. Jaramillo initially faced going to prison for more than 57 years.

Authorities say the 35-year-old approached numerous children around Albuquerque in March 2014 to film them getting squirted with the water gun.

They say his victims ranged in age from 9 to 18.

Jaramillo apologized to his victims in court, blaming his behavior on drugs, alcohol and mental illness.

The father of one victim says Jaramillo took away his daughter's innocence.
