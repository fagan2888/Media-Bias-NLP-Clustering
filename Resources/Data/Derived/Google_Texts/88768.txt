Bats get lost in the haze.

The opening ceremonies for the first Gatemen game at Spillane Field in 2014.

After an 90-minute delay to drain the rain-soaked Spillane Field and another 10-minute delay in the second inning due to fog, the Gatemen bats went quiet as they lost their home opener 7-0.

Home plate umpire Jospeh Caraco briefly stopped the game in the 2nd, saying that the right fielder couldn't possibly see the ball coming off the bat from home plate. On the play before the game was briefly halted, Harwich third baseman Danny Zardon laced a double into left center field that made the Gatemen outfielders disappear into the mist like characters from "Field of Dreams."

The Wareham offense proved to be another disappearing act.

After a 13-3 trouncing of Chatham on Thursday, the Gatemen only managed three hits against the Harwich pitching trio of Zack Erwin, Jacob Evans, and Robby Kalaf.

Despite the lack of offense, the Gatemen got a promising start from pitcher Brock Hartson, who went five innings giving up four hits and two earned runs with six strikeouts.

The other bright spot for the Gatemen was catcher John Bormann, Hartson's battery-mate at the University of Texas San Antonio. Bormann caught two runners stealing in the sixth inning and had one of Wareham's three hits.

Before the game, local youth baseball and softball teams got the chance to lineup on the field for the national anthem before longtime Tabor Academy teacher and baseball coach Dick Duffy threw out the ceremonial first pitch.

The next home game for the Gatemen (1-4) will be a double header against Chatham on Sunday, June 22 at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.
