The agreement affects registered nurses and nurse practitioners who work in 86 Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in Northern and Central California, from Santa Rosa to Fresno.\n\nCNA/NNU Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro paid tribute to the \"unity of the Kaiser RNs and their devotion to assuring the highest level of quality care for patients as well as protections for the nurses who deliver that care.\"\n\n\"We look forward to a new chapter in our interactions with Kaiser,\" DeMoro added.\n\n\"We especially appreciate the commitment of Kaiser's leadership to addressing our concerns, including working through the complicated problems associated with the changes in health care delivery, some of them related to the Affordable Care Act, and the attention it has paid in this contract to the health and safety of its registered nurses as well as patients.\"\n\nA key to the settlement was the agreement by Kaiser to establish a new committee of direct care RNs and NPs who will work with management to address the concerns RNs have about care standards in Kaiser facilities.\n\n\"This is a great day for Kaiser patients and nurses,\" said Zenei Cortez, RN, chair of the Kaiser RN bargaining team and a co-president of CNA. \"We have an agreement that will strengthen the ability of Kaiser RNs to provide the optimal level of care our patients deserve, while establishing additional security for nurses. I am so proud of the Kaiser RNs and NPs who worked so hard for so long for this day.\"\n\n\"This agreement is a great achievement,\" added Diane McClure, a Sacramento Kaiser RN and nurse negotiator. \"We are especially excited about the expanded opportunity for new RN grads and trainees in Kaiser and the protections this agreement offers for RNs and our families.\"\n\nAmong other major components of the agreement:\n\n\u00b7 Kaiser will hire hundreds of RNs which the nurses say should substantially improve the quality of care for hospitalized patients, as well as signaling a renewed commitment to RN training and employment opportunities for new RN graduates at a time many hospitals have frozen RN hires.\n\n\u00b7 Groundbreaking workplace protections for nurses from workplace violence to infectious diseases like Ebola to needle stick injuries.\n\n\u00b7 Substantial economic gains for RNs and NPs, many of them the sole source of income for their families or extended families. Over the three years of the agreement, all the nurses will receive 14 percent pay increases through across the board hikes and lump sum payments.\n\n\u00b7 Additional long-term retirement security for Kaiser RNs and NPs through maintenance of a secure pension plan plus a substantial increase in employer contributions to the nurses' 401k pension plans for the 87 percent of Kaiser RNs with those plans.\n\n\u00b7 Annual paid release time, the first in the nation, for 25 RNs every year to participate in NNU's disaster relief program, the Registered Nurse Response Network, which has dispatched hundreds of RNs to provide basic medical services following U.S. and global disasters from Hurricane Katrina to the Haiti earthquake to Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.\n\nCNA also committed to helping National Union of Healthcare Workers at Kaiser, including mental health clinicians, to achieve a contract agreement as well.\n\nSource: Califiornia Nurses Association", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "More than 18,000 nurses with Kaiser Permanente will receive more say in patient care and workplace protections.", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "KESQ", "og": {"site_name": "KESQ", "description": "More than 18,000 nurses with Kaiser Permanente will receive more say in patient care and workplace protections.", "title": "California nurses win battle over rights in the workplace", "url": "http://www.kesq.com/news/18000-rns-win-stronger-patient-care-voice/30793032", "image": "http://www.kesq.com/image/view/-/30793058/highRes/1/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/3vssroz/-/nurse-png.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kesq.com/news/18000-rns-win-stronger-patient-care-voice/30793032", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 176415799038020}, "keywords": "Palm Springs news,Coachella Valley news,Palm Springs weather,Coachella Valley weather,Palm Springs,Coachella Valley,Indio,Palm Desert,LaQuinta,Desert Hot Springs", "google-site-verification": "kxlEvsVFZ1pUc9poWK-_fbBxpRMU8OrGQukWW1YlhQk", "news_keywords": "Palm Springs news,Coachella Valley news,Palm Springs weather,Coachella Valley weather,Palm Springs,Coachella Valley,Indio,Palm Desert,LaQuinta,Desert Hot Springs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9213\"", "article_summary": "\u00b7 Groundbreaking workplace protections for nurses from workplace violence to infectious diseases like Ebola to needle stick injuries.\n\"This is a great day for Kaiser patients and nurses,\" said Zenei Cortez, RN, chair of the Kaiser RN bargaining team and a co-president of CNA.\nI am so proud of the Kaiser RNs and NPs who worked so hard for so long for this day.\"\nThe agreement affects registered nurses and nurse practitioners who work in 86 Kaiser Permanente hospitals and clinics in Northern and Central California, from Santa Rosa to Fresno.\n\"This agreement is a great achievement,\" added Diane McClure, a Sacramento Kaiser RN and nurse negotiator."}
