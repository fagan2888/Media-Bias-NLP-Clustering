ENID, Okla. – An Oklahoma woman was allowed to wear a spaghetti strainer on her head in her state driver’s license photo after she said it symbolized her religious freedom.

Shawna Hammond said the strainer did not violate state law that required religious headpieces to present a clear view of your face.

“I asked if I could wear my religious headwear and he said, yes, it just couldn’t have any logos, or any type of writing. I told him it didn’t, and I went out to my car and got my colander,” Hammond told KFOR.com. “He kind of chuckled, giggled, gave me a funny look and asked me what religion I was. I said I was a Pastafarian.”

Pastafarianism is a religion where there are “no strict rules and regulations, there are no rote rituals and prayers and other nonsense,” according to the church’s website.

Hammond said she is an Atheist and believes no one should be forced into certain beliefs.

“For me the colander represents freedom, our freedom of religion, and to whatever religion we prefer or lack of religion. It was important to me to exercise that, even if it’s just a driver’s license photo,” she said.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol officials said they would review of the picture to make sure it followed all the rules. If it did, authorities said they may look at changing the rule of religious headwear because it is more than 10-years old.
