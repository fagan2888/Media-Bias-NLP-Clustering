Mitch McConnell\u2019s \u201cred flag in font of a bull\u201d comment), and President Obama has said he is not afraid to use his veto pen.\n\nThe debate will largely center around three main agenda items, and Indiana\u2019s senators are particularly concerned about a fourth. Here\u2019s where they stand and what they hope to accomplish:\n\n1. Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nThe Senate is considering approving the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would stretch from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico. The Senate failed to approve the project in November by one vote, but with the new GOP majority, lawmakers are confident it will pass.\n\nCOATS: Supports the measure. He says \u201cit moves us toward energy independence.\u201d\n\nDONNELLY: Supports the measure. In a statement regarding why he voted in favor of the pipeline in November, Donnelly said \u201cthe Keystone XL pipeline would promote economic competitiveness and energy security for our country\u201d and called it a \u201ccommonsense project.\u201d\n\nHere is Donnelly speaking on the Senate floor in favor of the pipeline.\n\n2. Immigration\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s executive action provides millions of undocumented immigrants the opportunity to stay in the United States. Congress\u2019 most recent budget, however, only funds Homeland Security, which handles immigration, through the end of February, so lawmakers need to agree to another deal before then.\n\nBoth Donnelly and Coats said the president did not have the authority to make the executive order. Regarding next steps, Donnelly has emphasized the need for immigration reform, while Coats has focused largely on securing the border.\n\nCOATS: Step #1 is securing the border. \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people are ready to accept any kind of immigration reform if they turn on their TV or look at YouTube and see thousands of people, illegals, crossing the border and saying you can\u2019t send us back. You need to get us into your schools and hospitals and benefits and so-on,\u201d Coats tells WFIU/WTIU.\n\nDONNELLY: \u201cBy enacting legislation we can change the law to adequately secure our borders, modernize our visa system, and permanently address the millions of undocumented immigrants who are currently living in our country. To date, Congress has failed to do its job,\u201d Donnelly said as part of a joint letter with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, D-North Dakota, to House and Senate leaders.\n\n3. Obamacare\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, has been a major point of contention since its passage in 2010. The House of Representatives has voted to repeal it several times, but the Democratic majority in the Senate has kept that measure from going anywhere.\n\nCOATS: Wants to repeal and replace Obamacare with \u201cmore sensible provisions.\u201d He explains, though, that Senate Republicans do not have enough votes to override a presidential veto, which Obama is expected to issue if the law were repealed. Therefore, Coats says he hopes to make some significant changes \u201cpiece by piece.\u201d\n\nDONNELLY- \u201cTake the parts of the bill that need to be fixed, let\u2019s fix it, and the parts that provide coverage, that makes people\u2019s lives better, let\u2019s keep.\u201d\n\n4. Medical Device Tax\n\nThis is a provision within the Affordable Care Act that is of particular interest to Indiana, which is home to several medical device manufacturers. The medical device tax is a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices and provides some of the money used to pay for other parts of Obamacare.\n\nCOATS: \u201c ..the medical device tax should be repealed because it stifles innovation and kills jobs,\u201d Coats said in a statement relating to an IRS report on the tax. \u201cGiven this bipartisan agreement and the more than 20,000 Hoosiers who are directly employed by medical device manufacturers, this tax needs to be repealed immediately.\u201d\n\nDONNELLY: \u201cSen. Donnelly has been a consistent supporter of eliminating the medical device tax and has made clear that he will not stop working to repeal the medical device tax until the job is done,\u201d Donnelly\u2019s website reads. \u201cThe medical device industry is important to Indiana\u2019s economy, and thousands of Hoosiers rely upon the jobs the industry provides.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana's senators say the Keystone XL Pipeline, immigration and Obamacare will likely be the main issues this year.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Indiana's senators say the Keystone XL Pipeline, immigration and Obamacare will likely be the main issues this year.", "title": "Where Indiana\u2019s Senators Stand On Key Issues For 2015 | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/indianas-senators-stand-key-issues-2015-76554/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2015/01/4089419553_059f5228df_o-940x626.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2015/01/4089419553_059f5228df_o-940x626.jpg", "title": "Where Indiana\u2019s Senators Stand On Key Issues For 2015", "description": "Indiana's senators say the Keystone XL Pipeline, immigration and Obamacare will likely be the main issues this year.", "card": "summary", "site": "@wfiunews"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1", "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfde1\"", "article_summary": "Medical Device TaxThis is a provision within the Affordable Care Act that is of particular interest to Indiana, which is home to several medical device manufacturers.\n\u201cThe medical device industry is important to Indiana\u2019s economy, and thousands of Hoosiers rely upon the jobs the industry provides.\nDonnelly has been a consistent supporter of eliminating the medical device tax and has made clear that he will not stop working to repeal the medical device tax until the job is done,\u201d Donnelly\u2019s website reads.\nThe medical device tax is a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices and provides some of the money used to pay for other parts of Obamacare.\nThe debate will largely center around three main agenda items, and Indiana\u2019s senators are particularly concerned about a fourth."}
