The reports say that almost half of the doctors call their decision of becoming a doctor \u201ca million dollar mistake\u201d and would not opt out for a medical career again. They doubt their choice of speciality and are apprehensive of the introduction of Obamacare.\n\nMedicine \u2013 a million dollar mistake\n\nAs many doctors say that they made a million dollar mistake by opting out for a career in medicine, almost all of them had the same view point towards Obamacare and said that they dread the mounting paper work that would result when this is implemented.\n\nThe figures show that almost 28% doctors had to go for a pay cut the previous year, making the profession seem a little dry. The newly practicing doctors do get a very good pay but data states that generally in the beginning they have to lug off a debt of $ 166,750 borrowed money.\n\nThe shocking data stated that less than half admitted that if they had to go through the medicine study again, they would become doctors but majority of them preferred out. The main reasons for this are the whopping debts that the doctors had to borrow during their student years and the huge paper work that they would be doing rather than looking after the sick in case Obamacare is exercised in full force in the future.\n\nDebt , pay cuts, working schedules\n\nA lot of effort and extensive higher education is needed for a person to turn into a full-fledged doctors, this means that about 10 years after graduation the physician starts to earn. Does that equate to ten lost years of capable earning?\n\nThe doctors who have opted for family and medicine and pediatrics are the most dissatisfied according to the stats. A study involving American Association of Medical Colleges, George Washington University\u2019s School of Public Health and Medscape, showed that the internal physicians spent about 23% of their time chalking out the paperwork and they saw just about 2 patients in an hour.\n\nThe doctors earned about $ 185,000 per year after working 54 hours in a week. Nearly one fourth of the doctors face the pay cut as well. Hassled with these facts and figures, one-third doctors vehemently said they would never take up medicine as their career and only 19% said they would go for the speciality they had majored in, again if the chance came.\n\nChristina Lamontagne of NerdWallet stated that \u2018Administrative tasks account for nearly one-quarter of a doctor\u2019s day. With additional liability concerns and more layers in health care, we can understand the drain this takes.\u2019\n\nThe ideal specialty for the doctors is orthopedic and neurology line. Orthopedics earn $ 405,000 on an average annually, and the neurologists get $ 216,000 after working 55 hours weekly. The neurologists were happy with their chosen specialty line and about 53% neurologists said that they were ready to go for medicine again. The same feeling was shared by the oncologists where 57% said they were happy to carry on their rampage against cancer.\n\nNearly 42% radiologists said that they suffered pay cuts even if they carried home $ 349,000 on an average. Cardiologists have been the busiest and earn about $ 357,000 annually after slogging 60 hours a week.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd059b\"", "article_summary": "Medicine \u2013 a million dollar mistakeAs many doctors say that they made a million dollar mistake by opting out for a career in medicine, almost all of them had the same view point towards Obamacare and said that they dread the mounting paper work that would result when this is implemented.\nThe reports say that almost half of the doctors call their decision of becoming a doctor \u201ca million dollar mistake\u201d and would not opt out for a medical career again.\nThe doctors who have opted for family and medicine and pediatrics are the most dissatisfied according to the stats.\nThe neurologists were happy with their chosen specialty line and about 53% neurologists said that they were ready to go for medicine again.\nOrthopedics earn $ 405,000 on an average annually, and the neurologists get $ 216,000 after working 55 hours weekly."}
