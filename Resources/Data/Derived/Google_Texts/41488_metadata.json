On Sunday, Cruz\u2019s fellow Republicans responded by abandoning him in dramatic fashion.\n\nCruz has turned to the tried-and-true method of using his perch in the Senate to draw attention to himself in recent days, as his presidential campaign struggles to gain traction. But unlike colleagues such as Rand Paul or Marco Rubio, the Texas Tea Partier hasn\u2019t limited himself to the typical Senate headline-grabbing moves\u2014a lengthy filibuster-type speech, for example, or a dogged push for legislation. No, the Cruz style is to attack the institution itself, its norms and conventions, and in particular, its precious decorum.\n\nFrom a purely political perspective, it\u2019s not a bad move. Congress is never popular, and accusing a polarizing legislative leader like Mitch McConnell of lying is not the same as, say, belittling the war record of John McCain and suggesting it was his fault the Vietcong captured and tortured him for seven years, as Donald Trump recently did. (Nor is it as offensive as Mike Huckabee\u2019s invocation of the most wretched imagery of the Holocaust to protest the Iran nuclear deal.) The Senate may have been designed as the \u201ccooling saucer\u201d of American government, but no one prizes its glacial pace or its Treehouse Club rules and traditions nearly as much as the senators themselves.\n\n\u201cSquabbling and sanctimony may be tolerated in other venues\u2014or perhaps on the campaign trail\u2014but they have no place among colleagues in the United States Senate,\u201d Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving Republican, said in a floor speech at the opening of an unusual Sunday session. In the best passive-aggressive tradition of the Senate, Hatch did not mention Cruz by name, but it was obvious to all who he was talking about.\n\nThe admonition followed Cruz\u2019s outburst on Friday, when he said McConnell told Republicans a \u201cflat-out lie\u201d about his intentions to allow supporters to revive the expired charter of the Export-Import Bank\u2014a lending agency targeted by conservatives\u2014as part of an unrelated highway bill. McConnell on Sunday denied making a \u201cspecial deal,\u201d but he largely left his defense to a handful of other senior Republicans who went after Cruz. Among those standing with McConnell was Cruz\u2019s own Texas colleague, John Cornyn, who said he was \u201cmistaken\u201d in calling out the majority leader.\n\n\u201cSquabbling and sanctimony may be tolerated in other venues\u2014or perhaps on the campaign trail\u2014but they have no place among colleagues in the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nTo no one\u2019s surprise, Cruz refused to back down. He insisted that he had not violated the Senate\u2019s sacred decorum. \u201cI do not believe speaking the truth is anything other than in the very best tradition of the United States Senate,\u201d Cruz told reporters, according to CNN.\n\nYet the rhetorical barbs were only part of the story on Sunday. Cruz next turned to the Senate\u2019s arcane procedural rules to try to get his way. In a bid to appease conservatives upset over the Ex-Im Bank amendment, McConnell had announced Friday that the Senate would also vote on a full repeal of Obamacare. Cruz had denounced this offer as \u201can empty show vote,\u201d and on that point, he was exactly right. Under the rules devised by McConnell, the amendment repealing the healthcare law would be subject to a 60-vote threshold, thereby ensuring its failure, given that none of the 45 Democrats would ever support repeal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Texas conservative assumes the role of Washington rebel, and enlists his outraged colleagues as his supporting cast.", "author": "Russell Berman", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Ted Cruz decides to play the role of Washington rebel, and enlists his outraged colleagues as his supporting cast.", "title": "The Senator Who Wants to Be a Maverick", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/07/AP_67787960493/facebook.jpg?1438020649", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/republicans-ted-cruz-senate-2016/399680/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8c1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI do not believe speaking the truth is anything other than in the very best tradition of the United States Senate,\u201d Cruz told reporters, according to CNN.\nOn Friday, Ted Cruz called the leader of his party a liar on the Senate floor.\nMcConnell on Sunday denied making a \u201cspecial deal,\u201d but he largely left his defense to a handful of other senior Republicans who went after Cruz.\nNo, the Cruz style is to attack the institution itself, its norms and conventions, and in particular, its precious decorum.\nIn the best passive-aggressive tradition of the Senate, Hatch did not mention Cruz by name, but it was obvious to all who he was talking about."}
