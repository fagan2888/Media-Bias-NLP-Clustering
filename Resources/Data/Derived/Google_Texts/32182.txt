A Brooklyn nonprofit group with roots stretching back to the 19th century is cashing in on the borough’s hot real estate market by cutting a deal with a developer to convert its headquarters to new office space and apartments.

Brooklyn Community Services, which offers a wide range of programs for children and adults, has cut a deal with developer Louis Greco to convert the existing seven-story building at 285 Schermerhorn St. into a 14-story tower that will include about 100 apartments and a 17,000-square-foot office condominium.

Brooklyn Community Services will own the office condo and continue to locate its headquarters at the location, which is a few blocks away from the Barclays Center. Mr. Greco’s company, Second Development Services Inc., will own the apartments which will either be rentals or condominiums.

Terms of the deal, which is scheduled to be announced Thursday, were not released. But real estate experts say that the value of the building currently is over $20 million.

The existing building was constructed for Brooklyn Community Service in 1927. The organization decided to sell to because it needs the proceeds to pay down debt and stabilize its financial condition for the future, said Marla Simpson, the group’s executive director.

Now also is a good time to sell because “downtown Brooklyn is one of the hottest markets on the planet,” she said. More than a dozen developers expressed interest in the property, Ms. Simpson said.

Mr. Greco has been an active developer in Brooklyn. He is best known as the co-developer of a Richard Meier-designed condominium at 1 Grand Army Plaza.
