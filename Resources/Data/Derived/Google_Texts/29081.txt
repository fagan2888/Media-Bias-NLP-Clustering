“The Colbert Report” host says no way, no how Abe Lincoln does that

President Barack Obama stopped by Zack Galifianakis’ “Between Two Ferns” recently to promote the Affordable Care Act, but Stephen Colbert wasn’t laughing at the commander-in-chief’s appearance with the comedian.

“There’s a time and a place for fun and one of those places is not with your finger on the button,” Colbert said. “Knock, knock. Who’s there? Nobody, we were all killed in a nuclear war while you were too busy yukking it up with your Hollywood buddies.”

“The Colbert Report” host noted that his views that the presidential appearance on the Funny or Die program was beneath the dignity of the office he holds were widely shared by Fox News’ roster of talking heads.

Colbert’s idol Bill O’Reilly went reaching for historical precedent, noting that Abe Lincoln would never have have appeared on Galifianakis’ program.

“You can’t fight that logic,” Colbert said. “Abe Lincoln would never have done a viral web video. The most that President Lincoln ever did was sit for a daguerreotype meme.”
