These superficial manifestations of its incompetent administration are not the key problem the program faces.\n\nThe lethal threat to its future is that nobody wants it or needs it. The glitches have permitted the administration to hide the dismally low enrollment figures behind assurances that people wanted to sign up but couldn\u2019t.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUsing national projections and data from New York\u2019s own exchange:\n\nTotal population: 17 million\n\nEstimated uninsured 3.5 million\n\nVisited site 1 million\n\nRegistered 134,000\n\nSought to enroll \u201cseveral thousands\u201d\n\nEnrolled as of yet 0\n\nSo only about two- or three-tenths of 1 percent of the uninsured have sought to enroll in ObamaCare. Only about 3 percent of those who have registered have sought to enroll.\n\n\n\nAnd none have succeeded.\n\n\n\nNationally, that would work out to only about 50,000 enrollment applications \u2014 a dismal performance for the first three weeks of the program\u2019s availability.\n\n\n\nThe high rate of site visits and registration measured against the low number of enrollment applications suggest the basic truth: that as people see and learn more about ObamaCare\u2019s policies and prices, they do not want to buy it. And they are staying away in droves.\n\n\n\nWhile there are glitches with which to contend and the system is far from smooth-functioning, the total lack of interest these enrollment figures illustrate poses a lethal political threat to President Obama\u2019s political viability\n\n\n\nWe debated ObamaCare for years. We all explored its cost, the justification for its mandatory provisions. We examined its impact on the quality of care. We discussed its constitutionality. We all probed each aspect of this debate. But to my knowledge nobody \u2014 nobody \u2014 has said that people wouldn\u2019t want it or need it. That they would give a war and nobody would come. This possibility never occurred to me.\n\n\n\nYet it is plainly the fact.\n\n\n\nObama is trying to hide the fact of low interest and low enrollment behind the computer glitches. He avows that he is furious and imports techies to fix it and puts Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius Kathleen SebeliusFighting for assisted living facilities The chaotic fight for ObamaCare California exchange CEO: Insurers \u2018throwing ObamaCare under the bus\u2019 MORE out to testify before Congress on the glitches. If the first half of October was about the shutdown, the second half is about the glitches.\n\n\n\nObama wants us to focus on the glitches so that we don\u2019t look behind the curtain at the more serious problem \u2014 that he monopolized America\u2019s attention, neglected the economy, polarized us politically and staked his whole administration and spent billions of dollars to fix something that wasn\u2019t broken.\n\n\n\nIf the low enrollment figures persist, the very basis of the case for ObamaCare will have eroded around its foundations. Those suffering without insurance will be exposed as neither wanting nor being able to afford it.\n\n\n\nTo the average 27-year-old, facing monthly premiums in the $300-$400 range, the question is: Do you buy health insurance on an Obama-Care exchange, or do you buy a car? Which one?\n\n\n\nI believe that the entire Obama administration will be discredited in history if the demand for this program persists at this low level. It is always hard to repeal an entitlement program once it is launched. But if only 1 million people apply for it, repeal is not that difficult.\n\n\n\nThis program will go down in history as the greatest failure in recent domestic policy legislation \u2014 not because of its cost or impact on care, but because of low enrollment and interest.\n\n\n\nMorris, who served as adviser to former Sen.
