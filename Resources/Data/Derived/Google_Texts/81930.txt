Bowie police shot and wounded a man Friday who was being sought for questioning as part of an auto theft investigation.

The man was visiting his mother’s house on Keynote Lane in Bowie – dropping off diapers for his child, who lives there – when Bowie police came to arrest him, the man’s mother said. She said the police wanted to talk to him for using a car without permission.

Police Involved Shooting in Bowie, Md.

Bowie police said they shot and wounded a man who rammed them with a car when they attempted to talk to him about another investigation. News4's Darcy Spencer has the latest. (Published Friday, Dec. 27, 2013)

The man fled and found a car on nearby Kennison Lane that had been left running but unoccupied, police said. He fled in that car, and police said he tried to run down police officers.

Two officers then shot at him, and he was hit at least once in the upper body. He is expected to recover.

Charges are pending against the suspect, police said.

Police have not yet named him, but his mother identified him as Joseph Moreland, 26.

His mother questioned why officers needed to use deadly force against her son. "Unauthorized use is what they said they came by to pick him up for," said Norita Moreland. "Deadly force is above the shoulders. That's what was used today. And that's ridiculous."

Bowie Police Chief John Nesky said the investigation was continuing, but that "everything on the surface appears to be a justified shooting."
