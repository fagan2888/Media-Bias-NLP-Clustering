On Friday, the hospital maintained that it gave Duncan the best care possible under its circumstances as it released a statement saying it made procedural changes and continues to \u201creview and evaluate\u201d the decisions surrounding Duncan\u2019s care. The\n\nAccording to reports, Duncan displayed symptoms of Ebola as he carried a 103 degree fever as well as rated the pain he was in an 8 on a scale of 10.\n\nMedical records obtained by the AP from Duncan\u2019s family show that Duncan\u2019s first visit to a Dallas emergency room ended with him being sent home with a prescription for antibiotics after undergoing a slew of tests. The records, which amount to more than 1,400 pages in all, also chronicle Duncan\u2019s time in the ER, in addition to his urgent return to the hospital two days later and the steep decline in his health as his organs began to fail. Duncan died Wednesday.\n\nIn addition, the AP reports that stories surrounding the hospital\u2019s account of what their medical team knew when it released Duncan on Sept. 26 changed repeatedly, among other items of dispute.\n\nThis comes amid an alert from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advising hospitals nationwide to take a travel history for patients with Ebola-like symptoms. Nevertheless, the hospital stated it made changes to its intake process and other practices \u201cto better screen for all critical indicators\u201d of Ebola.\n\nA Texas Department of State Health Services spokeswoman revealed Friday that the said the agency was considering investigating the hospital for compliance with state health and safety laws.\n\nDespite revealing that Duncan\u2019s remains have been cremated, the spokeswoman did not say when, where or by whom. In addition to Duncan\u2019s cremation, the AP mentioned that drums of potentially contaminated material taken from the apartment where he became ill was incinerated Friday at a hazardous material processing center in Port Arthur.\n\nThe revelations come with Friday\u2019s announcement from the World Health Organization that the Ebola death toll had surpassed 4,000 confirmed, probable or suspected Ebola deaths. All but nine were in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, the agency stated.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only person that has died from Ebola here in America,\u201d Weeks told CNN\u2019s \u201cOutFront.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s a black man. He\u2019s poor, didn\u2019t have insurance.\n\n\u201cHad that been another name, you know, or another color, he would probably be living today and he would have survived it,\u201d Weeks said Friday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s really hurting me the most is because they treated him the way they did because of the color of his skin, and that\u2019s very upsetting and disturbing, and know that you stand a chance if you\u2019re white, but you don\u2019t if you\u2019re black.\u201d\n\nTo see Weeks interview with \u201cOutFront,\u201d check out the video below:\n\n(White Ebola Patients Lived But The One Black Man Died)\n\n51 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
