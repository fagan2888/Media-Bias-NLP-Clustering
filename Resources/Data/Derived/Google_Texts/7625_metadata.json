She was accompanied by Daren Bakst, a Heritage research fellow in agricultural policy. The duo set forth the challenges Obamcare unnecessarily places on small businesses \u2014 especially pizza franchises like Domino\u2019s.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, restaurant chains are required to put up menu boards that detail caloric and nutritional information for the standard food options sold in that store. The Food and Drug Administration is making sure this provision is implemented, at a cost to the private sector of an estimated $97 million to $537 million.\n\nCarraway said that the regulations make no sense for Domino\u2019s. There are more than 34,000 different ways to craft a pizza and the requirements call for menus to reflect the calories in an entire pizza, instead of individual slices. Plus, the majority of pizza orders come in from the Internet, where Domino\u2019s already supplies tons of nutritional information. Aside from that, no one uses a menu at a store to order pizza, she said.\n\n\u201cJust think to yourself, how many times have you walked into a Dominos pizza store\u2026 and thought, \u2018Oh, I wonder what I\u2019m going to order today\u2019?\u201d she told the crowd at Heritage. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone does. I\u2019ve known what kind of pizza I like since I\u2019ve been about 12 years old.\u201d\n\nShe said the requirements put in place by the Affordable Care Act harm her store managers, who make their profit off what their stores make. On top of that, her competitors \u2014 mom and pop shops \u2014 don\u2019t have to follow the same requirements, since they aren\u2019t chain stores.\n\nAccording to the FDA, the signs are meant to \u201cassist consumers in making healthier dietary choices.\u201d But Bakst doesn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cThe government thinks that people cannot make informed choices about what they eat and that the government \u2014 all knowing that it is \u2014 knows what\u2019s best for Americans,\u201d he told the crowd at Heritage. \u201cThe idea is actually to try to change consumer behavior.\u201d\n\nHe added that consumers often call for nutrition information themselves and that government doesn\u2019t need to meddle in that process. Then business owners are left to decide if complying with those demands will give them a competitive edge. The FDA, which is forced to implement the Obamacare nutritional information provision, has acknowledged that consumers do often ask for that info, Bakst added.\n\nBut then, Bakst said, the FDA justifies the government intervention by saying that consumers are still not making healthy choices, so the information provided to them by restaurants must not be sufficient.\n\nHe also noted that many people aren\u2019t looking to eat healthy when they\u2019re at restaurants. They might offset a high calorie meal with lower calorie meals the rest of the day, or the may exercise regularly.\n\n\u201cWhen you go to a steakhouse, you don\u2019t go for the kale,\u201d he joked.\n\nBakst and Carraway condemned the FDA\u2019s one-size-fits-all mentality. Instead, the two support \u201cThe Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act,\u201d which would find a happy medium between giving consumers nutritional information and not imposing burdens on businesses.\n\nUltimately, however, eating healthy at a pizza place comes down to the individual consumer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of choice,\u201d Carraway said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "The menu regulations that come with Obamacare are effectively making it difficult for small businesses to operate, according to Mary Lynee Carraway, majority owner and president of Domino\u2019s Pizza Team Washington.", "title": "Domino's franchisee condemns Obamacare's 'war on pizza': Calorie...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/06/Dominos-400x400.png", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/11/19/dominos-franchisee-condemns-obamacares-war-on-pizza-calorie-count-menus/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "obamacare-calorie-count-requirement", "published_time": "2013-11-19T15:28:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-19T15:28:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99b2\"", "article_summary": "Plus, the majority of pizza orders come in from the Internet, where Domino\u2019s already supplies tons of nutritional information.\nInstead, the two support \u201cThe Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act,\u201d which would find a happy medium between giving consumers nutritional information and not imposing burdens on businesses.\nThe duo set forth the challenges Obamcare unnecessarily places on small businesses \u2014 especially pizza franchises like Domino\u2019s.\n\u201cJust think to yourself, how many times have you walked into a Dominos pizza store\u2026 and thought, \u2018Oh, I wonder what I\u2019m going to order today\u2019?\u201d she told the crowd at Heritage.\nThe menu regulations that come with Obamacare are effectively making it difficult for small businesses to operate, according to Mary Lynee Carraway, majority owner and president of Domino\u2019s Pizza Team Washington."}
