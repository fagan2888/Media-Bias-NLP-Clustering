The cub is only the second panda born at the zoo to survive to her first birthday.\n\nBao Bao\u2019s only sibling, brother Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and returned to China in 2010. Panda keeper Nicole MacCorkle says Bao Bao has been a different baby from her brother, including a little more stand-offish with keepers.\n\nIn the past year she has grown from a wriggling pink newborn a little bigger than a stick of butter to a 44-pound black-and-white bundle whose favorite activity is sleeping in a tree. A hemlock tree in the front of her yard is one favorite, and she also likes wrestling with a blue cylinder-shaped buoy filled with sand, MacCorkle said. The cub, whose name means \u201cprecious\u201d or \u201ctreasure,\u201d has also started eating solid food like sweet potato and bamboo and recently got her first taste of honey.\n\nShe\u2019s also learned behaviors that help keepers monitor her health including getting on a scale and standing up when asked. Lately, she\u2019s \u201cgetting really good\u201d and responding when her name is called, MacCorkle said, and is exploring her yard a little more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "National Zoo celebrating panda\u2019s first birthday", "title": "National Zoo celebrating panda\u2019s first birthday", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "National Zoo celebrating panda\u2019s first birthday", "title": "National Zoo celebrating panda\u2019s first birthday", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/23/national_zoo_celebrating_pandas_first_birthday/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/panda-birthday.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "National Zoo celebrating panda\u2019s first birthday", "title": "National Zoo celebrating panda\u2019s first birthday", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/panda-birthday.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jessica Gresko", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Saturday marks the first birthday of panda cub Bao Bao, and she\u2019ll get a cake made from frozen fruit juice and other treats like pears and apples to celebrate.\nShe\u2019s also learned behaviors that help keepers monitor her health including getting on a scale and standing up when asked.\nThe cub is only the second panda born at the zoo to survive to her first birthday.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The National Zoo in Washington is throwing a panda party.\nPanda keeper Nicole MacCorkle says Bao Bao has been a different baby from her brother, including a little more stand-offish with keepers."}
