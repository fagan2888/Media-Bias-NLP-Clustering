Immigrants are supposed to wait there until they are processed and taken to detention centers, but the surge in children arriving without their parents has overwhelmed the U.S. government.\n\nThe U.S. Border Patrol is not the only federal agency overwhelmed by the huge influx of undocumented minors at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, which had expected its greatest task at the time to be dealing with the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act, is scrambling to care for and provide services to the tens of thousands of unaccompanied children coming to the United States from Central America.\n\nMany are coming from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, either fleeing violence in those countries, or seeking to reunite with parents or other relatives here, authorities say. About 50,000 have come within the past year.\n\nThe children are first put in the custody of the U.S. Border Patrol and then are handed over to HHS within 72 hours.\n\nHHS takes them into one of several immigration shelters in various states \u2013 the administration said it is looking for more facilities to send the children. The agency is tasked with providing the children with services that include medical care, food, clothing, socialization and recreation, according to the HHS website.\n\nThe influx of children is straining the program \u2013 called Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) \u2013 which was meant to serve some 8,000 children a year while their cases were pending in immigration court, say representatives of child advocacy groups.\n\n\u201cThe system as it was created was never meant to hold this many children,\u201d said Megan McKenna, communications and advocacy director of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), in an interview with Fox News Latino. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned that these children, who would like to claim U.S. protection and who are potentially eligible for U.S. protection are not able to access our system\u201d for proper guidance on their rights and criteria for staying in the country.\n\nOnce in HHS custody, the agency then works to locate a parent or other relative with whom the child can stay. Some also stay in foster care.\n\nSome child advocacy groups, including KIND, are assisting the government by doing such things as helping to provide basic necessities to the children, as well as guidance on what immigration relief may apply to them.\n\nHuman rights groups and lawyers who have spoken to many of the children estimate that between 60 to 80 percent of them could qualify for political asylum or a special visa for unaccompanied children who are deemed to have been abandoned, neglected or abused.\n\n\u201cThese are children,\u201d said McKenna. \u201cIf they are kept in a Border Patrol facility and asked questions, it\u2019s going to be very hard for them to talk about what\u2019s happened to them. They\u2019ve just come out of the desert without a parent or legal guardian, and in many cases these children are also abused on the journey here.\u201d\n\nMany who are released from HHS\u2019s supervision are referred to groups such as KIND, which has handled more than 6,000 children, including some as young as 2 years old.\n\n\u201cThey say they feel they have to leave their countries or die,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cThe majority say they were targeted by violent gangs and cartels. There is very little state protection in these countries.\u201d\n\nBut some say that HHS is ill-prepared to handle the crisis \u2013 and, they argue, the federal government is unfairly being burdened by the sudden mass of children illegally crossing the border.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned with HHS\u2019 lack of transparency and preparation\u2026,\u201d Rep. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.) wrote in a letter to HHS. \u201cWhere is HHS currently housing UACs and for how long? What other sites/locations are currently planned? What do you anticipate to be the final cost of housing UACs to taxpayers?\u201d\n\nObama is seeking about $2 billion to respond to the flood of immigrants illegally entering the U.S. through the Rio Grande Valley area of Texas and ask for new powers to deal with returning immigrant children apprehended while traveling without their parents.\n\nDetails of the emergency appropriation, including the exact amount and how it will be spent, will come after lawmakers return from their holiday recess on July 7, according to published reports.\n\nObama also is asking that the Homeland Security Department be granted the authority to apply \"fast track\" procedures to the screening and deportation of all immigrant children traveling without their parents and that stiffer penalties be applied to those who smuggle children across the border.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an emergency response and everyone is doing best they can,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cThese children are potentially very traumatized. We\u2019re concerned the system is breaking down.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-02 10:30:01 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "It is straining the program \u2013 called Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) \u2013 which was meant to serve some 8,000 children a year while their cases were pending in immigration court, say representatives of child advocacy groups", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/news/0/0/Immigration%20Overload_Garc%20(1).jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Health And Human Services Scrambling To Serve Influx Of Undocumented Immigrant Kids\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/07/01/us-health-and-human-services-scrambling-to-serve-influx-immigrant-kids/\",\"image_url\":\"http://global.fncstatic.com/static/v/all/img/fn_latino_128x128.png\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"b94a4c4d5aee6410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-02T14:30:01Z\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "It is straining the program \u2013 called Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) \u2013 which was meant to serve some 8,000 children a year while their cases were pending in immigration court, say representatives of child advocacy groups", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:b94a4c4d5aee6410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "", "description": "Las pantallas flexibles est\u00e1n de moda.
