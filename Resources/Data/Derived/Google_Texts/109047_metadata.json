Not since the election of John F. Kennedy had such a wave of energy and youthful optimism swept across the nation. Not since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr\u2019s seminal \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech had the hope of a post-racist nation been so strong. It propelled Barack Obama into the Presidency and sparked a new political revolution.\n\nAfter more than a year of fighting with intransigent Republicans in congress\u2014despite reaching across the aisle\u2014Obama had spent virtually all of his political capital ensuring the passage of Obamacare, giving the new political revolution all the energy it needed to become a powerful national movement.\n\nThis new political revolution, called the Tea Party, firmly seated far-right wing ideologues into both houses of congress, giving the Republicans a majority in the House and a filibuster representation in the Senate. This political revolution continues to reverberate through sustained efforts to defund and repeal Obamacare, blocking even moderately progressive legislation, and the filibuster of more judicial nominations to federal courts than any other administration in the history of our country. As the President said himself, the mid-term elections of 2010 gave Democrats a \u201cshellacking.\u201d\n\nWhat happened? The answer is quite simple, those who voted for Obama thought they had won the day on November 4th, 2008 and simply sat down. The progressive momentum of the election was gone.\n\nWill we make the same mistake in 2016? The energy of the Bernie Sander\u2019s campaign is truly inspirational. We are feeling a renewed sense of energy, hope, and optimism, especially from the youth vote. But Bernie warns us that this isn\u2019t about electing one man, it\u2019s about a political revolution. More than anything, we need to understand, embrace and own this.\n\nMuch has been said recently about the \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d movement. The idea that, should Bernie not receive the Democratic nomination, we should write in his name (splitting the Democratic vote), abstain, or vote for the Republican candidate (likely Donald Trump) sends shivers down the spine of any progressive. However, if Clinton clinches the nomination, should we support her? Perhaps not\u2014and here\u2019s why. If we know anything, it\u2019s that either Democrat in the White House will reinvigorate the Tea Party. But the enthusiasm and energy of Bernie progressives will evaporate during a Clinton administration. Progressives, again, will sit down. This is a recipe for disaster.\n\nBut wouldn\u2019t a Clinton administration be better than a Republican one? We have good reason to think not. Bernie is the only viable candidate running who hasn\u2019t already been bought by big campaign contributors. Wall Street, the anti-environmental Oil Industry, and other non-progressive interests will want their usual, disproportionate seat at the table. How can a Clinton administration deny them such access after they paid her so much for it? It isn\u2019t an unreasonable or unfair question.\n\nShould Sanders become the 45th President of the United States he will lead a progressive political revolution, encouraging and empowering grass roots movements to fight the inevitable backlash from conservatives. This is imperative to succeed with any progressive agenda in the face of moderate congressional Democrats and dug-in, right-wing Republicans. This is ideal.\n\nHowever, should a proponent of a Christian Caliphate like Cruise or a neo-authoritarian racist like Trump win the general election, which political revolution will be energized? The answer is clear\u2014progressives will STAND UP! We\u2019d be energized, if not desperate, to organize and act in order to take our country back. Enough would be ENOUGH! We only need to see the passion of Bernie supporters to know it isn\u2019t a fantasy. A major progressive movement, perhaps led by Bernie, could arguably sweep Congress in the mid-terms of 2018.\n\nIf Bernie loses, progressives can\u2014and should\u2014feel completely justified in standing up for what is right by rejecting another four to eight years of politics-as-usual, go-nowhere, gridlock in Washington.\n\nPatrick Westerberg\n\nPatrick Westerberg is an undergraduate at the University of Oregon pursuing a BS in General Social Sciences.
