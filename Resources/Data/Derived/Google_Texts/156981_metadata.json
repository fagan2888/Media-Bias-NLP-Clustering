While a phenomenon known as color constancy ended up explaining this particular debate, some still argue over what two colors \u201cThe Dress\u201d really is. Thankfully, AsapSCIENCE is here to explain the secret behind this new video and show how we can use it as a measure of our eyesight.\n\nAt the start of the video, you probably see a somewhat blurry image of Albert Einstein, but if you stand up and move away from your computer you\u2019ll start to notice another famous face that is a little easier on the eyes: Marilyn Monroe. Don\u2019t be alarmed or call in your friend for a second opinion. You just passed this eyesight test. What you\u2019re seeing is a \u201chybrid image,\u201d or a combination of two images.\n\nThe picture of Albert Einstein is easier to distinguish up close, but almost impossible to see from a distance because it consists of hard, detailed lines. The picture of Marilyn Monroe, on the other hand, is made up of soft outlines, meaning it is easy to see even from a distance. \u201cHybrid image\u201d tests are used for research purposes by Dr. Aude Olivia from MIT to show the different levels our visual perception system can operate at.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "marilyn, monroe, or, albert, einstein, find, out, how, good, your, eyesight, really", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Forget \"The Dress\" debate.
