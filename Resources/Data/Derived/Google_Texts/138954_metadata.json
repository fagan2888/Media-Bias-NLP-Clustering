From Jan.1 to April 20, 425 people dialed their number, seeking help with dental emergencies.\n\nThere are options in Licking County to help alleviate their pain. The Look Up Dental Clinic offers free appointments to people who need teeth pulled because of infection.\n\nBut people in pain usually don't want to wait. Many of them head to the emergency room for antibiotics and painkillers. Those solve the problem temporarily, but don't treat the underlying problems with their teeth and gums. They'll be in pain again and the cycle will continue, said Dr. Geoffrey Bauman, chairman of the Look Up Dental board.\n\n\"There are a lot of people (in this county) who have a lot of dental needs, but a lot of people go around with those needs being unmet,\" Bauman said.\n\nBauman and his colleagues aren't the only ones concerned about this.\n\nDuring the two-year study that produced its recent Community Blueprint, United Way of Licking County found many of the people it surveyed were worried about the county's most vulnerable populations not having access to dental care.\n\nData from Pathways of Central Ohio seems to emphasize the need.\n\nIn 2011, 520 people contacted 211 looking for help with a dental crisis. As word spread about the Look Up Dental Clinic in 2012, that number increased to 2,890 people, then 3,011 people in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, the number of calls dropped to 2,009 then to 1,387 in 2015, which Bauman theorized was partly due to Medicaid expansion.\n\nWith changes brought on by the Affordable Care Act, some people are getting the care they need - but many are still slipping through the cracks, said Walt Zang, program director of the 211/crisis hotline at Pathways.\n\nIt's a problem that needs to be addressed because poor dental health has significant costs, said Dr. Paul Casamassimo, a professor at Ohio State University's College of Dentistry and past president of the Ohio Dental Association.\n\nDental problems have been linked to heart disease, dementia, respiratory infections, diabetic complications and other health problems.\n\nHaving unattractive or missing teeth can also effect a persons confidence, especially when they are living in poverty and looking for work, Casamassimo said.\n\n\"It\u2019s pretty clear that a healthy mouth is an asset when looking for employment and trying to interact socially,\" he said.\n\nSome options but barriers remain\n\nLicking County kids from low-income families have several options when it comes to dental care.\n\nLicking Memorial Hospital collaborates with the Licking County Foundation to offers a dental clinic for uninsured children. Children's Hospital in Columbus also offers a kids dental clinic on a sliding scale.\n\nThe Licking County Health Department provides a dental sealant program for schools in Licking, Knox and Coshocton counties, said Mary Beth Hagstad, director of nursing. Health educators visit local third graders in school to teach them about brushing and flossing.\n\nThose programs help, but dentists around the state still face an uphill battle, Casamassimo said.\n\n\"In Ohio, about half of our children have tooth decay by the age of 5,\" he said. \"And that continues to be a problem for those kids.\"\n\nProviding dental care and education for adults is typically even more challenging, Casamassimo said.\n\n\"Kids tend to be able to get dental care through 18 years of age, but from 21 to 35 - maybe because they are marginally employed or unemployed or have other priorities - they are not seeking dental care. By the time they experience dental pain, their teeth are in bad shape and it\u2019s very hard to take care of them. The diseased teeth need to be pulled and crowned and that starts them on the path of loosing their teeth in a relatively young age.\"\n\nThe Ohio Dental Association and the Ohio Department of Health Dental OPTIONS program can match low-income uninsured Ohioans with volunteer dentists, Casamassimo said\n\nMuskingum and Knox counties have healthcare centers with dental clinics that also do preventative work, such as fillings and cleanings. The Ohio State University Dental School sees some patients on a sliding scale, Hagstad said.\n\nBut transportation can be a barrier to those services, Zang said.\n\n\"We have to send these individuals out of our county, but it doesn't do me any good to send someone to Zanesville when they don't have a way to get there,\" he said.\n\nFor people with urgent need, the Look Up Dental Clinic is their best bet. But they have to meet certain criteria, Zang said.\n\nEligible patients must be uninsured, must meet income guidelines and be complaining of pain that is a seven or higher on a 10 point pain scale.\n\nThe only service the clinic provides is extractions. So anyone trying to have teeth pulled for dentures or struggling with a cavity or their wisdom teeth isn't going to find help there, he added.\n\nBetween Jan. 1 and April 20, the Look Up Clinic scheduled 121 patients and turned away 121 other individuals, he said.\n\nThe costs of dental care\n\nAlthough 211 continues to get calls, the Look Up Clinic has seen a decrease in patients over the last few years, Bauman said.\n\nDentists used to volunteer twice a week but have cut their time at the clinic to one half day a week. Sometimes only some of the patients on the schedule show up.\n\nThat might be because they found temporary relief at the emergency room, because they have a work conflict or had difficulty getting to the appointment, he said. Some people might just be afraid of the dentist. Others might have been able to get dental coverage through Medicaid.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act prompted Ohio's Medicaid expansion, more people have dental coverage for the first time. But that doesn't guarantee they'll find a provider that accepts it, Casamassimo said.\n\n\"Medicaid reimbursement is so poor - around 38 cents on the dollar - many dentists chose not to take it because they lose money,\" he said.\n\nOhio needs to strengthen its Medicaid system so more dentists will have incentive to take on those patients. But even those with private insurance might be skipping appointments because of costs, Casamassimo said.\n\nSome families are underinsured or have such high deductibles they can't afford to regularly see a dentist, he said.\n\n\"They can't get routine preventative care,\" he said. \"They have to make some hard choices. Do we go to the dentist or do we save that money for something else.\"\n\nA preventable problem\n\nThere aren't many mysteries left in dentistry, Bauman said. With the proper care, almost all dental disease is completely preventable.\n\n\"It's one of the the few things in healthcare that is assured,\" he said. \"If you could get people to do what they are supposed to do, it would really help control it.\"\n\nThe challenge for dentists and community members is to educate people to care for their teeth while giving them the resources to do so, he said.\n\nSomething as simple and inexpensive as flossing every day can help make a big difference. Although it's not visually appealing or marketable, it goes a long way., Bauman said.\n\nGetting more education, more frequently in schools is one way to promote better hygiene. Another option is to encourage primary caregivers to get engaged in promoting dental care.\n\n\"We need to be cooperating,\" he said. \"Dentists need to refer families to doctors and doctors need to be doing preventative (dental health) counseling.\"\n\nBut education is only one piece of the puzzle, Casamassimo said.\n\nCommunities plagued by dental problems usually also struggle with poverty, addiction, unemployment and physical health problems such as heart disease.\n\nIt's difficult for families to think about their teeth when they are struggling to put food on the table or find work.\n\n\"We are never going to stop it until we turn around these communities,\" he said. \"Until we can fix some of the underlying problems, we will be playing catch up and treating these emergency problems.\"\n\najeffries@newarkadvocate.com\n\n740-328-8544\n\nTwitter: @amsjeffries\n\nLearn more\n\nFor more information about the Look Up Clinic and other dental resources for families in need, call 2-1-1 or 740-345-4357.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/27M0htj", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Although Licking County has some resources, more is needed to help low income adults who need dental care.", "og": {"site_name": "The Newark Advocate", "description": "Although Licking County has some resources, more is needed to help low income adults who need dental care.", "title": "Dental care dismissed or ignored by many in Licking Co.", "url": "http://www.newarkadvocate.com/story/news/local/2016/05/21/dental-care-dismissed-ignored-many-licking-co/83970588/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/newarkadvocate.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although Licking County has some resources, more is needed to help low income adults who need dental care.", "title": "Dental care dismissed or ignored by many in Licking Co.", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7e7b71ca841b77b2a5e78b83dc13dc3b43c3f8b1/c=0-0-1799-1799&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/06/OHGroup/Newark/635981303399410346-02-NEW-050616-look-up-dental-ML.JPG", "creator": "@newarkadvocate", "site": "@newarkadvocate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=896410125", "fb": {"app_id": 125418460841564}, "article": {"author": 12315851}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "dental care, Look Up Dental Clinic, Newark, Licking County"}, "article_summary": "\"Kids tend to be able to get dental care through 18 years of age, but from 21 to 35 - maybe because they are marginally employed or unemployed or have other priorities - they are not seeking dental care.\nBuy Photo Dr. Jeffrey Kirian provides dental services for a patient Friday morning at the Look Up Dental Clinic.\nLicking Memorial Hospital collaborates with the Licking County Foundation to offers a dental clinic for uninsured children.\n(Photo: Michael Lehmkuhle/The Advocate)Buy Photo Story Highlights Although Licking County has some resources, more is needed to help low income adults who need dental care.\nThe Licking County Health Department provides a dental sealant program for schools in Licking, Knox and Coshocton counties, said Mary Beth Hagstad, director of nursing."}
