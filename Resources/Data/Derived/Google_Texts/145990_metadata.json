When the process breaks down \u2014 as it's done frequently in the past decade \u2014 the only way to keep the government funded is through what's called a continuing resolution. That measure is basically Congress' way of saying, \"Just keep spending what you're spending for a few more weeks or months, and maybe we can pass a real budget by then.\"\n\nThe current CR runs out \u2014 at midnight Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "A looming government shutdown may soon be averted, setting up another budget confrontation in December when the Treasury hits the debt ceiling.", "author": "John W.
