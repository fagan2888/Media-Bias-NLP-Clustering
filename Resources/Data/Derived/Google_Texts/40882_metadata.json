I\u2019d also like to shine a light on efforts at budget reform, which I\u2019ve supported and researched as an academic and a practitioner.\n\nShould we judge this book by its cover?\n\nOne look at the budget\u2019s cover might well raise questions about the president\u2019s desire for compromise. Republicans may be wondering if it was intended to taunt them.\n\nUsually budget covers have solid backgrounds in blue or green. But this year President Obama broke with tradition by embellishing his budget with a picture of the tallest peak in the United States, Mt. Denali. Once called Mt. McKinley, Obama renamed it by executive action last August, angering some Republicans for diminishing their former standard-bearer\u2019s renown.\n\nThe White House emphasized that the image was meant to celebrate the administration\u2019s executive actions on climate change, which were featured in the budget\u2019s narrative.\n\nMany Republicans still claim publicly that climate change will not happen, that the fact \u201cDenali\u201d is an anagram of \u201cdenial\u201d is just a coincidence. But the choice of cover may be Obama\u2019s way of signaling that he will continue to go it alone in his final year by issuing more executive actions rather than legislating through Congress.\n\nIt takes two\n\nObama\u2019s ability to govern by executive orders alone is constrained because many executive orders are not \u201cself-executing.\u201d In other words, money is required for agencies to carry them out.\n\nThe Constitution grants the legislative branch the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d; thus, Congress\u2019 assent is necessary to change most spending priorities. Gaining such approval has been difficult for Obama since the Republicans retook control of Congress in the 2010 election\u2014hence the executive actions, even if their effects are limited by insufficient funding.\n\nYet similarly, a Republican desire to go it alone\u2014by passing spending plans that include large cuts\u2014is also unrealistic. In the end, the president has a veto over appropriation bills, and can insist that executive priorities be included in those bills along with the legislature\u2019s priorities.\n\nCompromise between the branches, in other words, is essential for government budgeting.\n\nThis reality was ignored when President Richard Nixon insisted that he need not follow enacted appropriation bills. In response, Congress passed the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which reasserted its power over the purse.\n\nBut the act went beyond that by establishing a process for passing a so-called concurrent resolution\u2014one that doesn\u2019t require a president\u2019s signature. This was a big shift from the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, in which Congress tasked the president with proposing a comprehensive budget. Now Congress can attempt to set out its own broad vision, which may greatly differ from the president\u2019s.\n\nIn nine of the last 18 years, however, Congress has failed to enact concurrent budget resolutions. And regardless of whether a concurrent resolution is adopted, Congress and the president still have to agree on appropriation bills and changes to other spending and tax laws to put a detailed budget into place.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, who has authored ambitious plans that would have drastically cut domestic discretionary and entitlement spending, has recently warned his party that if they want to pass the 12 regular appropriation bills on time (and then go home to campaign), they would have to accept the levels agreed to in 2015, rather than the lower levels now demanded by many of his Tea Party members.\n\nWhere agreement begins\n\nThe reasons behind Republicans\u2019 sharp rhetorical response to the president\u2019s budget are obvious but mask important ways in which Obama\u2019s priorities are in tune with theirs.\n\nCentral to the GOP platform has long been a desire to cut spending to avoid excessive debt. Returning to this year\u2019s budget cover, one Republican legislator dubbed it \u201cliterally a mountain of debt\u201d (since it\u2019s covered with cold, hard glaciers rather than cash, presumably he meant \u201cfiguratively\u201d).\n\nIt\u2019s true that Democrats want to increase domestic spending above the levels agreed to in 2015, yet some of the president\u2019s proposals will be endorsed by Republicans despite their public rejection of all things Obama because both parties actually agree on their importance.\n\nThe best example of this is cybersecurity spending, which would rise 35 percent in the president\u2019s budget in response to recent hacks by China, Russia and other countries. Other major proposals that have a good chance of being adopted include an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, and increased spending for cancer research and opioid abuse treatment. Republicans will probably also support the requested increase for maternal and child home visiting programs, an example of spending that research has shown to have significant benefits.\n\nThe largest spending increases and expanded tax preferences in the Obama budget are for clean energy and transportation, expanded child care and pre-K education, grants for college completion, reform of unemployment insurance and the creation of a wage insurance program. These aren\u2019t likely to meet with much support on the other side of the aisle.\n\nBut despite the Republicans\u2019 \u201cmountain of debt\u201d allusion, the White House proposals if adopted in full actually wouldn\u2019t add to the deficit. The increased spending would be entirely offset, partly by spending cuts in other areas of the budget, but mostly by tax increases, including a $10.25 \u201cfee\u201d on each barrel of oil produced in the U.S. and restrictions on avoidance schemes used by the wealthy and businesses.\n\nWhile that runs into another major plank of Republicans, lower taxes, it also hints at another area of broad agreement: the need to reform the tax code. Congressional leaders have said that this year they will draft reforms to business taxes in expectation of moving legislation in 2017. The proposals in Obama\u2019s budget that would limit corporate tax \u201cinversions\u201d and \u201cearnings stripping\u201d will be a part of that discussion.\n\nA realistic blueprint\n\nBut even where the two parties don\u2019t agree, Republican appropriators will, as is always the case, have to rely on the extensive work put into developing the executive budget.\n\nEach agency gives the relevant appropriations subcommittee a \u201cjustification book\u201c with hundreds and sometimes thousands of pages of detailed information on how it plans to spend its allocation. The staff resources of Congress are no match for this complexity, meaning it must concentrate on major items of dispute.\n\nThe administration also has an advantage in allocating spending to specific areas of the country, since Congress\u2019 moratorium on earmarks tied its own hands.\n\nIn this campaign season, it should also be noted that deficit reduction advocates have judged Obama\u2019s budget to be financially realistic, unlike the platforms of almost all of the other candidates. The tax reduction plans of Republicans would add trillions of dollars to our national debt, and the transition to Senator Sanders\u2019 proposed single-payer health system would be massive compared with the relatively incremental approach of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUltimately the Obama budget will leave an important legacy of policy proposals that have been scrutinized by the executive branch. This is particularly the case for the ongoing restructuring of the health care system. Many suggested health savings in President George W. Bush\u2019s last budget were included in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nReforming the process\n\nWhile budget realities will lead Congress to rely somewhat on the president\u2019s budget, a bipartisan effort to reform the budget process is still essential.\n\nCongress\u2019s failure to budget effectively reached its nadir during the government shutdown of 2013. In recent years, various experiments with would-be \u201caction-forcing triggers\u201d did not lead to the results their users said they wanted. For example, refusing to increase the debt limit was not a practical threat; given that Congress had already permitted spending above the taxes it imposed, borrowing was necessary to close that financing gap.\n\nReformers have periodically suggested as an alternative to the concurrent resolution process a joint budget resolution, in which the president and the congressional leadership negotiate a general budget framework for the upcoming year\u2014or in the case of a biennial process, for the next two years.\n\nAd hoc, limited versions of this biennial process were adopted in the Bipartisan Budget Acts of 2013 and 2015. Both acts increased caps on discretionary spending (the amounts provided by the appropriations committees) above the very low and politically unrealistic levels required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. That act created a bipartisan \u201csupercommittee\u201d tasked with reaching a specified amount of deficit reductions through tax and spending changes. Its members failed to agree, resulting in automatic spending cuts.\n\nA delayed reaction to this mess is that there is now growing interest in creating a new \u201cregular order\u201d for the budget process. The House and Senate budget committees have started to hold hearings, and a group of experts called the National Budgeting Roundtable has been discussing reform options.\n\nTo be successful, reforms will have to restore norms of good budgeting, including that the two branches take each other seriously. While the odds are still long, it is possible that over the next year or two a major reform package will be developed that will be acceptable to both parties.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.
