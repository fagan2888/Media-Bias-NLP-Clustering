This skepticism grows out of my experience in China, where a messianic leader who ostensibly set out to eliminate poverty and create a perfect society instead wound up purging \u2014 through famine, torture and firing squad \u2014 over 10% of the population. Today, Mao Zedong\u2019s successors continue to abort 13 million children a year under an equally grandiose and misguided scheme to jump-start economic development, commonly known as the one-child policy.\n\nYet it is just such sweeping and dangerous ideas \u2014 of extirpating poverty for all time, of controlling population growth, of fundamentally remaking society into some kind of egalitarian earthly paradise \u2014 that now drive most Western foreign-aid programs. Sadly, such ideas have also infiltrated charities run by the Church, according to Cardinal Robert Sarah, the president of Cor Unum, the Vatican council responsible for Catholic charitable activity around the globe.\n\nThe result of this \u201cerroneous hermeneutic,\u201d as the good cardinal called it, is that \u201cthe hope of salvation found itself reduced to a temporal messianism and the understanding of Christian life to a form of humanitarian engagement. Many missionaries have practically abandoned evangelization and become invested exclusively in development, human promotion and the fight to \u2018eliminate poverty.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeaking in November 2012 to the heads of Caritas organizations from across Africa, the cardinal warned, \u201cThe great danger consists in believing that the objective of the charitable mission of the Church is to reform society, to fight for a more just or more democratic society. \u2026 Fundamentally, it belongs to the state to deal with social questions; that is not the immediate responsibility of the Church.\u201d\n\nOne reason for this weakening of Catholic identity in once-great Catholic charities is USAID; the U.S. Agency for International Development disburses its huge budget only to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that agree to play by its rules. And rule No. 1 is that you have to check your faith at the door. This means that Catholic organizations that take USAID money cannot preferentially hire or serve Catholics, and they must never, ever, under any circumstances, preach the Gospel.\n\nWhat does Cardinal Sarah have to say about taking money under these conditions? The cardinal to Caritas heads: \u201cAnd I would like to say, right here and now, that the Christian values and the ecclesial identity of the charitable action of the Church are not negotiable! [Catholic charities] must refuse any ideology contrary to the teaching of God transmitted by the Church and categorically reject all financial aid which imposes ideological conditions opposed to the magisterium.\u201d\n\nFew would dispute the fact that USAID is more than happy to, in effect, secularize Catholic charities \u2014 that is to say, to turn them into extensions of itself. Witness the callous way the Obama administration has tried to ram the contraceptive mandate down the throats of Catholics.\n\nBut we must at all costs resist such pressures, says the Cor Unum cardinal: \u201cWe can, thus, not let ourselves be absorbed by those who, with powerful means \u2014 financial, of the mass media and of a great manipulative capacity \u2014 want to spread \u2026 a philosophy of rights that we cannot accept.\u201d\n\nSo how does the Church understand and explain authentic Catholic charity? It must, the Church says, go hand-in-hand with the sacraments and the Gospel. As Pope Benedict wrote in the encyclical Deus Caritas Est (God Is Love), \u201cThe Church\u2019s deepest nature is expressed in her threefold responsibility: of proclaiming the word of God (kerygma-martyria), celebrating the sacraments (leitourgia) and exercising the ministry of charity (diakonia). These duties presuppose each other and are inseparable\u201d (25) [italics added].\n\nIn other words, you can\u2019t simply distribute mosquito nets and call it \u201cCatholic charity.\u201d You have to be preaching the Good News and celebrating the sacraments at one and the same time. Or in Cardinal Sarah\u2019s words, Catholic charity must not solely aim \u201cat social progress or the improvement in the material living conditions of people, but it seeks to bring men close to God, to the source of all good. It permits the light of Christ to enter the world.\u201d\n\nOf course, the only people who can bring the light of Christ into the world are Christians. And, among Christians, it is only Catholics and the Orthodox who celebrate the sacraments. So what Cardinal Sarah, reflecting on Deus Caritas Est, seems to be saying is that all of the employees of Catholic charities must be Catholic.\n\nIn fact, he makes that point explicitly later on in his speech: \u201cThe personal relationship with God, prayer and the frequenting of the sacraments is thus essential in order that those who work in the charitable organizations of the Church can be true witnesses of the love of Christ and will not fall into activism or secularism.\u201d\n\nHow can someone \u201cfrequent ... the sacraments\u201d or \u201chave a personal relationship with God\u201d if he or she is not a practicing Catholic? How can a Catholic charity retain its Catholic identity \u2014 and reject the impulse to remake societies along secular humanist lines \u2014 if it does not preferentially hire Catholics?\n\nIf the Church wants \u201cthose who work in the charitable organizations of the Church to be true witnesses of the love of Christ,\u201d then Catholic charities of all stripes must avoid taking government money \u2014 money that forbids them from \u201cdiscriminating\u201d in hiring \u2014 and instead actively recruit dedicated Catholic laypeople.\n\nWhen I imagine authentic Catholic charity at work, what comes to my mind and, I believe, to the minds of most people, are not huge, government-funded NGOs anyway. Rather, I remember a tiny nun who, in 1946, walked alone into the worst slum in the world. Her purse held only a few pennies \u2014 and she never did receive a multimillion-dollar grant from USAID \u2014 but her heart was overflowing with the love of God.\n\nMany years later, the woman we now know as Blessed Teresa of Calcutta defined the difference between the humanitarianism of the world and the charity of the Church. \u201cThe others do good because of something,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we do good because of Someone.\u201d\n\nDoing good for Christ will make all the difference in the world. Even if \u2014 perhaps, especially if \u2014 USAID won\u2019t fund it.\n\nSteve Mosher is the president of Population Research Institute.\n\nHe writes from Virginia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "COMMENTARY: Cardinal Robert Sarah of Cor Unum offers some guidelines. \n\tI must admit at the outset\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "COMMENTARY: Cardinal Robert Sarah of Cor Unum offers some guidelines.", "title": "What is Authentic Catholic Charity?", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/what-is-authentic-catholic-charity/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/CdlSarah.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/what-is-authentic-catholic-charity/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/CdlSarah.jpg", "description": "COMMENTARY: Cardinal Robert Sarah of Cor Unum offers some guidelines.", "card": "summary", "title": "What is Authentic Catholic Charity?"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register,", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "article_summary": "How can a Catholic charity retain its Catholic identity \u2014 and reject the impulse to remake societies along secular humanist lines \u2014 if it does not preferentially hire Catholics?\nWhen I imagine authentic Catholic charity at work, what comes to my mind and, I believe, to the minds of most people, are not huge, government-funded NGOs anyway.\nSo what Cardinal Sarah, reflecting on Deus Caritas Est, seems to be saying is that all of the employees of Catholic charities must be Catholic.\nIn other words, you can\u2019t simply distribute mosquito nets and call it \u201cCatholic charity.\u201d You have to be preaching the Good News and celebrating the sacraments at one and the same time.\nOr in Cardinal Sarah\u2019s words, Catholic charity must not solely aim \u201cat social progress or the improvement in the material living conditions of people, but it seeks to bring men close to God, to the source of all good."}
