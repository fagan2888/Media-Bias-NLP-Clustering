Larry Steve McQuilliams

A man who opened fire on the Mexican consulate, police headquarters and other buildings in Austin, Texas had ties to the Wichita area. Austin police identified the suspect as Larry Steven McQuilliams, 49.

Internet searches show McQuilliams spent years living in Wichita.

The man was then shot by a police sergeant outside the main entrance to police headquarters -- but authorities say it's not clear whether the shots were fatal, or whether the suspect took his own life.

Some of the buildings targeted are near Austin's popular Sixth Street entertainment district, where bars close at 2 a.m. -- about the same time the shootings began. The city's police chief says with all of the people who were on the streets, it's "very fortunate" that no one else was hurt.

Officers approached McQuilliams after he had been shot, but noticed cylinders in his vehicle, which was nearby, and discovered he was wearing a vest they thought may be rigged to explode. Officers retreated and a bomb squad was called. It was later determined the items were not explosive.

The fire at the consulate was extinguished before any significant damage was done to the building. The federal courthouse's guard house was shot several times, as was police headquarters -- which the chief says was "extensively damaged."
