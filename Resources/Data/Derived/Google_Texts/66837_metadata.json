The district budgeted for this and increased its contributions, he said.\n\nIn 2015, a provision of the Affordable Care Act will require employers to provide health insurance to all employees who work an average of 30 hours a week or more.\n\nAmarillo ISD has several hundred substitute teachers, some of which exceed the 30-hour mark regularly, Hoyt said, and he estimates the district will need to cover between 50 and 60 of them in the future.\n\nWhile some school districts in the state plan to cut substitutes\u2019 hours to keep them under the 30-hour threshold, Hoyt said that isn\u2019t part of Amarillo ISD\u2019s approach at the moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been discussed, but we really want to make sure that we do what\u2019s right for the children in the classroom,\u201d Hoyt said. \u201cWe have to be very careful that we don\u2019t disrupt the instructional experience in the process.\u201d\n\nHereford and Pampa independent school districts also don\u2019t plan to cut hours, superintendents said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still figuring out what the ramifications of the system are, but the guiding principle will be to do right by the people, so if that costs us a little more, it costs us a little more,\u201d Pampa ISD Superintendent David Young said.\n\nAbout 60 percent of Texas school employees are enrolled in the state\u2019s ActiveCare plan from the Teacher Retirement System of Texas.\n\nStarting Sept. 1, ActiveCare will eliminate one of its health insurance plans and some deductibles will go up $100 to $200. Caps on out-of-pocket costs will also rise $2,000 to $5,000 in some plans, according to TRS.\n\nPer employee, the state is required to contribute $75 per month, and school districts must contribute at least $150 per month, said Ann Fickle, legislation director for Texas Classroom Teacher Association.\n\nLast year, Canyon ISD raised its monthly contribution $25 to $275 per employee, said spokeswoman April McDaniel. Per employee, Pampa ISD contributes $250 each month and Hereford ISD contributes $225 each month, superintendents said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, all of the increases are passed on to the employee,\u201d said Hereford ISD superintendent Kelli Moulton. \u201cOur board has recognized that and has provided pay raises this year, with a 2.5 percent increase for salaried employees and a 6.6 percent increase for hourly. However, we realize that most of our employees will not see an increase in take-home pay or the bottom line because of rising health care costs.\u201d\n\nThis year, Pampa ISD employees will receive a 3 percent raise, Young said.\n\nAs districts attempt to keep up with these costs, the state\u2019s share hasn\u2019t increased since ActiveCare was created, Fickle said, and employee salaries have remained flat for the most part.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of employees are seeing, effectively, cuts on take-home pay between flattening salary increases and rising insurance rates and other costs,\u201d she said.\n\nA state hearing next week will focus on school employee health insurance, as well as state retirement plans.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to see is not cutting back on benefits or changing the structure of plans, but what we really need is funding assistance from the state,\u201d Fickle said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Latest News, Local News, News", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "School employees are facing higher health insurance deductibles and out-of-pocket fees as districts prepare for a federal requirement to cover all employees working at least 30 hours a week kicking in next year.", "title": "Insurance costs rise for school staff", "url": "http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2014-07-04/school-employees-face-higher-insurance-costs", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/AISD%20Logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "School employees are facing higher health insurance deductibles and out-of-pocket fees as districts prepare for a federal requirement to cover all employees working at least 30 hours a week kicking in next year.Amarillo Independent School District has self-funded health insurance, and its costs have risen $1 million this year, Chief Financial Officer Les Hoyt said.
