The Precision Medicine Initiative was announced by President Obama on January 30, 2015.\n\nMany pathologists, clinical chemists, and medical laboratory scientists recognize that such a program would pump additional funds into the research and development of new diagnostic tests that are designed to aid physicians in their practice of precision medicine.\n\nThe big question is how to pay for this initiative. President Obama proposed budgeting $215 million to fund this effort. But such funding must be approved by a Congress that is at odds with the President on nearly every issue. Additionally, The American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) warns that the Food and Drug administration\u2019s (FDA) 2014 announcement to regulate laboratory developed testing services (LDTs) is in conflict with the President\u2019s initiative.\n\n\u201cThe clinical laboratory community applauds the President\u2019s leadership in the area of personalized medicine, particularly the new funding proposed for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI),\u201d said Alan Mertz, President of ACLA, in an ACLA press release.\n\n\u201cHowever, the FDA\u2019s push to regulate laboratory developed testing services through the \u2018Draft Guidance\u2019 documents issued last year would dramatically slow patient access to vital diagnostic tools and runs counter to the President\u2019s new initiative to promote precision medicine,\u201d he continue. \u201cMost of the new molecular and genetic diagnostic tests that are at the very heart of precision medicine are LDTs, and FDA\u2019s proposal would severely impede the development of new LDTs and the advancement of precision medicine.\u201d\n\nInitiative Calls for Investing $215M in Mechanisms to Support New Research\n\nLed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the President\u2019s Initiative would fund research and facilitate collaborative public-private efforts to leverage advances in genomics. It would involve stakeholders in healthcare as well as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). It also would recruit expertise from multiple sectors and forge partnerships with existing research cohorts, patient groups, and the private sector to capitalize on previous genomic discoveries as well as work currently under way. The funding would get divided three ways:\n\nThe NIH would receive $130 million to:\n\nLaunch a national \u201cpatient-powered\u201d research cohort consisting of scientists and a million volunteers,\n\nActively engage study participants in research,\n\nShare research data with cohort members, and\n\nEmploy technological advances to mine health information for comprehensive results.\n\nThe FDA would receive $10 million to:\n\nAcquire expertise to develop a new approach for evaluating next-generation sequencing technologies,\n\nDetermine which genetic changes are important to patient care,\n\nPromote innovation in genetic sequencing technology,\n\nEnsure test accuracy and reliability, and,\n\nAdvance the development of high quality, curated databases to support the regulatory structure.\n\nThe ONC would receive $5 million to:\n\nDevelop interoperability standards to ensure privacy during secure exchange of data across systems,\n\nEmpower patients and clinicians, and,\n\nAdvance individual, community, and population health.\n\nThe National Institute of Cancer (NIC) would receive $70 million to scale up efforts to identify genomic drivers in cancer, and then apply that knowledge to develop more effective cancer treatments. This would include:\n\nSupporting expansion of genetically based clinical trials in partnership with drug companies,\n\nEstablishing a national \u201ccancer knowledge network\u201d that generates and shares new knowledge to fuel scientific discovery and guide treatment approaches,\n\nTesting therapy combinations that target a tumor\u2019s molecular structure,\n\nDeveloping solutions to drug resistance,\n\nDeveloping approaches to assessing therapy response and resistance, and,\n\nDeveloping new tumor cell models to help clinicians predict response to drug combinations and define mechanisms of resistance.\n\nOverall Goal Is to Apply Precision Knowledge to Patient Care\n\nVolunteers in the study cohort would share their genomic profiles, biological specimens, and health and lifestyle data with the scientists by granting the researchers access to their electronic medical records (EHR).\n\nDiagnostic tests and image studies would be available to the researchers, as well as lifestyle data, including diet, environmental exposures, and activity, which would be tracked by mobile health devices. Study volunteers, in turn, would assist in the designing of the studies, and have access to their own health and research data to help them make informed health choices.\n\nThis is an exciting development for pathologists and medical laboratory scientists. Many lab professionals will be called upon to develop new molecular diagnostic tests based on precision medicine research results, as well as genetic sequencing. The proposed funding for this initiative illustrates how whole-genome sequencing is poised to move into mainstream medicine. The question yet to be answered, however, is how quickly Congress might act to fund this initiative.\n\n\u2014Patricia Kirk\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nFACT SHEET: President Obama\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative\n\nKalorama: White House Precision Medicine Initiative Spotlights Tissue Diagnostics\n\nPrecision Medicine Initiative\n\nFDA Pushes Forward with Plans to Regulate Laboratory-Developed Tests, in a Move that Will Impact Many Clinical Laboratory Companies and Pathology Groups\n\nACLA Lauds President\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative, Warns FDA Move to Regulate Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) Conflicts with White House Proposal", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "pathology, medical laboratory, clinical laboratory, medical laboratory scientist, clinical chemist, personalized medicine, precision medicine, nih, national institutes of health, president obama, molecular diagnostic test, cancer, white house, food and drug administration, fda, u.s. congress, genetics, office of the national coordinator for health information technology, health and human services, hhs, dna sequencing, next-generation sequencing technology, obama administration, national institute of cancer, nic, genomics, electronic medical record, molecular diagnostics  ,cancer,clinical chemist,clinical laboratory,dna sequencing,electronic medical record,fda,food and drug administration,genetics,genomics,health and human services,hhs,medical laboratory,medical laboratory scientist,molecular diagnostic test,molecular diagnostics,national institute of cancer,national institutes of health,next-generation sequencing technology,nic,nih,obama administration,office of the national coordinator for health information technology,personalized medicine,precision medicine,president obama,u.s. congress,white house,compliance, legal, and malpractice,laboratory hiring & human resources,laboratory management and operations,laboratory news,laboratory operations,laboratory pathology", "description": "A new Precision Medicine Initiative announced by President Obama January 30, 2015, could be a boon to pathologists, clinical chemists, and lab scientists.
