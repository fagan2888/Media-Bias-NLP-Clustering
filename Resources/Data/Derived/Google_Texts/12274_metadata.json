It was a Wednesday in February, and she had traveled from the confines of the White House to a nearby Virginia high school to lecture students on applying for \u201cfree\u201d federal financial aid for college.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be the valedictorian\u201d Mrs. Obama continued. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to major in a certain subject. You don\u2019t even have to be at the very bottom of the income ladder to receive the money. It\u2019s the single most important thing you can do for your future.\u201d\n\nDetermining the \u201csingle most important thing\u201d for a young person\u2019s future is a task that might otherwise make parents, teachers and counselors pause and contemplate. But for the wife of our current President the answer is obvious: get your government handout before you do anything else.\n\nSadly, the generation that is being told to \u201cjust sign up\u201d by both the President and his wife is a generation that will feel the pain of America\u2019s decline, likely worse than any other. And both present-day high school and college students, along with recent college graduates, are already feeling the pain of at least a few decades of flawed policies that have emanated from both government and academia.\n\nConsider these harsh realities:\n\nAmerica\u2019s \u201cinformation-based, knowledge-based economy\u201d has reached its limits: For at least the last twenty-five years or so the U.S. has been on a pathway of not manufacturing much, not exporting much, and not utilizing its own natural resources. In the early days of the digital technology revolution this approach to constructing our economy worked pretty well \u2013 our technological components may have been built in China, Vietnam or India, but the blue prints, the \u201cintellectual capital\u201d that laid the ground work for it all, came from \u201ceducated\u201d Americans.\n\nBut as technology has matured, the demand for new \u201cblueprints\u201d (and for those who create them) has substantially slowed-down. Now suddenly in the second decade of the 21st century knowing how to operate a lathe or a drill press is once again a valuable bit of knowledge, and the jobs that aren\u2019t being created for our lack of using oil, timber and mineral resources are painfully apparent.\n\nThe global economy has changed, but academia hasn\u2019t adequately adapted: From K-12 to the post-secondary level, the world of American education perpetuates itself with phrases and clich\u00e9s: \u201cBe cool, stay in school.\u201d \u201cEducation is the key.\u201d \u201cA college education gives a young person $1 million to $2 million more in lifetime earnings.\u201d\n\nThat all sounds wonderful. But tell these things to a 25 year old with a bachelor\u2019s degree, $40,000 in student loan debt and no job, and ask how good that makes them feel.\n\nNobody wants to see an increase in \u201cdrop outs.\u201d But there are grave fiscal and social costs awaiting our country for having produced a generation of Americans who are well educated, yet can\u2019t find a productive place in our economy. Like Mrs. Obama\u2019s vacuous \u201cyou don\u2019t have to major in a certain subject\u201d rhetoric, far too many American educational institutions have failed to concern themselves adequately with determining which courses of study can prepare a student to contribute to the economy - and which of them will not. A degree in petroleum engineering makes one more employable than a degree in gender studies \u2013 but admitting this is taboo in contemporary academia.\n\nWhat if American high schools produced graduates who were both college-ready and equipped with a marketable skill? What if high schoolers had to master HTML as a foreign-language requirement? America would be in a much better place if these and other practical ideas were our reality.\n\nThe rest of the industrialized world is leaving America behind: As America drapes itself in lofty dreams of \u201cgreen energy\u201d and climate change taxes, the other industrialized nations of the world are running in the opposite direction from the U.S. Australia is set to lead the world this year with timber and iron ore production, while Canada and New Zealand are expanding their nations\u2019 oil output. Even the nations of the European Union have abandoned most of their so-called \u201cclimate change regulations\u201d so as to enable more manufacturing and natural resource development.\n\nAs a result, these nations are getting out of debt and creating new prosperity. Australia finished 2013 by eliminating their national debt. Canada is on-track for zero government debt by 2015. And Europe, while riddled in debt, is finally correcting course with fiscal and environmental policies \u2013 something the U.S. doesn\u2019t seem prepared to do.\n\nIf today\u2019s unemployed American youth can find their way individually while at the same time demanding more rational policies from government, business, and academia, they just might save themselves, and our country, in the process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cCompleting this form is a critical start to completing your education,\u201d noted First Lady Michelle Obama..05/24/2016 1:11:16AM EST.", "author": "Austin Hill", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\u201cCompleting this form is a critical start to completing your education,\u201d noted First Lady Michelle Obama.", "title": "- \u201cEpic Fail:\u201d America\u2019s Boomers and Gen-Xers Leave A Legacy Of Foolishness", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/austinhill/2014/02/23/epic-fail-americas-boomers-and-genxers-leave-a-legacy-of-foolishness-n1799370", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/36/9ef5fd23-ad02-4061-a3a8-2e8e7fa65855.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\u201cCompleting this form is a critical start to completing your education,\u201d noted First Lady Michelle Obama.", "title": "- \u201cEpic Fail:\u201d America\u2019s Boomers and Gen-Xers Leave A Legacy Of Foolishness", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/austinhill/2014/02/23/epic-fail-americas-boomers-and-genxers-leave-a-legacy-of-foolishness-n1799370", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/36/9ef5fd23-ad02-4061-a3a8-2e8e7fa65855.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\u201cEpic Fail:\u201d America\u2019s Boomers and Gen-Xers Leave A Legacy Of Foolishness, Austin Hill, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9de3\"", "article_summary": "What if American high schools produced graduates who were both college-ready and equipped with a marketable skill?\nIt was a Wednesday in February, and she had traveled from the confines of the White House to a nearby Virginia high school to lecture students on applying for \u201cfree\u201d federal financial aid for college.\nYou don\u2019t even have to be at the very bottom of the income ladder to receive the money.\nAnd Europe, while riddled in debt, is finally correcting course with fiscal and environmental policies \u2013 something the U.S. doesn\u2019t seem prepared to do.\nBut for the wife of our current President the answer is obvious: get your government handout before you do anything else."}
