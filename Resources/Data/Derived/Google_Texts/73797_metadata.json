Screenshot / The Daily Mail\n\nDr. Kaldarbek Abdramanov, a cardiac surgeon in Kyrgyzstan, was performing open-heart surgery on patient Tagir Karabayev in a state-run clinic when the hospital lights went out. Not wanting to risk the surgery, Dr. Abdramanov\u2019s team of surgeons took their phones out and focused the mobile light on the patient\u2019s open chest.\n\nRemarkably, the patient survived. \u201cBut these are the kind of extreme circumstances under which we perform operations on hearts that have stopped beating,\u201d Abdramanov said. \u201cI am not sure if it is a crime or an act of heroism.\u201d\n\nThese extreme circumstances are due in large part to Kyrgyzstan\u2019s government's extreme effort to conserve electricity. So, this means Dr. Abdramanov has performed surgery amid a blackout before, and he\u2019ll most likely do it again. Normally, he said, he\u2019ll rely on hydropower, which is electricity generated from moving water, but the water levels are so low in local rivers that it doesn\u2019t make much of a difference.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported that locals are now on a mission to raise money to buy a generator for the clinic. Even with proper lighting, the risks of open-heart surgery include heart attack or stroke, lung or kidney failure, blood clot and loss, as well as brain damage. It\u2019s insane to think how today\u2019s mobile technology may not only ensure patient survival, but it doesn\u2019t seem it exacerbated any of these risks.\n\nAfter you tip a hat to Abdramanov\u2019s skill and innovative team, watch the whole thing unfold in the video below.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "open, heart, surgery, only, cell, phones, light, kyrgyzstan, surgeons, improvise, after", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "You have to see how surgeons ensured patient survival after lights went out during open-heart surgery.", "title": "Open Heart Surgery \u2014 Made Possible By A Cell Phone's Light [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/open-heart-surgery-only-cell-phones-light-kyrgyzstan-surgeons-improvise-after-hospital-307413", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/18/open-heart-surgery-mobile-light.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "You have to see how surgeons ensured patient survival after lights went out during open-heart surgery.", "title": "Open Heart Surgery \u2014 Made Possible By A Cell Phone's Light [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/open-heart-surgery-only-cell-phones-light-kyrgyzstan-surgeons-improvise-after-hospital-307413", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/18/open-heart-surgery-mobile-light.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/18/open-heart-surgery-mobile-light.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-18T16:40:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-18T16:40:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "You have to see how surgeons ensured patient survival after lights went out during open-heart surgery."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0805\"", "article_summary": "You have to see how surgeons ensured patient survival after lights went out during open-heart surgery.\nScreenshot / The Daily MailDr. Kaldarbek Abdramanov, a cardiac surgeon in Kyrgyzstan, was performing open-heart surgery on patient Tagir Karabayev in a state-run clinic when the hospital lights went out.\nIt\u2019s insane to think how today\u2019s mobile technology may not only ensure patient survival, but it doesn\u2019t seem it exacerbated any of these risks.\nEven with proper lighting, the risks of open-heart surgery include heart attack or stroke, lung or kidney failure, blood clot and loss, as well as brain damage.\nNot wanting to risk the surgery, Dr. Abdramanov\u2019s team of surgeons took their phones out and focused the mobile light on the patient\u2019s open chest."}
