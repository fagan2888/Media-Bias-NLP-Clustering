Burwell.\n\nThe plaintiffs in that case, four Virginia residents, contend that federal law allows subsidies only in states that have established their own insurance marketplaces, not in states that rely on the federal exchange.\n\nRepublicans in Congress are drafting legislation to respond if the court blocks subsidies in more than 30 states where people buy insurance through the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Ms. Burwell on Wednesday denounced a leading Republican proposal, set forth in a bill introduced by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.\n\nThe bill, supported by at least 31 other Republican senators, would continue tax credits on premiums through August 2017 for consumers who might otherwise lose them as a result of a Supreme Court decision.\n\nThe Republican bill would also repeal provisions of the Affordable Care Act that mandate most Americans have health insurance and require larger employers to provide it.\n\n\u201cThis bill in its current form is repeal,\u201d Ms. Burwell said of Mr. Johnson\u2019s legislation. \u201cAnd the president has said he will not sign something that repeals the act.\u201d\n\nThe hearing got off to a fast start. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, skipped the usual pleasantries and jumped right into criticism of the health care law and the way it had been carried out by President Obama.\n\n\u201cObamacare is just flat busted,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t work, and no fix can change that fact. Its central principle is government control. That means higher prices, fewer choices and lower quality. The answer isn\u2019t just to tighten a few screws. The answer is to repeal and replace this law with patient-centered reforms.\u201d\n\nAfter listening to Ms. Burwell for two hours on Wednesday, Mr. Ryan expressed frustration. Administration officials, he said, \u201crefuse to entertain the notion that the health care law might be struck down,\u201d and they have not developed a backup plan.\n\nThe senior Democrat on the committee, Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, defended the law, telling Republicans: \u201cWhat\u2019s busted is not the Affordable Care Act, but your attacks on it, endless attacks. You never come up with single comprehensive alternative.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRepublicans complain about \u201cgovernment control,\u201d Mr. Levin said, but the fact is that \u201cmore and more people are getting insurance through the private sector.\u201d\n\nMr. Ryan said the administration was acting illegally in providing some types of financial assistance to reduce medical costs for low-income people.\n\n\u201cCongress wields the power of the purse,\u201d Mr. Ryan said. \u201cMore and more, the administration is acting like a purse snatcher.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies must reduce co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs for some people in health plans purchased through the new public insurance exchanges. The federal government reimburses insurers for the \u201ccost-sharing reductions.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans say the Obama administration never received an appropriation to make these payments to insurance companies.\n\nMr. Ryan and other Republicans assert that the spending violates the Constitution, which says, \u201cNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama requested the money as part of the budget he sent to Congress in April 2013, but Congress did not act on the request. Seeing the issue as an urgent priority, the administration began making the payments in early 2014, using money from a separate account established for tax refunds and tax credits.\n\nMs. Burwell said that the spending was legal. Republicans challenged the spending in a lawsuit filed against the administration in November.\n\nThat lawsuit, House of Representatives v. Burwell, is pending in Federal District Court here and is separate from the Supreme Court case.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150610120119, "twitter": {"description": "Sylvia
