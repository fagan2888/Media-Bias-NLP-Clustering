Brady Todd's girlfriend, Jessica Oliver was allowed a trip to visit home and family this 4th of July, and News 9 was there for his big surprise.

A welcome home for a woman in the Army, turns into one of the biggest moments of her life. Her boyfriend, who is in the National Guard has been planning this moment for months.

It's been a long journey for the young couple still living thousands of miles apart. Brady Todd's girlfriend, Jessica Oliver was allowed a trip to visit home and family this 4th of July, and News 9 was there for his big surprise.

"I'm really nervous, excited, really giddy," said Todd. "She's been wanting me to do this for a while, but I don't know. I was just waiting for the right moment. I know that I want to spend the rest of my life with her, and now is a good time to ask."

Oliver has no idea she's about to be proposed to. Minutes before her arrival from California, family and friends gathered downstairs near baggage claim holding welcome home signs.

Right now, the couple only sees each other every few months because of Oliver's training schedule. Todd is hoping to change that very soon. His family scrambles to get in place, moments before her arrival.

As soon as she steps off the escalator, Todd wasted no time getting down on one knee.

"Will you marry me," asked Todd.

"Definitely," said Oliver.

"I felt like I knew she was something special from the day that I met her, and I've always been trying to get to know her a little bit better," said Todd. "Now I'm glad to be spending the rest of my life with her."

"It feels really good," said Oliver. "It's nice to know that someone knows me and can prove it."

At some point the couple plans to sync up their careers so that they're in the same place. They're still working out the details of their wedding date.
