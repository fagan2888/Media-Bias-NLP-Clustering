Pittsburgh Opera\u2019s \u201cCosi fan tutte,\u201d which opened Saturday night at the Benedum Center, embraced the multifaceted character of the opera in a pared-down production that plumbed much of the opera\u2019s depth. The estimable British baritone Sir Thomas Allen, who also portrayed Don Alfonso, directed the production.\n\nMuch of the tragedy in this staging was singularly rendered by Danielle Pastin, who depicted Fiordiligi. The most complex character in the opera, Fiordiligi is torn up about betraying her fianc\u00e9, where her sister is somewhat flighty on the matter.\n\nAt first, this representation was necessarily one-dimensional: Fiordiligi followed the expectations she had for herself, and that others had for her. But Ms. Pastin revealed the character\u2019s internal battles throughout the opera, particularly in the second-act rondo \u201cPer pieta.\u201d\n\nThe soprano painted those interior emotions with a lively, expressive timbre, a natural music line and an even tone that supported her imaginative phrasing and stunning dynamic contrast. So tortured was this characterization that, by the end, one hoped she would end up with Ferrando, with whom she was more infatuated than the virile Guglielmo.\n\nAs Ferrando, tenor Christopher Tiesi had an appealing, sweet timbre but did not match that emotional dimensionality. He struggled with the role\u2019s highest notes and relied on vibrato where other expressive tools were needed.\n\nMr. Allen, in his Pittsburgh Opera debut, carried himself with the sturdy confidence of Don Alfonso and also served as a thoughtful director. During the Act I quintet, right before the young officers departed, teary-eyed, for their regiment, Don Alfonso mocked the lovers from the other side of the stage, reminding the audience that the whole thing was a sham. Most effective was his creative staging of the finale: He replaced Mozart\u2019s design, in which the original pairs reconcile, with a scenario that seemed better suited for this production. Still, the spare scenery designed by John Conklin looked too small for the Benedum stage.\n\nIn a comic delivery of Dorabella, former resident artist Jennifer Holloway offered a full, round tone, particularly in the upper register. Hadleigh Adams captured Guglielmo\u2019s machismo with a gravelly, dark-hued timbre. As Despina, Sari Gruber gave amusing takes on the maid\u2019s disguises, even if her voice could be tight in other moments.\n\nMusic director Antony Walker conducted the lithe orchestra, with the continuo played on an upright piano.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pittsburgh Opera embraced the complex characters in a pared-down production that plumbed much of the opera\u2019s depth.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "The premise of Mozart\u2019s \u201cCosi fan tutte\u201d is simple: Two men, Ferrando and Guglielmo, try to prove to their older, pessimistic friend that their fianc\u00e9s are faithful to them.
