But if the past is any guide, we may be headed for something worse.\n\nThat\u2019s because the activists currently amassing in Albuquerque are affiliated with the very groups whose actions have a propensity to lead to the killing, assaulting, harassing and attempting to murder clinic workers.\n\nThe Albuquerque protests are organized primarily by Operation Rescue and Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust. Their main target is the Southwestern Women\u2019s Options clinic, one of the few providing late-term abortions to women in need.\n\nThe focus on Albuquerque echoes the targeting of Wichita, Kan. Beginning in the early 1990s, antiabortion activists set their sights on Wichita because it was home to the medical practice of Dr. George Tiller, one of the few physicians in the Midwest who performed late-term abortions. Over the summer of 1991, antiabortion activists, largely organized by the group Operation Rescue, flocked to Wichita to assault Dr. Tiller\u2019s clinic and two others. Over six weeks there were 2,600 arrests. While antiabortion activists had committed acts of violence before, 1991\u2019s \u201cSummer of Mercy\u201d turned it up a notch. Since 1991, there have been 17 attempted murders of abortion providers. One of those providers was Dr. Tiller, who was shot twice in the arm outside his health center in 1993. Eight clinic workers have been killed, starting with Dr. David Gunn and two clinic receptionists, Shannon Lowney and Lee Ann Nichols, in 1994, and extending through 2009 when Dr. Tiller was shot to death at church.\n\nEvery clinic bombed or burned, and every clinician assaulted or killed, had been previously picketed, targeted or assailed by antiabortion groups like Operation Rescue and the Army of God. Operation Rescue issued \u201cWanted\u201d posters of abortion providers, often listing their home addresses. Several of the doctors listed on the posters, including David Gunn, George Patterson, John Britton and George Tiller, were killed by antiabortion zealots.\n\nThe individuals who commit acts of violence against abortion providers and clinics often have ties to antiabortion organizations. James Kopp, who killed Dr. Barnett Slepian in New York, worked alongside Operation Rescue\u2019s then-leader Randall Terry, driving with him from New York to Atlanta to begin the 1988 protests that put Operation Rescue on the map. In Atlanta, Kopp was jailed along with Terry and several Operation Rescue volunteers who went on to commit acts of violence: Rachelle \u201cShelley\u201d Shannon, who shot Dr. Tiller in 1993; John Arena, who used butyric acid to attack abortion clinics; Normal Weslin, the founder of the radical group the Lambs of Christ; and Andrew Cabot, who reportedly called a man charged with murdering abortion providers a \u201chero.\u201d\n\nMany of the murderers of abortion providers had some affiliation with the group the Army of God. Nearly all of the murders were condemned by mainstream antiabortion groups. But those groups didn\u2019t reconsider their rhetoric, organizing or tactics; they only amped them up.\n\nHere\u2019s how this works: The more radical antiabortion groups rally their supporters around a small handful of doctors and clinics who they\u2019ve decided are particularly bad. They use offensive, overhyped language to impress upon their (often very religious, sometimes young) followers the urgency of the situation, telling them that they are literally the only bulwarks standing between life and death for thousands of babies. They compare abortion clinic workers to Hitler, to Nazis, to mass murderers. Right-wing radio, blogs, news shows and other media pick up on those talking points and disseminate them to wider audiences.\n\nWhile that\u2019s happening, more mainstream antiabortion organizations and Republican political leaders capitalize on that energy to introduce antiabortion legislation, anti-contraception legislation and a slew of other laws intended to make abortions harder to get and birth control harder to access. Some of the radical antiabortion leaders transition into positions of power in more mainstream groups, or are elected into political office. What were once far-right views \u2014 for example, that contraception is the same as abortion \u2014 make their way into the mainstream, and are adopted by large contingents of the Republican Party. While radical positions are being mainstreamed, some of the more extreme activists who have spent years hearing that abortion providers are Nazis but the U.S. government won\u2019t do anything about it decide to take the next logical step and bomb a clinic or kill a doctor. The mainstream antiabortion organizations shake their heads in disapproval. Then they support the grass roots in rallying their extremist troops all over again.\n\nIn response, pro-choicers have to play at all levels. We\u2019re doing clinic defense. We\u2019re battling bills in state legislatures and in Congress. We\u2019re trying to support doctors, some of whom have been bankrupted by antiabortion forces, and many of whom have been terrorized off the job. We\u2019re trying to raise money to help low-income women afford abortions. We\u2019re trying to sound the alarm at the fact that the antiabortion strategy is to incrementally chip away at abortion rights, realizing that the American public is going to wake up one day and there will be few privacy rights left. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of energy left to go around to push for proactive pro-choice policies. So pro-choicers remain on defense, perpetually trying to prevent antiabortion groups from scoring more points, passing more legislation, and making life even more difficult for women. Sometimes we block their progress, but sometimes not. In the aggregate, they end up with the advantage.\n\nThat is the antiabortion ecosystem. It gives the more mainstream players plausible deniability when violence occurs, while allowing the radical actors to keep pro-choice activists and clinic workers in a state of fear. It\u2019s a multi-pronged onslaught that dismantles abortion rights and terrorizes providers out of working. It\u2019s not a handful of crazies shooting doctors, bombing clinics and blocking healthcare access. Shooting doctors, bombing clinics and blocking healthcare access are all necessary parts of the bigger picture.\n\nWichita is a good example. The Summer of Mercy brought out pro-lifers en masse, and a lot of them never left. Doctors were genocidal Nazis guilty of crimes against humanity. Wichita was \u201cAuschwichita.\u201d In 2003, Operation Rescue moved its headquarters there to continue the assault. Today, Operation Rescue operates out of a building owned by the group \u201cSurvivors of the Abortion Holocaust.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Antiabortion activists in Albuquerque are using the same rhetoric and tactics that led to Dr. Tiller's killing", "title": "How the right plays with murder: The antiabortion movement\u2019s cycle of violence", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Antiabortion activists in Albuquerque are using the same rhetoric and tactics that led to Dr. Tiller's killing", "title": "How the right plays with murder: The antiabortion movement\u2019s cycle of violence", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/10/how_the_right_plays_with_murder_the_anti_abortion_movements_cycle_of_violence/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/anti_abortion_protest.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Antiabortion activists in Albuquerque are using the same rhetoric and tactics that led to Dr. Tiller's killing", "title": "How the right plays with murder: The antiabortion movement\u2019s cycle of violence", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/anti_abortion_protest.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jill Filipovic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, albuquerque, anti-abortion, george tiller, New Mexico, wichita", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0016\"", "article_summary": "While antiabortion activists had committed acts of violence before, 1991\u2019s \u201cSummer of Mercy\u201d turned it up a notch.\nThe individuals who commit acts of violence against abortion providers and clinics often have ties to antiabortion organizations.\nOne of those providers was Dr. Tiller, who was shot twice in the arm outside his health center in 1993.\nHere\u2019s how this works: The more radical antiabortion groups rally their supporters around a small handful of doctors and clinics who they\u2019ve decided are particularly bad.\nSo pro-choicers remain on defense, perpetually trying to prevent antiabortion groups from scoring more points, passing more legislation, and making life even more difficult for women."}
