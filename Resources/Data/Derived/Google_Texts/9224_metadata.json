But more than 50,000 of them won\u2019t be able to keep their health plans beyond this year, potentially setting up a repeat of last fall\u2019s turmoil and frustration among people whose policies were discontinued.\n\nLast fall, the insurance department surveyed major carriers and found that 108,287 Connecticut residents had individual-market policies as of Nov. 21.\n\nThe department repeated the survey this year, and found that on June 30, individual policies covered 167,838 people. Insurer ConnectiCare saw a major gain in membership, eating into the dominance of Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\n\nThe new data appear to answer a major question posed by critics of the health law, who wondered whether people signing up for coverage through the state\u2019s new health insurance exchange had been uninsured or were simply buying different policies because their old plans had been discontinued. The growth indicates that the individual market has new members, not just old customers with new policies.\n\n\u201cIt was hard for us to know whether people were just moving from off-exchange to on-exchange, and it turns out that in fact there were quite a few net new participants and policy owners,\u201d said Deputy Insurance Commissioner Anne Melissa Dowling, who leads the department\u2019s health insurance initiatives.\n\nDowling said that finding is consistent with the department\u2019s experience handling customer service calls in recent months, many of which have been from people who seemed to need help understanding how to use an insurance policy for the first time.\n\nThe growth is also consistent with the findings of a survey of people who signed up for coverage through the state's exchange, Access Health CT. It found that 52 percent of people who bought private insurance through the new marketplace had previously been uninsured.\n\nBut in the absence of data from the rest of the insurance market, particularly employer-sponsored coverage, it\u2019s impossible to tell the extent to which the increase represents a gain in the total number of insured Connecticut residents, since some could have moved into the individual market after their employers stopped offering coverage.\n\nThe insurance market figures offer a snapshot of the individual market on two given days, but might not be representative of the full years. That\u2019s because many people in the individual market don\u2019t maintain their coverage for a full year. Some use it as a short-term patch between jobs or stop paying premiums and lose coverage.\n\nThe figures don\u2019t include coverage offered by small carriers like Celtic and Time insurance companies, which have fewer than 1,000 members.\n\nMany old plans that will soon end\n\nConnecticut's individual insurance market is currently a mix of plans from different eras, subject to different rules.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act -- the health law -- made significant changes to rules governing insurance policies, many of which took effect Jan. 1.\n\nMore than 60,000 state residents still have insurance policies that began before Jan. 1 and don\u2019t meet the new requirements of Obamacare.\n\nOf them, just over 10,000 people have \u201cgrandfathered\u201d plans -- meaning they were purchased before the health law passed in 2010 -- and can keep them as long as they\u2019re offered by the insurers.\n\nThe other 50,947 people will have to find new plans for next year because their plans can\u2019t legally be renewed.\n\nLast fall, as insurers notified members they were discontinuing plans that didn\u2019t meet the health law\u2019s requirements, the companies allowed some members to renew their old plans or buy new ones before the start of 2014. That allowed people to get 12 months of coverage from a plan that didn\u2019t meet the coverage requirements of the health law -- or carry the costs associated with those rules, which include covering benefits that weren\u2019t usually offered in the past.\n\nSince non-grandfathered plans that don\u2019t meet the Obamacare rules can\u2019t be purchased or renewed anymore, people with those plans will have to find new coverage when their plans expire.\n\n(The federal government announced earlier this year that states and insurers could allow people to keep their noncompliant plans for another two years, but the insurance department and Gov. Dannel P. Malloy\u2019s administration decided against allowing it. The reasoning, according to the insurance department, is that since no new members can join the noncompliant plans, the risk pools will continue to shrink, likely leading those who have the policies to face higher premiums.)\n\nThere\u2019s a temporary exception for some: People who bought their plans Dec. 1, 2013 will be allowed to keep them for an extra month, rather than having to buy a new policy for one month until 2015 plans begin.\n\nCT's individual insurance market, June 30, 2014 Number of state residents in each type of plan. Grandfathered plans existed before Obamacare passed in 2010 and can be continued as long as the insurers offer them. Non-ACA compliant, non-grandfathered plans cannot be continued beyond this year, so the people in them will have to find new coverage for next year. Plans sold on and off the exchange meet the health law's requirements.

The health law allows people with low and mid-range incomes to receive federal financial assistance to help discount their premiums, but it\u2019s only available to people who buy coverage through public exchanges.\n\nAnother 35,024 people are covered by individual plans that meet the Obamacare rules and were purchased outside the exchange.\n\nConnectiCare, Anthem picked up members\n\nThe bulk of the growth in membership went to two of the three insurers selling plans on the exchange, ConnectiCare and Anthem.\n\nConnectiCare quadrupled its membership and jumped from 11.7 percent of the individual market last year to 32 percent, a gain of 42,635 people. Among people who bought Obamacare-compliant plans outside the exchange, nearly half -- 17,103 of 35,024 -- chose ConnectiCare.\n\nAnthem\u2019s membership grew from 45,940 to 63,226, but its overall share of the individual market fell from 42 percent to 37 percent.\n\nHealthyCT, a new insurer selling plans through Access Health, lagged behind the others with 2,778 members.\n\nAetna, which is not selling plans through the exchange, saw a slight gain in membership, from 31,900 to 32,809. But the vast majority of customers are in plans that don\u2019t comply with the health law, and most -- 24,294 -- will have to be discontinued by the end of this year.\n\nAetna covered 4,587 people in Obamacare-compliant plans.\n\nGolden Rule, which is owned by UnitedHealthcare, had 13,713 members, all in plans that are not Obamacare compliant. UnitedHealthcare has plans to begin selling individual-market plans on and off the exchange in 2015.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/18/cts-individual-insurance-market-grew-55-percent-under-obamacare/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Aetna, Affordable Care Act, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, canceled plans, connecticare, Connecticut Insurance Department, healthyct, insurance", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/08/18/cts-individual-insurance-market-grew-55-percent-under-obamacare/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Data from the Connecticut Insurance Department show that more than half the people who bought their own health insurance last year have maintained their old policies.
