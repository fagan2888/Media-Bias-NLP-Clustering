Some excerpts from readers\u2019 comments on our website and Facebook page:\n\nIt\u2019s not about filling the mall. It\u2019s about reinventing the space. Seems to me there\u2019s a pretty large company based downtown that could potentially utilize the space, pay taxes and free up a lot of potential river front land for development.\n\n\u2014 Owen Jones\n\nShut the mall down. Everyone in Wausau goes out to Rib Mountain anyway. Malls are a thing of the past. Time to pull the plug.\n\n\u2014 Jesse Riege\n\nThe Wausau Center has been operating for more than three decades. If you make a plan and it works for more than 30 years, then that\u2019s a pretty good plan. If you need to redevelop after more than a generation of success, that doesn\u2019t mean your plan was a failure. That there are some serious challenges to consider going forward is a fact. Rib Mountain Drive provides some valuable retail options to central Wisconsin, but little in the way of defining a community or a unique culture in the way that a true, historic downtown center does.\n\n\u2014 Jim Rosenberg\n\nThink of new ways to utilize the space. Maybe turn JC Penney\u2019s space into an indoor skatepark. Or a studio for art and photography classes maybe.\n\n\u2014 Eric Zannino\n\nThanks Obama!\n\n\u2014 Jake Brewer\n\nIt\u2019s not just the Wausau mall. Fond du Lac mall has lost JC Penney, Sears, the cinema and many others including the soon-to-be closed Deb.\n\n\u2014 Linda Frisque Freund\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1CbNtgj", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Readers shared their thoughts following news of new closures at Wausau Center mall.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Readers shared their thoughts following news of new closures at Wausau Center mall.", "title": "What to do with Wausau Center mall: Readers React", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2015/01/18/wausau-center-mall-readers-react/21877205/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Readers shared their thoughts following news of new closures at Wausau Center mall.", "creator": "@wausauherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/54f858f04763cf848367ef5d2e7ea3795e0a8cd6/c=518-0-2570-2052&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wausau/2015/01/16/B9315863115Z.1_20150116160306_001_GFF9MO39I.1-0.jpg", "title": "What to do with Wausau Center mall: Readers React", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Out of business and discount signs display on the windows Monday at the Deb shop in Wausau Center mall.\n(Photo: T'xer Zhon Kha/Daily Herald Media)Buy PhotoThe news of two new store closures at Wausau Center mall \u2014 Deb Shops, a clothing chain that is closing nationwide, and Great American Cookies \u2014 rekindled reader debate about the health of the downtown mall and its future prospects.\n\u2014 Jesse RiegeThe Wausau Center has been operating for more than three decades.\n\u2014 Jake BrewerIt\u2019s not just the Wausau mall.\nFond du Lac mall has lost JC Penney, Sears, the cinema and many others including the soon-to-be closed Deb."}
