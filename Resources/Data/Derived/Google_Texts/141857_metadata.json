On Wednesday, lawmakers in Illinois voted 98-18 in favor of legislation that would allow the use of medical marijuana for people under the age 18 who suffer from epilepsy.\n\n\u201cThese people are not interested in getting high,\u201d Illinois Rep. Lou Lang told the Chicago Sun-Times. \u201cThese are folks that are interested in alleviating their seizures.\u201d\n\nIllinois citizens over the age of 18 with a doctor-approved medical condition, such as cancer or Crohn\u2019s disease, are currently given access to medical marijuana as part of the Department of Public Health\u2019s Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot, a four-year pilot program for medical marijuana use that went into effect on Jan. 1, 2014. If approved by the state Senate, this bill will give epileptic minors the option of using oil derived from medical cannabis as treatment for chronic seizures.\n\n\u201cIt now makes no sense to limit the ability for minors, juveniles with epilepsy, the ability to get a byproduct \u2014 frankly, a very limiting non-gateway-esque component of an oil \u2014 that could give them relief,\u201d said Rep. Ron Sandack.\n\nBack in February, the Epilepsy Foundation issued a statement asking the Drug Enforcement Administration to end restrictions that limit the use of medical marijuana as a treatment option that is approved by physicians. Epilepsy, a neurological condition that is characterized by recurring seizures, affects 2.3 million people in the United States. Over one million Americans living with this condition suffer from uncontrollable seizures that in some cases are not helped by surgery or FDA-approved medication.\n\n\u201cWe applaud recent decisions that have allowed clinical trials of Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, to begin in several states,\u201d said Phillip M. Gattone, president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation, and Warren Lammert, chair of the Epilepsy Foundation Board of Directors. \u201cCertain components of medical marijuana, including CBD, have shown effectiveness in animal studies, and there have been encouraging anecdotal reports from patients. But further research and unbiased clinical trials are needed to establish whether and in what forms medical marijuana is or is not effective and safe. Restrictions on the use of medical marijuana continue to stand in the way of this research.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "epilepsy, medical, marijuana, seizures", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Illinois minors suffering from epilepsy may soon be granted access to oil derived from medical marijuana to help treat recurring seizures.", "title": "Epileptic Minors In Illinois May Soon Have Access To Medical Marijuana", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/epilepsy-and-medical-marijuana-illinois-lawmakers-approve-bill-could-give-patients-under-age-18", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/medical-marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Illinois minors suffering from epilepsy may soon be granted access to oil derived from medical marijuana to help treat recurring seizures.", "title": "Epileptic Minors In Illinois May Soon Have Access To Medical Marijuana", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/epilepsy-and-medical-marijuana-illinois-lawmakers-approve-bill-could-give-patients-under-age-18", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/medical-marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/medical-marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2014-05-22T10:17:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T10:17:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Illinois minors suffering from epilepsy may soon be granted access to oil derived from medical marijuana to help treat recurring seizures."}, "article_summary": "\u201cCertain components of medical marijuana, including CBD, have shown effectiveness in animal studies, and there have been encouraging anecdotal reports from patients.\nRestrictions on the use of medical marijuana continue to stand in the way of this research.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, lawmakers in Illinois voted 98-18 in favor of legislation that would allow the use of medical marijuana for people under the age 18 who suffer from epilepsy.\nBut further research and unbiased clinical trials are needed to establish whether and in what forms medical marijuana is or is not effective and safe.\n\u201cThese are folks that are interested in alleviating their seizures.\u201dIllinois citizens over the age of 18 with a doctor-approved medical condition, such as cancer or Crohn\u2019s disease, are currently given access to medical marijuana as part of the Department of Public Health\u2019s Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot, a four-year pilot program for medical marijuana use that went into effect on Jan. 1, 2014."}
