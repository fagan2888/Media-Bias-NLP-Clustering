About 12,000 people RSVP-ed for his appearance at the University at Buffalo on Monday, surpassing the venue's capacity and leaving about 3,000 ardent fans standing in the rain. But, those who couldn\u2019t fit inside didn\u2019t totally miss out. Before his speech, Sanders spent a few minutes addressing his outdoor supporters.\n\n5,000 people outside couldn't fit in 8,500 capacity arena. #FeelTheBern #Bernie2016 #UB @BernieSanders @SenSanders pic.twitter.com/NrHhlPXFeP \u2014 Kate Allen (@superlibrarygrl) April 11, 2016\n\nThe reporters at WBEN NewsRadio 930 were covering the event and noted how different a climate it was from when President Obama appeared at the school two years ago.\n\nI \u201cwalked right in when the president was here,\u201d noted newsman Brian Mazurowski.\n\nThe reporter had the same equipment as last time, except this go around security had dogs sniffing their belongings in addition to secret service searching through attendees\u2019 bags.\n\n\u201cFor a sitting president, you\u2019d think the security would be tougher,\u201d Mazurowski said.\n\nThe atmosphere, he said, was \u201cas loud if not louder\u201d as when President Obama was here and the line was longer.\n\nSeveral people spoke in support of Sanders before he reached the stage, including a Black Lives Matter activist and a UB professor, which the WBEN journalist defined as \"strange.\" So much for a \"fair and balanced education,\" he noted.\n\nSanders' UB rally was also notable for who wasn't there: protesters.\n\nA huge crowd inside and outside of Alumni Arena at UB. One thing I haven't found that's common at other rallies: protestors. @news4buffalo \u2014 Rachele Mongiovi (@4RacheleM) April 11, 2016\n\nWhen Sanders did arrive, he spent much of his time criticizing Wall Street and Goldman Sachs.\n\n\"Wall Street\u2019s goal is to make as much money as they can for themselves,\" the senator insisted.\n\nThe senator then skewered Goldman Sachs for its behavior during the financial crisis in 2008, when it pushed inferior mortgages on unknowing investors.\n\nSanders couldn't help noting how Clinton has given speeches to the corporation.\n\nHe also spent a few moments reacting to news that Verizon workers are planning to go on strike. He seemed fully supportive of it because it \"reflects what corporate America is doing.\" The corporations, he said, are making employees pay more for health care while cutting other benefits and outsourcing jobs to the Philippines.\n\nAt some point, Sanders also called for a $15 hour national minimum wage.\n\nThe senator mentioned he was 70 points behind Hillary when he started his campaign and the audience booed. \u201cThere\u2019s a good ending to that story,\" he said, jocosely trying to quiet his fans.\n\nHe took another swing at Clinton by contrasting his small money donations to Hillary\u2019s big money campaign:\n\nThe difference you see in candidates is how they raise their money for their campaigns--@BernieSanders LIVE NOW #BernieInBuffalo \u2014 WBEN NewsRadio 930AM (@NewsRadio930) April 11, 2016\n\n\"If we have a large voter turnout next week, we are going to win New York state,\" he concluded.\n\nMazurowski noted that about 60 percent of Sanders' audience was college age. While the senator continues to have no problem courting the Millennial vote, Hillary Clinton is acknowledging her need to do a better job connecting with young men and women.\n\nHer suggesting young people are being duped by Sanders' lofty campaign promises isn't helping.", "article_metadata": {"description": "College students crazy for Bernie..05/26/2016 20:15:01PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "College students crazy for Bernie.", "title": "Sanders' University at Buffalo Appearance Had More Security Than Obama\u2019s, Longer Lines", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/12/sanders-rally-at-university-at-buffalo-had-even-more-security-than-obamas-appearance-n2147037", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/102/2016-04-11T194829Z_3_LYNXNPEC3A104_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-SANDERS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "College students crazy for Bernie.", "title": "Sanders' University at Buffalo Appearance Had More Security Than Obama\u2019s, Longer Lines", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/12/sanders-rally-at-university-at-buffalo-had-even-more-security-than-obamas-appearance-n2147037", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/102/2016-04-11T194829Z_3_LYNXNPEC3A104_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-SANDERS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Sanders' University at Buffalo Appearance Had Even More Security Than Obama\u2019s, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Before his speech, Sanders spent a few minutes addressing his outdoor supporters.\nSanders' UB rally was also notable for who wasn't there: protesters.\nSanders couldn't help noting how Clinton has given speeches to the corporation.\nAbout 12,000 people RSVP-ed for his appearance at the University at Buffalo on Monday, surpassing the venue's capacity and leaving about 3,000 ardent fans standing in the rain.\n@news4buffalo \u2014 Rachele Mongiovi (@4RacheleM) April 11, 2016When Sanders did arrive, he spent much of his time criticizing Wall Street and Goldman Sachs."}
