Their aggregate employee count s about 75,000, an average of 2,273 per customer. One, though, employs 30,000 people, skewing the average. Some of the new entrants have barely more than 100 workers, Grossman says.\n\nHe notes that on average, larger companies are more often driven by a desire to provide an enhanced employee benefit with a greater choice of health plans, while for smaller employers cost-saving opportunities are often the bigger motivator.\n\nAlso notable is the extreme variability of industries in which the 33 companies operate. Such diversity marks Aon Hewitt\u2019s group of new customers as well.\n\nUntil now, virtually all companies publicly known to be using private exchanges for active employees are in industries populated mostly by low-wage, often part-time workers, such as retail, hospitality and food service.\n\nMercer revealed the names of nine of the 33 companies: Addison Group, which provides professional-level IT and finance staff on temporary assignment; Cosentry, a provider of data-center and server-monitoring services; Kraus Flooring, which makes carpet, vinyl and hardwood flooring; PAS Technologies, a provider of maintenance and repair applications and components for manufacturing equipment; Sanborn Maps, which publishes maps of U.S. cities and towns; Surgical Specialties, a manufacturer of microsurgical knives and other medical equipment; and Vistronix, a federal contractor that provides national-security solutions and services.\n\n\u201cThis really puts to rest the myth that private exchanges appeal to a narrow range of companies,\u201d Grossman says.\n\nJust two of the named companies fit the narrow range in terms of worker pay: Petco, the pet-supplies retail chain, and DineEquity, parent of Appleby\u2019s and IHOP.\n\nAddison Group pays its IT professionals, who generate about half of the company\u2019s $180 million in revenue, an average of $50 an hour, or about $100,000 a year, says CFO Patrick Jones. The high pay is because the supply of highly qualified IT professionals is thin. \u201cThe unemployment rate is very low for those folks, so we wanted to give them more options and a better benefits experience,\u201d Jones says. \u201cThat\u2019s important to continuing our company\u2019s growth.\u201d\n\nUntil now they\u2019ve had only two health-plan choices, one in-network and one out-of-network PPO plan. In surveys of the company\u2019s 2,100 employees, Addison Group heard of dissatisfaction with the benefits, Jones says. Young and healthy people who would prefer an HMO or high-deductible plan comprise much of the population. They will have those options in the Mercer exchange, which will have plans from five insurance carriers.\n\nBut while enhancing benefits may be Addison\u2019s primary motivation for the move, cost savings expected to flow from it are not unappreciated. The company\u2019s head count rose by 50 percent during 2013, so 2014 health costs are going to be much higher no matter what. But on a per-employee basis, Jones estimates that the company\u2019s health-care tab will run 15 percent to 18 percent lower next year.\n\nThe savings will come from the healthy employees\u2019 ability to be better consumers, says Jones. \u201cPeople will get the plan that fits their individual needs, versus being overinsured and having the company pay a big piece of that.\u201d\n\nAnd the 15-18 percent savings level is expected in spite of the fact that Addison will increase the share of insurance premiums that it pays by 6 percent, another strategy aimed at attracting and retaining employees.\n\nLike many other private-exchange customers, Addison will be making direct contributions (DC) to employees for use in buying insurance through the exchange. They will get to keep any money they don\u2019t use for that purpose, though it will be taxable to them.\n\nGrossman said just less than half of its exchange customers will be taking the DC approach, instead continuing to deduct employees\u2019 share of the premium cost from their paychecks. About two-thirds of the customers are fully insured as opposed to self-insured.\n\nMercer also announced that 19 companies that pay for retirees\u2019 health care have joined its Medicare-based retiree exchange.", "article_metadata": {"date": 20131015, "description": "Mercer announces 33 new users for its Mercer Marketplace active-employee exchange product, most with between 100 and 3,000 employees.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Midsize Companies Move to Private Health Exchanges\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2013\\/10\\/midsized-companies-move-private-health-exchanges\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-15 16:50:02\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-04 17:07:09\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":21715,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"Addison Group\",\"Aon Hewitt\",\"Cosentry\",\"Eric Grossman\",\"Kraus Flooring\"],\"categories\":[\"Growth Companies\",\"Growth Strategies\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"People\"],\"image\":null}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Mercer announces 33 new users for its Mercer Marketplace active-employee exchange product, most with between 100 and 3,000 employees.", "title": "Mercer Adds 33 Companies to Its Active-Worker Private Health Exchange", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-06-04T17:07:09+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2013/10/midsized-companies-move-private-health-exchanges/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Mercer announces 33 new users for its Mercer Marketplace active-employee exchange product, most with between 100 and 3,000 employees.", "title": "Mercer Adds 33 Companies to Its Active-Worker Private Health Exchange", "creator": "@cfo", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Midsize Companies Move to Private Health Exchanges", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "People", "tag": "Vistronix", "published_time": "2013-10-15T16:50:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T17:07:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "addison group, aon hewitt, cosentry, eric grossman, kraus flooring, mercer, pas technologies, patrick jones, petco, private exchange, sanborn maps, surgical specialties, vistronix"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe62a7\"", "article_summary": "Still, the 33 companies new to the Mercer exchange come in widely varying sizes.\nThey will have those options in the Mercer exchange, which will have plans from five insurance carriers.\nAlso notable is the extreme variability of industries in which the 33 companies operate.\nMercer also announced that 19 companies that pay for retirees\u2019 health care have joined its Medicare-based retiree exchange.\nThe market of private health-insurance exchanges got another strong boost today, with human resources consulting firm Mercer announcing that 33 companies will use its exchange for their active employees starting Jan. 1."}
