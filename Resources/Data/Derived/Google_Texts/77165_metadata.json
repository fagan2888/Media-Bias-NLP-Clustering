But things get complicated if the hospital is physician-owned, as evidenced by a recent CMS notice.\n\nTexas Health Presbyterian Hospital Rockwall, a 50-bed hospital located in Rockwall, Texas, is seeking an exception to an Affordable Care Act ban on the expansion of physician-owned hospitals, according to the notice. The ban was put in place to address concerns over potential Stark law violations.\n\nUnder the Stark law , most Medicare self-referrals are prohibited, including situations where physicians own or invest in a hospital.\n\nTexas Health Rockwall says it meets the requirements of an applicable hospital, meaning it serves a higher percentage of Medicaid patients than any other hospital in its county, as well as operates in a state with a lower average bed capacity than the national average. Additionally, the hospital is located in a county that\u2019s had a population increase of at least 150 percent of the overall state population increase.\n\nHospitals can qualify for two exceptions to the ban: either the whole hospital exception, which allows physician ownership of a hospital as long as it\u2019s in the whole hospital and not an individual unit, or a rural hospital exception, which allows physician ownership if the hospital\u2019s in a rural region. However, hospitals can\u2019t qualify for either exception unless they\u2019re deemed an applicable hospital or a high-Medicaid facility.\n\nComments on the request for an exception are due by March 2. So far, three physician-owned hospitals have received permission to expand since the ACA was enacted, including two in Texas.\n\nTake a free trial to the Health Law Resource Center to receive industry-leading health law news and analysis.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/hospital-wants-expand-b57982066985/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "In theory, hospital expansion should be an easy process: get the necessary permits, build new space and add some new beds.
