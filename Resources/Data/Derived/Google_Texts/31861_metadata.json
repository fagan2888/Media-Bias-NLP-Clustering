The company's annual analysis of the U.S. pharmaceutical market suggests that the precarious balance point between cost and value may be shifting with the entrance of a new patient population and continued concerns over rising costs of care.\n\nThe report revealed that of the top ten physician specialties writing prescriptions for federal Health Exchange members, more endocrinologists and dermatologists wrote prescriptions than any other, including family practice and internal medicine. Nearly 66% of endocrinologists and 67% of dermatologists wrote prescriptions for federal Health Exchange members, while only 47% of family practitioners and 25% of pediatricians wrote prescriptions for this same group.\n\nBased on this new data, the ACA may be succeeding in opening access to previously underserved populations who are either new to care or who now have better access to care. For example, dermatological care has been cited in a brief published by The Center for Studying Health System Change as one of five specialties that had been difficult to access for uninsured and Medicaid populations (the others were gastroenterology, orthopedics, cardiology, and endocrinology.) Other studies, as reported in the Annals of Surgery, have shown that uninsured patients with diabetes had statistically lower rates of the recommended physician surveillance and monitoring needed to control the disease.\n\nPharma Insights highlights the broader themes of cost vs. value in today's healthcare system, exploring the value of new high cost, innovative pharmaceutical treatments that show promise in providing cures vs. the economic burden to the healthcare system. In addition, the report looks at the role of big data and analytics to enhance health system transparency and promote accountability and coordination amongst care settings as a much larger portion of the population accesses care.\n\nPharma Insights also provides a comprehensive overview of the biopharmaceutical marketplace leveraging Symphony's Integrated DataverseTM(IDV). IDV brings together comprehensive prescription, medical and hospital claims to provide a complete view of the prescriber, patient, and payer dynamics that determine market activity. In 2014, U.S. biopharmaceutical prescription volume grew by 1.6 percent over 2013. Branded drug volumes continued to decline while average patient out-of-pocket cost increased more than $5 over the past four years, as high-priced specialty drugs enter the market. Generic volumes continued to grow, while patient out-of-pocket remains steady, slightly declining by 35 cents on average over the past four years.\n\nFor more information, visit www.symphonyhealth.com/news.\n\nEditor's Note: To set an interview with a Symphony Health Solutions expert, please contact Heather Varela at 602-463-7838 or via email at heather.varela@symphonyhealth.com.\n\nAbout Symphony Health Solutions\n\nSymphony Health Solutions is a leading provider of high-value data, analytics, technology solutions and actionable insights for healthcare and life sciences manufacturers, payers and providers.
