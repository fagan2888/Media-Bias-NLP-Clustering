Brian Holmes was swept out of site in the Fatwa area, the news release says.\n\nWhen Alex Holmes initially tried to ski down to search for his brother, he triggered a second avalanche. Feeling it wasn't safe to continue, he skied back to Trout Lake and called for help.\n\nBrian Holmes said he was able to dig himself out of the snow after being carried about 1,000 feet down the slide and landing on his back, mostly buried in snow.\n\nHis entire body except for his face and one arm were under the snow. It took him about 15 minutes to dig out. He then began searching for his brother, whom he thought was dead.\n\nDeputies were dispatched about 1 p.m. Rescuers from several agencies joined the search, including the Telluride Ski Patrol. A helicopter and a specially trained avalanche dog were used.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the ongoing mission, dispatchers received calls from a cell phone belonging to Brian Holmes. They heard someone breathing, but no further communication was established.\n\nBrian Holmes made his way to the town of Ophir. He was taken to the Telluride Medical Center where he was treated for non-life threatening injuries.\n\nRector said it was not surprising that an avalanche was triggered.\n\n\"The San Juans in general can represent some of the most tenuous snow conditions on the continent,\" Rector said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or @kirkmitchell or denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_29168277/colorado-brothers-survive-avalanches-near-ophir-after-each", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "sailthru.author": "By Kirk Mitchell   The Denver Post", "description": "Two brothers survived a massive avalanche Wednesday in the back country in San Miguel County after one of them was swept away and buried under snow.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:29168277:view"}, "startDate": "2015-11-26T10:34:23-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_29168277/colorado-brothers-survive-avalanches-near-ophir-after-each", "image": "http://local.canoncitydailyrecord.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/canoncitydailyrecord.png", "type": "article", "description": "Two brothers survived a massive avalanche Wednesday in the back country in San Miguel County after one of them was swept away and buried under snow.", "title": "Colorado brothers survive avalanches near Ophir after each thought the other was dead"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Two brothers survived a massive avalanche Wednesday in the back country in San Miguel County after one of them was swept away and buried under snow.", "title": "Colorado brothers survive avalanches near Ophir after each thought the other was dead", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_29168277/colorado-brothers-survive-avalanches-near-ophir-after-each", "image": "http://local.canoncitydailyrecord.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/canoncitydailyrecord.png", "creator": "@kirkmitchell", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-26T10:34:23-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Colorado brothers survive avalanches near Ophir after each thought the other was dead", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.tags": "avalanche, San Miguel County Sheriff, Alex Holmes, Susan Lilly, Trout Lake, Telluride Ski Patrol, Ophir, Waterfall Canyon", "byline": "By Kirk Mitchell", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "modificationDate": "2015-11-26T18:03:34-0700", "endDate": "2025-11-26T10:34:47-0700", "sailthru.description": "Two brothers survived a massive avalanche Wednesday in the back country in San Miguel County after one of them was swept away and buried under snow.", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "pubDate": "2015-11-26T10:34:43-0700", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementDuring the ongoing mission, dispatchers received calls from a cell phone belonging to Brian Holmes.\nAlex Holmes was watching his brother begin to ski down the slope when Brian Holmes triggered an avalanche.\nBrian Holmes was swept out of site in the Fatwa area, the news release says.\nBrian Holmes made his way to the town of Ophir.\nOlder brother swept away but digs himself out while distraught younger brother goes for helpTwo brothers from Ophir a survived massive avalanche Wednesday in the San Miguel County backcountry after one of them was swept away and buried."}
