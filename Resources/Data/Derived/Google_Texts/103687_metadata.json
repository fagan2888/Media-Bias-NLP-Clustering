The collection includes printer\u2019s proofs for packages and point-of-purchase displays for such products as Salvo Rockets (\u201cwith launching platform and remote control firing\u201d), the water-powered Satellite Rocket (everyone I knew owned at least one), the Strong Man Bell Target Game, and a number of extremely familiar water guns (the ones I would stockpile each summer for the hour-long water battles waged on the dunes of Long Beach, Long Island).\n\nSteve Pellegrino, a graduate of the School of Visual Arts 3D Illustration program and director of Taglio Design, recently invited me to see a portion of his grandfather\u2019s mint toy-package collection from the \u201850s and \u201860s. What pop-culture maven could resist the word \u201cmint\u201d?\n\nThe ultra-realistic illustrations of Lugers, Mausers, derringers, and .38 snubnose specials transported me right back to when it was de rigueur for boys to pack hardware, or plasticware (BB guns, air guns, cap guns, dart guns, and water guns), and for teachers to routinely confiscate them. When plastic replaced metal and wood manufacturing in the \u201860s, it allowed for even more realistic weaponry than before. Nationwide standards were later passed to govern how toy guns are made so as to be distinguished from the genuine thing (i.e. with bright-colored parts, such as an orange band around the barrel).\n\nGregory Ruffa Advertising, the sole ad agency working on Park's toy-gun their packaging, did such convincing work it was difficult to resist the call to arms. Now, these are historical artifacts. \u201cAs Park produced the packaging,\u201d Pellegrino told me, \u201cmy grandfather would save certain boxes or proofs for posterity, or because he simply liked the work they had done.\u201d\n\nHow to sell these and the non-weapon products was the job of Ruffa and Park\u2019s sales managers. \u201cThey decided that packages were to be illustrated, often airbrushed, to give the buyer a good representation of the product,\u201d Pellegrino said. \u201cHad they used flat graphics, [my grandfather] felt it would have forced the consumer to fill in too many gaps with their imagination, thus reducing the impact of the toy. Realistic graphics also helped the toys carry a high-quality appearance.\u201d\n\nNot all the imagery is realistic, modern design, though. Many included Saul Bass-inspired graphics, which signaled these were indeed toys. Comic drawings of children at play, done by Dorothy Moreland, added a light touch.\n\nThey sold well too. \u201cThe public devoured the original \u2018WeeGee\u2019 pistol,\u201d Pellegrino said, \u201cpurchasing millions and forcing Park to produce an additional run. Kellogg of cereal fame ordered somewhere near to a million of the water guns for prizes, and other proprietary toys were developed especially for them.\u201d\n\nWe've since learned that having a fake gun that looks like a real one can be pretty dangerous.
