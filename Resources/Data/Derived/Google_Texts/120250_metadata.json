The product in question, commonly abbreviated to BS, has been flowing freely from both ends of the political spectrum since at least 2010.\n\nWhile there may be plenty of debate over how many jobs the pipeline would create if it were built, there\u2019s no question that the political wrangling over its approval has been a virtual full-employment program for fact checkers.\n\nRelated: Is the Keystone Pipeline the Key to Landrieu\u2019s Senate Seat?\n\nThere are a few things that everyone agrees on. The project would run a 36-inch pipe 1,179 miles, from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska, with 875 miles of it running through three U.S. states. In Steele City, NE, it would connect to existing lines that would allow oil from Canadian tar sands to be shipped to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nBeyond that, almost every element of the pipeline, from the number of jobs it will create, to the project\u2019s environmental impact, to the economic benefits has been subject to furious, over-the-top debate.\n\nTo the environmentally-minded, like Esquire Magazine blogger Charles Pierce, Keystone is \u201cthe proposed continent-spanning death funnel that would bring the world's dirtiest fossil fuel from the environmental hellscape of northern Alberta down through the richest farmlands on the planet all the way to refineries in Texas.\u201d\n\nTo conservatives in favor of the project, like Fox News commentator Eric Bolling, the project isn\u2019t just a modest job creator, but a fountain of employment that could create \u201cup to a million new high-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nRelated: Corporate America\u2019s Wish List for the 114th Congress\n\nProfessional fact checkers have been working overtime since the project was first proposed, flagging the outrageous claims made by people on both sides of the debate.\n\nEarly this year, Glenn Kessler, who writes the Fact Checker column for The Washington Post, bestowed the dreaded \u201cFour Pinocchio\u201d rating on environmental group NextGen\u2019s claim that Keystone is, in effect, a Chinese plot to siphon energy away from the U.S. to power China\u2019s growth.\n\nLikewise, in July 2013, Kessler blasted President Obama for \u201clowballing\u201d the number of jobs the project is expected to create. Obama had claimed that it would create as few as 2,000 construction jobs, which required some bending of the facts to justify. Kessler also went after supporters of the pipeline in November of last year, hitting them for false claims about the pipeline reducing U.S. dependence on foreign energy.\n\nRelated: GOP Leaders on Government Shutdown: It\u2019s a Trap\n\nAs far back as 2011, Kessler was going after members of both parties for what he characterized as the \u201cbipartisan fumble\u201d of Keystone jobs estimates.\n\nAnd Kessler hasn\u2019t been alone. Politifact.org has tracked more than a dozen high profile examples of public figures spouting false or mostly false information about Keystone going back to 2010.\n\nSome of the highlights include:\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) claiming that delays to Keystone were costing the economy 100,000 jobs per year.\n\nRep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) claiming that a Keystone bill was an illegal earmark under House rules.\n\nRep. Cory Gardner (R-CO) claiming that the pipeline would create thousands of jobs in Colorado \u2013 a state the pipeline won\u2019t touch.\n\nRelated: Strong Dollar Blunts Benefit of Oil Price Decline\n\nBy the spring of 2014, the discussion had become so confused that the Annenberg Public Policy Center\u2019s FactCheck.org produced an exhaustive \u201cPipeline Primer\u201d in an effort to aggregate the facts about Keystone.\n\nOne might think that, five years into the issue \u2013 and with so many organizations checking up on them \u2013 advocates on both sides would have their stories down. But just Sunday Russ Girling, the CEO of TransCanada, the company building the pipeline, appeared on ABC and delivered a whopper.\n\nIn conversation with host Martha Raddatz, Girling cited the State Department\u2019s finding that the Keystone project would \u201csupport\u201d 42,100 jobs during construction. The State Department\u2019s estimate included not just construction workers, but extended out into the companies that would supply parts and equipment, logistics companies, and businesses that would supply goods and services to pipeline workers.\n\nRaddatz pointed out that the vast majority of those jobs would disappear within two years. Indeed, both TransCanada and the State Department estimated that once complete, the pipeline would employ no more than 50 people.\n\nRelated: More Americans Are Quitting Their Jobs\u2026and That\u2019s Great News\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Girling insisted, \u201cthe 42,000 jobs is in ongoing, enduring jobs.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the fact checkers were on the case immediately. Katie Sanders of the Tampa Bay Times promptly called up a TransCanada spokesperson, who had to walk back his CEO\u2019s claim.\n\n\u201cWe rate his statement False,\u201d Sanders wrote.\n\nGirling was only the latest in a long line.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Keystone XL pipeline, which the Senate is expected to vote on late today, hasn\u2019t d", "title": "Keystone XL Pipeline: No Oil, Plenty of Propaganda", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/18/Keystone-XL-Pipeline-No-Oil-Plenty-Propaganda", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01182012_Keystone_Pipeline_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/18/Keystone-XL-Pipeline-No-Oil-Plenty-Propaganda", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01182012_Keystone_Pipeline_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Keystone XL pipeline, which the Senate is expected to vote on late today, hasn\u2019t d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe23b2\"", "article_summary": "Related: Is the Keystone Pipeline the Key to Landrieu\u2019s Senate Seat?\nRep.
