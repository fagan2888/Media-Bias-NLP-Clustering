A car accident on Christmas took two lives and sent one person to the hospital.

On December 25 at 6 P.M. a BMW was traveling on Cainhoy Road, in Berkeley County, when it ran off the left side of the roadway and struck a power pole and a tree.

The driver, 41 year old Marshevis Ellington, of Columbia, was ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene by Coroner Salisbury.

Also killed in the wreck was a passenger, 50 year old Joseph Simmons of Huger. Simmons was trapped in the wreckage and was extricated by the fire dept.

A third person in the car was taken to MUSC with non-life threatening injuries.

The deaths have been ruled accidental by the Coroner. No one in the vehicle was wearing a seatbelt.

The Berkeley County Coronerâ€™s Office and the South Carolina Highway Patrol say speed was a factor in this accident.
