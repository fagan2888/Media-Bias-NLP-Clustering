Newly elected Senator Tom Cotton (R., Ark.) delivered the Republican Thanksgiving Day address on Thursday, emphasizing his gratitude for the sacrifices made by members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families.

“For many, there will be no homecoming this week. From Afghanistan to Iraq to Korea, our troops continue to patrol the world to bring peace and security for us all. From Marines in Liberia to sailors across the oceans to airmen over the Asian skies to the sentinels standing guard at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, these troops will sacrifice the comforts of family and home so we can enjoy them. To each of you, on behalf of the people of a grateful nation, I extend our deepest thanks for your honorable and faithful service.”

A graduate of Harvard and Harvard law, Cotton is one of the few lawmakers to have served in the military, and one of seventeen current members of Congress who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.

Cotton served combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan.

In his address, the congressman offered thanks and solace to the families of those currently serving.

“Nine years ago, I was at Ranger School for Thanksgiving; six years ago, it was Mehtar Lam, Afghanistan. While we deeply missed our own families, we also celebrated together as a second, surrogate family,” he said.

“As you see the empty seat at your table this Thanksgiving, please know that your sons and daughters, husbands and wives, moms and dads miss you dearly, but are enjoying the next best thing to home: the camaraderie and love of their brothers and sisters in arms.”
