Plaintiffs were Rafael Lopez, who operates the El Bandera Jalisco food truck; father and son Regino and Bernardo Soriano and their El Bandolero food trucks; and Ricardo Quintanilla, who operates the Tacos el Regio food truck.\n\n\u201cI am glad that our lawsuit forced the city to do the right thing,\u201d Quintanilla said Thursday. \u201cI am happy that I can now focus on running my business instead of worrying about getting shut down if a restaurant opens nearby.\u201d\n\nThe San Antonio repeal means the city \u201crecognizes that entrepreneurs should not need their competitors\u2019 permission to operate a business,\u201d said Matt Miller, managing attorney of IJ\u2019s Texas office in Austin.\n\nBert Gall, who directs the institute\u2019s National Street Vending Initiative, called the council\u2019s decision \u201ca big win for street vendors throughout Texas and the rest of the country who face similar unconstitutional restrictions on their right to earn an honest living.\u201d\n\nDuring a brief discussion, Councilman Mike Gallagher said \u201cbrick and mortar restaurants that pay taxes\u201d could be disadvantaged by the repeal. In the end, he voted for revocation.\n\nThe Metro Health Department said it would \u201cstep up enforcement\u201d of food trucks in the evening hours to ensure that licensing laws are followed.\n\nThis article originally appeared at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Sweet freedom.", "title": "San Antonio Overturns Ban on Food Trucks", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/11/27/san-antonio-overturns-ban-on-food-trucks", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14483072184809.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14483072184809.jpg", "description": "Sweet freedom.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "San Antonio Overturns Ban on Food Trucks"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Must Reads", "published_time": "2015-11-27T11:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/kenric-ward"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "San Antonio on Thursday repealed its ordinance prohibiting food trucks from operating within 300 feet of any restaurant, grocer or convenience store.\nPlaintiffs were Rafael Lopez, who operates the El Bandera Jalisco food truck; father and son Regino and Bernardo Soriano and their El Bandolero food trucks; and Ricardo Quintanilla, who operates the Tacos el Regio food truck.\nThe Metro Health Department said it would \u201cstep up enforcement\u201d of food trucks in the evening hours to ensure that licensing laws are followed.\nAs reported by Watchdog.org, a group of truck owners sued the city Oct. 6.\n\u201cI am glad that our lawsuit forced the city to do the right thing,\u201d Quintanilla said Thursday."}
