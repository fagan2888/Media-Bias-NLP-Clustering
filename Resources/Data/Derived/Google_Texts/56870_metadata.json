The three-minute cartoon parodied the year\u2019s presidential election and borrowed the tune of an American folk song. Perhaps it was the summer Friday-ness, that imminent post-Independence Day weekend feeling, or maybe folks were vaguely on edge in that election-year way and looking for something to watch. It\u2019s hard to say. But links to the video jumped from email inbox to Friendster message, and, in the words of the two brothers behind the video, the little web server hosting the video \u201cspontaneously combusted.\u201d The video was This Land, the primary digital spoof of the Kerry-Bush election. After their server crashed, the two brothers behind the video\u2014Evan and Greg Spiridellis\u2014moved it to a web video distributor, AtomFilms. According to a USA Today report, the video got more than 1 million \u201chits\u201d in 24 hours. The brothers received all the trappings of mainstream American microfame: They were on the morning shows and named people of the year. A national newspaper compared them to Jesus. They boasted that their video was seen on every continent and on the ISS.\n\nBefore Twitter existed, before Facebook allowed more than college students to join its network, the brothers made new media that went viral. But what I\u2019m struck by, watching the video now\u2014beyond how did we ever survive the 2000s?!\u2014is how much harder it would be for something like this to find success now. By which I don\u2019t mean a parody video about a national election: We\u2019re drowning in those now, and an unusually good one (or even a mediocre one with high production values) could make its way from Politics Twitter to Buzzfeed to a thousand Facebook-optimized aggregators. No, no: An animated video could never find this success now. There aren\u2019t any actors in This Land\u2014just images and photographs being moved across a screen. Kerry and Bush open and close their mouths marionette-style. A cylinder moving up and some gray circles at the bottom represents a nuclear missile. It\u2019s all very rudimentary. That\u2019s part of its charm. And that was part of the charm of the whole mid-2000s boom in web animation. Beyond Jib-Jab, there was Homestar Runner and Making Fiends, independent animation series whose creators made a living off their alternate distribution channels and merchandising. There were clearing houses for this stuff, like the foul Ebaums World, which must have been the first entry on American middle school block lists. These series originated from a fluke of Internet technologies. In the early 2000s, most computers could play moving images on the web only with the help of the Macromedia Flash player. While Flash did allow for live-action video, it pixelated the frames to the point of incomprehensibility. Instead, most creators opted to use the vector animations the software\u2019s editor could create. For a couple years, if you wanted to make cinema on the web, you did it with Flash animations. Besides, live-action video files took up a ton of space and processing power. Who wanted to spend the time uploading and downloading them? Who wanted to host them? As it turned out: YouTube. The service was founded in 2005, and it created a home for live-action videos right as the technology was making it feasible.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Before Twitter existed, before Facebook allowed more than college students to join its network, two brothers made new media that went viral.", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Before Twitter existed, before Facebook allowed more than college students to join its network, two brothers made new media that went viral.", "title": "This Land, JibJab's Seminal Parody Flash Video, Turns 10", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/Screen_Shot_2014_07_09_at_11.15.40_AM/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/jibjabs-seminal-flash-parody-turns-10/374161/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8df\"", "article_summary": "Ten years ago today, a small Flash animation firm based in Los Angeles uploaded a video to its website.\nAfter their server crashed, the two brothers behind the video\u2014Evan and Greg Spiridellis\u2014moved it to a web video distributor, AtomFilms.\nWhile Flash did allow for live-action video, it pixelated the frames to the point of incomprehensibility.\nBesides, live-action video files took up a ton of space and processing power.\nAnd that was part of the charm of the whole mid-2000s boom in web animation."}
