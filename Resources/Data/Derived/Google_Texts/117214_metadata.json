People could identify as one of 15 possibilities, including now-derogatory words such as \u201cNegro.\u201d These classifications might shed some light on why some federal laws from that time contain outdated verbiage that\u2019s now being addressed.\n\nRELATED CONTENT\n\nAfter it was unanimously passed with 380 votes, President Barack Obama signed H.R. 4238 on Friday, which amends two federal acts from the \u201970s that define \u201cminorities\u201d with terms that are now insensitive or outdated.\n\nThe Department of Energy Act has for decades described \u201cminorities\u201d as, \u201ca Negro, Puerto Rican, American Indian, Eskimo, Oriental, or Aleut or is a Spanish speaking individual of Spanish descent.\u201d\n\nThe new bill changes the language to, \u201cAsian American, Native Hawaiian, a Pacific Islander, African American, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Native American, or an Alaska Native.\u201d There\u2019s also similar language in the Local Public Works Capital Development and Investment Act.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Rep. Grace Meng, D-NY, with 74 Democratic co-sponsors and two Republican ones, who focused on the word \u201cOriental.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Oriental] is an insulting term that needed to be removed from the books, and I am extremely pleased that my legislation to do that is now the law of the land,\u201d Meng said in a statement.\n\nThe U.S. Census never used the word Oriental, which became associated in the U.S. with exoticism and Asian-American stereotypes in the 20th century. But it dropped \u201cNegro\u201d from identities in 2013, after people during the 2010 count said they were offended by it.\n\nThe director at the time said 56,000 people during research in the 1990s written under \u201cother race\u201d that they identified as Negro. So the census had continued to include the word in its 2000 count, and also in 2010, but by then people were raising concerns.\n\n\u201cI apologize to them. I am confident that the intent of my colleagues in using the same wording as Census 2000 was to make sure as many people as possible saw words that matched their self-identities. Full inclusiveness was the goal,\u201d Robert Groves, former director of the U.S. Census Bureau, wrote. \u201cThe race question has often changed over the decades, as the country has changed and racial terms have evolved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After it was unanimously passed with 380 votes, President Barack Obama signed bill H.R. 4238 on Friday, which amends two federal acts from the '70s that define \u201cminorities\u201d with terms that are now insensitive or outdated.", "pubdate": 20160522, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "After it was unanimously passed with 380 votes, President Barack Obama signed bill H.R. 4238 on Friday, which amends two federal acts from the '70s that define \u201cminorities\u201d with terms that are now insensitive or outdated.", "title": "Obama signs bill eliminating 'Negro,' 'Oriental' from federal laws", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RTX16PU5.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/obama-signs-bill-eliminating-negro-spanish-speaking-oriental-from-federal-laws/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "After it was unanimously passed with 380 votes, President Barack Obama signed bill H.R. 4238 on Friday, which amends two federal acts from the '70s that define \u201cminorities\u201d with terms that are now insensitive or outdated.", "title": "Obama signs bill eliminating 'Negro,' 'Oriental' from federal laws", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RTX16PU5.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "Race Matters"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Editors' Picks, federal law, identity, minority groups, negro, oriental, Race Matters"}, "article_summary": "But it dropped \u201cNegro\u201d from identities in 2013, after people during the 2010 count said they were offended by it.\nThe director at the time said 56,000 people during research in the 1990s written under \u201cother race\u201d that they identified as Negro.\nThe U.S. Census never used the word Oriental, which became associated in the U.S. with exoticism and Asian-American stereotypes in the 20th century.\n4238 on Friday, which amends two federal acts from the \u201970s that define \u201cminorities\u201d with terms that are now insensitive or outdated.\n\u201cThe race question has often changed over the decades, as the country has changed and racial terms have evolved.\u201d"}
