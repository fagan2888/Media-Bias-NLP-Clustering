Then he dropped down and bee-lined right for our vehicle.\"\n\nDavid Peters said the experience behind a few inches of glass was really more exciting than scary.\n\n\"It wasn't really scary for me and my wife; we'd seen bears before,\" said Peters. \"The bears didn't show any sign of aggression, they were more curious than anything else.\"\n\nBut what the camera doesn't show is that Peters was outside of the vehicle, snapping pictures of the bears.\n\nAs one bear came toward the vehicle, Peters sneaked around the back and hopped in the back seat.\n\n\"I was kind of playing this which way is he going with the bears,\" said Peters. \"It's five seconds of inattention that was really not good. It could've been disastrous if that bear had come straight for me instead of the front of the car like he did.\"\n\nHe caught a lucky break.\n\nPeters walked away from the incident with only a few minor scratches --- on his car, and an unforgettable memory caught on camera.\n\nIn the video, a young girl can be heard shouting: \"He smells the beef jerky!\"\n\n\"I asked my friend's daughter Elise if she thought she'd have nightmares over the whole thing,\" said Peters. \"And she said 'Are you kidding me? This is the best day of my life ever!'\"\n\nPeters' car still has the scratch marks and mud smears from the bear's paws.\n\nFor now, Peters said his wife won't let him wash the evidence of the story away.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
