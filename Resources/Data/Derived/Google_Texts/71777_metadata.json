The candelabra lightbulbs shine through the night as you and dozens of other cars parade through the town to celebrate Hanukkah.\n\nThe third-annual Chabad of Western Monmouth County menorah parade kicked off Monday with about 50 vehicles with menorah on each roof, whether sedan, minivan or work truck, and its to come together to celebrate Hanukkah in a way that showcases the pride and joy of the season, said Rabbi Shmuel Volovik of the Chabad of Western Monmouth County and organizer of the parade.\n\nIt's an idea he brought to the Chabad after seeing the Los Angeles menorah parade when he visited there.\n\n\"These happen all over the world,\" Volovik said. \"They are huge events, held mostly in big cities, but all over \u2014 New York, Paris, Israel. We bring it back, to our community. We're bringing it to the next level, to here, to the small towns as well.\"\n\nThe menorahs are handmade, with its lights, wood base, and painted Happy Hanukkah message. Some of the components are hard-to-find, since you need bulbs that are of a low enough wattage to not drain a car battery, Volovik said. Its wood base sits on a small frame, and the blue nylon tie-downs are passed through the base then over the roof and secured under the vehicle's roof rack or through the passenger windows before locking in place. The Chabad made many of them last year, and volunteers help secure them to vehicles as participants line up for the parade.\n\n\"People see us going down Route 9, a bunch of cars with menorahs on the top, and they're like, 'Wow,' \" said the rabbi. \"It's just quite a sight.\"\n\nVehicles began to line up in the circular parking lot at Robertsville Elementary School, and a half hour later they'd depart to Marlboro Town Hall for the town's menorah lighting ceremony, with CDs of Hanukah music playing from each vehicle along the route.\n\nThe event is joyous, instilling that feeling in the drivers and passengers but also passersby, he said. \"When they see the menorah and brings out a lot of Jewish pride out in them, and it's really festive and happy.\"\n\nBut it also allows the local Jewish community to come together for Hanukkah, said Linda Ross, who has participated all three years of the event.\n\n\"It makes it special because this is about community,\" Ross said. \"The community is coming together, it's festive, we are all here to share our beliefs, and everyone is celebrating the same thing and in a great mood. It's very uplifting.\"\n\nNaomi Ross, Linda's daughter-in-law, was driving a vehicle full of family members for the event, and said the public nature of a parade means it is sharing the light of the menorah with more of the world.\n\n\"You may walk by and see a menorah in someone's window,\" Naomi said, \"but this is doing it with publicity, to share and honor the miracle of Hanukkah, and bring it out so everyone can see.\"\n\nHer son, Mordechai Ross, 11, said that in his view it showed a sense of unity.\n\n\"We all go drive out together, at the same time, as one,\" said Mordechai Ross, 11.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/16LbJtW", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Third annual event brings community together", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Third annual event brings community together", "title": "A menorah parade of joy", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/western-monmouth-county/marlboro/2014/12/22/menorah-parade-joy/20791723/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Third annual event brings community together", "title": "A menorah parade of joy", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/20b76c0d2a02af7ed6565fa1a244e51146ab6253/c=720-0-3568-2848&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/12/22/B9315506899Z.1_20141222220539_000_GH19G9V3U.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1b0\"", "article_summary": "It's an idea he brought to the Chabad after seeing the Los Angeles menorah parade when he visited there.\nBuy Photo The Chabad of Western Monmouth County sponsored a car-menorah parade along Route 9 in Marlboro for the community menorah lighting Monday night.\nThe third-annual Chabad of Western Monmouth County menorah parade kicked off Monday with about 50 vehicles with menorah on each roof, whether sedan, minivan or work truck, and its to come together to celebrate Hanukkah in a way that showcases the pride and joy of the season, said Rabbi Shmuel Volovik of the Chabad of Western Monmouth County and organizer of the parade.\nThe candelabra lightbulbs shine through the night as you and dozens of other cars parade through the town to celebrate Hanukkah.\n(Photo: Staff photo by FRANK GALIPO/CORRESPONDENT)Buy PhotoStrap a menorah to the top of your car and plug it into your vehicle's cigarette lighter."}
