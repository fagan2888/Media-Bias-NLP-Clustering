She brings excited, visionary leadership for the organization.\u201d\n\nMcCoy also praised \u201cher unique combination of leadership, organizational and people skills. We are all looking forward to working with her.\u201d\n\nWilliams will be the voice and face of the Alliance who will seek new dues-paying members in the organization to benefit everyone.\n\n\u201cWe want to leverage the local money to get state money and state money to get federal money so we can assist them by putting grants into the communities,\u201d McCoy said.\n\nWilliams worked in Washington, D.C., as an assistant to the chief of staff and then as a legislative aid and office manager for Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) from 2003-2007. From 2008-2014, she was executive vice president for government affairs and business development for the Golden Triangle Development LINK in Columbus.

North Mississippi is a wonderful place \u2026 I think it\u2019s the best-kept secret in the world. And I think we\u2019re more effective working as a group rather than working individually.\u201d\n\nThe path to establishing the Mississippi Hills National Heritage Area began in 2004, and was funded initially by CREATE.\n\nA management plan was approved in fall 2014 to help guide the cultural and heritage development of the area comprising the alliance.\n\ndennis.seid@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @dennisseid", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Mary Cates Williams plans to visit each of the 30 counties in the Mississippi Hills National Heritage Area as early and often as possible.
