On March 22, the San Jose Earthquakes will host its first home game against the Chicago Fire at the brand new, ultramodern Avaya Stadium.

In the Bay Area, it is the first ever soccer-specific stadium.Avaya Stadium represents the newest advances in stadium engineering with several of its features. The stadium is the first cloud-enabled professional sports venue that supports mobile applications, enabling an interactive experience. The whole stadium runs on sustainable energy, provided by founding partner PetersenDean Solar and Roofing. The stadium also has an open-air, canopy roof with the steepest seats in the MLS to create a compelling fan experience.
