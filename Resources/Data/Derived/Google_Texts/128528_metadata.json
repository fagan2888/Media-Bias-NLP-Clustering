Rick Perry to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI know that sometimes this task is especially challenging here in the great Lone Star State,\u201d he said, prompting a woman in the audience to shout \u201cWe\u2019re up to the task!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no state that actually needs this more than Texas,\u201d Obama said. \u201c\u2026Here in just the Dallas area, 133,000 people who don\u2019t currently have health insurance would immediate get health insurance without even having to go through the website\u201d if Texas would just expand Medicaid.\n\nHe noted that neighboring states have done that because \u201cthis is a no-brainer.\u201d Arkansas, alone, he said, cut the number of uninsured by 14 percent in the first month by expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cAcross this state you\u2019ve got a million people, because this is a big state, a million people \u2013 citizens \u2013 who don\u2019t have health insurance that could get health insurance right away\u2026.\n\nThis looks like a pretty motivated group\u2026 I\u2019m going to be right there with you the entire way\u201d until everyone in Texas has affordable healthcare.\n\noriginal post\n\nAir Force One touched down at Love Field in Dallas at 4:48 pm, one hour behind schedule.\n\nEn route, White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president chose Dallas to talk about Obamacare because it\u2019s one of the top 10 cities in terms of uninsured Americans.\n\nThe figures he cited: 1.1 million people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area who are uninsured but eligible for help under Obamacare. Of those, 40 percent of them Latino \u2013 a politically significant data point, as Democrats eye eventual control of Texas \u2014 and about 550,000 with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty line, which means they\u2019re out of luck because of the state\u2019s refusal to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t force them to expand. The Supreme Court ruled on this,\u201d Carney said, insisting the president\u2019s trip isn\u2019t any sort of effort to shift focus from rollout problems. \u201cI can promise you that whether or not the website worked we would be going to places like Dallas, where the education effort and outreach effort is underway, to reach these dense pockets of uninsured Americans.\u201d\n\nHe noted a University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll released Wednesday showing that while Obamacare is overall unpopular in Texas, elements are very popular, including a potential Medicaid expansion. He contrasted Gov. Rick Perry with other governors who have taken that step.\n\n\u201cThose governors are focused on their constituents,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s perhaps the case that Texas Republicans might not be responsive to the views of a Democratic president, a Democratic administration, they may at least take into account to some degree the views of their constituents.\u201d\n\nObama is heading to Temple Emanu-El, to meet with navigators hired by the Communities Foundation of Texas to help people enroll through the troubled HealthCare.gov site. He\u2019ll also thank volunteers from Dallas Area Interfaith. The coalition of religious and other groups working to spread the word about the new marketplace, raising $100,000 to distribute 30,000 pamphlets educating local residents about their options.\n\nAfter that, he\u2019ll head to back-to-back fund-raisers for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the party arm tasked with electing as many Democrats to the U.S. Senate as possible.

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., the DSCC chairman, flew with Obama to Dallas to mingle with donors at the homes of Dallas lawyers Peter Kraus and Russell Budd.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMS9vYmFtYS1hcnJpdmVzLWluLWRhbGxhcy10by1tYWtlLXRoZS1jYXNlLWZvci1vYmFtYWNhcmUuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Todd J.
