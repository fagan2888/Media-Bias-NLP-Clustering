Nobody is quite sure what to make of it. A familiar Washington Kabuki dance? A white-knuckle bond market tightrope walk? A final reactionary howl at the onset of Obamacare? It may be these things, but it\u2019s also something much larger: a Constitutional struggle, a kind of quasi-impeachment, that will test Obama\u2019s mettle and, next to his reelection campaign, poses the most singular threat to his presidency.\n\nThe progression of events begins with a dynamic I described in a print piece at the beginning of 2012 \u2013 conservatives had come to regard the 2012 race as their last chance to win an election as authentic conservatives against a rising Democratic majority. Since their crushing defeat, they have ignored the task of refurbishing the party\u2019s national appeal for its next national electoral bid, and instead have recommitted themselves to waging increasingly millenarian confrontations from their existing red state power base in Congress.\n\nMost of us expected, at some level, that the election would cool the right\u2019s apocalyptic fervor. Instead, the opposite has occurred. Paul Ryan candidly explained the calculation: \"The reason this debt limit fight is different is, we don't have an election around the corner where we feel we are going to win and fix it ourselves. We are stuck with this government another three years.\" This is a remarkable confession. Republicans need to compel Obama to accept their agenda, not in spite of the fact that the voters rejected it at the polls but precisely for that reason.\n\nPhoto: Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nThe exhaustion of electoral channels against Obama has spurred the party to seize power through non-electoral channels. Their opening demand that Obama sign Mitt Romney\u2019s entire economic plan into law in return for avoiding a debt default, while historically bizarre, followed perfectly from their legislative strategy this year.\n\nHouse Republicans decided back in January to boycott any negotiations with Obama over fiscal policy. They presented this at the time as a desire to return to \u201cregular order,\u201d with negotiations between the House and Senate, but eventually decided to boycott those, too. The entire House Republican strategy is premised on using threats to leverage unilateral concessions from the Democrats.\n\nTheir aversion to compromise has been accepted as settled fact in Washington, reimagined not only as a new normal but as the way it\u2019s always been. Republican Dana Rohrabacher defended the use of debt-ceiling threats to pry concessions from Obama like so: \u201cPeople have to recognize there\u2019s never any compromise until the stakes are high. In our society, that\u2019s the nature of democratic government.\u201d That is completely false. American political parties have forged compromises for decades without high-stakes threats to bring them to the table. Not to mention the fact that, by \u201ccompromise,\u201d Rohrabacher means unilateral concessions by the president.\n\nPart of the confusion is that the debt ceiling used to be an opportunity for the opposing party to denounce the fiscal irresponsibility of the president. On occasion, but not usually, debt-ceiling hikes have been appended onto budget agreements that were negotiated on their own terms. What\u2019s completely novel is Congress using the threat of a debt default to force the president to make unilateral policy concessions. The conventions of he-said, she-said journalism have allowed this radical development to insinuate itself into the routine backdrop of partisan squabbling.\n\nNeutral parties have likewise come to accept the hostage-taking threat of the debt ceiling as merely a normal form of political negotiation. Time reporter Zeke Miller asserts, \u201cHostage taking \u2014 by promising harm if you do not get your way \u2014 has long been a standard way of doing business in Washington,\u201d pointing to Democratic threats to let the Bush tax cuts expire or to change Senate rules as an analogue.\n\nPhoto: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nBut these examples lack any of the relevant hostage-taking qualities that sets apart the debt ceiling threat. One is the scale and irreversible impact of a debt ceiling breach \u2013 unlike the failure of a bill, or even a government shutdown, which can be reversed. Second, and more importantly, it\u2019s normal in any negotiation for each party to have a walk-away threshold to stop something they consider objectionable. Democrats, in the cases Miller cites, were objecting to outcomes -- full extension of the Bush tax cuts, continued filibustering of executive appointments \u2013 that they defined as unacceptable. House Republicans, by contrast, don\u2019t object to raising the debt ceiling. They concede it\u2019s necessary to avoid disaster!\n\nThe hostage dynamic of the debt-ceiling fight has created a dangerous, historically unusual set of circumstances. One aspect of it is to set up a precarious, high-stakes negotiation, the failure of which could set off large, immediate, and irreversible damage. The second is to reset the balance of power between the president and Congress, allowing the latter to compel the former to submit to its agenda without concessions. Both these changes would permanently and dangerously alter the character of American government.\n\nIf outsiders have failed to grasp the motivations of the House Republicans, puzzling at their odd redoubling of ideological fervor since November, they have likewise mistaken Obama. Everything I have seen from Obama suggests he understands that he cannot repeat his blunder of 2011, when he mistook the GOP\u2019s debt-ceiling threat for an invitation to engage in normal fiscal bargaining.\n\nObama can\u2019t tame the monster he created gradually; he has to kill it completely. Bargaining his way through this crisis would do Obama no good, even if he could get through it by offering up a meager or even symbolic concession. Anything that allows Republicans to believe they can trade a debt-ceiling threat for policy concessions simply creates a new hostage crisis the next time the debt ceiling comes up. This negotiation is Obama\u2019s only chance to halt the routinization of debt-ceiling extortion.\n\nObama\u2019s incentive structure is simple, then: Allowing Republicans to default on the debt now is better than trading something that allows them to threaten it later. His best option is to refuse to negotiate the debt ceiling and have the House raise it before October 17. His next best option is to refuse to negotiate the debt ceiling, allow default, and never have to go through it again. Bargaining merely postpones, and worsens, the next default crisis. No negotiated debt-ceiling price is small enough to be acceptable. There is therefore no circumstance under which bargaining for a debt-ceiling hike makes sense, even if the alternative is certain default.\n\nThat is a frightening reality, made all the more frightening by two additional factors. The first is that Republicans don\u2019t believe Obama\u2019s insistence that he won\u2019t negotiate. Obama can claim he won\u2019t negotiate, but he would have an incentive to lie about this, and nobody other than Obama can really know for sure. (I believe him, but I wouldn\u2019t bet my life on it.) And one of the things Republicans truly believe about Obama \u2014 they say it constantly in private \u2014 is that they can make him fold.\n\nAs the debt-ceiling deadline ticks toward midnight, Obama ought to be able to make his determination clear enough that House Republican leaders understand their only choices are to raise the debt ceiling or breach it. Default would risk not only economic calamity but the potential of an electoral one for the otherwise unassailable Republican majority. But history is replete with disastrous miscalculations. They\u2019re often made by weak, short-sighted leaders facing pressure to demonstrate toughness from internal opponents. That is to say, Boehner is exactly the kind of leader who would blunder into a calamity like a debt default.\n\nYet Obama simply has no alternative but to accept that risk. The stakes are higher than resisting the specific demands Republicans are making, and higher even than the economic havoc of a debt breach.
