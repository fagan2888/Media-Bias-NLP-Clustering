David Chester added a solo home run for the Sea Dogs (78-50).\n\nPortland continues to lead the East Division, with a 1 1/2-game lead over Binghamton.\n\nThe top two teams in both East and West divisions reach the postseason, and Portland holds a 14-game lead over third-place New Britain (63-63), which also won Sunday.\n\nThe magic number for Portland to reach the playoffs is now one. Either one Portland win or one New Britain loss puts the Sea Dogs in the playoffs for the first time since 2008.\n\n\u201cWe try not to pay too much attention to the standings, but we know if we keep winning, we\u2019ll be in good position,\u201d said Mike Augliera, Sunday\u2019s winning pitcher. \u201cOur job is to keep plugging away.\u201d\n\nBoth Portland and New Britain are off Monday. The Sea Dogs begin a six-game road trip Tuesday in Harrisburg.\n\nIn the West Division, first-place Richmond (70-57) remained a half-game ahead of Akron (70-58).\n\nOn Sunday, Augliera (6-10) allowed one run on six hits in six innings.\n\nWhile his record may not dazzle, Augliera is fourth in the Eastern League in innings pitched (140).\n\n\u201cHe goes out there every fifth day and he gives us innings,\u201d Sea Dogs Manager Billy McMillon said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go to our bullpen as much when he\u2019s out there. He\u2019s been very reliable.\n\n\u201cWhen he\u2019s good, he\u2019s down in the zone, like he was today.\u201d\n\nAugliera was staked to a 5-0 lead in the second inning as the Sea Dogs took advantage of an poor outing from Kyle Crick (6-7), the San Francisco Giants top prospect, according to Baseball America.\n\nAfter walking one batter in the first, Crick walked three more in the second, while also giving up two hits.\n\nAlmanzar greeted reliever Phil McCormick with a bases-clearing double to left for a 5-0 lead.\n\n\u201cThe offense jumped out early, so I just tried to throw strikes and let the defense play behind me,\u201d Augliera said.\n\nRobby Scott (1.98 ERA) pitched two scoreless innings of relief and Aaron Kurcz (2.15) finished it off.\n\nPortland was out-hit 8-6 but got the big blasts, including Chester\u2019s fifth home run in his 51st game for the Sea Dogs.\n\nChester, a 33rd-round draft pick out of the University of Pittsburgh in 2011, was part of Class A Salem\u2019s championship run. He sees a similar pattern in Portland.\n\n\u201cA lot of the same guys,\u201d said Chester, while his teammates celebrated their third straight win. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting hot at the right time. That\u2019s all that matters at the end.\u201d\n\nAfter the road trip to Harrisburg and then New Hampshire, the Sea Dogs return to Hadlock Field next Monday for their final regular-season home stand from Aug. 25 to Sept. 1.\n\nNOTES: The announced paid attendance was 7,368, the 12th sellout of the season \u2026 Sea Dogs catcher Mike Brenly threw out two runners trying to steal second base in the first inning \u2026 Sea Dogs ace Brian Johnson was initially scheduled to pitch Tuesday, but has been moved to next weekend to give him extra rest \u2026 Sea Dogs playoff tickets go on sale Monday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Portland continues to lead the East Division with a 1 1/2-game lead over Binghamton.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Portland continues to lead the East Division with a 1 1/2-game lead over Binghamton.", "title": "Sea Dogs on threshold of playoffs with 7-1 win over Richmond - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/487346_641808-20140817_SeaDogs_005.jpg", "height": 857}, "updated_time": "2014-08-18T00:33:34-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/08/17/sea-dogs-on-threshold-of-playoffs-with-7-1-won-over-richmond/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Portland continues to lead the East Division with a 1 1/2-game lead over Binghamton.", "title": "Sea Dogs on threshold of playoffs with 7-1 win over Richmond - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/487346_641808-20140817_SeaDogs_005.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Portland Sea Dogs", "published_time": "2014-08-17T16:52:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-18T00:33:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0f0\"", "article_summary": "Either one Portland win or one New Britain loss puts the Sea Dogs in the playoffs for the first time since 2008.\nThe Portland Sea Dogs settled for a win, and the anticipation of bubbly later this week.\n\u201cHe goes out there every fifth day and he gives us innings,\u201d Sea Dogs Manager Billy McMillon said.\nThe Sea Dogs begin a six-game road trip Tuesday in Harrisburg.\nDavid Chester added a solo home run for the Sea Dogs (78-50)."}
