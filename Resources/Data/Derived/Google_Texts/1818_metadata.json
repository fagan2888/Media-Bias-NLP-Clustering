His current coverage through Utah\u2019s high-risk insurance pool plan ends Dec. 31. By that time, the Obama administration expects enrollees to transition into health plans sold through the new health-care law.\n\nBut so far, Gisler hasn\u2019t succeeded in purchasing coverage -- but not for a lack of effort.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had three separate applications that failed to make it through,\u201d Gisler says. \u201cI have a notebook with all the calls I\u2019ve made, maybe 50 or 100. It just goes on and on.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Gisler quit trying. Worried about a potential gap in coverage, he decided to forgo his son\u2019s $3,000 tax credit and buy outside of the exchange from a local insurance broker.\n\n\u201cWe have a son who is critically ill,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cannot take any chances. Not having insurance would, in no short order, lead our family to bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is designed to expand health insurance coverage. But the law's insurance cancellations mixed with the Web site's problems might leave some people who have coverage now uninsured in the new year.\n\nThese are Obamacare's biggest losers: People whose current plans have been canceled but who are having trouble getting through HealthCare.Gov to purchase coverage by Dec. 23 -- the deadline for buying insurance that begins Jan. 1.\n\nThe concern is particularly acute for patients with expensive medical conditions, who rely on their coverage for doctor visits and drug refills that would otherwise break the bank.\n\nEven with HealthCare.gov improving and enrollment numbers rising -- approximately 1.2 million people have gained coverage since October -- there's still concern about what happens if this particular population falls through the cracks.\n\n\u201cAs we approach the end of the month, there is set of chronically ill people for whom a coverage gap is a big deal,\u201d says Caroline Pearson, a vice president at research firm Avalere Health. \u201cThese are folks who use a lot of drugs and a lot of services and could potentially have. We haven\u2019t left them very much time.\u201d\n\nThose facing a potential coverage gap include an estimated 15 million people who purchase coverage for themselves on the individual market, many of whom received cancellation notices because their policies did not meet health-care law requirements.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d certainly like to have continuous coverage for the peace of mind,\u201d says Rich VanMetter, a 64-year-old D.C. resident whose Kaiser Permanente plan will end this year.\n\nVanMetter only wants to purchase coverage for January and February; he turns 65 in March and will then qualify for Medicare. But his application with the D.C. HealthLink has been held up in the identity verification process, requiring him to fax in copies of his driver\u2019s license.\n\n\u201cEver since I got my first job in 1977, I\u2019ve had continuous coverage,\u201d he says. \u201cSuppose I slip on the ice and break my arm. I\u2019m 64. Anything can happen, so having insurance is extremely important.\u201d\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Congress Wednesday that the cancellation of a private plan should not be equated with losing coverage.\n\n\"I know people have been told their health plan doesn't necessarily match the Affordable Care Act requirements,\" she said. \"Losing coverage and being notified that the plan they have doesn't exist anymore are two very different things.\"\n\nThere are also approximately 300,000 Americans receiving coverage through state-run high-risk plans, which provide subsidized insurance to residents who insurance companies have rejected because of preexisting conditions. About two-thirds of them will lose coverage at the end of this month. These programs tend to cover some of the sickest patients, whose monthly medications can cost upwards of $60,000 without coverage.\n\n\u201cFor some of the high-risk members, it's a matter of life or death,\u201d says Tanya Case, executive director of the National Association of State High Risk Pools. \u201cWe have many members who are on specialty medications that they have no way of affording on their own.\u201d\n\nCase says that the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight at Health and Human Services has directed the federally-funded high risk pools to call each and every enrollee to find out whether they have successfully enrolled in health-care law coverage. Those calls began this month, and will continue through this week.\n\nWhile those calls are still on-going, Case says she hears from members of the high-risk pool she runs in Oklahoma who are successfully enrolling in less than an hour -- and those who are still having difficulty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag,\u201d Case says. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re seeing our members tried to enroll really early, because we had impressed on them how important it was. It became such an emotional issue, and now they\u2019re just paralyzed in the process.\u201d\n\nOne other challenge for patients with high medical bills has been figuring out which health insurance plans on the exchange meet their specific needs. Hemophiliacs, for example, can require $100,000 in monthly prescriptions -- making it crucial to determine whether a particular plan covers their medication.\n\nInformation on doctor networks and drug formularies is not typically available on the exchange. Instead, shoppers need to visit each individual plan\u2019s Web site to track down that information.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, especially if you\u2019re in a situation like a cancer patient and need ongoing coverage, you need to just pick a plan,\u201d says Marc Boutin, executive vice president at the National Health Council, which works with patient advocacy groups. \u201cIn an ideal world, you\u2019d be able to get an estimate of who is in your network. It\u2019s frustrating, from our perspective, because we think that should be built in.\u201d\n\nThe health-care law does include some protections for those who might select an inappropriate plan. It limits maximum cost-sharing to $6,350 for an individual -- still a significant amount, but also much less than some specialty medications.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better than not having coverage, but it also means you\u2019re going to be hit with $6,000 in bills before you can get care,\u201d Boutin says.\n\nGisler in Utah has filed an appeal with the federal exchange and is hoping to eventually gain coverage through the marketplace. For his son, he sees the health-care law as a mixed bag. For the first time, he was able to gain coverage in the individual market despite having a serious medical condition. And his new premium is half of what he paid in the state program, which was about $700 per month.\n\nBut technical difficulties have prevented Gisler\u2019s son from accessing the tax credit he believes he should receive. That would knock an additional $250 each month off his premium bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a net gain for us, that preexisting conditions no longer preclude coverage,\u201d Gisler says. \u201cBut in terms of the government\u2019s ability to process us through the system, they\u2019re still working on that. We\u2019ve given up. We don\u2019t even try anymore.\u201d\n\nKLIFF NOTES: Top health policy reads from around the Web.\n\nHHS is in the process of \u201chand-matching\u201d thousands of enrollments. \u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is manually fixing thousands of flawed enrollment transmissions sent from HealthCare.gov to insurance companies in October and November, Congress was told Wednesday. \"We are in the process of actually hand-matching individuals to insurance companies,\u201d Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\u201d Jonathan Easley in the Hill.\n\nObamacare enrollment is gaining pace, but still behind projections. \u201cAbout 365,000 Americans chose health plans during the first two months of the federal and state insurance marketplaces, bringing the total to more than triple the meager enrollment from October, according to new figures issued by the Obama administration. The report shows that the number of people who collectively signed up for coverage in the 14 states running their own insurance exchanges continued to outpace the total enrollment from the three dozen states relying on the federal marketplace.\u201d Amy Goldstein and Lena Sun in The Washington Post.\n\nCongress is inching closer to a 3-month doc-fix. \u201cCongress is planning to patch Medicare's flawed physician payment system for three months, sparing doctors from a substantial pay cut on Jan. 1, a GOP source told the Hill. A short-term \"doc fix\" would set the stage for lawmakers to permanently repeal and replace Medicare's sustainable growth rate (SGR) early next year. \u201c Elise Viebeck in the Hill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The law's insurance cancellations mixed with the Web site's problems might leave some people who have coverage now uninsured in the new year.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The law's insurance cancellations mixed with the Web site's problems might leave some people who have coverage now uninsured in the new year.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s biggest losers", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/12/11/obamacares-biggest-losers/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/11/Health-Environment-Science/Images/116685584.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/12/11/obamacares-biggest-losers/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "insurance, coverage, obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "insurance, coverage, obamacare,"}, "article_summary": "Not having insurance would, in no short order, lead our family to bankruptcy.\u201dThe Affordable Care Act is designed to expand health insurance coverage.\nThese are Obamacare's biggest losers: People whose current plans have been canceled but who are having trouble getting through HealthCare.Gov to purchase coverage by Dec. 23 -- the deadline for buying insurance that begins Jan. 1.\nBy that time, the Obama administration expects enrollees to transition into health plans sold through the new health-care law.\n\"I know people have been told their health plan doesn't necessarily match the Affordable Care Act requirements,\" she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a net gain for us, that preexisting conditions no longer preclude coverage,\u201d Gisler says."}
