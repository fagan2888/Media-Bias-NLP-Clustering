I started thinking about the inning and thought, \u2018Well, that went well,\u2019\u201d Brothers said.\n\nIt was the fifth immaculate inning in MLB this season, tying a record.\n\nHis perfect eighth inning went like this:\n\nStruck out Michael Morse looking\n\n1. 90 mph fastball, called strike\n\n2. 85 mph slider, foul\n\n3. 92 mph fastball, called strike\n\nStruck out Brandon Crawford looking\n\n1. 84 mph slider, swinging strike\n\n2. 85 mph slider, foul\n\n3. 91 mph fastball, called strike\n\nStruck out Gregor Blanco swinging\n\n1. 90 mph fastball, called strike\n\n2. 83 mph slider, called strike\n\n3. 86 mph slider, swinging strike\n\nThe Giants fouled off just two pitches. They looked at five called strikes. They swung and missed twice.\n\n\u201cMomentum swings are big, especially in this place. I think that plays, definitely, to their advantage,\u201d Brothers said. \u201cAnd any time you can have a shutdown inning and get your team back in the dugout as quick as possible, that\u2019s obviously going to be for the betterment of the team.\u201d\n\nBrothers earned the win to move to 3-4 and dropped his ERA to 4.85. He also increased his season strikeout total to 30 and tipped the scales in his K-to-walk ratio from 1.69 to 1.88 (30 to 18).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good ball club over there. It seems like it\u2019s always a battle, whether it\u2019s here or there,\u201d Brothers said. \u201cVery proud of what we\u2019ve done to this point, especially at this point in the year and how we\u2019re still battling.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies, with a win Sunday in the series finale, can earn their first sweep of the Giants in San Francisco since 2008.\n\n\u201cWe have to keep our noses to the grind and keep playing hard,\u201d Brothers said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Rex Brothers", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "Rex Brothers threw just the 76th immaculate inning in baseball history (nine pitches, nine strikes) in the Rockies' come-from-behind victory over the Giants", "title": "Rex Brothers throws an immaculate inning for Rockies on nine strikes", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/06/14/rex-brothers-throws-immaculate-inning-rockies-nine-strikes/17816/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/06/rex-brothers-rockies-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Rex Brothers threw just the 76th immaculate inning in baseball history (nine pitches, nine strikes) in the Rockies' come-from-behind victory over the Giants", "creator": "@nickgroke", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2014/06/14/rex-brothers-throws-immaculate-inning-rockies-nine-strikes/17816/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2014/06/rex-brothers-rockies-495x329.jpg", "title": "Rex Brothers throws an immaculate inning for Rockies on nine strikes", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Rex Brothers threw just the 76th immaculate inning in baseball history (nine pitches, nine strikes) in the Rockies' come-from-behind victory over the Giants"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2033\"", "article_summary": "Rex Brothers on Saturday threw just the 76th immaculate inning in baseball history \u2014 nine pitches, nine strikes, three outs \u2014 in the Rockies\u2019 come-from-behind victory over the Giants.\n90 mph fastball, called strike2.\n83 mph slider, called strike3.\nHis perfect eighth inning went like this:Struck out Michael Morse looking1.\n92 mph fastball, called strikeStruck out Brandon Crawford looking1."}
