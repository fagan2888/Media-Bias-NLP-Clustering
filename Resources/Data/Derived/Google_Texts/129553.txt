Workplace wellness is a big issue with workers. After all no amount of money is worth getting sick and dying over. We all hear about workplace wellness programs and claims that they are well worth the cost. In consideration of the high value we place on our health this is well worth exploring.

Workplace wellness programs have been becoming increasingly popular, reports Health Affairs. Employers want these programs to improve the health and well-being of employees, which can clearly lead to increased productivity. This can all result in lower medical costs, increased productivity, and reduced absenteeism for the firm. For this study researchers evaluated the cost impact of the lifestyle and disease management aspects of PepsiCoâ€™s wellness program, Healthy Living.

It was found that seven years of continuous participation in one or both aspects of the program was associated with an average reduction of $30 in health care cost per member per month. When the components were broken down it was found that the disease management aspect was associated with lower costs than the lifestyle management aspect. They have estimated disease management to lower health care costs by $136 per member per month, due to being driven by a 29 percent reduction in hospital admissions.

The researchers concluded wellness programs may decrease health risks, delay or avoid the onset of chronic illnesses, and lower health care costs for employees with chronic disease. However, employers and policy makers should not take for granted that the lifestyle management aspect of such programs can lower health care costs or even lead to net savings.
