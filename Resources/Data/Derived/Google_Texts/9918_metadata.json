The New York Times\u2018s Jonathan Martin attempts to answer that question in a front page article from Saturday\u2019s paper that demonstrates how the paths of these two \u201ctea party\u201d senators have diverged over the last several months and what that split means for the GOP.\n\nMartin describes recently developed \u201canger and resentment\u201d between the two men, who in the past have considered each other \u201cgood friends\u201d He reports that in private, Cruz has suggested that Paul could never be elected president because he will always be associated with her libertarian father, former Rep. Ron Paul. Meanwhile, he reports that Paul\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d has called Cruz \u201cthe chief of the wacko birds,\u201d perhaps in an attempt to distance themselves from the term coined by Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) to describe both men.\n\nAnd as Cruz became even more closely aligned with the tea party after his anti-Obamacare \u201cfilibuster\u201d last month, Paul has begun to embrace the \u201cestablishment\u201d wing of the party, appearing at events sponsored by Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads and campaigning with fellow Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell.\n\nMartin reports that after Paul privately admitted the government shutdown was a \u201cdumb idea,\u201d establishment Republicans are \u201clining up to heap praise on Mr. Paul, using words like \u2018grown\u2019 and \u2018matured\u2019 to describe him and the role he played during the shutdown.\u201d\n\nAt this point, both senators are high on the list of probably 2016 GOP presidential candidates. With three years to go, they are already making strides to differentiate themselves from each other.\n\nRead Martin\u2019s full article at NYTimes.com.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who represents the future of the Republican Party, Texas Senator Ted Cruz or Kentucky Senator Rand Paul?
