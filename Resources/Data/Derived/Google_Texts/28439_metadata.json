The EITC is the third-largest federal assistance program for people with low incomes, and it is a kind of conditional variant on Milton Friedman\u2019s idea of a negative income tax: Workers at the low end of the income spectrum get a refundable credit tied to income earned with work; because it\u2019s fully refundable, it means that workers get the full credit even if the amount exceeds their tax liability.\n\nThere are serious concerns with the EITC: Notably, it has a 24 percent improper payment rate, which is unusually high even for a major federal program. The spending controls, to the extent that they exist, are clearly flawed. But even still, it\u2019s widely regarded as an effective way of moving people into the workforce and thus increasing their incomes, moving millions of children out of poverty and into the lower middle class each year. It\u2019s also a much better way of targeting genuinely needy low-income individuals than increases in the minimum wage.\n\nFor those who believe that tax rates affect behavior, this won\u2019t come as a surprise; the EITC offers a major tax incentive for people at the bottom end of the income spectrum to work, and in that sense is substantively different from many other assistance programs that simply offer a benefit.\n\nObama\u2019s support for expanding the EITC isn\u2019t new\u2014he published a lengthy proposal for expanding it last year. But even still, it\u2019s at least a little odd that the president didn\u2019t stress this idea even more. Not only is it exactly the sort of \u201cmiddle class economics\u201d policy that he spent this year\u2019s State of the Union touting, it\u2019s also one of the few places where he might be able to find common ground with Republicans in Congress.\n\nRonald Reagan enthusiastically expanded it in 1986, calling it \u201cthe best antipoverty, the best pro-family, the best job creation measure to come out of Congress.\u201d And more recently, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), one of the GOP\u2019s most powerful domestic policy agenda-setters in Congress, has called for further expansion of the credit as part of the suite of anti-poverty policies he put forth last year.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Obama\u2019s proposal and Ryan\u2019s differ, especially in their funding mechanisms. Comparing the two proposals is instructive.\n\nIn some sense they mirror each other. Neither were built with the expectation that they quickly would become legislative reality. Both are paid for with funding mechanisms that members of the other party are likely to oppose. Obama would expand the credit with new tax revenue, while Ryan would pay for his expansion by cancelling several other programs, including Social Service Block Grants, the Economic Development Administration, and the federal Fresh Fruits and Vegetables program.\n\nBut even this brief comparison reveals the major difference between the two proposals: Obama wants to make federal aid programs bigger; Ryan wants to make them better.\n\nIndeed, Ryan\u2019s proposal sets the expansion of the EITC in the broader context of reforming the safety net and helping the poor (there's even a criminal justice component), and it addresses a number of concerns about the EITC while offering a variety of ideas to make it more effective and streamlined.\n\nA common complaint on the left, for example, is that qualifying for the EITC is unnecessarily complicated\u2014an extensive paperwork hassle that poses an even bigger burden on the folks who need the credit the most. Ryan\u2019s plan notes this, agrees, and then suggests simplifying delivery of the EITC by putting it directly onto paychecks. That, in theory, should bolster the link between work and the credit, making it more effective. Ryan\u2019s plan also argues that reducing the complexity of the qualification process would reduce fraud and other improper payments, and proposes sharing savings generated by reducing bad payments with beneficiaries\u2014meaning that boosters of the EITC would have an incentive to reduce payment error.\n\nIn addition, Ryan\u2019s plan gives states more flexibility to implement various poverty programs, setting up a kind of contest system where states can innovate and compete to best deliver aid.\n\nTo be sure, there are problems with Ryan\u2019s poverty plan, of which the EITC is just one part: It calls for an army of nannying case-workers charged with guiding beneficiaries through a life plan, and it is probably too optimistic about what efficiency improvements can be achieved in government programs.\n\nBut it is an actual reform plan, designed to improve the overall performance of government aid by shifting resources away from bureaucratic boondoggles and into a program that has demonstrated its effectiveness while simultaneously exploring ways to address that program\u2019s existing problems.\n\nObama\u2019s plan, in contrast, is little more than an expansion designed to grow the program without regard to its problems or how it meshes with the rest of the government\u2019s aid programs. Its implicit definition of a better program is simply one that spends and does more.\n\nThat definition lends itself to a remarkably simplistic theory of government, in which programs that don\u2019t work need more funding to work better, and programs that do work need more funding to expand upon their success. It\u2019s this basic outlook that has resulted in a bloated federal government overrun with ineffective aid programs that are exceedingly difficult to cut.\n\nRyan's proposal offers a counter-theory, which is that programs should be tested and held accountable, expanded and tweaked if they work, but pruned if they don't. His plan isn\u2019t perfect, but it starts from the right assumption\u2014that when it comes to improving government programs, more isn\u2019t necessarily better, but that, well, better is.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Both want to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).
