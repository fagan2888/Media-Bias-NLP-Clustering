Not open and conducting no audits until the government is reopened. (Photo: Getty)\n\n4421044\n\nThe Obama administration announced new rules under Obamacare on Monday that target nonprofit hospitals\u2019 efforts to get paid by their patients.\n\nNonprofit hospitals, which serve a charitable purpose and are often religiously affiliated, will now be subject to strict rules on when and how they can collect payments from customers, thanks to regulations included in the health-care law. As a condition of their tax-exempt status, these hospitals must \u201ctake an active role in improving the health of the communities they serve,\u201d Treasury Department deputy assistant secretary for tax policy Emily McMahon wrote in a blog post Monday.\n\nUnder the new IRS rules, the penalty for failing to meet the new standards could even lead hospitals\u2019 tax-exempt status to be revoked entirely.\n\n\u201cReports that some charitable hospitals have used aggressive debt collection practices, including allowing debt collectors to pursue collections in emergency rooms, have highlighted the need for clear rules to protect patients,\u201d McMahon wrote. \u201cFor hospitals to be tax-exempt, they should be held to a higher standard.\u201d\n\nThe rules cover a number of Obamacare requirements. For one, hospitals must charge the uninsured the same price for emergency care as those with insurance are \u201cgenerally billed,\u201d whether they have private coverage, Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nNonprofit hospitals will be required to have and \u201cwidely publicize\u201d a financial assistance program \u2014 and will be banned from using certain collection methods until they\u2019ve taken \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to see whether a patient who hasn\u2019t paid their bill is eligible for assistance. The hospital can\u2019t report unpaid bills to a credit agency or garnish wages until hospital workers themselves have determined whether a customer is financially needy or is just trying to skip out on the payment.\n\nThe new regulations don\u2019t stop at active patients. In order to maintain tax-exempt status, nonprofit hospitals now need to actively attempt to handle health problems in their communities.\n\n\u201cEach charitable hospital must conduct and publish a community health needs assessment at least once every three years,\u201d McMahon wrote. \u201cAnd disclose on the tax form it files annually the steps it is taking to address the health needs identified in the assessment.\u201d\n\nIf a hospital fails to live up to the IRS\u2019s new standards, it could have its tax-exempt status revoked. But there\u2019s some leniency \u2014 if a misstep appears to be an honest mistake, the hospital can \u201ccorrect and publicly disclose\u201d its error and pay an excise tax on that program rather than having the whole hospital\u2019s status revoked.\n\nThe requirements were included in the health-care law as consumer protections, according to McMahon.\n\n\u201cThat is why the Affordable Care Act (ACA) included additional consumer protection requirements for charitable hospitals, so that patients are protected from abusive collections practices and have access to information about financial assistance at all tax-exempt hospitals,\u201d McMahon wrote.\n\nOver half of all hospitals are nonprofits, representing a significant pool of money that\u2019s exempt from state and federal tax authorities. Charitable hospitals have been criticized for years on the grounds that some don\u2019t spend enough on free care for patients who qualify for financial assistance.\n\nA 2013 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that on average, nonprofit hospitals spent 7.5 percent of their operating expenses on charity care and community benefit, according to The New York Times.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'They should be held to a higher standard'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration announced new rules under Obamacare on Monday that target nonprofit hospitals' efforts to get paid by their patients.
