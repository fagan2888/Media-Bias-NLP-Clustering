The day after that, the court affirmed the administration\u2019s legal position in a 5-4 decision establishing gay marriage as the law of the land.\n\nWhen the marriage decision was announced, the president was in Charleston, S.C., at Emanuel A.M.E. Church where he gave an impassioned eulogy for nine murdered African-American parishioners before leading the congregation in a rendition of \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d which he began a cappella.\n\nIt was an extraordinary scene, and reminded millions of Americans of the Barack Obama they voted for in 2008. Although one snarky former White House aide issued a snide tweet criticizing South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for previously supporting the Confederate flag, Obama himself sat beside Haley in church and praised her from the pulpit for her leadership on the issue.\n\nObama returned home Friday night to see the White House bathed\u2014per his orders\u2014in the rainbow colors of the gay pride movement. Asked days later about his winning streak at an East Room press conference, Obama merely acknowledged his \u201cgratifying\u201d week, but mentioned other blessed weeks in his life, including the one in which he\u2019d married Michelle\u2014and the times when his daughters were born. Obama also playfully mentioned scoring 27 points in a high school basketball game, although he may have been poking fun at himself. Or not. But there was no denying his string of successes.\n\nThe American people noticed. Obama\u2019s job approval rating in CNN\u2019s poll topped 50 percent for the first time in a while. So why didn\u2019t he spike the ball and do an end-zone dance? Several reasons, it seems to me.\n\nFirst, if I may mix my sports metaphors, the president was heeding the advice of Crash Davis in \u201cBull Durham.\u201d He didn\u2019t mess with a winning streak. Republicans in Congress and the Supreme Court and in South Carolina had helped him, so why antagonize them?\n\n(Well, then came Thursday in Wisconsin, when he delivered a weirdly partisan -- even for him -- speech mocking the 2016 GOP field and the entire Republican Party.)\n\nSecond, it became clear that Obama had no intention of resting on his laurels. Last Monday, he announced plans to unilaterally give an estimated 5 million Americans a pay raise by tweaking Labor Department rules about overtime pay. On Tuesday, he announced plans to open a U.S. Embassy in Cuba\u2014and allow the Cubans to open one here. On Wednesday, he went to Nashville where he publicly lobbied Tennesseans to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. No less a local Republican personage than former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist expressed support for Obama\u2019s approach.\n\nBut there was another factor mitigating against presidential victory dances. In the middle of this run of success\u2014on the same fateful Friday he spoke in Charleston and the high court upheld gay marriage\u2014a frightful series of terrorist attacks rocked the world.\n\nIslamic terrorists struck in France, Kuwait, and Tunisia on the same day. In France, an Islamic radical drove a delivery van into a U.S.-owned chemical plant while attempting to blow it up. He failed, but did decapitate the manager of a transportation company and unfurl two Islamic banners. A little while later, a suicide bomber in Kuwait blew up a Shiite mosque, killing 25 worshipers and wounding many more. In Tunisia, a gunman pulled an assault rifle from a beach umbrella and began shooting sunbathers indiscriminately. Thirty-eight people died, most of them from Great Britain.\n\nThree attacks on three continents in a matter of hours. ISIS took credit for Tunisia and Kuwait; France appears to be a \u201clone wolf\u201d attack, but this is becoming a distinction without a difference: If ISIS exhorts extremists around the world to launch such attacks\u2014and these calls are heeded\u2014it\u2019s irrelevant to the victims whether the killers received direct operational support from ISIS. This was a lesson Americans learned in Charleston: Armed lunatics inspired by hate can be just as dangerous as organized terrorist groups.\n\nISIS punctuated its June 26 orgy of bloodletting by throwing four gay men in Iraq off a five-story rooftop to their deaths, perhaps in response to the U.S. Supreme Court decision on gay marriage.\n\nBarack Obama ran for president wanting to reduce America\u2019s military footprint in the world. He continues to believe that the original sin was George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq, a view shared by a majority of Americans. It also seems obvious that Obama\u2019s decision to withdraw from that country was premature and that his dithering in Syria made things worse. But those mistakes are in the past. The only steps Obama can take now are ones that try to shape the future.\n\nEven as administration officials worried about possible terrorist attacks against Americans on July 4, the Royal Air Force was flying home the bodies of the 30 Britons murdered in Tunisia. In the House of Commons, Prime Minister David Cameron termed the killings an act of war against the U.K. He\u2019s right, but they were also an act of war against the civilized world.\n\nLong before the latest atrocities, ISIS released videos boasting about machine-gunning Iraqi prisoners of war, beheading Western journalists and international aid workers, burning a Jordanian military pilot alive, executing dozens of Egyptian Christians working in Libya, and auctioning off ethnic Yazidi women as sex slaves.\n\nThis is a regime no government on earth wants to see survive. And Barack Obama is the only international leader with the cred and the military muscle to go to the United Nations and serve notice that his country will lead a global effort to rid the world of this scourge.\n\nLast week, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie formally declared his presidential candidacy. One of 15 Republicans who would like to succeed Obama as commander-in-chief, Christie was asked by a reporter why his job approval rating in New Jersey is so low. In reply, Christie said his popularity had taken a hit because he\u2019s made some tough decisions in Trenton, that he\u2019d used his political capital to get things done. That\u2019s not the whole answer, but it\u2019s partially true\u2014and instructive. It\u2019s time for President Obama to do the same.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With apologies to Judith Viorst, the nearly two weeks leading up to the July 4 weekend might be called President Obama\u2019s wonderful, remarkable, not at all bad, very good fortnight.\nIt started...", "title": "How Obama Can Build on His Winning Streak | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/07/05/how_obama_can_build_on_his_winning_streak_127225.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/110916_2_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With apologies to Judith Viorst, the nearly two weeks leading up to the July 4 weekend might be called President Obama\u2019s wonderful, remarkable, not at all bad, very good fortnight.\nIt started...", "title": "How Obama Can Build on His Winning Streak | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "How Obama Can Build on His Winning Streak | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "Barack Obama,ISIS,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s time for President Obama to do the same.\nIt also seems obvious that Obama\u2019s decision to withdraw from that country was premature and that his dithering in Syria made things worse.\nIt was an extraordinary scene, and reminded millions of Americans of the Barack Obama they voted for in 2008.\nObama returned home Friday night to see the White House bathed\u2014per his orders\u2014in the rainbow colors of the gay pride movement.\nWith apologies to Judith Viorst, the nearly two weeks leading up to the July 4 weekend might be called President Obama\u2019s wonderful, remarkable, not at all bad, very good fortnight."}
