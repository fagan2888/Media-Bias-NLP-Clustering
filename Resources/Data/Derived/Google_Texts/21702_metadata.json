The Cowboys won 20-10. ( Matt Rourke / Associated Press )\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2014 No Romo. No Dez. No problem.\n\nTony Romo joined Dez Bryant on the injured list with a broken left collarbone, but the Dallas Cowboys shut down DeMarco Murray and beat the Philadelphia Eagles 20-10 on Sunday.\n\n\"I'll be back,\" Romo said. \"It's going to take a little bit of time. It's a broken bone. It is what it is. Our team played great. I'm proud we got this win. It's not an easy place to come in and win. We'll hopefully get a few more and we'll get ready to go.\"\n\nKyle Wilber returned a blocked punt 26 yards for touchdown, Brandon Weeden threw a 42-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams and the Cowboys (2-0) overcame a franchise-record 18 penalties in their 10th consecutive road win.\n\nIt's a costly victory for Dallas, however.\n\nRomo suffered a similar injury in Week 7 in 2010 and missed the rest of the season. The team said he'll be evaluated on Monday. Weeden is 5-16 as a starter, including 0-1 for the Cowboys. He finished 7 of 7 for 73 yards.\n\nDallas already lost Bryant last week. The All-Pro receiver will miss at least six weeks after having foot surgery.\n\n\"Key thing is we get to have him at the end of the season,\" Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said of Romo. \"Physically, he has such focus and he understands his body. If it's possible to get back, he'll do it. No one has greater appreciation for what we can do than him.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWeeden started 15 games for Cleveland in 2012 as a 29-year-old rookie. He threw two interceptions in a 28-17 loss to Arizona last year in his only start for Dallas.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-09-20T19:06:17-0600", "modificationDate": "2015-09-20T19:06:48-0600", "byline": "Associated Press", "sailthru.author": "Associated Press", "description": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 No Romo.
