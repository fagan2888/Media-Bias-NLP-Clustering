With the committee\u2019s blessing, King\u2019s confirmation will go before the full Senate.\n\nObama nominated King, who currently serves as acting secretary, last month. He would succeed Arne Duncan, who stepped down from the post in December 2015, and tapped King to serve as his second-in-command early last year.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate HELP Committee, praised his members for approving the new Department of Education head, who will be tasked with overseeing the implementation of the latest iteration of No Child Left Behind.\n\n\u201cI urged the president to sent the Senate a nominee for education secretary, and after today\u2019s vote, we are a step closer to having a confirmed secretary who will be accountable to Congress as we work together to ensure the new law is implemented just as Congress wrote it\u2014reversing the trend toward a national school board and restoring to those closest to children the responsibility for their well-being and academic success,\u201d Alexander, R-Tenn., said in a statement.\n\nSix lawmakers on the Senate HELP Committee opposed King\u2019s nomination Wednesday, including Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., who explained his decision to oppose King in a series of posts on his Twitter account.\n\nI voted against John King\u2019s nomination for Secretary of Education because he is clearly the wrong person for the job. #StopJohnKing \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 9, 2016\n\nWe need someone who will listen to teachers and parents. John King has demonstrated that he is not that person. #StopJohnKing \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 9, 2016\n\nWhile serving as State Education Commissioner in New York, John King made education worse. #StopJohnKing \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 9, 2016\n\nKing forced big government Common Core standards on teachers and students, and pushed policies that violated student privacy. #StopJohnKing \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 9, 2016\n\nKing exhibited poor judgement as a manager. He allowed lawbreakers to continue serving in Sr. positions without penalty #StopJohnKing \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 9, 2016\n\nDespite the few senators on the Senate HELP Committee who opposed King, his appointment has not been met without controversy.\n\nDuring confirmation hearings last week, neither Republicans nor Democrats asked King a single question on his tenure with the New York State Education Department, of which he served as commissioner from 2011 to 2015.\n\nThe Washington Post described the absence of such questions as an \u201castounding pass\u201d the committee gave to King.\n\nKing\u2019s time as commissioner has been described as a period of \u201cturmoil,\u201d particularly because of his \u201cblind commitment\u201d to Common Core and other programs reforming education in New York.\n\n\u201cUnder King, Common Core implementation was a disaster, teacher evaluation was a disaster, testing was a disaster, massive data gathering was a disaster, and having public meetings to manage public reaction to the other disasters was a disaster,\u201d Peter Greene, an English teacher who frequently writes on education for the Huffington Post, wrote on his own blog, Curmudgucation, last month.\n\nUnder King\u2019s leadership as commissioner, close to 65,000 students in New York opted out of the state\u2019s Common Core tests in 2014. The number of students opting out climbed to more than 200,000 in 2015.\n\nCarol Burris, an award-winning principal in New York and executive director of the Network for Public Education, called King an \u201cunapologetic proponent of Common Core, student data collection, and Common Core testing\u201d and criticized the former New York education commissioner for failing to address concerns from parents and teachers, alike, while instead choosing to promote the Common Core curriculum they took issue with.\n\n\u201cThe profiles being published focus on [King\u2019s] personal biography, which is compelling,\u201d Burris wrote last month of his media coverage. \u201cYet his leadership during the three and a half years he served as New York\u2019s Commissioner of Education is far more revealing to how he will lead the U.S. Department of Education. That story should not be ignored.\u201d\n\nPrior to the Senate HELP Committee\u2019s approval of King, school boards in New York passed resolutions opposing his confirmation.\n\n\u201cWe cannot help but conclude that amplifying Dr. King\u2019s abject failure as the leader of the educational establishment in New York state to the federal level is good for no one,\u201d the Board of Education of the Patchogue-Medford Union Free School District on Long Island wrote in its resolution.\n\nThe resolution specifically criticized King for his implementation of both No Child Left Behind and Common Core\u2014a \u201ctotal failure\u201d\u2014as well as his unresponsiveness to input from parents and teachers.\n\nAdditionally, four Republican members of the New York State Assembly called on New York Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, both Democrats, to oppose King\u2019s confirmation.\n\n\u201cJohn King\u2019s tenure as the Commissioner of Education in New York State culminated in disaster for our schools,\u201d Al Graf, a Republican who represents Holbrook, N.Y., said last month. \u201cHis lack of experience in the classroom led to policies that resulted in the near destruction of public education in New York State. He was unqualified and unfit to hold the reins in New York. Why is the federal government now trying to impose his type of failed leadership on education for the entire country?\u201d\n\nReflecting on objections to Obama\u2019s nomination of King despite strong calls for him to be opposed, Mary Clare Reim, a research associate in education policy at The Heritage Foundation, stressed that King\u2019s views differ from those of parents nationwide.\n\n\u201cDuring Dr. King\u2019s tenure as Commissioner of Education in New York, parents were so vocal in their objection to the Common Core roll out that he was forced to cancel many public forums. Parents and teachers alike called for his resignation,\u201d she told The Daily Signal. \u201cDr. King\u2019s strong support for national standards does not represent the views of American parents who overwhelmingly do not support Common Core.\u201d\n\nBack in Washington, D.C., the conservative group Heritage Action for America, the sister organization of The Heritage Foundation, re-upped its calls for Congress to stop confirming the president\u2019s nominees.\n\n\u201cGiven the Obama administration\u2019s disregard for Congress\u2019s role in our constitutional system of government, the Senate should refuse to confirm the president\u2019s nominees unless those nominees are directly related to our national security,\u201d the group said in a January memo.\n\nIn his announcement nominating King to serve as acting secretary of education, Obama praised King as an \u201cexceptionally talented educator.\u201d\n\nThe son of New York public school educators, King\u2019s parents died when he was 12, and he praises his public school teachers in New York City for saving his life because of the educational experiences they gave him, as well as hope for his future.\n\nKing earned degrees from Harvard, Yale, and Columbia; served as a teacher and principal; and founded a charter school before he was appointed deputy commissioner of the New York State Education Department in 2009.\n\nHe became commissioner in 2011.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John King Jr. has been criticized for his support of Common Core.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "John King Jr. has been criticized for his support of Common Core.", "title": "Senate GOP Helps Advance Obama Education Nominee", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160309_King_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-09T22:13:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/24RBHpg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "John King Jr. has been criticized for his support of Common Core.", "title": "Senate GOP Helps Advance Obama Education Nominee", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160309_King_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "common core", "published_time": "2016-03-09T17:47:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T22:13:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "John King Jr., Senate HELP Committee, Arne Duncan, Lamar Alexander, Richard Burr, No Child Left Behind, Common Core, Carol Burris, Department of Education"}, "article_summary": "#StopJohnKing \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 9, 2016While serving as State Education Commissioner in New York, John King made education worse.\n#StopJohnKing \u2014 Richard Burr (@SenatorBurr) March 9, 2016King forced big government Common Core standards on teachers and students, and pushed policies that violated student privacy.\n\u201cHis lack of experience in the classroom led to policies that resulted in the near destruction of public education in New York State.\nThe Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee approved Obama\u2019s nomination, 16-6.\nI voted against John King\u2019s nomination for Secretary of Education because he is clearly the wrong person for the job."}
