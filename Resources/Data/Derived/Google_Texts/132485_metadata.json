And on Tuesday, as the Nuggets began summer-league preparations, history was repeating itself just a bit.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t as bad.\n\nBoth first-round draft pick Gary Harris and free agent Solomon Alabi missed the first day of drills in advance of Saturday\u2019s opener in the NBA Las Vegas summer league, but neither was because of injury. Harris\u2019 rookie contract was not yet finalized, so he was not permitted to practice. Afterward, he expressed no concern that it would be done in time for him to be on the court for Wednesday\u2019s practice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be out there,\u201d Harris said.\n\nAlabi, a center, was held out due to FIBA not yet receiving a letter of his release from his club team in Taiwan. He expected the release to be received in time to be in uniform for the Nuggets\u2019 summer-league opener.\n\nThe Nuggets\u2019 summer-league team will be coached by assistants Patrick Mutombo and Noel Gillespie. They will have one more practice in town before leaving for Las Vegas.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gary Harris, Solomon Alabi miss 1st day of Nuggets\u2019 summer-league practice", "title": "Gary Harris, Solomon Alabi miss 1st day of Nuggets\u2019 summer-league practice", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/08/gary-harris-solomon-alabi-miss-1st-day-of-nuggets-summer-league-practice/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__gary-harris-nuggets-062714p1-1.jpg", "height": 424}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__gary-harris-nuggets-062714p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-08T15:56:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T08:08:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Nuggets\u2019 summer-league team will be coached by assistants Patrick Mutombo and Noel Gillespie.\nAfterward, he expressed no concern that it would be done in time for him to be on the court for Wednesday\u2019s practice.\nHe expected the release to be received in time to be in uniform for the Nuggets\u2019 summer-league opener.\nAnd on Tuesday, as the Nuggets began summer-league preparations, history was repeating itself just a bit.\nAlabi, a center, was held out due to FIBA not yet receiving a letter of his release from his club team in Taiwan."}
