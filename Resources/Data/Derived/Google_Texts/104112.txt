Immigration reform will be crucial to the 2016 presidential election, at least one Republican senator believes.

Sen. Lindsey Graham appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press'” with David Gregory Sunday morning to discuss foreign policy and the border crisis.

“Senator, the crisis on the border, immigration reform. This is an international problem. But it’s also a big political issue, as well,” Gregory asked. “Is your party prepared to move with the president on this?”

President Barack Obama has requested $3.7 billion in aid for the border, but has not supported any changes to the current laws to stem the flow of immigrants flocking to the border. Graham had a different take than his fellow Republican Ted Cruz, but he believes the GOP vote on immigration will be crucial to the party’s future.

“There will be no money for supplemental without changes to the 2008 law. We have to streamline and quicken deportations. There will be no immigration reform because of the crisis on the border,” Graham said.

“I blame Obama for this moment, but in 2015 if we start over and the Republican Party doesn’t get immigration reform right in 2015 — and the House should lead, not the Senate– our chances of winning the White House in 2016 are very low.”
