This would seemingly violate the law which stated that if you cannot give your own informed consent, or if you are a child, there would need to be a guarantee that the experiment would not make you any worse off than you were before.\n\nThere is a law in the State of California called the Protection of Humans in Medical Experimentation Act. It goes into some detail about what is and what isn't permissible in realm of performing experiments on humans. I tried very hard to use it once only to find out that the law had nothing in it about who is responsible for enforcing the law.\n\nMedical Exemptions and the Sponsored Legislative Drive to Eliminate Personal Belief and Religious Waivers of Vaccines. Or Stupid is as Stupid Does\n\nSince Dr. Stoller practices medicine in San Francisco, he's very concerned about the push to end personal vaccine exemptions in California. After studying the language of SB 277, the exemption bill, he concluded that even parents who try to get a medical exemption for their child also may be out of luck. I asked him about what's at stake here. Here's his answer.\n\nHe's taken a very public stand on the issue of vaccine safety and I've covered it.\n\nI've known Kenneth P. Stoller, MD for over a decade . He's a tireless advocate for recognition of the link between vaccines and autism. He wrote the foreword for my book, The Big Autism Cover-Up--How and Why the Media is Lying to the American Public .\n\nEvery law enforcement agency passed the buck saying that nowhere in the law was there a provision making them the enforcement arm of this part of the Health & Safety Code.\n\nI met with Assemblyman Herschel Rosenthal, the author of the original bill, and he told me this was an oversight and invited me to rewrite the legislation. I was a new pediatrician and didn't feel qualified to write law for the State of California. I had no idea at the time that California allowed anyone with money to write bills and get those bills turned into laws by funneling campaign contributions to the members of the legislative bodies. The whole system is basically bought and paid for, and you need no talent to do this. But I was young and na\u00efve. There I was being offered the chance to modify a California law and I didn't have had to pay anyone anything.\n\nI missed my chance.\n\nCurrently, the pharma sponsored legislation known as SB 277 is up for a vote in the Assembly, and from there it will be sent to Governor Jerry Brown. Those eagerly endorsing the bill may not understand that it has a big hole in it, just like the Protection of Humans in Medical Experimentation Act did.\n\nThe hole is that it allows for an individual child to claim a medical exemption from vaccinations without defining the parameters of that exemption.\n\nAre the medical exemptions to be based on the whim of a patient's physician or are they to be based on recommendations from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Public Health Service, and the Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices-as published in the CDC's MMWR?\n\nBecause there are problems with both of these, there needs to be clarification. Someone's whim is not a good idea, but neither is it a good idea to ask a primary care physician to document what component in any one of the vaccines may have caused an untoward reaction. If you took a child that had an untoward reaction to an unknown component in any of the 5 to 9 vaccines they were given on a previous occasion, how would the physician be able to document which component caused the problem? They could not, and as much as they might want to sign a waiver, they wouldn't want to be held accountable for not following the rules for qualifying a patient for a general medical waiver.\n\nMost physicians don't even know what ingredients are in vaccines.\n\nWhat if parents already have a child they believe was vaccine injured and they are afraid to vaccinate subsequent children? Will doctors support their position and exempt siblings?\n\nThere are other problems.\n\nTake a look at the form for a medical exemption in North Carolina.\n\nMost single vaccine exemptions call for a previously recognized vaccine reaction. In other words, vaccines already hurt this child. How can a doctor specify which vaccine in the battery of 8 or 9 given in a single visit was the culprit?\n\nIn the general waiver category for all vaccines, a physician can check off moderate to severe acute illness with or without fever.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nIt means a child could get a general waiver for all vaccines if a parent asked for a medical exemption at the moment a child is ill.\n\nTo get a general medical waiver, all the parent has to do is bring the child in to the pediatrician to sign off on the waiver on the very day they're sick and they receive a general medical waiver.\n\nThat meets the letter of medical exemption rules set forth by the DHHS. It would be legal.\n\nIs a parent going to get a physician to sign a general medical exemption waiver just because the child is coughing in his face or vomiting in his office? It's unlikely. The doctor will probably tell the parent to come back when the child is well even if that means the child can't enroll in school on time.\n\nNo way will a physician sign off on that even though those are the rules set forth by the DHHS. Once the waiver is signed, it is good only until the next school year. I could go on giving one example after another of how the DHHS guidelines are not real world guidelines, but this isn't about guidelines or any guidelines. There are NO GUIDELINES.\n\nSB277 has no guidelines about what constitutes a medical exemption or even the protection of physicians who find themselves faced with filling in the forms - even if based strictly on the DHHS guidelines as they now exist, which have a loop hole in them bigger than the Lincoln Tunnel and restrictions smaller than the eye of a needle.\n\nThe point I am making is elected officials should not vote for or sign off on such ambiguous legislation affecting every child in the state.\n\n(KP Stoller, MD is Chief of Hyperbaric Medicine at the Hyperbaric Oxygen Clinic of San Francisco [www.hbotsf.org] and a Fellow of the American College of Hyperbaric Medicine)\n\nWhile legislators and the governor are considering the ramifications of forcing California's children to be fully vaccinated in order to attend school, they might take heed something written by a mother, Caitlan Sullivan, on the Independent Voter Project website on May 25.\n\nSullivan wrote, An Open Letter to Governor Brown: Please Support A Mother Right to Choose.\n\n. . .Something is broken, Governor Brown. Our children have never been sicker, and our requirement for vaccines has never been higher. I understand correlation doesn't equal causation, but please point me to a study that shows the benefit of heavy metal exposure on the human body. Children in the U.S. are fraught with auto-immune diseases, deadly allergies, asthma, eczema, perpetual ear infections, and childhood cancers. Autism rates are staggeringly high (1 in 68).\n\nAccording to the CDC, our infant mortality rate is higher than any of the other 27 first world countries! This wasn't the case 30 years ago. Don't you think we should figure out what is happening to our babies? I personally know four people that have lost their baby to SIDS. Is that normal?\n\nWhile frightening facts like \"28 percent of children younger than the age of 5 who contracted measles in the United States between 2001 and 2013 had to be hospitalized. Measles can cause pneumonia, lifelong brain damage, deafness, and death,\" flood the media, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data, 0 deaths have occurred resulting from the wild measles in the last ten years.\n\nMeanwhile, according to data from the Vaccine Adverse Effect Reporting System (VAERS), a government-run program, over 100 deaths have occurred from the MMR vaccine. Any day of the week, I'd prefer to be \"hospitalized\" than die, or begin a lifetime of suffering a debilitating auto immune disease.\n\n. . .The mainstream media loves to state that science has conclusively and repeatedly found that vaccines are safe for the overwhelming majority, but this is simply not true! Never has a true independent, double-blind placebo study been performed on the safety of vaccines.\n\nCurrently, the vaccines are not tested against placebos; they are tested against aluminum - or other vaccines! These studies are often funded and published by companies like the Lewin Group, a consulting firm that lists major vaccine manufacturers as clients. As you know, this is not how scientific studies are to be performed. The science is not in, Governor Brown!\n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, since 1986, vaccine manufacturers have been immune from liability in the United States and victims of vaccine injury must file with the VAERS system in attempt to be compensated through the federal program. Despite the lengthy and arduous process, the government has paid out over $3 Billion to the vaccine injured.\n\n. . .I understand that this is a tough position for you to be in, but that doesn't waive your responsibility to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, to which you swore an oath. You are in a position to make a unique and lasting change to protect our children, and the way to do this is to demand answers, not force these unsafe, untested, pharmaceutical drugs on our children.\n\nHere is a mother who clearly and succinctly explains to Governor Brown the down side of mandated mass vaccination.\n\nShe questions the idea of a one-size-fits-every-child vaccination schedule that begins within hours of birth. She's done her research. She's looked at the science. SB 277 scares her. She sees that we have the most vaccinated kids on the planet and some of the sickest. She challenges the safety claims, saying our vaccines are not adequately tested. She cites charges of drug industry fraud regarding the mumps vaccine and corruption at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over their MMR research. She reminds Gov. Brown that he has a responsibility to be fully informed on this issue before he makes any decision on SB 277.\n\nIs anyone listening in Sacramento?\n\nKen Stoller and Caitlan Sullivan have grave concerns about what elected officials are doing. Here are two intelligent and informed individuals who are trying to educate those with the power to decide if parents should have the right to make health care decisions for their children.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "AGE OF AUTISM", "description": "By Anne Dachel I've known Kenneth P.
