Nancy Pelosi and at least five other congressmen attended the last stop on Modi\u2019s Silicon Valley tour, which included meetings with CEOs of Apple, Google and Facebook, as well as with some Indian and American startups.Hours before his arrival, supporters were already outside the venue, shouting slogans and wielding banners. As shouts in Hindi of \u2018Bharat Mata ki Jai\u2019 (Victory to Mother India) and \u2018Modiji Zindabad\u2019 (Long live, Modi) rang in the background, Ashish Mehrotra, a Cupertino resident and a tech worker, said he was eager to meet Modi.\u201cHe has a vision for my country,\u2019\u2019 Mehrotra said. \u201cHe is working on getting investments for India.\u2019\u2019 Mehrotra cited Modi\u2019s \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative, which the premier launched on Sept. 25 last year seeking to make India a global manufacturing destination for both local and multinational companies, thereby creating jobs for Indian citizens.Modi\u2019s supporters distributed T-shirts bearing his image, provided free WiFi and even posed with cardboard cutouts of him. Anand Agarwal, another engineer from the Bay Area, sporting a Modi T-shirt, said he was pleased with Modi\u2019s performance \u201cand there was no reason to oppose him at all.\u201d\n\nMany, however, seemed to think otherwise. Activists were seen displaying banners calling for Modi to end discrimination of several forms in India. Sabiha Basrai, from the Alliance for Justice and Accountability, described Modi\u2019s agenda as \u201csuccess for some and oppression for others.\u201d\n\nWide spectrum\n\n\u201cIf there has to be development, it has to be for all,\u201d she told Peninsula Press.Another group of protesters included the Sikhs for Justice, who alleged that there was no religious freedom in Modi\u2019s government.Sangam Gill, a Sikh nurse, said the Indian government was \u201cletting Sikh political prisoners rot in jail despite them having served their sentences.\u201dGill also she was fighting for the rights of Muslims, who bore the brunt of the communal riots of 2002 in the state of Gujarat, whose chief minister (CM) then was Modi. More than 1,000 people were killed in the tragedy, most of them Muslims and Modi has been accused of not doing enough to stop the violence.The group also demanded a separate Sikh nation, accusing the Indian government of not paying attention to their community\u2019s needs.\n\nIn his speech, Modi congratulated the Indian-American community for their success in the technological arena. But he encouraged them to return to India, stressing that the 21st century belonged to India and that technology \u2013 and therefore their technical prowess \u2013 would be a major enabler in its economic growth. He also underscored how the 800-million-strong youth workforce of the country was a huge asset.\n\nModi also touched upon an array of programs that he said were helping the poor in India. These included the Jan Dhan initiative, which is the Indian government initiative to provide affordable financial services to the poor. Modi said 180 million zero-balance bank accounts had been opened as part of the program. He also cited his government\u2019s push for the Aadhar program, which seeks to give each Indian citizen a unique ID and a card that she can use to avail of government services.
