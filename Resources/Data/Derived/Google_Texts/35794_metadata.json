These condemnations are grounded in a number of highly implausible theses that amount to a very flimsy moral psychology. The first is the extremely inhumane idea that we ought to make global judgments about people\u2019s characters based on their worst moments, when they are least in control of themselves: that what people do or say when they\u2019re most angry or incited reveals a kind of essential truth about them. The second is that we are to condemn human beings merely for having certain impulses, regardless of their behaviors and beliefs. The third is that people\u2019s darkest and most irrational thoughts and feelings trump their considered beliefs: Baldwin can\u2019t possibly really believe in gay rights, according to Coates, if he has any negative feelings about homosexuality whatsoever. The fourth, implied premise here \u2013 one that comes out in the comical comments section following Coates\u2019 post \u2013 is that we are to take no account whatsoever of the possibility of psychological conflict. We refuse to allow ourselves to imagine that a single human being might have a whole host of conflicted thoughts and feelings about homosexuality: that they might be both attracted to it and repelled by it.... It is just as ludicrous to condemn people for being afraid of or repulsed by homosexuality as it is to condemn them for having violent impulses. Freud thought that homophobia and same sex attraction (which is not the same thing as homosexuality per se) were universal and mutually implicating (a man, for instance, might be both repelled by and fascinated by homosexuality because he associates it with the both terrifying and thrilling prospect of submitting and being penetrated). Whether or not you like such associations or agree with Freud, you cannot condemn people merely for being afraid of something, or for having certain feelings or associations: what counts are their considered thoughts and behaviors. The bigot who gets on TV to tell you that homosexuality ought to be against the law does not belong in the same category as a vocal advocate of gay rights who has not purified himself entirely of negative feelings about homosexuality. Homophobic feelings are no more of a choice than homosexuality itself... Before I offer a rebuttal, I think it's important that we take an account of the evidence.Two years ago, Baldwin\u2014hounded by paparazzi\u2014Baldwin reacted as follows It seems Alec finally had enough ... This time, Alec -- clutching a pink stuffed animal -- approached one of the photogs who was hanging out in front of his apartment building and lashed out, \"I want you to shut the f**k up ... leave my neighbor alone ... get outta here.\" At one point, at the beginning of the confrontation, It sounds like Alec says to the photog, \"I know you got raped by a priest or something.\" Then, in an effort to assert his dominance, Alec got right in the pap's face ... and in a menacing tone said, \"You little girl.\" You should watch the video in the hyperlink to get the full effect of this.\n\nA few months ago, offended by something a reporter\u2014who is gay\u2014had written, Baldwin said the following: George Stark, you lying little bitch. I am gonna fuck you up \u2026 I want all of my followers and beyond to straighten out this fucking little bitch, George Stark. @MailOnline \u2026 My wife and I attend a funeral to pay our respects to an old friend, and some toxic Brit writes this fucking trash \u2026 If put my foot up your fucking ass, George Stark, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019d dig it too much \u2026 I\u2019m gonna find you, George Stark, you toxic little queen, and I\u2019m gonna fuck\u2026.you\u2026.up. Then two weeks ago Baldwin, again hounded by paparazzi, pursued the cameraman and once they'd back off called one a \"cock-sucking fag.\" Baldwin claimed that he'd actually said \"cock-sucking fathead.\" He also added that he was unaware that \"cock-sucker\" was a derogatory term for gay men. Yesterday, it came out that Alec Baldwin will no longer have a show on MSNBC. Baldwin offered the following commentary on his cancellation: But you've got the fundamentalist wing of gay advocacy\u2014Rich Ferraro and Andrew Sullivan\u2014they're out there, they've got you. Rich Ferraro, this is probably one of his greatest triumphs. They killed my show. Baldwin didn't blame his own repeated use of anti-gay\u2014dare I say bigoted\u2014slurs. He blamed \"the fundamentalist wing of gay advocacy.\" My way of understanding this is simple. If I were to be found to, in anger, repeatedly employ anti-Hispanic slurs, to refer to my enemies as \"wetbacks\" or \"illegals,\" if I were found to address an actual Latino journalist with the term and threaten to say \"kick his ass back across the border,\" and then having lost my job here at The Atlantic blame \"the fundamentalist wing of La Raza,\" I think you would be justified in calling me a bigot. I don't think my support for, say, the DREAM Act, or my horror at Arizona's immigration laws would save me. The ability to \"globally\" label anyone is a privilege that people who live with a boot on their neck don't really enjoy. And I don't think it would save many other people, besides Alec Baldwin. I don't think if Jesse Jackson, or Al Sharpton, shared Baldwin's record of threatening actual gay men, and threatening people period with anti-gay slurs, that this would be a debate. I don't believe their record of support for marriage rights would save them. Alec Baldwin a rich, handsome, white guy from the liberal Mecca of the Upper West Side of New York. He enjoys the full weight of our credulity\n\nAlwan believes that we shouldn't, \"make global judgments about people\u2019s characters based on their worst moments, when they are least in control of themselves.\" I reject the notion that \"bigot\" is a \"global judgement.\" Aside from Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant, no single white person may be more responsible for the destruction of slavery than William Sherman. But Uncle Billy was\u2014even in his own time\u2014a reconstructed bigot and white supremacist. This is neither shocking nor particularly complicated. There is no reason why one could not, on the one hand believe, that slavery should have ended, and also believed that black people were inferior and worthy of a lesser place in society. \"Bigot\" is not a polite way of saying \"child-molester\" or \"serial killer\" or \"genocidal maniac\" or even asshole. And it does not automatically blot out one's other qualities such as \"caring father,\" \"good husband,\" \"charitable giver,\" or \"supporter of marriage equality.\" Black people\u2014who have spent much of the history living around, working for, or working with actual bigots but have not had the luxury of dismissing them \"globally\"\u2014understand this. I suspect that women\u2014who have, for some time, had to live around, work with, and work for sexists and misogynists, but have not had the luxury of \"globally\" dismissing them\u2014understand this too. And I suspect the LGBT community, where people must function in families with other people who believe their lifestyle to be a sin, understand this as well. If you are gay your father or mother could be a \"homophobic bigot,\" but you might well love him all the same. For a significant period of American history it was common for black people to have fathers who were white supremacists. Some of us hated our fathers. But for many of us, the feeling was somehow more complicated. The ability to \"globally\" label anyone is a privilege that people who live with a boot on their neck don't really enjoy. We see people as complicated, because we must, because your tormentor one moment might be your liberator the next. This is not theoretical. In 1863, General James Longstreet led an Army that kidnapped free black people and sold them into slavery. Ten years later, Longstreet was leading black soldiers in a courageous, if doomed, campaign against white terrorists in Louisiana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Bigot\" isn&#39;t a \"global\" judgement of someone&#39;s character.
