Patrick Murphy\u2019s District 18 and Democratic Rep. Alcee Hastings\u2019 District 23 would remain largely the same while many of the District 22 constituents now represented by Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, would become part of District 21, which is represented by Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton.\n\nDeutch\u2019s current District 21 generally includes voters west of Military Trail between Southern Boulevard and Clint Moore Road in Boca Raton, then west of Florida\u2019s Turnpike from Clint Moore Road to the Broward County line. District 21 also includes portions of Broward County.\n\nFrankel\u2019s current District 22 includes coastal Broward County north of Fort Lauderdale and coastal Palm Beach County from the Broward County line to the northern end of the town of Palm Beach.\n\nUnder the maps released Wednesday, Frankel\u2019s constituents north of Boca Raton would become part of District 21. Frankel\u2019s home in West Palm Beach would become part of District 21, though House members are not required to live in the districts they represent.\n\nWhen Broward County is included, the majority of the constituents Frankel now represents in District 22 would still be part of the new District 22. The majority of Deutch\u2019s current District 21 constituents would still be part of the new District 21.\n\n\u2014 George Bennett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Florida Legislature releases new set of congressional districts, including major changes to Palm Beach County districts of Democrats Fra\u2026", "og": {"description": "Florida Legislature releases new set of congressional districts, including major changes to Palm Beach County districts of Democrats Frankel, Deutch", "title": "Florida plan alters Lois Frankel, Ted Deutch U.S. House districts", "url": "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/frankel-deutch-us-house-districts-see-big-change-u/nnDg9/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/06/25/68/3d/080714-Deutch-head-shot.jpg", "date": "Wednesday, August 5, 2015", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "pbp", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/frankel-deutch-us-house-districts-see-big-change-u/nnDg9/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3016459/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/frankel-deutch-us-house-districts-see-big-change-u/nnDg9/", "keywords": "tcoast,newsfeed,allpbc,Legislature", "google-site-verification": "lgU00SzU_ChqK0qFbu4lYha8V6ghHO9uTf0LHHcoQ98", "viewport": "width=1024", "news_keywords": "tcoast, Legislature, allpbc, newsfeed"}, "article_summary": "The majority of Deutch\u2019s current District 21 constituents would still be part of the new District 21.\nFrankel\u2019s home in West Palm Beach would become part of District 21, though House members are not required to live in the districts they represent.\nWhen Broward County is included, the majority of the constituents Frankel now represents in District 22 would still be part of the new District 22.\nFrankel\u2019s current District 22 includes coastal Broward County north of Fort Lauderdale and coastal Palm Beach County from the Broward County line to the northern end of the town of Palm Beach.\nDistrict 21 also includes portions of Broward County."}
