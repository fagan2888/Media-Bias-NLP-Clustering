But don\u2019t commit voter fraud, kids.\n\nIncumbent Republican Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder leads Schauer by between two and five points in a very close race Tuesday. Schauer, The Daily Caller recently revealed, chose not to sign his campaign staff up for Obamacare, but rather for health plans through the Michigan Small Business Association. (RELATED: Michigan Democrat For Governor Signed Up Staff For Non-Obamacare Plans, Despite Obamacare Support)\n\nTurns out Schauer likes private non-Obamacare plans just as much as he likes voting for Republicans.\n\nLast time Michigan held national elections in 2012, Schauer filled out and sent in an absentee ballot in the state\u2019s Republican primary as part of an effort by state Democratic insiders to weaken presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney, operatives discovered.\n\n\u201cThere was nobody to vote for on the Democratic side of the ballot,\u201d Schauer told mlive.com at the time that his absentee ballot was discovered. \u201cI try not to miss any elections, and so no, I don\u2019t encourage that, but I think that\u2019s up to every individual voter to decide. Michigan is full of crossover and independent voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do not have photo ID or do not bring it with you to the polls, you may still vote,\u201d according to the state government of Michigan. \u201cSimply sign an affidavit stating that you are not in possession of photo identification. Your ballot is included with all others and is counted on Election Day.\u201d\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "In Michigan, you can vote without a photo ID", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Democratic Michigan gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer personally voted in the 2012 Republican presidential primary to hurt Mitt Romney.
