For the amount of money that went into North Carolina’s record-breaking Senate election, you could buy 57 Bugatti Veyrons, 123,000 base-model MacBook Airs or a 1.75-liter bottle of Grey Goose for every resident of Houston – with more than $3.5 million left over after the bulk liquor purchase.

North Carolina’s $111 million contest between Republican Sen.-elect Thom Tillis and incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan was the most expensive senatorial showdown in U.S. history, according to a study released by the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy group.

The steep spending in the Tar Heel State helped boost 2014’s election cycle to a projected $3.67 billion price tag, which would make it the most expensive midterm election run in U.S. history, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Spending in Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky and Georgia each eclipsed $70 million.

That figure would place this year's midterm elections past the $3.63 billion midterm watermark of 2010. And with a runoff still in play in Louisiana, the spending ceiling has nowhere to go but up.
