She\u2019s survived breast cancer, was laid off work, and struggled to pay down her student debt because of the cost of having to buy her own health insurance before the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nBut today, she\u2019s living her dream of running her own mental health practice \u2013 something she couldn\u2019t have done if it wasn\u2019t for the ACA, or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMy dream has always been to be in private practice, and that wouldn\u2019t be possible without the ACA,\u201d says Cayko, a 61-year-old licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) in Great Falls, Montana. \u201cWith the ACA, there was hope my dreams could be fulfilled.\u201d\n\nThe specter of financial disaster\n\nDenial of coverage because of pre-existing conditions had been a \u201cblack umbrella\u201d over her dreams for many years, Cayko says. During the 1980s, she was denied coverage because of her history of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Still, she persevered. She went back to school to earn her bachelor\u2019s degree and eventually graduated with a master\u2019s degree in Social Work in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, Cayko was diagnosed with breast cancer. The only silver lining was the fact that she had insurance at the time, through the mental health center where she worked.\n\n\u201cI never knew what happiness was until I survived cancer,\u201d Cayko says.\n\nAfter her treatment, she was more determined than ever to pursue her dream. Cayko earned her LCSW certification in 2007, hoping at that point to go into private practice. But she decided against it because she was quoted health insurance premiums of $5,000 a month with a $20,000 deductible. So she stayed put until 2013, when her job ended.\n\nWith $25,000 in student debt and no job, Cayko ate up most of her savings keeping up with her monthly COBRA payments of $608. Fortunately, the launch of the Obamacare insurance marketplace was just around the corner, bringing with it an end to discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions and help paying for coverage.\n\nTax credits are a saving grace\n\n\u201cI\u2019d checked into potential options available through the ACA and was anticipating the roll-out,\u201d she says. \u201cI just had to hold my breath and wait.\u201d\n\nWith the help of tax credits, Cayko was able to sign up for an affordable plan \u2013 in 2015, it cost her $257 a month with a $1,500 deductible \u2013 that covered everything she needs to manage multiple chronic conditions. This includes high blood pressure, osteoporosis and atrial fibrillation, a serious but manageable heart condition that was diagnosed in 2014.\n\n\u201cWithout health insurance, I wouldn\u2019t be able to get healthcare and wouldn\u2019t be treated,\u201d says Cayko, whose atrial fibrillation puts her at an increased risk of stroke and other complications. \u201cI would probably die if I didn\u2019t get coverage. It\u2019s a matter of life and death.\u201d\n\nJust the diagnosis and treatment of her atrial fibrillation alone would have cost her $100,000 if she\u2019d had to pay for it without insurance, she estimates \u2013 a nearly impossible task for someone in the midst of setting up her own business.\n\n\u201cI never would have gotten through this period without the ACA,\u201d Cayko says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have been able to work.\u201d\n\nFreedom to go solo\n\nIn 2014, Cayko\u2019s dream became a reality when she opened her private practice. She\u2019s building up her clientele, and starting to earn enough to chip away at the debt that piled up between student loans and out-of-pocket healthcare costs.\n\nAlthough she likes her current insurance plan, especially its wide network of providers, Cayko\u2019s insurance company is discontinuing it for 2016. \u201cI won\u2019t automatically enroll in the plan they\u2019re is offering me as a replacement,\u201d she says. \u201cMy partner and I are both shopping around to find the plans that work best for us.\u201d\n\nCayko is grateful that Obamacare gave her the freedom to pursue her career in private practice, instead of having to work for someone else just to get insurance \u2013 or quit working and go on disability, as many people urged her to at one point or another.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be on disability \u2013 I want to keep working,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be helping others and I wouldn\u2019t be happy. If a person has a purpose in life, they have a better quality of life.\u201d\n\nIn addition to her private practice, Cayko volunteers in the community, including serving on the Board at a local LGBTQ center.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to do what I can to help, which I wouldn\u2019t have the energy to do if I wasn\u2019t getting the care I need,\u201d she says. \u201cMy dream is coming true, and it wouldn\u2019t be possible without the ACA.\u201d\n\nThanks to Families USA for bringing Shirley Cayko\u2019s story to our attention.
