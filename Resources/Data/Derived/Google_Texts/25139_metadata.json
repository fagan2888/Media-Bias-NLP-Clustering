After the game, Koval\u2019s family and group of friends eagerly waited for Koval to come through the corridor leading to the locker room.\n\nAn hour passed.\n\nWhile most of the players quickly exited the field, Koval stayed to interact with fans. He finally appeared in the corridor. With a smile, he stopped for every autograph and selfie request, and thanked the wide-eyed fans.\n\nA Camarillo, Calif., native and who grew up as a L.A. Galaxy fan, Koval remembers waiting for hours to get the autographs of Cobi Jones and Brian Rowe. \u201cWe looked up to the players so much,\u201d Koval said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m on the other side of the fence.\u201d\n\nFor Koval, timing was everything. After a series of injuries, the Quakes needed a right fullback. Although traditionally a midfielder, Koval was the answer. \u201cAt such a young age, he definitely has a veteran head on himself,\u201d Chris Wondolowski, the Earthquakes all-star and team captain, said in an article on MLSsoccer.com.\n\nAbout halfway into season, Koval, the ninth overall pick in the MLS SuperDraft, has established himself in the league. The Quakes have welcomed the rookie to the \u201cfamily.\u201d Teammate Alan Gordon, an 11-year MLS veteran, has \u201cadopted\u201d Koval and fellow rookie, Joe Sofia, as his \u201csons.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty fun,\u201d Koval said of Gordon. \u201cHe\u2019s looking out after us. He makes sure we\u2019re doing the right things.\u201d Gordon can be heard proudly cheering, \u201cThat\u2019s my boy out there!\u201d\n\nOn the Quakes, the players range from a 35-year-old with a family to the 21-year-old Koval who is fresh out of Stanford. \u201cI relate to the other players as a student, but I\u2019m also a teammate,\u201d Koval said. \u201cI try to learn from them as much as possible because they\u2019ve been there so many years. But at the same time I\u2019m here to play as much as I can and contribute to the team now.\u201d\n\nKoval was a four-year starter and team captain his senior year. Assistant Coach Nick Kirchhof believes Stanford was lucky to have Koval on the team. \u201cJJ was overlooked \u2026 they missed out,\u201d Kirchhof said referring to other college coaches. \u201cHe always had a positive energy.\u201d\n\nAlthough not the fastest player, the fit Koval can cover ground. \u201cMost of my game is technical,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the ball at my feet, make good passes and start the attack.\u201d Always aggressive, his Stanford teammates jokingly called him \u201cBone Saw\u201d \u2014 the professional wrestler who fights Spiderman in a cage match. \u201cHe always gets into tackles,\u201d Austin Meyer, a former Stanford teammate, said.\n\nEntering his senior year, Koval didn\u2019t have high hopes of being drafted or even being selected to go to the MLS Player Combine, an invitational tryout for the top 50 Division 1 seniors to showcase their skills to MLS coaches.\n\n\u201cPublicly, I wasn\u2019t really on anyone\u2019s radars,\u201d Koval said, remembering the online player rankings. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get too excited thinking (about being drafted). It might not happen.\u201d\n\nKoval led Stanford to the NCAA tournament Sweet 16 and earned All-Pac-12 First Team. The Quakes took notice of what he could bring.\n\nThe road to professional soccer\n\nThe day finally came. After frequently checking for the Combine invitee list, Koval was eating lunch when his mother called.\n\n\u201cJJ, you won\u2019t believe what I just saw online,\u201d Lisa Koval said, both laughing and crying. \u201cYou were invited to the Combine!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was happier for my parents than for me,\u201d Koval said. \u201cI remember other parents telling them that they\u2019re crazy investing so much in soccer. For it to all pay off, they got the tangible award for all of their effort.\u201d\n\nThe MLS Combine in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., was to take place Jan. 9 to 14 giving Koval a month to prepare. With his teammates on holiday break, Koval tirelessly trained by himself. As a result, he entered the Combine as one of the most fit players.\n\nThe draft\n\n\u201cWith the ninth pick of the first round of the 2014 MLS SuperDraft, the San Jose Earthquakes select from Stanford University\u2026\u201d Don Garber, MLS Commissioner, announced at the SuperDraft in Philadelphia.\n\nKoval quickly searched the room to see if another Stanford teammate was there.\n\n\u201c\u2026Midfielder JJ Koval.\u201d His dedication and hard work had paid off.\n\nFaith\n\n\u201cSo whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God,\u201d 1 Corinthians 10:31.\n\nWritten in sharpie on the heels of his cleats, Koval said the Bible verse \u201csums up what I want to be.\u201d He taps the back of his cleats before every game.\n\nRaised in a Catholic church, Koval says faith is the most important part of his life. He prays before every game \u2014 and not for a win or even to play well. Instead, Koval thanks God for another day and opportunity, and the ability to do the things he can.\n\n\u201cIt enables me, as a soccer player, to give everything I\u2019ve got, getting better every day. I don\u2019t have this fear of failure that if I were to fail, my dream is crushed and everything is over. I know that this [soccer] isn\u2019t the most important thing in my life. But it\u2019s a passion that God\u2019s given me,\u201d Koval said.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no such word as can\u2019t\u2019\n\nAfter starting three games in a row, Koval returns to the bench.\n\nThis only motivates Koval to work even harder. \u201cMy parents have taught me that \u2018there\u2019s no such word as can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Koval said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a negative. I want to be on the field all the time and by pushing for that, I should be pushing others to get better too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "JJ Koval,Kasey Quon,major league soccer,professional soccer,San Jose Earthquakes,soccer,Stanford soccer,Culture & Features,Frontpage Featured,Sports", "description": "Stanford grad JJ Koval has established himself in professional soccer, and the San Jose Earthquakes have welcomed the rookie to the \u201cfamily.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb09\"", "article_summary": "About halfway into season, Koval, the ninth overall pick in the MLS SuperDraft, has established himself in the league.\n\u201cHe always gets into tackles,\u201d Austin Meyer, a former Stanford teammate, said.\n\u201cI relate to the other players as a student, but I\u2019m also a teammate,\u201d Koval said.\nKoval quickly searched the room to see if another Stanford teammate was there.\n\u201cMy parents have taught me that \u2018there\u2019s no such word as can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d Koval said."}
