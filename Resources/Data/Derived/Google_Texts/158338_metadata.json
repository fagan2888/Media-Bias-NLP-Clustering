I want to make history here. That\u2019s a goal of the team. I want the team to go back to state. Me, I\u2019m the only guy back who went to state my sophomore year. I\u2019ve got a new group and I want to go back to state with them and put up another banner at this school.\u201d\n\nJarryn Bush, a 6-2 junior, is the only other returning starter for Timberline, which opened the season by winning five of its first seven games. Like Evans, Bush was also an honorable mention all-league player last season. Their varsity experience is an important cog for the Blazers.\n\n\u201cWe hope to get that leadership and experience from those two,\u201d said Allen Thomas, Timberline\u2019s head boys basketball coach. \u201cHaving an all-league post player and an all-league point guard is a luxury to have. With those two, we\u2019re trying to add some pieces around them.\u201d\n\nThomas, who is in his third year as the Blazers head coach and 12th year coaching at the school, is still experimenting with his starting lineups. Recently, along with Bush and Evans, Thomas started sophomore Jaelen Bush at center, freshman Eric Stevenson at guard and senior Taylor Adams at guard.\n\nLast year, Evans averaged 15 points and was named honorable mention 3A All-Narrows League. With his quickness off the dribble, Evans is effective driving to the basket, then either taking the open shot or passing to an open teammate. But Evans, even with his scorer\u2019s mentality, isn\u2019t just a shooter, an offensive minded player. He\u2019s also a hustler on defense.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a slasher,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cHe\u2019s also a guy who\u2019s a great defender. He hustles full court. He\u2019s a vocal leader. He can get people open shots. He\u2019s also a guy that you can go to when the shot clock is running down. He can get a good look or he can create a look for a teammate. That\u2019s a luxury to have.\u201d\n\nEvans scored 19 points in three straight games and is averaging about 15 per game.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a winner and he knows what it takes to win,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cHaving that at the point guard is a huge step.\u201d\n\nOffensively, Thomas said his team can play up tempo, looking for the fast break. They can also play a half-court passing game, looking for the open shot. It all depends on the strengths and weaknesses of opponent\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cWe want to pick our spots,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cMaybe run it off the free throw line break. Or we want to end up controlling it and getting the ball inside. We need to pick our situations. Hopefully we can control the tempo of the game.\u201d\n\nDefensively, the goal is try to keep an opponent in the 50s or 60s. Thomas preaches defense.\n\n\u201cDefense is our staple,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe\u2019re all about defense. We want to come out and set the pace. We want to be the ones who either allow you to walk the ball up or we\u2019re going to try to make you play faster. Until we get to that point where we control the pace of the game we\u2019re still going to be searching.\u201d\n\nAs his team progresses, Thomas talked about their need to focus on the fundamentals, to move their feet on defense, to not get beat on the backdoor, and to box out on rebounding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the little things,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cUntil they get to doing it right, I\u2019m going to stay on it. I\u2019m not going to take it for granted.\u201d\n\nLast year as a sophomore, Jarryn Bush averaged a double-double, averaging 12 rebounds and 14 points. When a teammate puts up a shot, Bush crashes the offensive boards just in case the shot is off.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a rebound put back guy,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI can score with my back to the basket. But I prefer to get my points off hustle rebounds, put backs.\u201d\n\nBush, at 6-2, is often matched up against an opponent who is taller.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t have the height everyone else does,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAs a returning starter, Bush said his role is to be the encourager, challenging his teammates to play hard.\n\n\u201cI try to stay positive even though it\u2019s hard for me because I really love to win,\u201d Bush said. \u201cSo when we\u2019re losing it\u2019s a hard thing for me to do. I try to stay positive and set an example of how I want other people to act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Gail Wood As a three-year starter, Brandell Evans hopes to do something no one has ever done at Timberline High School.
