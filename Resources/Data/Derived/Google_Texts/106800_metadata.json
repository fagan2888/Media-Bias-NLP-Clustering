Most Americans judge a president based on what he promises versus what he delivers, and they judge him using the question Ronald Reagan asked voters in 1980: \u201cAre you better off today than you were four years ago?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nAt this point in the Obama presidency, the answer is a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d Obama promised big results, but he\u2019s failed to deliver.\n\nFor example, look at these four promises and the eventual results. They cover what are arguably his biggest accomplishments.\n\nObama\u2019s $825-billion stimulus failed to keep unemployment below 8% as he promised. After the stimulus passed, America still lost over one million jobs. If you count people who have become discouraged and are no longer seeking jobs, some economists believe that the real unemployment rate is still above 20%. Obama called his healthcare package one of his major accomplishments. He told CBS News\u2019 Steve Kroft that he was \u201cputting in place a system in which we\u2019re going to start lowering healthcare costs.\u201d Yet Obamacare has failed to make health insurance more affordable. According to FactCheck.org, Obamacare is actually making healthcare \u201cless affordable.\u201d Workers paid an average of $132 more for family coverage this year. Obama predicted that his investments in green energy would create five million jobs, but The Wall Street Journal reports: \u201cThe green jobs subsidy story gets more embarrassing by the day. Three years ago President Obama promised that by the end of the decade, America would have five million green jobs, but so far, some $90 billion in government spending has delivered very few.\u201d Obama pledged to cut the deficit in half, saying: \u201cAnd that\u2019s why today I\u2019m pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office.\u201d Obama then enacted his deficit reduction plan, which was comprised of a series of massive tax increases. Yet the deficit is still more than twice what he promised.\n\nBased on these results, I\u2019d give the president a solid \u201cF\u201d!\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nDon\u2019t expect much reporting on the president\u2019s record, though. Instead, watch as the media continues to focus on polls. They like to judge politicians this way because they can control the outcome. Just ask any honest pollster \u2013 it\u2019s easy to game the outcome of a poll by manipulating the questions.\n\nIn fact, the news media is almost desperate to ignore Obama\u2019s record\u2026 and so is the president himself. He\u2019s constantly changing the subject when it comes to his record, focusing instead on topics like \u201cincome inequality.\u201d\n\nLucky for Obama, the mainstream media will always help him out. Just wait\u2026 I fully expect them to work hard building the president a legacy he doesn\u2019t deserve, as well.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThis commentary appeared at CapitolHillDaily.com and is reprinted here with permission.\n\nPhoto credit: SS&SS (Flickr)\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Don\u2019t expect much reporting on the president\u2019s record, though.", "author": "Floyd Brown", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "Don\u2019t expect much reporting on the president\u2019s record, though.", "title": "Top 4 Reasons Obama Will Be Seen As A Failure", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 970, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/5527928310_9c69b1e2ba_o.jpg", "height": 724}, "updated_time": "2014-05-19T11:30:41-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/top-4-reasons-obama-deserves-failing-report-card/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Don\u2019t expect much reporting on the president\u2019s record, though.", "creator": "@floydbrown", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/5527928310_9c69b1e2ba_o.jpg", "title": "Top 4 Reasons Obama Will Be Seen As A Failure", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-07T11:11:46-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-04-07T11:11:46-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-19T11:30:41-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "barack obama, fiscal irresponsibility, media bias, obamacare, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8df8\"", "article_summary": "After the stimulus passed, America still lost over one million jobs.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowAs Barack Obama moves toward the end of his career, expect to hear lots of talk about his legacy.\nObama predicted that his investments in green energy would create five million jobs, but The Wall Street Journal reports: \u201cThe green jobs subsidy story gets more embarrassing by the day.\nJust wait\u2026 I fully expect them to work hard building the president a legacy he doesn\u2019t deserve, as well.\nHe\u2019s constantly changing the subject when it comes to his record, focusing instead on topics like \u201cincome inequality.\u201dLucky for Obama, the mainstream media will always help him out."}
