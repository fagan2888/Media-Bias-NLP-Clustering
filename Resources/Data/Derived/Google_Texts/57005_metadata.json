He\u2019s Archie Bunker in a less comfy chair.\n\nIndeed, the justice provides so much candy for headline writers eager to drive up their website\u2019s traffic, that it is easy to miss what is probably the most significant part of the interview \u2014 he repudiates his own moderation from a quarter a century ago.\n\nTwo years after joining the Supreme Court, Scalia delivered a lecture entitled \u201cOriginalism: The Lesser Evil\u201d where he laid out much of his philosophy of how judges should decide cases. Words have meaning, Scalia correctly asserted, and the words of the Constitution must be read as they would have been understood at the time they were enacted. This way, Scalia assured, unelected judges will not overstep their proper role in a democracy. Even if the Constitution were intended to allow the law to evolve with society\u2019s values, Scalia saw \u201cno basis for believing that supervision of the evolution would have been committed to the courts.\u201d Scalia\u2019s textualism, and his belief that a text\u2019s meaning is fixed in time, were both grounded in notions of judicial restraint. If judges can change the meaning of the Constitution, their power is truly limitless.\n\nScalia\u2019s own relationship with this judicial philosophy, however, is quite fraught. As Yale\u2019s Jack Balkin and others have demonstrated, for example, there\u2019s little support in the Constitution\u2019s text or its original history for the idea that the federal government cannot regulate nationwide economic markets. And there\u2019s strong originalist evidence supporting the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Yet Scalia rejected this evidence to join an angry dissent labeling Obamacare unconstitutional.\n\nMoreover, as Scalia conceded in his 1988 lecture, it is not always easy to determine what the framing generation though a particular constitutional provision meant. And even when it is possible to read the minds of the founding generation, such cross-generational telepathy often reveals that the framers didn\u2019t know the answer either. James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were very much at odds over the scope of federal power under the Constitution, even though they both men were present while the document was being drafted. Justice Scalia\u2019s pro-gun opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller relies heavily on constitutional history to expand the scope of the Second Amendment, but so does Justice Stevens\u2019 dissent. It\u2019s easy to read Scalia\u2019s Heller opinion (and, to be fair, Stevens dissent) and conclude that its author started with the result he wanted, and then trolled through uncertain historical sources in order to find the ones that supported his view.\n\nSo, while the younger Scalia presented reliance on the Constitution\u2019s original history as a cure to judges imposing their views on the American people, that\u2019s not how Scalia\u2019s originalism has actually worked in practice. In practice, he\u2019s been more than capable of selecting the history he likes best \u2014 and even ignoring constitutional history that goes against his preferred result.\n\nYet, while Scalia\u2019s desire to shape the law often exceed his principles, his \u201cLesser Evil\u201d lecture did offer one sop to liberals afraid that he would comb through early American history, uncover abhorrent practices and then stamp the Court\u2019s blessing upon them. Labeling himself a \u201cfaint-hearted originalist,\u201d Scalia confesses that \u201cI cannot imagine myself, any more than any other federal judge, upholding a statute that imposes the punishment of flogging.\u201d There are some injustices that the younger Scalia would intervene to prevent, even if those injustices existed at the framing.\n\nThis is the part of the \u201cLesser Evil\u201d lecture that Scalia abandons in his interview with Ms. Senior. When asked \u201chow fainthearted\u201d he truly is, Scalia responds \u201cI described myself as that a long time ago. I repudiate that.\u201d And lest there be any doubt, that means he would permit flogging \u2014 \u201cwhat I would say now is, yes, if a state enacted a law permitting flogging, it is immensely stupid, but it is not unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nThis repudiation is not entirely surprising \u2014 while Scalia has not upheld flogging, he did join a dissent siding with three prison guards who handcuffed a prisoner to a hitching post in the hot sun and denied him water. Nevertheless, his explicit willingness to sanction injustices he would have halted as a younger man provides reveals a great deal about his approach to the law in his later years.\n\nWhen the lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act had just been filed, many legal observers mocked them as unlikely to prevail because Scalia authored an opinion in 2005 that left little doubt that the law was constitutional. If even Scalia\u2019s opinions supported a progressive law, how could any judge \u2014 or at least, any judge acting in good faith \u2014 deem the law unconstitutional? Scalia\u2019s repudiation of his 1988 statement may reveal why so many attorneys were wrong to look to his past opinions and expect them to guide him in the future. In the winter of his years on the Court, Scalia looks back upon his past moderation and regrets it. It follows that his own more moderate opinions are no longer reliable predictors of Scalia\u2019s current views.\n\nThis lurch to the right should scare liberals even more than Scalia already does. And it is not yet clear if anything remains of Scalia\u2019s prior claims to judicial restraint. Indeed, during oral arguments on the Voting Rights Act case, Scalia not only labeled the landmark law a \u201cperpetuation of racial entitlement,\u201d he claimed for himself a sweeping power to correct what he viewed as a failure of the democratic process.
