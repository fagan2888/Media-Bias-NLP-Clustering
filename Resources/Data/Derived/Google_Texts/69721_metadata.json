The NFL Players Union filed an appeal last night for the former Baltimore Ravens running back. He\u2019s been suspended indefinitely by the league for punching the woman who\u2019s now his wife.\n\nTwo other NFL players are also facing domestic violence cases. Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy played in week one, but not last weekend. Today, he was taken off the active roster while he appeals his conviction for domestic assault. And San Francisco 49ers defensive end Ray McDonald has played in both his team\u2019s games so far.\n\nMinority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said today that was the wrong call. Even so, the 49ers\u2019 Sunday night game with the Chicago Bears drew one of the largest TV audiences ever for a regular season game. Chicago won that 28-20.\n\nWhat kind of threats do these stories pose to the future of the game as a business? And is the business itself showing any cracks?\n\nWe check in with two who have a good lens onto all of this.\n\nGregg Easterbrook is the author of \u201cThe King of Sports: Football\u2019s Impact on America.\u201d He\u2019s a contributing editor to \u201cThe Atlantic\u201d and a columnist for ESPN and NFL.com. And Andrew Zimbalist is an economist at Smith College who specializes in the business of sports. He has consulted in the past for players unions, teams and sports leagues, including football.\n\nAndrew Zimbalist, let me start with you first.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, has this made a dent in the business of football?\n\nANDREW ZIMBALIST, Smith College: I don\u2019t think so, not yet.\n\nI mean, you have sponsors complaining and a few sponsors leaving. Those sponsors will come back as soon as this uproar blows over. As you just pointed out, ratings on the television games are going up. Attendance is fine. So I think this would have to drag on for a good deal longer, and there would have to be more and more bungling by the commission, by Roger Goodell, for it to have a real business impact.\n\nFootball is very, very strong. It\u2019s very resilient. And I think that the front office is now mobilized, and they are going to do things that will I think at least lower the uproar a little bit.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Gregg Easterbrook, what\u2019s the threshold that has to be crossed where there are serious financial consequences?\n\nGREGG EASTERBROOK, Author, \u201cThe King of Sports: Football\u2019s Impact on America\u201d: Well, since most of the NFL\u2019s money comes from television contracts, they\u2019re not going to change year to year.\n\nYou ask yourself, how will the perception of football change over the course of the next few years? The game itself has never been better. The games are fabulous. NFL games, college games are all great to watch.\n\nBut if people begin to say that football is the new cigarettes, and you\u2019re starting to hear that, if people begin to think that football isn\u2019t just tax subsidies \u2014 the governor of Minnesota says he\u2019s embarrassed by the Vikings\u2019 treatment of Adrian Peterson.\n\nWhat you should really be embarrassed about a half-a-billion dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money that the governor of Minnesota gave to the Wilf brothers to build the stadium in which they will keep all of the profits. If people become more aware of those issues, if football becomes perceived as a woman\u2019s issue \u2014 nobody saw that coming \u2014 and especially if football \u2014 people turn their attention to the fact that the vast majority of football is played at the youth and high school level by people who legally are children, that\u2019s where the health harm of football is done.\n\nIf public high schools begin to drop out of playing football \u2014 and there is some indication they will \u2014 that over a period of years could change the NFL\u2019s economics very radically.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew, when you were mentioning the sponsors, have any of the actions that the Radisson or Nike have taken, are they significant? Are they likely to win more support?\n\nANDREW ZIMBALIST: Not yet. Not yet.\n\nThey\u2019re drops in the bucket. And, You know, the Nike is a deal that they have with Peterson. It\u2019s not a deal they have with the Vikings or a deal they have with the NFL. And I think any sponsors that do drop the NFL will come right back, because they don\u2019t have better alternatives. This is a game that \u2014 a sport that produces ratings of 8 and 10 on a typical Sunday. So you have eight million households watching the football games.\n\nAnd this is a game where you have tens of millions of Americans involved in fantasy football. They have a very strong foothold in America. And I think Gregg is right. There are a lot of ifs, though, in what he said. If the perception of all of those things begins to change over time, then, yes, football can be hurt \u2014 hurt in its business dealings, but that\u2019s not about to happen.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Gregg, what about the fact that these ratings are at historic highs for football, that we might be privately or even semi-publicly opposed to what\u2019s happening with a few specific players, but we\u2019re still going to the games or we\u2019re certainly watching them more often than we used to?\n\nGREGG EASTERBROOK: Oh, football is the 800-pound gorilla of television, NBC\u2019s \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d the number one show on network TV, not the number one sport, the number one show, ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football,\u201d the number one show on cable, not the number one sport, the number one show.\n\nFootball, as I said, the games have never been better. It\u2019s the perfect game for the United States. I call it the king of sports because it expresses what we are as a nation. It\u2019s too loud, it\u2019s too crazy, it\u2019s too violent. It\u2019s the perfect game. And it\u2019s a fascinating game to watch. I love it.\n\nBut when you add the sociological impact, the distorting effect that it has on high school education, mainly for boys, for a few girls, but mainly for boys, the distorting effect that it has, the fact that NCAA football has at big public universities, and then add in that the public subsidizes the production of NFL profit \u2014 roughly a billion dollars a year goes to subsidize the construction and operation of NFL stadiums \u2014 where almost all the revenue generated is kept by the super rich, you have these sociological impacts.\n\nAnd, suddenly, the fact that the game is a fabulous game doesn\u2019t seem so great anymore.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew, what about \u2014 speaking of subsidies, this has also called into question the tax status of the NFL. And people have tried to take it on before, and there\u2019s now possibly pieces of legislation that may make their way to the floor.\n\nANDREW ZIMBALIST: Oh, frankly, I like Cory Booker, but I think he\u2019s grandstanding here.\n\nLook, what \u2014 what this tax exemption is, is an exemption for the front office of the National Football League. It\u2019s not an exemption for the teams. The teams still pay profit taxes. The owners pay profit taxes. The players pay income taxes.\n\nThe front office is a pass-through organization. They get revenue from television. They get revenue from licensing. They get revenue from sponsorships. They keep some of that to fund the front office, and then they give the rest to the teams. They can manipulate all those numbers any way they want.\n\nIf \u2014 if the IRS all of a sudden said, we\u2019re going the tax you, they can make all of their income disappear, and the taxes would amount to nothing anyway. So, I think it\u2019s a red herring.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK.\n\nGregg, what about the idea that the NFL has really sparked conversations in America in the past few years? We\u2019re talking now about concussions. We were talking about bullying. And here we are talking about domestic violence and a national conversation on corporal punishment.\n\nGREGG EASTERBROOK: Well, everything about the NFL is outsized. That\u2019s one of the interesting things about it.\n\nAnd it holds up a mirror to society in many ways. As recently as five years ago, concussions were a forbidden subject, totally verboten. You never heard it mentioned on the air on ESPN, CBS, NBC. Now it\u2019s discussed constantly. That\u2019s a healthy development \u2014 healthy literally, because it helps boys and youth players to understand how to protect their heads.\n\nA year ago, the Miami Dolphins\u2019 bullying controversy \u2014 Jonathan Martin, a huge, muscular man who could lift a 10-ton weight above his head, stopped playing football because he was being bullied. And that reflected \u2014 a generation ago, we would have laughed about that, but it reflected the fact that our social understanding of bullying has changed from being not just bad manners, from being an ethical problem.\n\nAnd now we\u2019re using the NFL as a lens through which to see domestic violence. It\u2019s the NFL holding up a mirror to American society.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Andrew, the NFL has weathered a lot of these things before. How do you think it will deal with this?\n\nANDREW ZIMBALIST: Yes, I think it\u2019s going to weather it. You know, they have a very effective public relations office. They have done it before.\n\nThey \u2014 people said that the concussion scandal and the litigations were going to unseat Goodell several years ago. They said when there was the issue with the New Orleans Saints a few years ago that that was \u2014 that they were getting bounties for injuring other players on the other teams.\n\nThese scandals have come to the surface practically every year, and there\u2019s always an uproar about it, and the media is always on top of it and people are speculating about how fragile the NFL is.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.\n\nANDREW ZIMBALIST: And it always bounces back. And that\u2019s what I predict will happen in this case.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Andrew Zimbalist, Gregg Easterbrook, thanks so much for your time.\n\nGREGG EASTERBROOK: Thank you.\n\nANDREW ZIMBALIST: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some sponsors of the NFL have started to complain publicly about the league's handling of the cases involving players and domestic abuse of spouses and children.
