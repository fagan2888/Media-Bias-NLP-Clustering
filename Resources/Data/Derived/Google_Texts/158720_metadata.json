Effective gerrymandering points to a string of congressional blowouts, particularly in Hampton Roads.\n\nEven the Senate race, in a year Republicans are set to take hold of the chamber with gains around the country, doesn't have the oomph of consequence here that it could. It hasn't drawn big outside money, as races in other states have, and Warner has led in every poll publicly released, usually by double digits. Only late last week did a pair of polls narrow the race to single digits, and they still showed Warner comfortably ahead.\n\n\"I just think that, when somebody's up that far, there's not an intensity,\" said Quentin Kidd, who heads the poll-producing Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University.\n\n\"The Gillespie campaign, I think, has done a good job,\" Kidd said. \"I don't think it's going to be enough.\"\n\nThat said, an upset in Virginia would help tilt the balance of power in the Senate from the Democrats to the Republicans. It's not out of the question if turnout is low enough \u2014 Republicans tend to vote in greater numbers than Democrats in off-year elections.\n\nDown the ballot, if you see boredom, \"you can simply blame gerrymandering, period,\" Kidd said.\n\n\"There is not a single competitive congressional district in Virginia,\" he said.\n\nNorthern Virginia's 10th District comes closest this year, but that's largely because of an open seat after U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf's retirement. The 7th District was competitive, in the primary, when upstart Republican Dave Brat beat former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. It will be an upset if Brat's Democratic opponent, Jack Trammell, pulls out a win.\n\n\"No one outside Virginia will be looking to the state as a harbinger of anything in this election,\" University of Virginia Professor and longtime prognosticator Larry Sabato said. \"Gerrymandering has worked as intended, and most races are snoozers.\"\n\nKidd predicted a statewide turnout in the 40-45 percent range, which would be about standard for Virginia's every-four-years midterm elections. Turnout was 44 percent in 2010. It nearly hit 53 percent in 2006, but Virginia's now-void constitutional amendment banning gay marriage was on the ballot that year as was a hard-fought, high-profile Senate race between Republican George Allen and Democrat Jim Webb.\n\nWhy, in the state that prides itself as the mother of presidents and cradle of western Democracy, do relatively few people consistently avail themselves of their rights?\n\nLots of reasons. A lot of people don't think they can make a difference, according to Ilya Somin, a George Mason University professor who wrote a book on voter ignorance. He said most people probably spend more time deciding what sort of television to buy than whom to vote for.\n\nThey know the TV decision will matter.\n\n\"Most people are not apathetic,\" Somin said. \"They do realize that government policy makes a difference in the world. ... However, they also understand intuitively that the chance that they're vote will make a difference is extremely small.\"\n\nIt's \"rational individual behavior,\" Somin said, but it leads to \"bad collective outcomes.\" The math simply says that your vote almost certainly won't decide an election.\n\nYet plenty of races are won or lost by far fewer votes than the number of people who stayed home.\n\nKidd offers a few more reasons. Negative campaigning. The aforementioned gerrymandering that essentially decides races in the primary. Election fatigue.\n\nWith Virginia's odd-year elections, and localities that often hold their elections in the spring or early summer, it is almost always election season in Virginia.\n\n\"You could have voted up to four times in any given year,\" Kidd said. \"So I do think there is something to be said about voter fatigue.\"\n\nFain can be reached by phone at 757-525-1759.\n\nElection Day FAQ\n\nWhere do I vote?
