The \u201cAcademy\u201d seems to have found a near perfect host in Neil Patrick Harris, who can combine old school entertainment with modern snark and a healthy helping of charm. All the old signifiers will be on full display: the red carpet interviews, the questionable dance numbers, and the interminable speeches. As always, audiences will lap it all up, maybe with a drinking game to help the hours fly by.\n\nDespite recent revelations that confirm long standing suspicions that Academy members are voting for reasons other than the actual quality of the performance, the awards and surrounding hoopla still convey the sense that, no matter who ultimately wins, the 20 actors nominated did give some of the best performances of the year.\n\nOscars 2015: The Nominees\u2019 Worst Films\n\n\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t yet filled out their office Oscar pool, here\u2019s a handicapper\u2019s guide to the nominees:\n\nBoyhood had the momentum following the Golden Globe, but has lost some steam. Some have suggested that its novel production schedule is more praiseworthy than the actual finished product. Based on pre-Oscars buzz, Birdman seems to have taken the lead, and will probably win\u2026though the box office performance of American Sniper may give voters pause.\n\nEddie Redmayne will probably take home Best Actor, despite reservations that playing a disabled character is a short cut to winning an Oscar. Should those protests be loud enough, Michael Keaton or possibly Bradley Cooper could sneak in and win it\u2026but that won\u2019t happen. Julianne Moore will almost certainly win Best Actress, as only Reese Witherspoon provides any real competition, but in an equally under-the-radar movie. Patricia Arquette and J.K. Simmons are both locks in the supporting categories. Trust me, these are this year\u2019s sure things. Nobody else is close.\n\nRelated: Hollywood\u2019s Desperate Measures to Save the 2015 Season\n\nThat said, and to bring some much-needed perspective to the celebration, we\u2019d like to remind these performers that their career choices were not always so award-worthy. Whether the result of desperation, foolishness, bad advice or simply being cast in an ambitious failure, all of our nominees have at least one skeleton in their career closet (the nominees this year don\u2019t include any first timers like Barkhad Abdi or Quvenzhane Wallis this year, for better or worse).\n\nWithout further ado, here is our list of the worst performances by all 20 of the actors and actresses nominated for 2015 Academy Awards.\n\nOscars 2015: The Nominees\u2019 Worst Films\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Sunday night, Hollywood royalty will gather for their annual industry awards, alleg", "title": "Oscars 2015: The Nominees\u2019 Worst Films", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Oscars-2015-Nominees-Worst-Films", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/02202015_Jupiter.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/20/Oscars-2015-Nominees-Worst-Films", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slides/02202015_Jupiter.jpg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On Sunday night, Hollywood royalty will gather for their annual industry awards, alleg", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc383\"", "article_summary": "Oscars 2015: The Nominees\u2019 Worst FilmsTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\nWithout further ado, here is our list of the worst performances by all 20 of the actors and actresses nominated for 2015 Academy Awards.\nOscars 2015: The Nominees\u2019 Worst FilmsFor those who haven\u2019t yet filled out their office Oscar pool, here\u2019s a handicapper\u2019s guide to the nominees:Boyhood had the momentum following the Golden Globe, but has lost some steam.\nJulianne Moore will almost certainly win Best Actress, as only Reese Witherspoon provides any real competition, but in an equally under-the-radar movie.\nOn Sunday night, Hollywood royalty will gather for their annual industry awards, allegedly recognizing the best performances both in front of and behind the camera for the past year."}
