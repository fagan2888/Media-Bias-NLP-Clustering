Karin Hoffman of Lighthouse Point, founder of the tea party group DC Works For US, is running for the Florida Senate.

In a filing with the state Division of Elections, Hoffman indicated she plans to seek the Republican nomination for the Broward-Palm Beach county seat currently held by state Sen. Maria Sachs.

Hoffman has conservative bona fides. She supported Herman Cain, the former Godfather’s pizza chief executive (famous for his 9-9-9 tax plan) for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

She has also carved an independent path that has often had her voicing skepticism of establishment Republican figures than Democrats.

In March, for example, she said former Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida’s favorite son and potential candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination would be hurt by his support for the Common Core education standards. Hoffman said Bush "wasn't palatable" before Common Core. "When he made that his core issue, then in essence he became enemy No. 1 to the grassroots."

She has also said that Gov. Rick Scott, who was a favorite of the tea party when he was elected in 2010, has alienated many in the movement. Among his alleged sins: reversing his position on part of Obamacare and deciding to support an expansion of the Medicaid health program for the poor. (Scott couldn’t convince the Republican-controlled Legislature to go along.)

And she’s worked with Democrats.

In 2011, she pulled together a group of Republicans and Democrats to discuss “The American Experiment: Where Do We Go From Here," an examination of the different philosophical approaches to the nation’s most pressing problems: health care, energy, jobs, taxes.
