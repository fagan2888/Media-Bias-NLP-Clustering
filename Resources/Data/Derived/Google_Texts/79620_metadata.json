Arlen Specter, quickly switched parties and became a Democrat.\n\nSoon after the stimulus vote, Mr. Obama began pushing his health care law, which also turned into another partisan fight. Although the president invited Republicans and Democrats to the White House to talk about his plans, in the end Democrats moved ahead without the GOP, clearing the bill through the House and Senate without earning a single Republican vote.\n\nSEE ALSO: Obama forgets which city he\u2019s in\n\nWhen he was campaigning for president in 2008, Mr. Obama pledged to \u201cturn the page on the ugly partisanship in Washington, so we can bring Democrats and Republicans together to pass an agenda that works for the American people.\u201d But during his final State of the Union address Tuesday night, the president said one of his regrets is that \u201cthe rancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.\u201d\n\nAt a retreat with Republican lawmakers Thursday to plan strategy for this year in Congress, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan told his colleagues that \u201cthe challenge we have clearly, in this particular government, is Barack Obama is president.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think the country is on the wrong track,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said. \u201cWe think we\u2019re headed in the wrong direction on so many issues \u2014 economic growth, upward mobility, poverty, national security. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here today to talk among ourselves about how we go forward.\u201d\n\nReflecting on the lack of bipartisanship, Mr. Obama said he has \u201cno doubt there are things I could have done better,\u201d without specifying what actions he could have taken. But he also said the problem was beyond his power to solve anyway.\n\n\u201cThis is not something a president can do by him or herself,\u201d the president said. \u201cWhen it comes to how we work together, the main impetus for a better politics is going to be the American people. They have to demand it. \u201c\n\nHe said too many voters are sending the message that they don\u2019t want their representatives to compromise.\n\n\u201cIf you punish an elected official for even talking to the other side, then it\u2019s going to produce the kind of politics that we have seen in Washington too often,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nIn 2013, the president cited then-Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio as a Republican lawmaker who wanted to compromise with him but faced too much criticism \u201con Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama embarked on the two-day trip to Nebraska and Louisiana to follow up on his proposals from the State of the Union address, and engage in a final-year effort to meet people who don\u2019t always agree with him, according to White House aides. But his two speeches were held before strongly supportive audiences at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, and at a high school in Baton Rouge where the audience members gave a standing ovation when one audience member suggested that first lady Michelle Obama run for the presidency, something Mr. Obama replied would never happen.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said the audiences are to a degree self-selected.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s most enthusiastic supporters are the people who are going to be most enthusiastic about standing in line, working hard to get the limited supply of tickets,\u201d he said. \u201d \u2026 It\u2019s not because we chose the audience. I think it\u2019s because the audience chose themselves.\u201d\n\n\u2981 Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Elaborating on his failure to heal the partisan divide in Washington, President Obama said Thursday his presidency got off to a bad start in 2009 because some Republican lawmakers were more concerned about their re-election than they were in helping him to save the nation from economic ruin.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Elaborating on his failure to heal the partisan divide in Washington, President Obama said Thursday his presidency got off to a bad start in 2009 because some Republican lawmakers were more concerned about their re-election than they were in helping him to save the nation from economic ruin.", "title": "Obama: GOP behaved selfishly from start of my presidency", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/14/obama-gop-behaved-selfishly-start-my-presidency/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/14/Obama.JPEG-079f2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/14/Obama.JPEG-079f2.jpg", "description": "Elaborating on his failure to heal the partisan divide in Washington, President Obama said Thursday his presidency got off to a bad start in 2009 because some Republican lawmakers were more concerned", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama: GOP behaved selfishly from start of my presidency"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Baton Rouge, Barack Obama"}, "article_summary": "Soon after the stimulus vote, Mr. Obama began pushing his health care law, which also turned into another partisan fight.\nElaborating on his admitted failure to heal the partisan divide in Washington, President Obama said Thursday his presidency got off to a bad start in 2009 because some Republican lawmakers were more concerned about their re-election than they were in helping him to save the nation from economic ruin.\n\u201cIf you punish an elected official for even talking to the other side, then it\u2019s going to produce the kind of politics that we have seen in Washington too often,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re here today to talk among ourselves about how we go forward.\u201dReflecting on the lack of bipartisanship, Mr. Obama said he has \u201cno doubt there are things I could have done better,\u201d without specifying what actions he could have taken.\n\u201cWe think we\u2019re headed in the wrong direction on so many issues \u2014 economic growth, upward mobility, poverty, national security."}
