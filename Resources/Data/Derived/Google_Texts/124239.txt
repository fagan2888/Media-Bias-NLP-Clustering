For a new U.S. News annual project, we examined thousands of data points about health care costs to present a comprehensive picture of health care's changing impact on the economy.

The Health Care Index is completely interactive and allows users to view the underlying data in different ways.



Here are the quick take-aways from the project:

Americans are spending more out of pocket for health care, and this is unlikely to change.

More costs are being shifted to the consumer through a variety of channels, including through increases in the percentage of plans that have a deductible and the costs of those deductibles.

The aging of baby boomers means more people are enrolled in government-funded Medicare, which has caused an increase in the share of Americans enrolled in public versus private health insurance policies.

In terms of employment, nurses still rule health care. But in terms of the rate of change, other unexpected professions – massage therapy, for one – have a faster rate of growth.

Associate degrees are the most popular type of degree for health professionals.

Costs are increasing across the board for services, but the costs for hospitals services are increasing the most quickly.

The U.S. spends far more of its gross domestic product on health care than other nations do.
