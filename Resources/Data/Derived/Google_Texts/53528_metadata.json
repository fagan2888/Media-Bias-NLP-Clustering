The company said it also will realign U.S. field operations and reduce expenses at the company\u2019s restaurant support center in Dublin.\n\n\u201cBut this initiative is about more than just cost-cutting,\u201d Mr. Brolick said. \u201cIt\u2019s also about the realignment of resources to enable same-restaurant sales and new restaurant growth.\u201d\n\nWendy\u2019s is investing in a mobile payment and ordering platform to drive customer loyalty with increased transactions, higher check and faster service.\n\n\u201cThese initiatives are essential elements of our growth strategy to increase brand relevance and economic model relevance,\u201d Mr. Brolick said.\n\nNet income attributable to the Wendy\u2019s Co. in the third quarter ended Sept. 28 advanced to $22,830,000, equal to 6c per share on the common stock, which compared with a loss of $1,939,000 in the prior-year period.\n\nNet revenues totaled $512,489,000, down 20% from $640,779,000 in the comparable quarter, reflecting the sale of company restaurants to franchisees, higher beef costs and restaurant closures as part of Wendy\u2019s reimaging program.\n\nDuring the quarter, same-restaurant sales growth at company-operated restaurants increased 2%, slightly below expectations. While Wendy\u2019s was pushing such premium items as a smoked gouda chicken sandwich on a brioche bun, the fast-food chain said it lost value-oriented business. Looking ahead, Wendy\u2019s will promote its Right Price Right Size menu of lower-price items while continuing to plug such higher-end entrees as barbecue pulled pork.\n\n\u201cWhat we see is that actually if you think about the price-value marketplace, it\u2019s not a totally homogenous marketplace,\u201d Mr. Brolick said. \u201cAnd what I mean by that is there are some people in that marketplace that are attracted by a value menu. Some of them are more coupon users. And then some of them are more users of what I\u2019d call a higher-end promoted product that has been discounted. So, I think as we look at Right Price Right Size Menu, I think there\u2019s some refinements we can make in messaging there. But we also have to just look at the portfolio of price-value messages that we put in front of the consumers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Financial-Performance/2014/11/Wendys_reinvesting_in_growth.aspx?ID=%7B060FEE10-1512-486C-AF9F-79D1184D741D%7D&cck=1", "image": "http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/Design/Shared/Images/Sosland_230X200.png", "description": "Chain announced cost-cutting initiatives after disappointing quarter.", "title": "Wendy's reinvesting in growth"}, "google-site-verification": "1cyYEzLu2aiOUF83gs4TTxN_lCZn-kz0GHVJCeaN5vA", "fb": {"app_id": 500352526759869}, "description": "News, Markets and Analysis for the Food Processing Industry", "keywords": "food business news,food business,ingredients,grain,wheat,trends,sodium,stevia,health,food safety,food production,food ingredients,fda,consumers,beverage,baking"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc410\"", "article_summary": "Wendy's reinvesting in growthby Monica WatrousDUBLIN, OHIO \u2014 The Wendy\u2019s Co. has announced plans to reduce operating expenses by approximately $30 million and reinvest in growth initiatives.\n\u201cThese initiatives are essential elements of our growth strategy to increase brand relevance and economic model relevance,\u201d Mr. Brolick said.\n\u201cWhat we see is that actually if you think about the price-value marketplace, it\u2019s not a totally homogenous marketplace,\u201d Mr. Brolick said.\nLooking ahead, Wendy\u2019s will promote its Right Price Right Size menu of lower-price items while continuing to plug such higher-end entrees as barbecue pulled pork.\n\u201cBut this initiative is about more than just cost-cutting,\u201d Mr. Brolick said."}
