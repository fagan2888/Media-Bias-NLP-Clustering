An emotional, physical burden,\" Clinton said, adding, \"Boy, is it hard for caregivers.\" She explained that hardship is why she wants to create a tax credit for caregivers as part of her effort to help families dealing with autism.\n\nThe Democratic front runner has laid out a number of health-focused plans as part of her campaign. Last month, she was in Iowa to roll out her proposal for a $2 billion annual research fund to find the cure for Alzheimer's. Other focal points of her campaign include efforts to expand the Americans with Disabilities Act and reduce drug costs. She has also committed to defending the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe autism initiative has a number of layers including: boosting screening, improving treatment by pushing private insurers to cover autism services, increasing research and creating a graduate program for those with autism to help them find employment.\n\nThere are more than 3.5 million Americans on the autism spectrum, and one in every 68 children in the United States was identified as having Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"As a country, we must make a priority of supporting the millions of Americans with autism, and their loved ones. My plan takes a comprehensive approach by boosting screening, improving treatment, and expanding employment and housing opportunities for those with autism,\" Clinton said of her new plan. \"Too many American families are staying up at night worrying about their family members, especially children, who are living with autism. There is more we can do.\"\n\nClinton identified the need to focus on this issue early on, and it has strengthened her support in the state.\n\nFor example, Jennifer Herrington, a mental health and social worker from southwest Iowa, had coffee with Clinton almost a year ago during the candidate's listening tour which launched her presidential campaign in the spring of 2015. Herrington works at a private mental health center and she fought -- though unsuccessfully -- against Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad's decision to close the health care facilities in the state. So when she sat down with Clinton, she specifically addressed the need to address the mental health issues in the state.\n\n\"When she said that she spent the first few months of the campaign really listening to the Iowans, that is so true, that is not just rhetoric,\" Herrington explains. She knows a handful of folks that have become Clinton supporters. \"With her campaign, mental health is finally getting the attention that it deserves.\"\n\nThere are some, however, who are still not sold on Clinton's plans. Michael Moore, an undecided Democratic caucus goer, was at the Sioux City event, and he is one of them.\n\n\"I was hoping to hear some more details, and I don't know if what she is proposing is realistic to get passed in Congress right now,\" Moore explained. \"I don't know how they are going to sit at the table together with some of the abrasive terms that she has used against them. I would like to see a softer tone to take on these issues, in my opinion.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic front runner has won over Iowa voters with her strong emphasis on health care issues", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-announces-autism-initiative-bulks-up-health-care-platform/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/01/06/4975f90c-b3ff-4c1c-a3ac-3d83d003bf95/thumbnail/1200x630/2a923aa8c0d26b828c8ece36e907c421/2016-01-06t012738z1161003403gf10000283957rtrmadp3usa-election-clinton.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "The Democratic front runner has won over Iowa voters with her strong emphasis on health care issues", "title": "Hillary Clinton announces autism initiative, bulks up health care platform"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Democratic front runner has won over Iowa voters with her strong emphasis on health care issues", "title": "Hillary Clinton announces autism initiative, bulks up health care platform", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-announces-autism-initiative-bulks-up-health-care-platform/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-announces-autism-initiative-bulks-up-health-care-platform/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-announces-autism-initiative-bulks-up-health-care-platform/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/01/06/4975f90c-b3ff-4c1c-a3ac-3d83d003bf95/thumbnail/1200x630/2a923aa8c0d26b828c8ece36e907c421/2016-01-06t012738z1161003403gf10000283957rtrmadp3usa-election-clinton.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-announces-autism-initiative-bulks-up-health-care-platform/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/hillary-clinton-announces-autism-initiative-bulks-up-health-care-platform/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "hillary clinton, iowa, health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton, iowa, health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d10\"", "article_summary": "So when she sat down with Clinton, she specifically addressed the need to address the mental health issues in the state.\n\"With her campaign, mental health is finally getting the attention that it deserves.\"\nSioux CityAfter gleefully thanking her Iowa precinct captains here at a town hall Tuesday, Hillary Clinton bulked up her steadfast commitment to improving health care issues, rolling out her new autism initiative.\nMy plan takes a comprehensive approach by boosting screening, improving treatment, and expanding employment and housing opportunities for those with autism,\" Clinton said of her new plan.\nHerrington works at a private mental health center and she fought -- though unsuccessfully -- against Iowa Gov."}
