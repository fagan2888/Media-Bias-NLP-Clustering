Oreos may be milk’s favorite cookie, but most nutritionists don’t share the same fondness for the calorie-packed snack. Mondelez International Inc., Oreo’s parent company, has heard the collective groan from health-conscious consumers and has decided to launch a more “sophisticated” snack with fewer calories. “Oreo Thins” are expected to hit the cookie market on July 13 and, according to the company, will provide a guilt-free snack for Oreo fans looking to watch their weight.

Now, if you’re like me, you may be thinking: So all they really did was take out the filling and leave us with two chocolate wafers with a thin slathering of cream. Actually, Oreo Thins offers the same cookie-to-filling ratio, just in a much slimmer cookie. While three regular Oreos contain 160 calories, four Oreo Thins contain 140 calories. Janda Lukin, senior director of Oreo in North America, told the Associated Press, "If regular Oreos are like pancakes, then Oreo Thins would be like crêpes.”

Unlike limited edition flavors recently marketed by Oreo, Thins are set to be added to the company’s official product line. They will be available in Original, Mint, and Golden. As an Oreo fan and a fitness enthusiast, I must say I am thoroughly excited about these new Oreo Thins. However, I do have one concern: How are we going to twist them open before dunking? The company’s spokeswoman claims they weren’t designed for this purpose, but we all know that’s exactly what all Oreos are designed for.
