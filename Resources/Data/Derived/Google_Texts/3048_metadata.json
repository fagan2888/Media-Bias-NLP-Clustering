He\u2019s been lobbying for the game for years. The Capitals were the visiting team in Pittsburgh for the 2011 Winter Classic, which was postponed several hours because of rain.\n\n\u201cI experienced the weather in Pittsburgh, and I see what can happen city-by-city when you play outdoors,\u201d Leonsis said at the team\u2019s annual fan convention, \u201cand I just hope that we get a cold spell and maybe even some snow.\u201d\n\nThe average high temperature on Jan. 1 in Washington is 44 degrees, with a record of 69 set in 2005. This season\u2019s Winter Classic will be held in Michigan, but a good litmus test for outdoor hockey in a warmer climate will come Jan. 5 when the Anaheim Ducks will play the Los Angeles Kings at Dodger Stadium.\n\nLeonsis said he\u2019d like to attend the game at Dodger Stadium, and noted that there have been technological advances that keep rinks cold when the temperature is unseasonably warm. He said it sounded like a \u201cgood idea\u201d when a fan suggested that the game in Washington be held at night when it\u2019s colder, but he also said that decision will be left up to the NHL.\n\n\u201cThe big concern is rain,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the one thing that would make it very difficult.\u201d\n\nStill to be determined are a venue and an opponent. NHL Chief Operating Officer John Collins said the league will consider Nationals Park, RFK Stadium and FedEx Field. Leonsis would prefer to rule out FedEx Field, which is located outside the city in Landover, Md.\n\n\u201cI think it should be in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Leonsis said.\n\nThere have been suggestions that the game be played on the National Mall between the U.S. Capitol and the Washington Monument, but the Capitals say there are too many logistical hurdles to make it a feasible venue.\n\nThe decision to play the game in Washington reinforces the city\u2019s recent emergence on the national hockey scene. The Capitals have become a perennial playoff contender with three-time league MVP Alex Ovechkin, and they\u2019ve sold out 181 consecutive games. Collins also noted the strong D.C. fan contingent that made the trip to Pittsburgh for the 2011 Classic.\n\n\u201cOne thing I did learn from that game,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that Pittsburgh fans and the Caps fans agree on \u2014 and that\u2019s how much they hate Philadelphia.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nationals Park, RFK Stadium and FedEx Field are the candidates to host the Winter Classic when the NHL's annual New Year's Day outdoor game comes to the nation's capital in 2015.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Nationals Park, RFK Stadium and FedEx Field are the candidates to host the Winter Classic when the NHL\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Day outdoor game comes to the nation\u2019s capital in 2015.", "title": "D.C. to host 2015 Winter Classic at venue to be determined", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/21/dc-host-2015-winter-classic-venue-be-determined/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/21/ap11010108007.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/09/21/ap11010108007.jpg", "description": "Nationals Park, RFK Stadium and FedEx Field are the candidates to host the Winter Classic when the NHL's annual New Year's Day outdoor game comes to the nation's capital in 2015.", "card": "summary", "title": "D.C. to host 2015 Winter Classic at venue to be determined"}, "Author": "Joseph White", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Ted Leonsis"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNow what I start to worry about is, I hope it\u2019s cold enough, right?\u201d Washington Capitals owner Ted Leonsis said.\nLeonsis announced Saturday that the Capitals will host the NHL\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s Day outdoor game in 2015.\nThe Capitals were the visiting team in Pittsburgh for the 2011 Winter Classic, which was postponed several hours because of rain.\nCollins also noted the strong D.C. fan contingent that made the trip to Pittsburgh for the 2011 Classic.\nThe Winter Classic is moving south of the Mason-Dixon Line, which means it\u2019s time to check the forecast."}
