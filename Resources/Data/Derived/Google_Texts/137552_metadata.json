Today the Stonewall Inn is known for being \u201cwhere pride began.\u201d\u201cWe mark 45 years since the patrons of the Stonewall Inn defied an unjust policy and awakened a nascent movement, let us honor every brave leader who stood up, sat in, and came out, as well as the allies who supported them along the way. Following their example, let each of us speak for tolerance, justice, and dignity \u2014 because if hearts and minds continue to change over time, laws will too,\u201d President Barack Obama announced in his 2014 acknowledgement of LGBT Pride Month.Throughout his two terms, President Obama has made several efforts to support the LGBT community.In 2011, President Obama signed a repeal of the \u2018Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell Law,\u201d which prohibited LGBT individuals in uniform from making their sexual orientation known.Additionally, the President has taken steps to expand the LGBT community\u2019s health care rights via the Affordable Care Act, hospital visitation rights, and global recognition. In 2008, President Obama told Saddleback Church that \u201cI believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, for me as a Christian \u2013 for me \u2013 for me as a Christian, it is also a sacred union\u2026 I am not somebody who promotes same-sex marriage.\u201dHowever, President Obama\u2019s seemingly staunch support of LGBT rights suggests that his view has, as he said later in 2008 \u201cevolved.\u201d\u201cWe continue to extend family and spousal benefits to legally married same-sex couples,\u201d announced President Obama in his most recent May 2015 acknowledgement of LGBT Pride Month.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "lgbt pride, gay pride", "pubdate": "2015-06-05T15:06:59", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "On May 29th, 2015, President Barack Obama declared June LGBT Pride Month.", "title": "Why Did Obama Declare June LGBT Pride Month?", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/lgbt-pride-gay-pride/2015/06/05/id/649050/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/lgbt-pride-gay-pride/2015/06/05/id/649050/", "title": "Why Did Obama Declare June LGBT Pride Month?", "description": "On May 29th, 2015, President Barack Obama declared June LGBT Pride Month.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1433516819, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "lgbt pride, gay pride", "article": {"section": "FastFeatures", "published_time": "2015-06-05T15:06:59"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/lgbt-pride-gay-pride/2015/06/05/id/649050/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "On May 29th, 2015, President Barack Obama declared June LGBT Pride Month."}, "article_summary": "On May 29th, 2015, President Barack Obama declared June LGBT Pride Month.\nIn 2008, President Obama told Saddleback Church that \u201cI believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.\nTell Us:Should the States or the Federal Government Decide the Legality of Gay Marriage?\nVote Now:Should Gay Marriage Be Legal in All 50 States?\nVote Now:Was the Supreme Court Right to Strike Down the Defense of Marriage Act?"}
