“Enough already!” Bob Beauprez shouts out as his two granddaughters douse him — rather slowly — in the latest rendition of the Ice Bucket Challenge to raise awareness and money to fight amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.

In the Youtube video posted Sunday, Beauprez made a pitch for donations before challenging his GOP mates on the November ticket, attorney general nominee Cynthia Coffman, secretary of state candidate Wayne Williams and Rep. Cory Gardner, who faces incumbent Sen. Mark Udall in a race that could determine control of the legislative branch of the federal government.

Incumbent Gov. John Hickenlooper took the ice water plunge earlier in the week, allowing Colin St. John, who challenged the governor, to do the honors. Hick held on to a rope that clanged a bell, as he took the dousing with a howl, before giving St. John a high handshake.

So who wore the ‘ice bucket’ better?

On his Facebook page, Hickenlooper issued his challenge: “Lt Governor Joe Garcia, Alan Salazar and Tracee Bentley, ready thy buckets!”
