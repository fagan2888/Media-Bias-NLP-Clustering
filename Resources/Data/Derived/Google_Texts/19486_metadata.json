Allen Christensen, R-North Ogden, said he would stay later to hear some of those whose names filled seven pages of would-be speakers.\n\nThose who wish to give written testimony on the Utah Access Plus expansion plan may email their thoughts to This email address is being protected from spambots.

They would see their annual license fees go up around $700.\n\nUtah Access Plus \u2013 put together by GOP Gov. Gary Herbert, his Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox and Republicans leaders in the House and Senate \u2013 the so-called Gang of Six \u2013 will likely go before a special legislative session called by the governor either in October or November.\n\nHerbert, up for re-election next year along with all 75 House members and half of the 29-member Senate, don\u2019t want to let Medicaid expansion dominate the 2016 Legislature like it did the 2015 session before Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah plan died in the House.\n\nEven if Utah Access Plus is voted down by the Legislature, Medicaid expansion won\u2019t go away, warned Senate President Wayne Niederhauser, R-Sandy, who was a surprise guest when he walked through the House Room 30 doors and sat next to Sen. Brian Shiozawa, R-Cottonwood Heights, as the ER room doctor explained the main points of Utah Access Plus.\n\nYou can read a summary of the Gang of Six\u2019s plan here.\n\nThe controversial \u201cmatrix\u201d showing which health care provider groups would be assessed and how much is found here.\n\nIt\u2019s those proposed special taxes and fees that the medical community objects to.\n\nFormer state senator and lieutenant governor Greg Bell, now head of the Utah Hospital Association, told the task force that hospitals came forward themselves a year ago to talk about a self-approved special tax of up to $25 million if that would help get Medicaid expansion adopted.\n\nBut in close questioning Tuesday by task force co-chair House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R-Taylorsville \u2013 who was also on the Gang of Six \u2013 Bell admitted that his group can\u2019t accept an open-ended \u201crisk\u201d of Medicaid taxes.\n\nThe hospitals \u2013 which could see \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d coming in expansion funding, money now listed as uncompensated care \u2013 would oppose UAP in the Legislature unless that risk is capped at some \u201creasonable\u201d level, said Bell.\n\nMost of the health care community spokespeople said they want Medicaid expansion because they want to help the poor and sick in need.\n\nThey just don\u2019t want to be singled out to pick up the new tax bill.\n\nSeveral Democratic legislators said all this worry and hand-wringing over the expansion cost \u2013 tapped at around $78 million a year by 2021 \u2013 is just nonsense.\n\nGrowing state revenues and the economic benefit to the health community specifically, and the state, in general, of seeing $450 million in Obamacare Medicaid expansion each year will more than pay for the state\u2019s share.\n\nIf not, even a small tax hike can take care of that concern, said Sen. Jim Dabakis, D-Salt Lake.\n\nCriticizing the Republicans for keeping Democrats out of the Gang of Six deliberations, Dabakis said the legislative fiscal analyst tells him increasing the state sales tax by 0.2 percent will bring in an extra $100 million \u2013 more than enough to pay for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cYou keep worrying about unlimited risk\u201d going to the state or going to medical care providers, said Dabakis.\n\n\u201cWhat about the unlimited risk\u201d of the poor and sick who don\u2019t have medical care at all now? He shouted out.\n\n\u201cThis is not hard; we should do it right away.\u201d\n\nNo, warned Jonathan Johnson, who is running against Herbert for the GOP gubernatorial nomination next year.\n\nTwenty years ago federal monies made up $1.5 billion of the state budget. Today it is $3.5 billion, and still growing.\n\nNo longer can Utah afford to take federal money \u2013 tying the state to Washington policies, said Johnson.\n\n\u201cNow you want to take $600 million more\u201d in Obamacare Medicaid expansion \u2013 the 90 percent match over time.\n\n\u201cYou preach we should be self-reliant, but as a state we are more and more dependent on Washington,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nUltimately, Utah will not only be responsible for the 10 percent Medicaid expansion match but more and more down the road when the feds, buried in debt, can\u2019t pay their promised 90 percent share.\n\nMedicaid expansion will become a huge burden on the Utah taxpayer, and it shouldn\u2019t be done, said Johnson.\n\nBut his was the minority opinion in Tuesday\u2019s hearing, as most said expansion should take place \u2013 the only fight left is who to pay for it.\n\nMelinda Turner of Provo walked slowly to the witness table. She said she is one of those who doesn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid today, but would under the expansion.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to have a life again,\u201d she said softly, talking about the health conditions she suffers from and the pain she endures daily.\n\nIf not for help from her parents, and the medical insurance they pay for, \u201cI would be dead.\u201d\n\nAnother woman spoke of the 35,000 \u201crefugee ladies\u201d who come to America and Utah hoping for a better life \u2013 but can\u2019t get on Medicaid as it now stands and suffer health problems so can\u2019t work \u2013 even though they wish to.\n\nKenwyn Derby of Bountiful said she is the wife of an emergency room doctor and wants expansion like do all of the doctors, nurses and medical care professionals she talks to.\n\nBut to place the cost on the medical providers seems odd to her, even underhanded.\n\n\u201cSome wonder if this (new tax) is a cynical ploy to stop Medicaid expansion.\n\nSpread out the cost across the citizenry, she said.\n\n\u201cWe can all afford to pay $15 a year more\u201d for Medicaid expansion.\n\nAt one point, Niederhauser told the task force and audience that they shouldn\u2019t be fooled that voting down UAP will end the Medicaid debate in the Legislature.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t. Someone will be back next year with another proposal, and the next (year) and the next (year),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we find something that works for Utah.\n\n\u201cWe have to deal with it.\u201d\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They came by the hundreds; those who would be taxed under a new Medicaid expansion plan opposing, those advocating for the poor and sick approving.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Bob Bernick", "og": {"url": "http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/7228-lawmakers-consider-new-medicaid-expansion-plan", "site_name": "utahpolicy.com", "image": "http://utahpolicy.com/images/articles/Utah_State_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Lawmakers Consider New Medicaid Expansion Plan"}, "google-site-verification": "lihgswQmNHE4uzDhVlR0Saxekx4JgwwjFYC6fjhIvCM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90f1\"", "article_summary": "They came by the hundreds; those who would be taxed under a new Medicaid expansion plan opposing, those advocating for the poor and sick approving.\nMost of the health care community spokespeople said they want Medicaid expansion because they want to help the poor and sick in need.\n\u201cNow you want to take $600 million more\u201d in Obamacare Medicaid expansion \u2013 the 90 percent match over time.\nMedicaid expansion will become a huge burden on the Utah taxpayer, and it shouldn\u2019t be done, said Johnson.\n\u201cWe can all afford to pay $15 a year more\u201d for Medicaid expansion."}
