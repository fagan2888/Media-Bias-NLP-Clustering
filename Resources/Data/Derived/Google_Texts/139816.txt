Q&A with Daniel McQuillen from the Lahey Hospital & Medical Center: Managing Infections in Transplant Patients







Daniel McQuillen, MD, works in the clinical setting their the medical center's transplant program. He sees all the patients as they're being evaluated; talking about their histories to uncover any possible infection they may have.

"It's amazing to me how few infectious disease complications they have, which I think has to do with the program's use of less intensive immunosuppressants," commented McQuillen.
