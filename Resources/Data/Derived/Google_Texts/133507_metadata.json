For starters, the weather.\n\nAs of Monday, meteorologists were calling for near optimal winter weather \u2014 about 40 degrees with little to no precipitation on Sunday for the Broncos-Seahawks game. But if it does snow, stadium workers will be called in to clear it off the field and seats, then use specialty equipment to melt the tons of snow.\n\n\u201cThe ideal lead time is 18 hours,\u201d said Eric Grubman, executive vice president of the National Football League. \u201cIt could be done in less (time), but it will not take more.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what kind of weather the host committee hoped for, New York Jets owner and committee co-chair Woody Johnson said: \u201cPerfect weather,\u201d adding that he wants some sunshine and snow flurries.\n\nNew York Giants co-chairman Jonathan Tisch expressed more concern for the stadium workers and visitors who would be subjected to the cold conditions. He cautioned fans to dress appropriately for any kind of weather.\n\nSunday\u2019s game is being touted as the first outdoor, cold-weather Super Bowl and if it goes off without a hitch, it could clear the way for sites such as Denver to host a future big game.\n\nSports Authority Field at Mile High, an open-air stadium in a traditionally cold-weather state, could be a contender in the future. Johnson said NFL owners selecting New York/New Jersey broke \u201cthe ice barrier. The game is played in all weather, so why shouldn\u2019t the Super Bowl be played in all weather?\u201d\n\nAsked if cities like Denver had a shot at serving as host, Johnson said, \u201cI would think so. \u2026 I would hope so.\u201d\n\nVisitors and game attendees are encouraged to plan ahead.\n\n\u201cThis is not a game where you can just hop in your car and pull up to the stadium,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cYou need a ticket to the game, but you also need a ticket to the site. \u2026 Don\u2019t show up without a plan and be disappointed.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being the first cold-weather game, the hosts are claiming it to be the first mass-transit Super Bowl.\n\nRoughly 80,000 fans will pack MetLife Stadium in New Jersey and roughly two-thirds of them are expected to arrive via public transportation. Parking is limited and access near the stadium is restricted. An estimated 45,000-50,000 fans will take the bus to the game and an additional 10,000-12,000 people will take the subway, Kelly said.\n\nThe host committee has also learned from recent lessons of the past \u2014 including prepping for and working to prevent a repeat of last year\u2019s blackout in New Orleans. The stadium was inspected repeatedly to avoid this situation, Kelly said.\n\nFor the fans who want a piece of the action, but can\u2019t afford to shell out extra cash for a seat to the game, they can head to Times Square where a large outdoor \u201cfanfest\u201d area has been created and dubbed Super Bowl Boulevard. It\u2019s free and open to the public with various events taking place each day.\n\nBianca Prieto: bprieto@digitalfirstmedia.com, twitter.com/biancamprieto", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Super Bowl week gets underway: N.Y./N.J. to see some 400,000 tourists", "title": "Super Bowl week gets underway: N.Y./N.J. to see some 400,000 tourists", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/27/super-bowl-week-gets-underway-n-y-n-j-to-see-some-400000-tourists/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140127__SuperBowlBlvd012714p1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140127__SuperBowlBlvd012714p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-27T11:46:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T04:43:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Super Bowl 2016"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s been an amazing journey,\u201d Al Kelly, president of the Super Bowl host committee, said at a news conference here.\nNEW YORK \u2014 Super Bowl week has officially kicked off \u2014 culminating four years of planning and work by the New York/New Jersey host committee.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome\u201d Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\u201cThis is not a game where you can just hop in your car and pull up to the stadium,\u201d Kelly said.\nThe host committee has also learned from recent lessons of the past \u2014 including prepping for and working to prevent a repeat of last year\u2019s blackout in New Orleans."}
