Jefferson is investing $20 million to open two urgent-care centers, including one three blocks from the existing ER, to treat patients with routine medical needs, and build a program to allow physicians to perform consultations using video apps so that other patients never have to leave home. \u201cThe best way to save the system lots of money is to keep them out of the hospital,\u201d Klasko says.\n\nHospitals account for a third of the $2.9 trillion annual U.S. health-care bill. Academic medical centers such as Jefferson, which has almost 1,000 beds and $2.1 billion in operating revenue, are among the most expensive places to get care because they\u2019re equipped to handle the most complex cases. The Affordable Care Act, combined with pressure from employers to tamp down health-care costs, is nudging providers to treat people in the lowest-cost settings possible. That approach, doctors and economists agree, is better for patients and is essential for controlling medical spending in the U.S., which is higher than anywhere else in the world. It isn\u2019t, however, great for hospitals. Insurers and the government pay medical providers mostly by volume: More tests, fancier treatments, and longer hospital stays mean more revenue. That\u2019s why many hospitals are adding capacity. Two miles west of Jefferson, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania is planning a new tower to accommodate more patients.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act included incentives to help move patients away from costly hospital stays. The law created a payment model that allows Medicare providers to qualify for a share of the savings if they can reduce overall health-care costs in their areas. The question for hospitals such as Jefferson is whether getting paid for producing better results can make up for the revenue they lose by seeing fewer people. \u201cCan you create a situation ultimately where you\u2019re treating fewer people in the hospital and doing fewer higher-reimbursement treatments? That\u2019s a real risk,\u201d says Dan Steingart, a health-care analyst for Moody\u2019s. \u201cIf your contracts only pay you on a pure fee-for-service basis, you\u2019re basically shooting yourself in the foot.\u201d\n\nKlasko, who came to Jefferson in 2013 from University of South Florida Health, is betting insurers will increasingly follow Medicare\u2019s lead. \u201cIf that transition happens in two years, then we look like geniuses,\u201d says Judd Hollander, an emergency doctor who\u2019s helping develop Jefferson\u2019s push into virtual medicine, which involves more than 100 employees so far. \u201cIf that transition happens in 30 years, we don\u2019t quite look like geniuses.\u201d\n\nThe hospital began experimenting with video apps last fall. One afternoon in January, staff crowded around an iPad in Ellen Louka\u2019s hospital room, briefing her daughter, who was at work, via video chat about the progress Louka was making after her hip replacement. The surgeon held an X-ray up to the camera and explained that the 79-year-old could bear weight on her new hip right away. \u201cJefferson believes that it\u2019s worth doing, even though it\u2019s not reimbursed,\u201d says Sang Hoon Woo, a doctor who leads residents on such virtual rounds.\n\nSoon, hospital staff will use the same technology to coordinate with primary-care physicians when patients go home. Eventually, doctors at Jefferson plan to have a \u201cvirtual emergency department\u201d to remotely triage many of the 119,000 people who visit its ER every year. Physicians will be able to use a video connection to assess whether someone with chest pains should rush to the hospital, get checked out at an urgent-care center, or simply call her regular doctor. People with minor ailments such as the flu could get a video consult. Hollander says the goal is to make sure everyone in the emergency room really needs to be there. The real sign of success, he says, will be \u201cwhen the ERs start closing.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: A hospital is investing in virtual medical service, a bet that insurers will begin paying for quality instead of quantity.\n\nThis story appeared in the print edition of Bloomberg Businessweek.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John Tozzi", "description": "It's\u00a0investing in virtual medical service, a wager\u00a0that insurers will begin paying for quality instead of quantity.", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iVXItVVUC7c8/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "It's\u00a0investing in virtual medical service, a wager\u00a0that insurers will begin paying for quality instead of quantity.", "title": "A Philadelphia Hospital Makes a Bet on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-01-26/a-philadelphia-hospital-makes-a-bet-on-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iVXItVVUC7c8/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's\u00a0investing in virtual medical service, a wager\u00a0that insurers will begin paying for quality instead of quantity.", "title": "A Philadelphia Hospital Makes a Bet on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-01-26/a-philadelphia-hospital-makes-a-bet-on-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iVXItVVUC7c8/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "It's\u00a0investing in virtual medical service, a wager\u00a0that insurers will begin paying for quality instead of quantity."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "A Philadelphia Hospital Makes a Bet on Obamacare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NISJ226KLVR901", "parsely-author": "John Tozzi", "parsely-section": "politics", "date": "2015-01-26T15:30:02.261Z", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-01-26T15:30:02.261Z", "parsely-tags": "Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-01-26/a-philadelphia-hospital-makes-a-bet-on-obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27d6\"", "article_summary": "Steve Klasko, the chief executive officer of Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, wants to see fewer patients walking into his emergency room.\nTwo miles west of Jefferson, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania is planning a new tower to accommodate more patients.\n\u201cCan you create a situation ultimately where you\u2019re treating fewer people in the hospital and doing fewer higher-reimbursement treatments?\n\u201cThe best way to save the system lots of money is to keep them out of the hospital,\u201d Klasko says.\nThe real sign of success, he says, will be \u201cwhen the ERs start closing.\u201dThe bottom line: A hospital is investing in virtual medical service, a bet that insurers will begin paying for quality instead of quantity."}
