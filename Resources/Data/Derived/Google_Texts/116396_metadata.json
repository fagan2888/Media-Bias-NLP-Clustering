To deal with claim A: the clause begins by saying that \u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives,\u201d and appropriations or spending bills fall outside the category \u201cbills for raising revenue.\u201d They don\u2019t raise revenue; they spend it.\n\nAs for claim B, the clause continues after a semicolon: \u201cbut the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\u201d So even if Andy were right and I wrong about claim A\u2014that is, if the origination clause encompassed an entire category of \u201cmoney bills\u201d that included taxing and spending legislation\u2014it would nevertheless be constitutionally permissible for the Senate, when it \u201cgoes second\u201d on consideration of a bill, to add new spending by way of amendment. A program entirely unfunded by a House-originated bill can legitimately be funded by the Senate\u2019s version, with whatever final outcome the two houses can come to terms about (and get a president to sign).\n\nIn his latest article, Andy has omitted any further defense of claim B, and has instead dug in on claim A, that a larger genus of \u201cmoney bills\u201d that includes the two species of taxes and spending was intended by the clause to be exclusively the province of the House to originate. Andy is right to note that at the Philadelphia convention, there are repeated references to \u201cmoney bills\u201d nearly every time some draft version of the clause is under consideration. (The course of those debates can be seen here.) But the view that all tax and appropriations bills must originate in the House, and the further view that the Senate should not even be able to amend them, were distinctly in the minority at Philadelphia. Elbridge Gerry, who is Andy\u2019s hero in this tale, kept banging on these issues every chance he got for weeks on end, and all he got was one quarter of his objective. That is, he got no limit on the Senate\u2019s power to amend, and got only tax bills and not spending bills into the text of the clause finally written.\n\nNot only does the parliamentarian of the House of Representatives itself take my view of the matter, so does one of the sources on which Andy relies in his latest. (I leave aside the Annenberg Institute for Civics, a carelessly and anonymously written source, as no help at all.) Andy quotes the opening line of the entry on the origination clause in the Heritage Guide to the Constitution, by Professor Erik Jensen of Case Western\u2019s law school, but he should have read further. Jensen writes:\n\nThe final version of the clause was much weaker than the form proposed by Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, which would have required all \u201cmoney bills\u201d (including appropriations) to originate in the House and would have given the Senate no power to amend. Gerry feared that the Senate would become an aristocratic body because of its small size, its selection by legislatures rather than by election, and its six-year term of office. \u201cIt was a maxim,\u201d he said, \u201cthat the people ought to hold the purse-strings.\u201d\n\nThe strongest proponents of national power opposed the clause in any form. As James Wilson of Pennsylvania explained at the Convention, \u201cIf both branches were to say yes or no, it was of little consequence which should say yes or no first.\u201d What survived the contentious debates was closer to Wilson\u2019s vision than to Gerry\u2019s. The clause was restricted to bills for raising revenue, and the Senate was given the amendment power (which, Gerry thought, gutted the provision of any real effect).\n\nIt is noteworthy that Elbridge Gerry refused to sign the Constitution at the close of the convention (one of just three delegates present to the end who so declined). I doubt the origination clause\u2019s \u201cgutting\u201d is solely what pushed him over into the refusenik camp. But he lost a lot of arguments, and this was one of them.
