On Tuesday, the Supreme Court announced that it had denied the appeal, known as a petition for certiorari.\n\nWinter reported that the notebook, which Holmes mailed to his psychiatrist just before the deadly attack on the Century Aurora 16 movie theater in July 2012, contained violent drawings and plans. She cited unnamed law enforcement sources in her report.\n\nBecause Winter is based in New York, courts in two states had to approve her subpoena. After the trial court in Colorado did so, the highest court in New York ultimately blocked the subpoena there because it said Winter was protected under the state\u2019s shield law for journalists.\n\nIn a statement issued after Tuesday\u2019s ruling, Fox News said the decision was an important victory for journalists\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of free speech today,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThe Court made it clear that Jana Winter can never be compelled to testify in Colorado, and that all New York-based journalists and media companies can rely on New York\u2019s strong shield law when they are covering news across the country.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s ruling clears up one more outstanding issue that could have further delayed the trial, which is currently scheduled to start in October with jury selection.\n\nHolmes faces 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other offenses and could be sentenced to death if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fox News reporter Jana Winter won\u2019t have to testify about notebook in theater shooting case", "title": "Fox News reporter Jana Winter won\u2019t have to testify about notebook in theater shooting case", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/27/fox-news-reporter-jana-winter-wont-have-to-testify-about-notebook-in-theater-shooting-case/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-27T08:39:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T08:39:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce46b\"", "article_summary": "Lawyers for James Holmes had appealed a New York court order shielding Jana Winter from testifying about her sources.\nOn Tuesday, the Supreme Court announced that it had denied the appeal, known as a petition for certiorari.\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of free speech today,\u201d the statement reads.\nThe Fox News reporter who wrote about the Aurora movie theater gunman\u2019s notebook won\u2019t have to testify about how she learned about the crucial document because the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal on the matter.\nBecause Winter is based in New York, courts in two states had to approve her subpoena."}
