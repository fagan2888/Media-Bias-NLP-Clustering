No-one wants to be that gift-giver.

You know the type. The one who hears, through a friend of a friend of a friend, that you're into books, or movies, and instead of accounting for popularity or your particular taste, gleefully hands you a Dean Koontz novel or a DVD of “Ishtar.”

"Why, yes! This is exactly what I wanted," you exclaim – dreading the line at the returns counter and masking your distaste with a stretched smile that would make a used car salesman shift uncomfortably in his seat.

Gamers have it the worst. If you know nothing about the gaming industry, it's all too easy to be overwhelmed by the misleading advertising, the multitude of platforms to take into account and the sheer amount of poor software on the market. Going in blind, you stand a very high chance of buying your gift's recipient an absolute lemon of a game.

So don't go in blind. This year's list of best-selling video games boasts a surprisingly well-rounded array of titles, each with its own merits and solid reviews. There's the visceral zombie-themed epic The Last of Us, the anachronistic dystopian shooter Bioshock Infinite, and of course, the record-breaking Grand Theft Auto V. All have racked up sales in the millions, and that’s no accident.
