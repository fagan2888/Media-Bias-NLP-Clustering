More details about what the ACA means for you.\n\nThe ARAG Legal Plan is open for enrollment. There will be no rate changes and the plan is very affordable, with a monthly cost of $10 to $15, depending on the eligible family members you choose to cover.\n\nWhile there aren\u2019t major benefits changes in store for 2016, there will be some changes, including a few benefits enhancements.
