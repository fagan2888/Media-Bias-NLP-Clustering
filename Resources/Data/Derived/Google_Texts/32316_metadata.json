A presidential panel today recommended a complete overhaul of virtually every tax law for individuals and businesses.

Because Washington, D.C., will celebrate Emancipation Day on April 15, taxpayers were given an extra three days to file.\n\nAnd while more taxpayers are filing by themselves and using electronic filing services like Intuit TurboTax than ever before, tax experts say many who prepare their own taxes may be paying more than they should by missing credits or deductions.\n\n\u201cOften times, filers may not know they qualify for something,\u201d said Susan Renzo, enrolled agent with the IRS and a master tax adviser with H&R Block in the Town of Poughkeepsie. \u201cPeople tend to self-edit. They don\u2019t take all the things they are entitled to into consideration when they do it themselves. By asking a few questions, I can pull it out of them.\u201d\n\nAnd the fastest way to get a refund, according to the Internal Revenue Service, is to e-file and choose direct deposit.\n\nTaxpayers can prepare and e-file their federal tax returns online for free through Free File at IRS.gov. The site features a number of tips about selecting a preparer.\n\nBut, there\u2019s much more to consider before April 18 arrives.\n\nFiling yourself vs. with an expert\n\nSmartphones are making e-filing easier and more convenient than ever. Forty percent of TurboTax customers used mobile devices in some way last year to file their taxes, nine times more than the year before, according to the online tax filing service. Using TurboTax\u2019s app, customers can now take a picture of their W2s on their smartphones and upload the information to their online tax form.\n\nBut while filing your taxes on your smartphone can be convenient, some taxpayers who have more intricate variables on their return prefer to use a tax professional.\n\nPoughkeepsie resident Warren Buhler, 71, says using an expert just makes the process easier.\n\n\u201cMy stuff is a little complicated, so I file with a professional,\u201d he said. \u201cI have done that since way back when I had a corporation that involved five partners \u2026 I found it is much easier to have a professional go through it all.\u201d\n\nThe IRS expects to issue more than nine out of 10 refunds within 21 days. By 2018, the IRSanticipates that 159,761,200 income tax return filers will file their taxes electronically, with an average annual increase of 2.5 percent between the years of 2011 and 2018. Meanwhile, paper filing will decrease from 93,776,300, with an average annual decrease of 1.3 percent between 2011 and 2018. These taxpayers will use a variety of software products to prepare and e-file their own returns, according to the IRS.\n\nItemize vs. standard deduction\n\nWhile more income tax filers use standard deductions than itemized, there are benefits to itemizing, experts say.\n\nThe itemized deduction allows taxpayers to deduct very specific expenses, including medical expenses, home mortgage interest, real estate and personal property taxes and charitable contributions.\n\nTax return experts say filers should choose the tax form that allows them to pay the lower amount of tax. The form that results in the higher deduction amount often gives the most benefit. But, despite qualifying for it, the majority choose a standard deduction instead of itemized, Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and tax expert for TurboTax, said.\n\nOne reason might be that many people think they make too little to qualify for an itemized deduction, she said.\n\n\u201cThe lowest a person can apply for an itemized deduction is $6,300 and $12,600 per joint return,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMost people underestimate their expenses,\u201d Greene-Lewis said. \u201cThey shortchange themselves. By keeping an accurate record and bringing those records in when they file, they are almost guaranteed a bigger refund.\u201d\n\nHyde Park resident Donald Carson, 76, said he has been doing his taxes with the same professional for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cThe biggest advice I could give to anyone filing their taxes is to keep records,\u201d Carson said. \u201cIf you keep good records, you can get through it very quickly. Many places, if you make donations to churches and so forth, they have to give you a (receipt) by law.\u201d\n\nCredits! Credits! Credits!\n\n\u201cWhile deductions reduce taxable income, tax credits reduce a taxpayer's tax liability directly,\u201d Tracey Niemotko, a CPA and chair of the School of Business and professor of accounting at Mount Saint Mary College, said.\n\nTwelve percent of American workers with annual household incomes of less than $50,000 are aware of the Savers Credit, according to data collected by TurboTax.\n\nDepending on your adjusted gross income and tax filing status, you can claim the credit for 50 percent, 20 percent or 10 percent of the first $2,000 you contribute during the year to a retirement account. Therefore, the maximum credit amounts that can be claimed are $1,000, $400 or $200. The biggest credit amount a married couple filing jointly can claim together is $2,000, Greene-Lewis said.\n\nMeanwhile, only one out of every five people that are eligible claims their Earned Income Tax Credit, a uniform credit that varies each year, Greene-Lewis said.\n\nStudents may be eligible to benefit from either the American Opportunity Tax Credit or the Lifetime Learning Credit if they or their families meet the income requirements and have qualified student expenses,\u201d Niemotko said.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nThe penalty for not having health insurance has tripled.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have health insurance in 2014, and didn\u2019t qualify for an exception to the penalty, you may have paid $95 per person or 1 percent of your household income, whichever is greater.\n\nThis year when you file your taxes, you can pay $325 per person, or 2 percent of your household income, whichever is greater. That can really add up for a middle-class family of four.\n\nBut, there are some exemptions from the requirement that taxpayers may not know about, experts say.\n\n\u201cThere are over 30 exemptions,\" Renzo said. \"One of the most common ones is income level. If you make $10,300 or less and file single and $20,600 and file joint, you are exempt from the penalty.\"\n\nRefunds on past taxes\n\nAnother benefit of using a tax professional is services like \u201cSecond Look\u201d from H&R Block.\n\nFrom now until the deadline, people can bring in their returns from the past four years (until 2012) to H&R Block so tax professionals can find any additional refunds that previously went unclaimed.\n\n\"Sometimes it's a very substantial amount of money,\" Renzo said.\n\nDeclining to file\n\nIf you don\u2019t file your taxes you could face penalties. But, experts say, more often non-filers miss out on some substantial refunds.\n\nThe IRS averages that 75 percent of income tax filers receive a refund, and the average refund is about $2,800. Nearly one million tax returns go unfiled and the average unclaimed refund is $700.\n\n\u201cSome people think that they dodged a bullet with the (IRS) if they do not file,\u201d Renzo said. \u201cBut, I run into more people that would have gotten refunds from the IRS.\"\n\nAmanda J.

Here are tips for each generation:\n\nMillennials\n\nIf you had a friend or significant other stay with you in 2015, you may qualify for a deduction in income taxes, Lisa Greene-Lewis, CPA and tax expert for TurboTax, said.\n\n\u201cIf that significant other or friend stayed with you the entire year, you would be able to claim a deduction for them if they made less than $4,000 in income,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's pretty common and a lot of people don\u2019t realize that.\u201d\n\nRecent college graduates should also check with their parents to make sure they are not listed as dependents on their parents\u2019 tax forms, Greene-Lewis said.\n\n\u201cStudents that work but make under the IRS filing threshold of $10,300 may not think to file their taxes,\u201d Greene-Lewis said. \u201cBut if they have federal taxes taken out, and are eligible for credits, like earned income tax credit or education credit, they could still get a refund. Of the nearly one million unclaimed refunds each year, a big portion of them are people think they don\u2019t make enough money to file their taxes.\u201d\n\nIf you searched or moved for a job in 2015, you may be able to deduct those expenses.\n\nGen-Xers\n\nThere's an extra $350 awaiting you if you have a child under age 17 and are income eligible in New York State. It\u2019s the second year of a three-year program that provides a $350 rebate to New Yorkers with children, called the \"Family Tax Relief Credit.\" In 2014, the rebates were sent out as checks in the mail. This year and in 2017, the money is a credit when people file their 2015 income taxes.\n\nAny money you contribute results in a tax deduction for the current year, which reduces your taxable income. For 2015, the 401(k) max is $18,000 for 2015, up $1,500 from 2014. The IRA contribution limit remains at $5,500 for 2015.\n\nBaby Boomers\n\nFor boomers, filing their adult child\u2019s status on their income tax return might be a bit tricky.\n\n\u201cMany people I talk to are surprised to find that they no longer qualify for a child tax credit when their child turns 17,\u201d Renzo said. \u201cBut you may be able to claim that child as a dependent if they lived with you for the year.\u201d\n\nIf you have appreciated investments in a taxable account, you can get a double tax break by donating the asset directly to a qualified charity.\n\nIf a taxpayer takes out money from their retirement account early, they could be taxed on the withdrawal amount and incur an additional 10 percent tax on the amount they took out.\n\nThe standard deduction amount is higher for those who are age 65 or older.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://pojonews.co/1Rdq8iS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Higher health insurance penalty for 2015If you didn\u2019t have health insurance in 2014, and didn\u2019t qualify for an exception to the penalty, the consequences weren\u2019t so bad.", "og": {"site_name": "The Poughkeepsie Journal", "description": "Higher health insurance penalty for 2015If you didn\u2019t have health insurance in 2014, and didn\u2019t qualify for an exception to the penalty, the consequences weren\u2019t so bad.", "title": "To e-file or not to e-file: Tips, tricks and tools for tax season", "url": "http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/money/2016/03/20/e-file-not-e-file-tips-tricks-and-tools-tax-season/81582740/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/poughkeepsiejournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Higher health insurance penalty for 2015If you didn\u2019t have health insurance in 2014, and didn\u2019t qualify for an exception to the penalty, the consequences weren\u2019t so bad.", "title": "To e-file or not to e-file: Tips, tricks and tools for tax season", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6472b9ebe1a2b58bf9521247eab6459cf84ea52f/c=134-0-667-533&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Poughkeepsie/2014/02/27/taxforms.jpg", "creator": "@pokjournal", "site": "@pokjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=820459961", "fb": {"app_id": 179935365368749}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/amanda.j.purcell.9"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "The IRS averages that 75 percent of income tax filers receive a refund, and the average refund is about $2,800.\nTax return experts say filers should choose the tax form that allows them to pay the lower amount of tax.\n\u201cMany people I talk to are surprised to find that they no longer qualify for a child tax credit when their child turns 17,\u201d Renzo said.\n\u201cWhile deductions reduce taxable income, tax credits reduce a taxpayer's tax liability directly,\u201d Tracey Niemotko, a CPA and chair of the School of Business and professor of accounting at Mount Saint Mary College, said.\nItemize vs. standard deductionWhile more income tax filers use standard deductions than itemized, there are benefits to itemizing, experts say."}
