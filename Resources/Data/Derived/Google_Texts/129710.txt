The WATC Foundation can help star students at the college pay for their education, setting them up to land a job in the Air Capital.

In the hangar at WATC's campus, students learn aviation maintenance. It's one of many courses geared to prepare students for the industry.

"The industry is doing great, so it's great to get students in the pipeline, give them an opportunity to get their courses paid for and get out there and get a job," said Andy McFayden, WATC's Director of Marketing & Community Outreach.

The College's Foundation provides scholarships for students who have a good chance at landing a job in aviation. During a typical year, the foundation provides financial support to more than five students.

"We work really hard with the community and the employers in the area to offer programs that are relevant where there are jobs in the current industry," said McFayden.

A $500 donation from our KAKEland Cares partners, the DeVaugn James Injury Lawyers will go directly to help with a student's tuition.
