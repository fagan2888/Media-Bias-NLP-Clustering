Hospice officials said both companies are in good financial shape.\n\nHowever, over the past several years, Medicare has cut hospice reimbursement, leading to financial challenges at most hospices.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act of 2010, hospice providers are having their rates cut 12 percent through 2020. These cuts are on top of a 4.2 percent rate cut that began in 2010 and will be phased in over seven years.\n\nIn a recent study, Medicare cuts are expected to reduce hospice provider margins that averaged 2 percent in 2008 to a -14 percent margin by 2019, said the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization.\n\nUnder the new, yet unnamed unified organization, Robert Cahill, who has led HOM the past several years, will become CEO. Gloria Brooks, current president of Arbor Hospice, will become vice president and chief strategy officer of HOM. She will continue as president of Arbor Hospital and the Arbor Hospice Foundation.\n\n\u201cArbor is excited to form an affiliation with HOM that aligns our missions and allows us to share best practices to better serve our patients and families,\u201d Brooks said in a statement.\n\nCahill added in a statement: \u201cWe are both financially sound organizations and are making this affiliation from a position of strength. This new affiliation will allow both of us to enjoy the financial benefits of being part of a larger organization without sacrificing our names, brands and legacies.\u201d\n\nUnder the affiliation agreement, Arbor and HOM will continue as independent nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations and operate under their respective names. Arbor will continue to serve patients throughout Washtenaw County and its current service area out of its Ann Arbor office and HOM will continue to serve patients throughout Michigan.\n\nEarlier this year, Arbor Hospice announced expanded services in Washtenaw and Wayne counties through new affiliations with Glacier Hills Retirement Community and C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital, both in Ann Arbor, and Henry Ford Village in Dearborn.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The nonprofit providers will create the state's largest hospice organization with the affiliation, which allows both to retain their own names.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "The nonprofit providers will create the state's largest hospice organization with the affiliation, which allows both to retain their own names.", "title": "Hospice of Michigan, Arbor Hospice announce affiliation agreement", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20151203/NEWS/151209933/hospice-of-michigan-arbor-hospice-announce-affiliation-agreement", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/Assets/rwd/C-Block_RWD.png?v=201503291736", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Mergers and acquisitions", "published_time": "2015-12-03T11:30:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-06T09:48:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "article_summary": "Hospice of Michigan, Arbor Hospice announce affiliation agreementHospice of Michigan and Arbor Hospice & Palliative Care announced they will join in an affiliation Jan. 1 that will create Michigan\u2019s largest hospice provider.\nJointly, Detroit-based Hospice of Michigan and Ann Arbor-based Arbor Hospice care for more than 2,200 patients in 58 counties in the state.\nEarlier this year, Arbor Hospice announced expanded services in Washtenaw and Wayne counties through new affiliations with Glacier Hills Retirement Community and C.S.\nArbor will continue to serve patients throughout Washtenaw County and its current service area out of its Ann Arbor office and HOM will continue to serve patients throughout Michigan.\nShe will continue as president of Arbor Hospital and the Arbor Hospice Foundation."}
