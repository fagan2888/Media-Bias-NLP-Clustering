Biden Jr.\n\nAn interesting debate is percolating in the evaluation of our federal antipoverty programs. President Obama\u2019s recent emphasis on the problem of high inequality and low upward mobility has forced conservatives to join that debate, and they\u2019ve developed a meme that, at the risk of straining the metaphor, goes like this:\n\nOur current spate of anti-poverty programs operate more like a hammock than a safety net when what we really need is a trampoline.\n\nToday's Economist Perspectives from expert contributors.\n\nAs Representative Paul Ryan, who has been hacking at the safety net for years, put it just the other day (before misrepresenting a fictional story as an actual anecdote against nutritional support), the \u201cleft\u201d is \u201coffering people is a full stomach and an empty soul.\u201d\n\nIn economic terms, it\u2019s pitting consumption against investment. The right is saying that the left focuses on poor people\u2019s consumption while neglecting to invest in their future. Broadly speaking, consumption gets you through today; investment sets you up for a better tomorrow. Representative Ryan might say that consumption is for the stomach; investment is for the soul.\n\nI should start by pointing out that I\u2019ve heard this argument only from people whose personal consumption is unconstrained by the inability to meet their family budget and more. But put that aside. I suspect it\u2019s a resonant argument to many and a potentially challenging one to the status quo.\n\nThere are, however, two big problems with it. First, it presumes that those who set up this dichotomy have a robust investment plan, though they do not. But more interestingly, a spate of recent research shows that it\u2019s wrong on the merits. A lot of what you\u2019d mistake for consumption really works like investment: Yes, it fills the stomach today, but it\u2019s also linked to better outcomes tomorrow.\n\nPhoto\n\nStart with a program that literally does fill the stomach: food stamps, now called SNAP, for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. A recent study took advantage of the fact that the program gradually expanded across the country starting in the 1960s, creating a natural experiment wherein researchers could compare child outcomes conditional on food stamp receipt by tapping variation between counties that adopted or expanded the program at different times. The chart highlights the findings.\n\nWhen poor, pregnant women and their young children had access to food stamps, those children had better health and economic outcomes as adults than did children born at the same time but in neighboring counties that did not yet offer such nutritional support. The authors find that as adults, children exposed to the program (starting in utero) experienced lower rates of \u201cmetabolic syndrome\u201d (obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes) and, for women, were more economically self-sufficient in that they were more likely to graduate high school, find work and avoid poverty (meaning they were also less likely to collect public benefits themselves).\n\nIncome supplements, like the earned-income tax credit or child tax credit, seem like classic near-term consumption boosters, yet they too have been found to have impacts that last into adulthood for children whose families receive them. By following children whose families received these benefits and comparing their outcomes with similarly-situated children whose families did not get them (or got less), numerous researchers have found lasting outcomes here as well.\n\nAs my Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) colleagues point out, one careful study found that children in low-income families that received an additional $3,000 of annual income (in 2005 dollars) betw\u200been the children\u2019s prenatal year and fifth birthday earned an average of 17 percent more and worked 135 hours more annually as adults, compared with similar children whose families did not receive the added income.\n\nOther rigorous studies found similar results relating income support to higher test scores in reading and math, which are themselves correlated with better employment and earnings later in life.\n\nHousing assistance is also found to have positive, lasting investment-type impacts, especially when compared with the damage to children who experience homelessness, overcrowding and frequent moves that involve changing school systems. According to CBPP, low-income families with housing vouchers \u201cwere 74 percent less likely to become homeless, 48 percent less likely to live in overcrowded housing, and moved fewer times over a five-year period than similar low-income families that didn\u2019t receive housing assistance.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an important way in which this research is particularly germane right now. Part of the conservative attack on the safety net \u2014 which, to be clear, is a setup for forthcoming budgets that are likely to seriously hack away at these programs \u2014 is motivated by what they call the \u201cpoverty trap.\u201d This is the idea that since eligibility for safety-net programs fades with income, beneficiaries suppress their earnings to stay of the rolls.\n\nWhile there\u2019s logic to that claim, careful research finds it to be largely unfounded. That\u2019s probably a function of the fact that most low-income people don\u2019t actually face work disincentives of the magnitude that Mr. Ryan and others claim, as the economist Robert A. Moffitt has shown. But the findings above may also play a role. By dint of these investments, low-income parents have a better platform \u2014 a stable dwelling, food on the table, a wage subsidy \u2014 from which to pursue upward mobility.\n\nThe point is that what Representative Ryan and others are thinking of as a hammock is itself more of a trampoline, at least for some children whose families receive these benefits. More direct investments, like Head Start and Pell grants, are also essential, and recent research supports these programs as well. And as I\u2019ve consistently stressed, the best antipoverty program I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime is a full employment labor market, where strong demand for low-wage workers dramatically increases their employment and earnings.\n\nBut if we want to correctly understand and evaluate the impact of policies currently helping poor families, we need to recognize that often what looks like consumption is actually investment. Both functions are important, for stomachs today and for souls tomorrow.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140310103513, "BN": "economix", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "businessday/economix", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/economix/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 10, 2014", "keywords": "Food Stamps,Poverty,Economix,Today's Economist", "GBLC": "Economix;Today's Economist", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/economix/How Aid to the Poor Is Also an Investment ( 20140310 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jared Bernstein", "SCG": "Economy", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jared Bernstein", "byl": "Jared Bernstein", "twitter": {"description": "Aid to the poor may seem like classic near-term consumption boosters, yet they have have impacts that last into adulthood for children whose families receive them, an economist writes.", "title": "How Aid to the Poor Is Also an Investment", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/how-aid-to-the-poor-is-also-an-investment/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@nyteconomix", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002759718, "description": "Aid to the poor may seem like classic near-term consumption boosters, yet they have have impacts that last into adulthood for children whose families receive them, an economist writes.", "CG": "Business Day", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 10, 2014", "article": {"section": "Business Day", "tag": "Today's Economist", "published_time": 1394462113, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T14:35:13-04:00"}, "utime": 20140310143513, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140310, "pdate": 20140310, "des": "Food Stamps;Poverty", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Economix Blog", "description": "Aid to the poor may seem like classic near-term consumption boosters, yet they have have impacts that last into adulthood for children whose families receive them, an economist writes.", "title": "How Aid to the Poor Is Also an Investment", "url": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/how-aid-to-the-poor-is-also-an-investment/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/how-aid-to-the-poor-is-also-an-investment/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "How Aid to the Poor Is Also an Investment", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "But if we want to correctly understand and evaluate the impact of policies currently helping poor families, we need to recognize that often what looks like consumption is actually investment.\nA lot of what you\u2019d mistake for consumption really works like investment: Yes, it fills the stomach today, but it\u2019s also linked to better outcomes tomorrow.\nThe right is saying that the left focuses on poor people\u2019s consumption while neglecting to invest in their future.\nBroadly speaking, consumption gets you through today; investment sets you up for a better tomorrow.\nRepresentative Ryan might say that consumption is for the stomach; investment is for the soul."}
