CGehlen, CC by 2.0\n\nA new report suggests infectious disease preparation is inadequate in 28 states, with rising heroin use contributing to the problem. The report, Outbreaks: Protecting Americans from Infectious Diseases, ranked Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, and Utah in the lowest category for preventing, detecting, diagnosing, and responding to outbreaks. However, Delaware, Kentucky, Maine, New York, and Virginia earned top marks from Trust for America's Health, which released the report with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe country needs to establish a clear, consistent set of baseline capabilities and provide ongoing resources to be consistently ready to combat ongoing problems as well as the next emerging threat,\u201d concluded the authors of the report.\n\nAmong the drivers of poor preparedness is rising heroin use, which directly contributes to swelling numbers of people infected by hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. Lack of awareness is a crucial factor in the spread of these viruses.\n\nAm I infected?\n\nWhile health officials estimate more than 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, almost one in eight do not know they are infected. Similarly, nearly five million Americans may be infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), both of which place people at risk for developing serious liver diseases and cancer. However, two out of three HBV infected people and half of HCV infected people remain unaware of their disease status.\n\nThe majority of the nearly 50,000 new HIV reports in 2010 affected young gay men, yet spiking heroin use \u2014 it has more than doubled within a decade, say the authors of the report \u2014 also contributes to the spread of this virus. Injected drug abuse has a corresponding effect on hepatitis C infections. In 2013, an estimated 29,718 new HCV infections occurred, with new cases predominantly appearing among young, white, non-urban, injection drug-using people. The report further explains those most likely to become infected with hep C have a history of using opioids, such as oxycodone, and live in Eastern and Midwestern states.\n\nEach person who injects drugs is projected to infect 20 additional people, add the authors, who stress the need for better testing and state reporting protocols.\n\nImportantly, new cases of hepatitis C are also arising from health care-associated infections or HAIs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes HAIs, which rank among the leading causes of preventable deaths, as \"infections patients get while receiving treatment for medical or surgical conditions.\" The CDC received reports of 44 health care-related outbreaks \u2014 an outbreak is defined as two or more cases \u2014 between 2008 and 2014. Of these, 42 (or 95 percent) occurred in non-hospital settings.\n\n\"The best offense to fighting infectious diseases is a strong and steady defense,\" observed the authors of the report.\n\nTrust for America\u2019s Health describes itself as a non-profit, non-partisan organization seeking to make disease prevention a national priority, while Robert Wood Johnson Foundation presents itself as the nation\u2019s largest philanthropy dedicated solely to health.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "heroin, opioids, hcv, hepatitis c, hiv, hepatitis b, hbv, virus, infectious disease, preparedness, states, public health, hospital-acquired infections", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Infectious disease preparation is inadequate in 28 states, with rising heroin use contributing to the problem via the spread of HIV and HCV: report.", "title": "The Link Between Heroin Use And America's Poor Disease Outbreak Preparedness", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-states-not-prepared-disease-outbreaks-drug-use-may-be-key-contributor-ongoing-365948", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/18/heroin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Infectious disease preparation is inadequate in 28 states, with rising heroin use contributing to the problem via the spread of HIV and HCV: report.", "title": "The Link Between Heroin Use And America's Poor Disease Outbreak Preparedness", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/most-states-not-prepared-disease-outbreaks-drug-use-may-be-key-contributor-ongoing-365948", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/18/heroin.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/12/18/heroin.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-12-18T11:49:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-18T11:49:46-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Infectious disease preparation is inadequate in 28 states, with rising heroin use contributing to the problem via the spread of HIV and HCV: report."}, "article_summary": "Infectious disease preparation is inadequate in 28 states, with rising heroin use contributing to the problem via the spread of HIV and HCV: report.\nHowever, two out of three HBV infected people and half of HCV infected people remain unaware of their disease status.\nCGehlen, CC by 2.0A new report suggests infectious disease preparation is inadequate in 28 states, with rising heroin use contributing to the problem.\nInjected drug abuse has a corresponding effect on hepatitis C infections.\nImportantly, new cases of hepatitis C are also arising from health care-associated infections or HAIs."}
