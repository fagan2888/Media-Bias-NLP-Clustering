Stephen Colbert‘s Comedy Central alter ego was, famously, partly based on “Papa Bear” Bill O’Reilly? Colbert often mocked O’Reilly and O’Reilly rarely resisted the urge to fire back. Well, even though Colbert left The Colbert Report relieved he wouldn’t have to watch O’Reilly anymore, it’s clear O’Reilly’s still keeping an eye on what Colbert is saying.

O’Reilly opened tonight’s Factor by bemoaning the activist Supreme Court ruling in favor of Obamacare and gay marriage. O’Reilly said on the latter, people deserve an “equal shot to pursue happiness and prosperity,” but no one should “demonize those who disagree.”

And that’s when O’Reilly brought up Colbert’s video from last Friday celebrating the Supreme Court ruling and mocking Justice Antonin Scalia‘s dissent.

O’Reilly brought up how Colbert’s going to be hosting The Late Show this fall opposite Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel, and said, “He might want to think about alienating traditional Americans to the extent he has. Could be very bad for business.”
