She concluded by expressing her assurance that Price's leadership will keep the steadfast wing moving into the future.\n\n\u201cToday, I have become your commander and that is an immense privilege and responsibility,\u201d said Price. \u201cGood leadership is about service and keeping our focus on those we have the opportunity to lead. I look forward to serving your families and you as we all continue to do the great work that has made this wing famous across the command.\u201d\n\nPrice was the vice commander of the 375th Air Mobility Wing at Scott Air Force Base, Ill., prior to his assignment at the Joint Base.
