Andy Thompson, a Marietta Republican, would let school districts choose standards and tests other than those required by the Common Core State Standards Initiative.\n\nThompson\u2019s House Bill 212 is an attempt to shift the overall balance of power between state officials and local school districts.\n\n\u201cI think that government which is closest to the people is the government which is most likely to be effective and responsive,\u201d Thompson told Ohio Watchdog, describing HB 212 as a way to restore local control of education.\n\n\u201cNot the sort of local control that our governor sometimes talks about, but real local control, where you transfer power from the federal and state levels down to the local level,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nGov. John Kasich, a Republican, supports Ohio\u2019s use of Common Core. Kasich insists the statewide implementation of the national standards has no negative impact on local school districts\u2019 control of education.\n\nMany of the school board members, superintendents, teachers and parents Thompson met with while drafting HB 212 disagree.\n\nThompson sees Kasich\u2019s agreement to get rid of the Common Core-compliant tests from Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers as the latest distraction meant to \u201cdiminish the overall message\u201d of Common Core opponents.\n\n\u201cPARCC needed to go, but in terms of the long-term approach we\u2019ve been trying to take to get rid of Common Core, it\u2019s not just bits and pieces,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cThe folks who are advocates for Common Core always try to segment, or put things in silos,\u201d Thompson explained. \u201cThey try to deny there\u2019s a problem until it becomes eminently obvious to everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the overall message is, this is a system. You can\u2019t look at it in silos,\u201d he said.\n\nIn addition to giving schools some flexibility on which standards and tests to use \u2014 the state would define a few options \u2014 HB 212 would end the state\u2019s teacher and principal evaluation systems.\n\n\u201cThese are all big, bureaucratic additions to the time-suck that goes on at the local level, much of it because outside entities want data on all this stuff,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nIn a departure from Thompson\u2019s previous efforts, HB 212 would let districts opt out of Common Core but wouldn\u2019t ban the standards in the state.\n\n\u201cIf you like your Common Core, you can keep it,\u201d Thompson said, acknowledging that some districts may want to stick with Common Core since they\u2019ve invested so much in compliance.\n\n\u201cBut we will provide a better quality, more developmentally appropriate path for Ohio and a choice of tests: both the norm-referenced Iowa Test and the aligned test to the Massachusetts standards,\u201d he added.\n\nOhio\u2019s 2016-17 budget forbids the continued use of PARCC tests. Instead, the state plans to use Common Core-compliant math and language arts tests administered by American Institutes for Research.\n\nWidespread complaints about PARCC testing made it difficult even for Common Core supporters to defend the tests. But by dropping PARCC while keeping Common Core, \u201cwe may have made things worse,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, the problem with Common Core has always been that it\u2019s one-size-fits-all, treating every kid like one more widget on an assembly line,\u201d he opined.\n\nBefore the standards were written, Kasich\u2019s Democrat predecessor, Ted Strickland, agreed to adopt Common Core in Ohio to secure federal funding and a waiver from federal No Child Left Behind mandates.\n\nThompson acknowledged Common Core has many powerful supporters, including Kasich and The Ohio Standard, a coalition backed by national donors including The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m up against the governor, the wealthiest man in the world, the Walton family; you\u2019ve got so many people who want to centrally plan our workforce,\u201d he said.\n\nBut with HB 212, Thompson sees a growing coalition calling for more local control and thinks \u201cthe momentum is definitely in our favor.\u201d\n\nThompson said superintendents, school board members and teachers from several of the state\u2019s school districts are already helping promote HB 212. He\u2019s optimistic the bill could have bipartisan support in the Ohio House.\n\nHB 212 hasn\u2019t received a hearing yet, but it has 20 cosponsors. Thompson expects Speaker Cliff Rosenberger, a Republican, will help the bill get \u201can objective hearing.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment on HB 212.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio has dropped its Common Core testing provider, but critics aren't done fighting the math and language arts standards in the state.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio has dropped its Common Core testing provider, but critics aren't done fighting the math and language arts standards in the state.", "title": "Ohio's fight over Common Core, local control heats up - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/andy-thompson-ohio-house.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-14T07:40:41+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/228699/ohio-common-core-fight/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio has dropped its Common Core testing provider, but critics aren't done fighting the math and language arts standards in the state.", "title": "Ohio's fight over Common Core, local control heats up - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/andy-thompson-ohio-house.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Education", "published_time": "2015-07-14T04:00:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T07:40:41+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "andy thompson, john kasich, common core, the ohio standard, common core state standards initiative, ohio common core, ohio house bill 212, ohioans against common core,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9552\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you like your Common Core, you can keep it,\u201d Thompson said, acknowledging that some districts may want to stick with Common Core since they\u2019ve invested so much in compliance.\nJohn Kasich, a Republican, supports Ohio\u2019s use of Common Core.\n\u201cFundamentally, the problem with Common Core has always been that it\u2019s one-size-fits-all, treating every kid like one more widget on an assembly line,\u201d he opined.\n\u201cThe folks who are advocates for Common Core always try to segment, or put things in silos,\u201d Thompson explained.\nWidespread complaints about PARCC testing made it difficult even for Common Core supporters to defend the tests."}
