Most doctors who provide care at UMC aren\u2019t directly employed by the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a good day,\u201d said Clark County Commissioner Lawrence Weekly, who chairs the Board of Trustees that oversees the hospital. \u201cI\u2019m devastated at the idea you\u2019ll have a number of these folks who will be unemployed.\u201d\n\nAs part of the cuts announced today, UMC is ending its outpatient oncology, outpatient pharmacy and Lied clinic services. Further details will be released at a press conference Thursday morning, a UMC spokeswoman said.\n\nMartin Bassick, president of the union that represents UMC employees, called the cuts \"devastating.\" \"Anyone who cares about Nevada needs to question how much patient care at UMC will suffer if these cuts are allowed to happen.\"\n\nThe layoffs come as UMC struggles to overcome more than a decade of financial challenges under the leadership of new chief executive officer Lawrence Barnard, who took the top job in January.\n\nAs the only public hospital in Southern Nevada, UMC provides millions of dollars of uncompensated care each year to patients without insurance, exacerbating its financial woes.\n\nThe hospital eliminated 105 positions and closed four of its satellite clinics in April in an attempt to bring down costs.\n\nThe hospital needed a $70 million subsidy from Clark County this year to balance its budget. It also took out an additional $45 million in emergency loans earlier this year to avoid a cash shortage that could have left the hospital unable to pay its bills.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t support it, I don\u2019t agree with it all,\u201d Weekly said of the layoffs. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know what to tell (UMC). There\u2019s no answer.\u201d\n\nWeekly said the hospital\u2019s mounting financial challenges require it to be run more like a business.\n\n\u201cThe days of trying to be all things to everybody, that\u2019s come to an end at UMC,\u201d Weekly said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A second round of layoffs are coming to University Medical Center, officials announced today, less than six months after the financially troubled hospital had its first batch of layoffs. ...", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "A second round of layoffs are coming to University Medical Center, officials announced today, less than six months after the financially troubled hospital had its first batch of layoffs. ...", "title": "UMC announces second, bigger round of layoffs", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2014/aug/20/umc-announces-big-round-layoffs-las-vegas/", "image": "http://media.lasvegasweekly.com/img/photos/2011/02/09/scaled.0106_m_umc4_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@LasVegasSun", "image": "//media.lasvegasweekly.com/img/photos/2011/02/09/scaled.0106_m_umc4_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "creator": "@Conor_Shine"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-20T14:35", "modified_time": "2014-08-20T18:33", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/conor-shine/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2105\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe days of trying to be all things to everybody, that\u2019s come to an end at UMC,\u201d Weekly said.\nA second round of layoffs are coming to University Medical Center, officials announced today, less than six months after the financially troubled hospital had its first batch of layoffs.\nMost doctors who provide care at UMC aren\u2019t directly employed by the hospital.\n\"Anyone who cares about Nevada needs to question how much patient care at UMC will suffer if these cuts are allowed to happen.\"\n\u201cI\u2019m devastated at the idea you\u2019ll have a number of these folks who will be unemployed.\u201dAs part of the cuts announced today, UMC is ending its outpatient oncology, outpatient pharmacy and Lied clinic services."}
