Health spending grew 4.8 percent year-over-year between February 2015 and 2016, according to a monthly report from the Altarum Institute.

“While year-over-year health spending growth of 4.8% in February is somewhat higher than the 4.5% growth observed in both December 2015 and January 2016, February is the fourth consecutive month in which it has been below 5%,” the report says. “The 4.5% growth rate in December and January was the lowest since March 2014.”

Spending increased in all categories across the industry over that year, the report says. Home health care grew the most quickly, at 12.2 percent. Hospital care, meanwhile, grew the most slowly at 2.4 percent.
