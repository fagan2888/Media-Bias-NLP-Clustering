The redshirt sophomore, starting his first game for Colorado State, threw five touchdown passes to five different targets and didn't even play the entire game.\n\nThen came the second week, and the bandwagon started to empty after Stevens was pulled after throwing for less than 51 yards and two picks in a loss to Minnesota.\n\nIn both cases, it was too soon to swing wildly either way, but that's what fans do. Heading into Tuesday's Arizona Bowl against Nevada (5:30 p.m.; FOX), the one thing that is clear is this: The better Stevens plays, the better Colorado State's chances are for victory.\n\nColorado State quarterback Nick Stevens has had an up-and-down season, but one that still led to him being an all-conference quarterback heading into Tuesday's Arizona Bowl against Nevada. (Mike Brohard / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nJust like those first two weeks, so has been Stevens' season. In six games this year \u2014 when he's thrown for a minimum of 200 yards and his touchdown-to-turnover ratio is at least even \u2014 the Rams are 5-1. In the six games where the yardage is lower and the ratio leans toward the bad, the Rams are 2-4.\n\nThrough it all, he set the school record for yardage by a sophomore quarterback (2,369), threw 21 touchdowns (fifth best all time) and earned second-team all-Mountain West honors. It suggests exactly what the numbers do \u2014 there has been more good than bad. Then again, consistency has never been synonymous with first-year starter at quarterback.\n\nThe one thing clear to head coach Mike Bobo is the version of Stevens which will play at Arizona Stadium is better than the one who was playing at Hughes Stadium back in September.\n\n\"Nick's done a nice job. Nick's really improved the whole year,\" Bobo said during bowl preparation. \"Nick is a focused young man, very intelligent, understands what we're trying to do. He's not there yet, but he's got a grasp of it. He's just got to play better consistently, and that comes with time, and it comes with fundamentals and footwork and understanding the offense at another level than he does now. I think everything will come easier to him.\"\n\nWhich in some ways is the key in Bobo's mind. When Stevens starts out well, the trend is he remains in that mode. When they don't, it's anybody's guess how the game will play out.\n\nHeading into the season finale at Fresno State, Stevens had been in a bit of a groove. In the three games prior, he threw five touchdowns against two interceptions and had completed at least 68 percent of his passes. But in the win over the Bulldogs (a game saved by three touchdowns from the special teams), Stevens was just off, throwing for 85 yards.\n\nBobo looks back at one play \u2014 a bootleg that produced a wide open Kivon Cartwright \u2014 a simple pass that was missed. Bobo doesn't expect every pass will be a completion, but the routine throws are necessary.\n\n\"At the same time, you've still got to have confidence in yourself to go out and rip the next one,\" Bobo said. \"I think he's gained some confidence. We continue to work on that, but give him credit, the bowl practices the last two weeks, he's been out there and he's been on fire.\"\n\nWhich could be a good sign. Stevens understands Bobo's theory, but he also goes back to what he puts into preparation. He admits it wasn't up to par early on, but as he's grown, he's gained more of an understanding of what it takes.\n\n\"I think I started playing well a little bit later in the season because the preparation I was putting in week to week,\" he said. \"I'm not exactly sure what caused me to struggle in the games I've struggled in, but I definitely have found it's definitely more likely to have a much better game when the preparation is there, and I spend a lot more time in the film room and studying an opponent a little bit more than what I guess I started out doing.\"\n\nHeading into Saturday's practice, Stevens was feeling good about the game plan, about the way he was practicing, about his preparation.\n\nIt's not just him saying it, either. Bobo is saying it, and his teammates are seeing it. Rashard Higgins said Stevens threw a couple of passes to him back in Fort Collins that reminded him of Garrett Grayson.\n\nWhich is also part of the equation. Stevens isn't Grayson of 2014, but he is in the same neighborhood of the Grayson of 2012. Even he, now with the New Orleans Saints, needed time to develop.\n\nSo too did Higgins.\n\n\"He's really grown. At practice, he's improving, and he's really showing what he can be,\" Higgins said. \"This is his first year at it, so you've just got to give him time to develop. Like how I was my freshman year. I dropped a lot of passes. Next year, we're looking for Nick to boom.\"\n\nHe may need to, because under Bobo, no job is guaranteed. As Coleman Key, the primary backup, exits the program via transfer, Faton Bauta enters the equation, a transfer from Georgia with one year of eligibility remaining.\n\nHe's coming to play, but nobody should expect Stevens to just step aside, either. Even Bauta said those who expect him to come in and immediately be the starter don't understand the process.\n\nStevens does. The more he knows, the better he'll be, the better the Rams' offense performs. It's not just seen in his completion percentage and yardage, but also that of the run game. Bobo has continuously given Stevens credit for helping get the offense out of bad run plays and into good ones, also a vital part of his job.\n\nThat starts before the game ever does, which is where Stevens sees his greatest growth.\n\n\"Off the field of preparation, then footwork and having my eyes in the right place,\" he said. \"I think it's helped a lot that I've just learned the offense more and I know a lot more about football and defense in general than I ever have.\"\n\nThe battle for his position is for another day, sometime in March when the Rams start spring drills. For now, the focus is on Nevada, a team that allowed just 206 yards per game passing to opponents. Looking deeper, it's also a secondary that was hit four times for 280 yards or more. After Hawaii threw for 291, the Wolf Pack allowed less than 190 yards to the final four opponents, but three of them rushed for better than 200 yards, San Diego State for 320.\n\nLast season, Higgins hit the Pack for 10 catches, 194 yards and two scores, and when he watches film, he sees many of the same players for the Wolf Pack.\n\nHiggins is ready for round two.\n\nJust as important, Stevens says he is, too.\n\nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/mbrohard", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/sports/ci_29315519/csu-footballs-nick-stevens-searching-norm-entering-arizona", "modificationDate": "2015-12-27T15:43:52-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/1227/20151227__28rhscsufbw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Mike Brohard \n \n  Sports Editor", "description": "TUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 After one game, fans were excited about Nick Stevens.\nAnd why not?
