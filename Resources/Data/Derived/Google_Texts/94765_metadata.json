He also promised once again to veto bills that would repeal Obamacare or roll back Wall Street regulations.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nProclaiming that \u201cAmerica has come back,\u201d he urged Democrats to stand proudly on the economic policies they have pursued during his time in the White House, saying that \u201cthe record shows that we were right\u201d \u2014 despite the drubbing their party took at the polls in November.\n\nAnd he called for a narrower approach to the spending cuts that are now driven by the annual sequester process, saying they should be \u201ca scalpel and not a meat cleaver.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make sure we are funding the things that American families need,\u201d he said.\n\nObama spoke just days before Senate Democrats are promising to filibuster a House-passed bill that would fund the Department of Homeland Security while rolling back years of the president\u2019s immigration policies, including last fall\u2019s decision to shield potentially millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation. Senate Democrats are demanding a \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill, while conservative House Republicans have warned that no such bill could pass their chamber.\n\nDHS funding is due to run out Feb. 27, but POLITICO reported Wednesday that some top House Republicans believe a funding lapse may not be so worrisome because most of the department\u2019s employees are considered essential and would stay on the job \u2014 though their paychecks would be withheld.\n\n\u201cIn other words, it\u2019s not the end of the world if we get to that time because the national security functions will not stop,\u201d Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) said at the time. While Diaz-Balart said Congress shouldn\u2019t ignore the funding deadline, Obama repeatedly seized on the \u201cnot the end of the world\u201d line Thursday night.\n\n\u201cYou think we can afford to have our Department of Homeland Security not functioning because of political games in Washington?\u201d Obama asked.\n\nAs for Obamacare, the president said: \u201cI hear Republicans are holding their 50th or 60th vote to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act. I\u2019ve lost count at this point. But if that bill actually ever reached my desk, I would happily veto it.\u201d\n\nHouse Republicans are scheduled to vote next week on legislation that would repeal the president\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nObama also mocked Republicans for \u201cstarting to sound pretty Democratic\u201d in their messages about poverty and the middle class, including a not-so-veiled swipe at former \u2014 and possibly future \u2014 presidential candidate Mitt Romney.\n\n\u201cEven though their policies haven\u2019t quite caught up yet, their rhetoric is starting to sound pretty Democratic,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have a former presidential candidate on the other side and [who is] suddenly deeply concerned about poverty. That\u2019s great, let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s do something about it.\u201d\n\nObama went further during a question-and-answer session held with members behind closed doors. He said Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t have an agenda\u201d in a response to a question from Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) on infrastructure, and joked that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) \u201ctook care\u201d of the White House proposal to tax 529 college savings accounts, according to sources in the room.\n\nAnd he asked lawmakers for time to negotiate a deal with Iran overs its nuclear facilities.\n\n\u201cMy simple request, which I do not think is unreasonable, is for Congress to let this play out for two to three months,\u201d Obama said, according to sources.\n\nObama also took a question on his State of the Union request for the ability to fast-track trade deals. He told members concerned about trade to \u201ckeep your powder a little dry\u201d and \u201cbe strategic.\u201d\n\nEarlier Thursday night, in his speech to the Democrats, he strongly repeated his pledge to campaign on the \u201cmiddle-class economics\u201d policies he had outlined in the State of the Union \u2014 policies that he said have already helped rebuild the economy from a deep recession.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare when you have two visions [and] a vigorous debate, and then you test who\u2019s right,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd the record shows that we were right.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou and I together made some really tough choices, sometimes some politically unpopular choices, and America has come back.\u201d Obama also challenged Democrats not to back away from their political achievements \u2014 arguing that if the party had been more forceful in touting the economic benefits Americans have seen, Democrats may have been more successful at the polls.\n\n\u201cI will just say, obviously, we were all disappointed in the outcome of the last election. We\u2019ve heard a lot of reasons for it and I\u2019m happy to take on some of the blame,\u201d Obama said. But he urged lawmakers to \u201cstand up straight and proud and say, \u2018Yes, we believe everybody in this country should have health insurance.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe believe in middle class economics and we don\u2019t apologize,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Obama acknowledged that middle-class families are still feeling the pinch from job losses and stagnant wages lingering from the economic downturn.\n\n\u201cWhat everybody here understands is the ground that middle class families lost \u2026 still needs to be made up,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAs much as we should appreciate the progress that\u2019s been made, it shouldn\u2019t be a cause for complacency. Because we\u2019ve got more work to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He also slams Republican arguments on a DHS funding lapse.", "title": "Obama threatens to veto attacks on his immigration policy", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/barack-obama-immigration-114752.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/29/140129_barack_obama_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Congress,Democrats,Department Of Homeland Security,Immigration,House Democrats,Philadelphia,Pennsylvania", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He also slams Republican arguments on a DHS funding lapse.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Senate Democrats are demanding a \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill, while conservative House Republicans have warned that no such bill could pass their chamber.\nObama also took a question on his State of the Union request for the ability to fast-track trade deals.\nWhile Diaz-Balart said Congress shouldn\u2019t ignore the funding deadline, Obama repeatedly seized on the \u201cnot the end of the world\u201d line Thursday night.\n\u201cWhat everybody here understands is the ground that middle class families lost \u2026 still needs to be made up,\u201d Obama said.\nHe also promised once again to veto bills that would repeal Obamacare or roll back Wall Street regulations."}
