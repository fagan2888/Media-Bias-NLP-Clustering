Nelson, then a freshman, had missed a class. So the coach had to make certain Nelson and the team knew there was still order, and none of that changed just because the player walked in with star status.\n\nMartelli checked his phone immediately after practice.\n\n\u201cHe had called me three times,\u201d Martelli said, \u201capologetic and telling me that it would never, ever happen again.\u201d\n\nIt can be argued the Nuggets\u2019 top free-agent priority this offseason was retaining the 33-year old Nelson. It can also be argued he\u2019s the most important player in the locker room though he\u2019s a backup to rookie Emmanuel Mudiay.\n\nAs effective as he was on the court late last season, the decision to make a strong push to keep the point guard was made because of his locker room impact.\n\nThings changed for the better almost immediately after the Nuggets traded for him in January. He was a stabilizing force who knew just what buttons to push on a fractured team down on its luck and down on itself. Two weeks after his arrival, he invited players and coaches to his house in Philadelphia for some team healing. He made himself available to teammates for advice on and off the court. He was never comfortable with how quickly media swarmed him after a game, but there was never any doubt Nelson was the voice of reason in the midst of chaos.\n\nThe Nuggets wanted all of that back. Because it was clear to them that a team of individuals who lack professionalism and discipline was just as doomed as one short on talent.\n\nNelson is a safeguard against that.\n\nMartelli has always known it.\n\n\u201cWhen I was recruiting him I was amazed, if not blown away, by the care and concern for not just the teammates that he had in high school, but those around the program,\u201d Martelli said. \u201cThe respect with which he dealt with me, one of the many coaches recruiting him. The mature fashion with which he dealt with the notoriety.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeadership is a posture and a choice, not a role that must be bestowed on you. Step up and be a leader when no one is watching or expecting you to do so.\u201d \u2014 John Izzo and Marshall Goldsmith, Stepping Up: How Taking Responsibility Changes Everything\n\nBeing on time is about 20-30 minutes too late to Nelson. So each day he strives to get to practice before his teammates.\n\n\u201cTo be a leader you have to be uncomfortable,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cYou have to get extra shots up, you have to be early to be on time. You gotta hold yourself accountable, so then when you hold somebody else accountable they\u2019re not looking at you with a side eye. (Instead) they\u2019re like, \u2018He\u2019s doing it, he\u2019s showing us.\u2019 \u201c\n\nNelson made an immediate impression on new Nuggets coach Michael Malone.\n\n\u201cI have the utmost confidence in Jameer Nelson as a leader,\u201d Malone said.\n\nWhen Nelson joined the Dallas Mavericks in 2014, coach Rick Carlisle gushed to reporters that Nelson was a \u201cnatural leader.\u201d\n\nNelson brought back the majority of the Nuggets to his Philadelphia-area house for a summer team bonding camp, and the impact it had did not go unnoticed.\n\n\u201cEveryone got a chance to know each other,\u201d Nuggets forward Darrell Arthur said. \u201cI thought it was a great experience for the team.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe task of the leader is to get his people from where they are to where they have not been.\u201d \u2014 Henry Kissinger\n\nLeaders orbit Mudiay like planets around the sun. It is by design, and it is also why when asked about Nelson, Mudiay lumps others in the leader bucket.\n\nThe effect, however, is the same.\n\n\u201cHe has the most years, him and Mike Miller,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cThey\u2019re the face and the leader of the team right now, so their voice matters. I\u2019m just trying to learn from them, from Coach Malone and the staff and it\u2019s been doing me good so far.\u201d\n\nNelson returned to the Nuggets for the promise of things to come. He insists he\u2019s not close to retirement, but already has an eye on coaching. He\u2019s not going to hold Mudiay\u2019s hand through every day of his professional career, but does take interest in helping mold a player who has the potential to be great.\n\nNelson is already playing a winning hand.\n\n\u201cI know this,\u201d Martelli said. \u201cIf you said to me, I want a leader for my car dealership, I want a leader for my newspaper, I want a leader for my university, I want a leader for my basketball program, it wouldn\u2019t take me a lot of names to get to Jameer. He has the Midas touch. He does. And I will forever be grateful to the man above that I had that young man in my life. Because he made me a better person.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jameer Nelson\u2019s impact hits beyond the court", "title": "Jameer Nelson\u2019s impact hits beyond the court", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/10/jameer-nelsons-impact-hits-beyond-the-court/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__jameer-nelson-denver-nuggetsp1.jpg", "height": 464}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151010__jameer-nelson-denver-nuggetsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-10T16:50:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:46:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4d83\"", "article_summary": "It is by design, and it is also why when asked about Nelson, Mudiay lumps others in the leader bucket.\n(Instead) they\u2019re like, \u2018He\u2019s doing it, he\u2019s showing us.\u2019 \u201cNelson made an immediate impression on new Nuggets coach Michael Malone.\nIt can also be argued he\u2019s the most important player in the locker room though he\u2019s a backup to rookie Emmanuel Mudiay.\n\u201cI have the utmost confidence in Jameer Nelson as a leader,\u201d Malone said.\nTwo weeks after his arrival, he invited players and coaches to his house in Philadelphia for some team healing."}
