Bikes kill. That’s the painful reminder the city got this week when, cops say, a speeding bicyclist ran down a 59-year-old mom in Central Park, leaving her brain-dead.

Jill Tarlov, of Fairfield, Conn., had come to New York to shop for a gift for her daughter’s birthday. Police say Jason Marshall, traveling above the speed limit and in the wrong lane, yelled for her to get out of his way — but struck her nonetheless.

It’s a tragic story. And while bike-vs.-pedestrian deaths aren’t everyday occurrences, the risk is real enough: Last month, 75-year-old Irving Schachter was also killed by a bicycle accident in the park.

Too often, cyclists adopt a sense of entitlement when it comes to the roads and sidewalks.

They regard traffic and bike laws as optional. Meanwhile, the city’s push to expand biking, particularly under former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, is making more accidents more likely, a point The Post has made for years.

We’ve also long argued that a smart way to avoid bike accidents is to crack down on lawless cyclists.

We were encouraged when the NYPD rolled out Operation Safe Cycle last month, targeting cyclists who ride on sidewalks, ignore traffic signs or don’t yield to pedestrians. Our one regret was that it was just a two-week trial program.

Now, the department says it will keep Safe Cycle going as part of Mayor de Blasio’s Vision Zero traffic-safety effort.

It’s about time. De Blasio says he wants to make our streets safe for horses, and Vision Zero focuses heavily on cars. But New York’s pedestrians need protection from the two-wheeled menaces, too.
