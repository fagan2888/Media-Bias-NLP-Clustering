Reuters\n\nAn unidentified 8-year-old girl in China has become the country\u2019s youngest lung cancer patient, according to China\u2019s Xinhua News Agency. Doctors from the Jiangsu Cancer Hospital say toxic air pollution, known as smog, is the primary cause of the young girl\u2019s life-threatening condition.\n\nDr. Jie Fengdong from the hospital located in Nanjing told the Xinhua agency that the girl has lived along a busy road in the eastern province of Jiangsu for most of her life. During this time, she most likely inhaled a hazardous amount of particles including dust and coal smoke, Agence France-Presse reports.\n\nThe environmental impact of air pollutants in China came to a head last month when the city of Harbin, the capital of northeast Heilongjiang province, was shut down due to dangerous smog levels. Schools were closed, highways were clogged, and airports were shut down in a city that\u2019s home to 11 million people.\n\nAccording to a recent World Health Organization (WHO) report, outdoor air pollution has been classified as a carcinogen that can cause cancer, among other major health risks. The WHO attributed a significant rise in smog exposure levels to industrialized countries with large populations. Sources of air pollution include transportation, stationary power generation, industrial and agricultural emissions, and residential heating and cooking.\n\n\u201cThere are effective ways to reduce air pollution,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Wild, director of the WHO\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer. \u201cAnd, given the scale of the exposure affecting people worldwide, this report should send a strong signal to the international community to take action without further delay.\u201d\n\nOut of the 7.6 million cancer-related deaths in 2008, according to the WHO, 1.37 million were attributed to lung cancer. The amount of lung cancer deaths in China is four times higher than what it was 30 years ago, China\u2019s Ministry of Health announced in a 2008 report. Lung cancer surpassed liver cancer with the most deaths linked to malignant tumors after an increase of 465 percent.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "china, 8, year, old, smog, air, pollution, lung, cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors in the eastern province of Jiangsu say smog may have caused an 8-year-old girl to become China's youngest lung cancer patient.", "title": "8-Year-Old Becomes China's Youngest Lung Cancer Patient", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/8-year-old-becomes-chinas-youngest-lung-cancer-patient-smog-blame-262137", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/06/chinese-air-pollution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors in the eastern province of Jiangsu say smog may have caused an 8-year-old girl to become China's youngest lung cancer patient.", "title": "8-Year-Old Becomes China's Youngest Lung Cancer Patient", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/8-year-old-becomes-chinas-youngest-lung-cancer-patient-smog-blame-262137", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/06/chinese-air-pollution.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/06/chinese-air-pollution.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-06T13:49:38-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-06T13:49:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors in the eastern province of Jiangsu say smog may have caused an 8-year-old girl to become China's youngest lung cancer patient."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c75\"", "article_summary": "Doctors in the eastern province of Jiangsu say smog may have caused an 8-year-old girl to become China's youngest lung cancer patient.\nReutersAn unidentified 8-year-old girl in China has become the country\u2019s youngest lung cancer patient, according to China\u2019s Xinhua News Agency.\nLung cancer surpassed liver cancer with the most deaths linked to malignant tumors after an increase of 465 percent.\nDoctors from the Jiangsu Cancer Hospital say toxic air pollution, known as smog, is the primary cause of the young girl\u2019s life-threatening condition.\nThe amount of lung cancer deaths in China is four times higher than what it was 30 years ago, China\u2019s Ministry of Health announced in a 2008 report."}
