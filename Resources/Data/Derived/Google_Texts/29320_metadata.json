We are also working aggressively to enroll more patients in Affordable Care Act insurance programs.\n\nPortland Community Health Center was established in 2009, growing out of community leaders\u2019 concerns about city residents who were facing a number of barriers to health care.\n\nRepresentatives of city government, health care and social service organizations, and a wide range of community groups formed the planning committee. As is often true of collaborative efforts, getting Portland Community Health Center launched required many meetings and the voices of many interested parties.\n\nInitially, the health center co-applied with the city of Portland for federal funding available to federally qualified health centers, which included funding to serve people experiencing homelessness.\n\nTo receive and maintain the federally qualified health center designation, Portland Community Health Center must serve an identified underserved area or population, offer a sliding fee scale, provide comprehensive services and have an ongoing quality assurance program.\n\nThe vision from the beginning was to provide fully integrated primary health care services to all members of the Portland community who had difficulty with access to such care.\n\nAs a federally qualified health center, Portland Community Health Center is required to have a majority of board members who are patients of record. Today, seven of our 13 board members are patients.\n\nFederally qualified health centers are highly regulated, and as a \u201cnew\u201d community health center, we received in-depth annual site visits from the Health Resources and Services Administration, our federal funder.\n\nAt our most recent site visit in 2014, once the transfer of patients from Health Care for the Homeless to Portland Community Health Center had been completed, we received excellent marks in all categories of performance, and we were cited for many \u201cbest practices\u201d in the area of board governance and oversight.\n\nIn December, we were notified of the award of a three-year federal grant to provide primary health care to adults, children and families in Cumberland County, including those experiencing homelessness.\n\nLet us make clear Portland Community Health Center\u2019s short but mighty history, and our plans to keep on growing:\n\nFrom the outset, the health center has been grounded in and led by the community. We\u2019re proud to count an original member of the planning committee as an active board member today, as well as several other long-standing board members.\n\nThe Board of Directors holds the accountability for every decision made in terms of service provision, quality assurance, financial health and community relations. We are proud of our superb staff, from our CEO to our front-desk staff, but we know the buck stops with us.\n\nToday, we serve 5,200 patients \u2013 1,500 of whom identify as homeless \u2013 in four clinical sites in Portland. We work in multiple coalitions and collaborative groups to make the best possible use of limited health care resources for city residents, and we welcome more partners.\n\nAs Portland Community Health Center board member Joyce Racine recently told legislators at a gathering hosted by the Maine Primary Care Association:\n\n\u201cI was homeless through no fault of my own, in poor physical health from the effects of my low-paying job at a laundry company where I was required to stand all day and lift and carry heavy bags of laundry, and the entire staff at the health center couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming \u2026 .\n\n\u201cWhen I first entered the Portland Community Health Center, I was greeted with a warm smile, a caring attitude and open arms by every health professional they had me see that very first day. It was the first place that gave me hope again \u2026\n\n\u201cAnd this is how you would be treated if you walked through our doors seeking affordable, high-quality health care. As a board member, I have a voice and a say in the services provided at our Community Health Center \u2026 . I\u2019ve never heard of that happening in health care before.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The center has a short but mighty history and welcomes more partners as it keeps on growing.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The center has a short but mighty history and welcomes more partners as it keeps on growing.", "title": "Maine Voices: Portland Community Health Center takes pride in welcoming all patients - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1794, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20140308_Homeless1-e1463156149293.jpg", "height": 1191}, "updated_time": "2015-03-01T20:08:58-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/02/27/maine-voices-portland-community-health-center-takes-pride-in-welcoming-all-patients/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The center has a short but mighty history and welcomes more partners as it keeps on growing.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20140308_Homeless1-e1463156149293.jpg", "title": "Maine Voices: Portland Community Health Center takes pride in welcoming all patients - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Columns", "published_time": "2015-02-27T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-01T20:08:58-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fd2\"", "article_summary": "The Maine Sunday Telegram recently ran a story about community health centers across Maine, including Portland Community Health Center (\u201cCommunity health clinics struggle with impact of MaineCare cuts,\u201d Feb. 8).\nAs a federally qualified health center, Portland Community Health Center is required to have a majority of board members who are patients of record.\nAs is often true of collaborative efforts, getting Portland Community Health Center launched required many meetings and the voices of many interested parties.\nPortland Community Health Center was established in 2009, growing out of community leaders\u2019 concerns about city residents who were facing a number of barriers to health care.\nabout the authors Karin Anderson is board president and Kathleen Stokes is immediate past board president of Portland Community Health Center."}
