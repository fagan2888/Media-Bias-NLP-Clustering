You\u2019ve loved them, encouraged them, fed them, educated them, and watched as they try to make it in the work-a-day world of a less-than-ideal job market and economy. Many of us are faced with watching our children take part-time work or temporary work as they hunt and peck for permanent positions. Often times they move from city to city \u2013 or move back home \u2013 after they finish school and until they find stable employment.\n\nAnd, if your child is over age 26, you may find yourself in constant conversations with them over just what their options are regarding health insurance during these transition phases of their careers \u2013 especially outside of the official open enrollment period to purchase health insurance. Open enrollment for 2015 coverage begins November 15, 2014 and runs through February 15, 2015.\n\nThe provision allowing children up to the age of 26 to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plan remains one of the most popular features of the Affordable Care Act. And rightly so. Current Bureau of Labor statistics indicate the unemployment rate for those ages 20-24 is 10.6 percent. And for those ages 25-34, it hovers near 7 percent.\n\nBecause employment and health insurance are so coupled, if you\u2019re a parent (like I am) when your child is unemployed, underemployed, between jobs or facing job transition, the question of what to do about insurance coverage during a qualifying event in their lives takes on added meaning.\n\nA qualifying event as defined by the ACA is: \u201cA change in your life that can make you eligible for a special enrollment period to enroll in health coverage. Some examples of qualifying life events are moving to a new state, changes in family size (including marriage, divorce, or the birth or adoption of a child), and loss of other health insurance coverage.\n\nCoverage options for Millennials \u2026\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that because of the ACA, there are options for these \u201cyoung adults.\u201d For us, our 29-year-old daughter lost her employer-based coverage on August 31, when her one-year job assignment ended. As of today, it\u2019s unclear just when her next full-time job with health insurance coverage will materialize.\n\nShe\u2019s cobbling together part-time work in various cities as she waits for what will be her best chance at obtaining a full-time job in her field (in the fall of 2015.) Yet, once she lost employer-based coverage, she was still eligible to enroll in an ACA-compliant plan (on or off-exchange) up until the end of October because loss of other coverage is a qualifying event that triggers a 60-day special enrollment period.\n\nDuring these transitional times, we always return to the reality that because of the ACA, our daughter cannot be denied insurance coverage; and there are affordable choices. It can be a bit tricky to work through the options, but there are options. And \u201crolling the dice\u201d and hoping she wouldn\u2019t need to see a doctor becomes far less attractive now that the ACA is here.\n\n\u2026 and options Millennials embrace\n\nIn fact, a recent study has shown how Millennials have embraced the ACA. Newly released U.S. Census data shows that the number, and rate of young adults, who lack health insurance has fallen significantly since the ACA became law in March 2010. An estimated 3.9 million more 18- to 34-year-olds were insured in 2013 than in 2009. In fact, the reports does not include much of the 2014 open enrollment period, meaning that numbers could improve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time that if you give Millennials options for quality, affordable health insurance, they\u2019re going to enroll. Uninsured young adults know that they\u2019re just one accident or illness away from a medical and economic catastrophe,\u201d writes Tom Allison, Policy and Research Manager from Young Invincibles.\n\n\u201cIf anyone has experienced a qualifying event \u2013 such as loss of coverage \u2013 under the ACA, they can apply for an ACA-compliant policy (on or off exchange) during your special open enrollment period, which typically lasts for 60 days,\u201d said Louise Norris, a Colorado-based independent insurance broker.\n\nAnother option is short-term health insurance policies, Norris pointed out, which can provide up to six months of coverage in most states. Short-term major medical may not be available in all 50 states.\n\nNorris cautions that \u201cshort-term policies aren\u2019t considered minimum essential coverage. That means that unless the individual is exempt from the ACA\u2019s shared responsibility provision (individual mandate), they will be assessed a penalty for the time they are covered by a short-term policy.\u201d A great list of the pros and cons of purchasing short-term plans can be found by clicking here.\n\nSo, although our children face a less-than-ideal job market right now there are options for health insurance coverage. With all that\u2019s on their minds (and ours) at this time, let\u2019s not forget that the ACA allows for special enrollment periods and that short-term plans can take away the worry of further financial burdens because of any health-related issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During these transitional times we always return to the reality that because of the ACA our daughter cannot be denied insurance coverage; and there are affordable choices.
