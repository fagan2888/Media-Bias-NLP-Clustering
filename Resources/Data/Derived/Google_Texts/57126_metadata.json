A vote is scheduled for Thursday.\n\nWriting in early November in National Review, Yuval Levin, a conservative popular with House Republicans, said the legislation \u201cseems likely to be worse than doing nothing.\u201d His rationale is that there are many more people who work 40 hours a week than just over 30, and that it would be easier for an employer to cut their hours to 39 a week to avoid offering them insurance than to 29.\n\n\u201cPutting the cutoff for the employer mandate at 40 hours would likely put far, far more people at risk of having their hours cut than leaving it at 30 hours,\u201d Levin wrote. \u201cThat would make for a worse effect on workers and on the economy. So by setting the definition lower, Obamacare\u2019s architects were trying to mitigate the damaging effects of the employer mandate some, and by setting it higher Republicans would be worsening those effects.\u201d Instead, he called for a full repeal of the employer coverage mandate.\n\nBill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, drew more attention to the post when he took to Twitter to bolster Mr. Levin. \u201cI don\u2019t see why Republicans should be taking the lead in an alleged fix of Obamacare that I\u2019m not sure would improve it anyway,\u201d he said Monday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe dispute exemplifies how moving from a slogan to actual legislation may be more tricky for Republicans than they expected. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that\u2019s an easy change,\u201d said Joseph Antos, a health care analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing easy about changing any one sentence in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAnd the issue goes beyond the health care law.\n\nThe House and Senate also will move almost immediately to approve the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico \u2014 but at a time when the price of oil is so low, investment in Canadian tar sands is expected to dry up.\n\nThe House on Tuesday will approve a new rule for the coming Congress mandating that the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimate the cost of all \u201cmajor legislation\u201d factoring in the bill\u2019s impact on economic growth. That might make tax cuts appear less costly to the Treasury, but depending on how budget office fulfills it, the rule change could also make Democratic bills, like the major infrastructure legislation the House will introduce Tuesday, appear less expensive.\n\nStill, Republican leaders and their allies are pushing to change the definition of part-time employment under the health law. After a yearlong delay, the law\u2019s \u201cemployer mandate\u201d will go partly into force this month, meaning that businesses with 100 or more full-time employees will have to offer at least 70 percent of their workers health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nBusiness groups say companies that employ low-wage, low-skilled workers are most likely to reduce their hours below the threshold to avoid the penalty, since such businesses are the most sensitive to worker costs.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about who we\u2019ve heard from, admittedly anecdotally, the biggest problem is for those workers traditionally not offered health insurance,\u201d said Katie W. Mahoney, executive director for health policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThey also point to a study by George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, which receives much of its funding from business groups, that suggests as many as four million workers could have their hours cut below 30 by employers avoiding mandated health coverage.\n\nBut other conservatives point to a simple fact: Far more Americans work 40 hours or more than those who work about 30.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMore than half of all workers maintain at least a 40-hour workweek, according to a study by the Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based foundation that studies health care. Most of them already get employer-provided health insurance, but about 9 percent \u2014 or 2.6 million Americans \u2014 do not.\n\n\u201cAt a full-time definition of 40 hours per week, there are more than twice as many workers at high risk of hours reductions because they are within five hours of the full-time definition at firms that do not offer health insurance coverage,\u201d the study concluded.\n\nBy pushing those workers onto the federally subsidized health insurance exchanges, the definition change would also increase the federal deficit by $73.7 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The White House last year promised that President Obama would veto the bill, a vow likely to be reissued this week.\n\nAs the job market strengthens, employers will be less inclined to cut hours or drop coverage because workers will be able to look elsewhere for better benefits, said Stuart Butler, who spent 35 years at the conservative Heritage Foundation before moving to the Brookings Institution.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing as much of a change of behavior among employers as some of us had feared,\u201d Mr. Butler said. \u201cAnd I think that would be the case here, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150105210725, "twitter": {"description": "The legislative priority for the new Republican Congress would change the definition of a full workweek, under the Affordable Care Act, to 40 hours, rather than 30.", "title": "Resistance From Right Slows G.O.P.
