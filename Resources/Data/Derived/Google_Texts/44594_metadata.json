( Don Reichert / Colorado State Athletics )\n\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 If this doesn't get fans to come back to Moby Arena in droves, then nothing probably will.\n\nIn game that Colorado State virtually had to win in order to put together a resume worthy of an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, the Rams came through with a 79-73 victory over visiting San Diego State on Saturday night.\n\nCSU is now 18-2 (5-2 in the Mountain West), the best record in program history through 20 games. But entering the night, the Rams had no wins against the RPI top 50. And with the way things stand now, the Aztecs (ranked 22nd in the RPI coming in) were the only chance for the CSU to earn one those coveted quality wins the selection committee looks for come March.\n\nAs much as players try to ignore such things, the Rams knew what was at stake.\n\n\"We knew what was on the line, but we try not to really look at that stuff,\" said CSU senior guard Daniel Bejarano, who was one of three Rams in double figures with 14 points to go along with a team-best five assists. \"We just play ball. We try not to really get ahead. San Diego State's coming in here, we have to handle business. That's what we tried to do.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCSU finished the night 12 for 21 from the 3-point line and 17 for 22 from the free-throw line. The Rams' 79 points were the most scored in regulation all season against the normally stingy Aztecs, who came in ranked third in the nation in scoring defense (52.6). Along with shooting the 3 well and getting to the free-throw line, CSU did what few SDSU opponents have done all season in taking care of the ball, turning over just five times compared to 15 assists.\n\nJ.J. Avila scored a game-best 29 points Saturday to lead Colorado State to a 79-73 win over San Diego State. (Don Reichert/ Colorado State Athletics)\n\n\"It was a neat game. They way I saw the game, we just came out and torched it,\" CSU coach Larry Eustachy said. \"(We) knew they were going to get back in this game, and they knew we were going to want it. I thought our team did great. We could do better, but I thought we did just enough to get the win and move on.\n\n\"That's an exceptional team we just beat, so I'm proud of our guys.\"\n\nJ.J. Avila was in a groove all night, going 12 of 16 from the floor for a game-best 29 points, the most a Ram has scored in game all season. Stanton Kidd made 8 of 10 free throws and scored all 14 of his points in the second half as the third player in double figures for CSU.\n\n\"(The key was) just taking good shots. Don't force anything. When I see the double-team coming, I try and leave before it gets there or find an open pass,\" Avila said. \"Really just being patient, working the clock down and just getting in the long post and seeing what I could do, seeing what good play I could make for the team. Things worked out.\"\n\nSDSU coach Steve Fisher said Avila was the Aztecs' top priority defensively. But the Rams' balanced offense and Avila's awareness thwarted that plan.\n\n\"We wanted to double him when he got it there (in the paint). Sometimes, though, he got it too high up where it is hard to double,\" Fisher said. \"Other times we were going with a different lineup and Malik (Pope) was the guy who was supposed to double, but he was hesitant to do the double while guarding (Stanton) Kidd.\"\n\nThe Rams never trailed in the game, but it was from a one-sided contest.\n\nIn front of a sold-out crowd of 8,745, mostly all dressed in white, CSU came out white-hot right from the opening tip. They needed every bit of the fast start in order to hold off a sustained comeback bid by the visiting Aztecs.\n\nThe Rams made their first six 3-pointers (two each by Bejarano, Avila and Joe De Ciman) and none of them even touched the rim. The final two of those 3s were by De Ciman, the start of an 11-0 CSU run that gave the Rams a 17-point lead (25-8) just 8 minutes in.\n\nBut things quickly began to even out.\n\nStarting with a 3 by Matt Shrigley, SDSU made 9 of their final 12 shots to end the first half, getting the Aztecs within two at one point on a jumper by Malik Pope, who fueled the SDSU comeback bid with 22 points (9-for-11 shooting) and seven rebounds in just 28 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile CSU went ice-cold, missing 10 straight from the field during a 6-minute stretch. But Gian Clavell helped rescue the Rams from a complete first-half collapse by scoring seven points in the final 2 minutes of the frame.\n\nWhen the first-half fireworks finally settled, the Rams went into the break with an eight-point lead, 40-32.\n\nClavell's performance to end the first half, which included a four-point play, made a world of difference in terms of momentum. Had he not scored those seven points, who knows what the final outcome would've been.\n\n\"It was huge,\" Eustachy said of Clavell's end to the first half. \"We're still building this program, so I thought it was big to get a decent cushion because our guys had a better foundation knowing that they can do this. It was big to stretch this thing out.\"\n\nCSU stretched its lead to 12 three times in the second half, but never led by more than six in the final four minutes. After a free throw by Aqeel Quinn cut the CSU lead all the way down to two, 75-73, with 1:50 to play, the Rams sealed it with an Avila layup with 18 seconds left and consecutive missed 3s by Quinn in the waning seconds.\n\nThe sellout was the eighth at Moby since the 2010-11 season. CSU improved to 5-3 in those games, including winners of five of the past six.\n\nThe Rams now have one fewer day off than normal and head out on the road to play at Boise State (14-6, 4-3) on Tuesday.\n\nSean Star: 970-669-5050, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/seanvstar\n\nSpencer 0-1 1-2 1, Quinn 3-12 4-5 10, Shepard 0-5 2-4 2, O'Brien 7-15 0-3 14, Shrigley 6-7 0-0 16, Chol 0-1 0-0 0, Allen 1-2 0-0 2, Kell 2-5 2-3 6, Pope 9-11 0-0 22.
