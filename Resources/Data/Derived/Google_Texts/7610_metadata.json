Children in particular are at higher risks of developing obesity if they consume soda frequently and routinely with meals. According to the CDC, obese children are at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, stroke, cancer, osteoarthritis, and other chronic diseases when they get older. Preventing childhood obesity is important, especially among fast food chains who have a responsibility to offer healthy options to Americans.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dairy queen soda", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In an attempt to curb childhood obesity, diabetes, and overall unhealthy lifestyles, Dairy Queen is removing soda from its menus.", "title": "Dairy Queen Sacks Soda From Its Menu", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dairy-queen-latest-fast-food-chain-remove-soda-its-menu-333654", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/dairy-queen_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In an attempt to curb childhood obesity, diabetes, and overall unhealthy lifestyles, Dairy Queen is removing soda from its menus.", "title": "Dairy Queen Sacks Soda From Its Menu", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dairy-queen-latest-fast-food-chain-remove-soda-its-menu-333654", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/dairy-queen_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/15/dairy-queen_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-05-15T17:42:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-15T17:42:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In an attempt to curb childhood obesity, diabetes, and overall unhealthy lifestyles, Dairy Queen is removing soda from its menus."}, "article_summary": "Dairy Queen is now the latest fast food franchise to ban soda from its menu, according to an announcement letter the company penned to the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\nPreventing childhood obesity is important, especially among fast food chains who have a responsibility to offer healthy options to Americans.\nDairy Queen is one of several fast food chains, like McDonald\u2019s and Chipotle, that are trying to turn over new leaves by offering lower calorie options, or healthier foods on their menu, or even removing GMO\u2019s from their ingredients.\nChildren in particular are at higher risks of developing obesity if they consume soda frequently and routinely with meals.\n\u201cI am pleased to inform you that during our most recent meeting, the [Franchise Advisory Council (FAC)] voted unanimously to remove soft drinks from our kids\u2019 menu,\u201d William Barrier, executive vice president of product development/quality at Dairy Queen, wrote in the letter."}
