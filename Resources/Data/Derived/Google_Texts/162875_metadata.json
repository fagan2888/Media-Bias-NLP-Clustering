Rather, you should ask yourself, \u201cWhich scenario would be more damaging?\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ll find that Donald Trump is the form of the Destructor.\n\nBut Hillary is the worst, most evil, liberal ever!\n\nYes. You should be counting on it. Hillary, as you may have noticed, does not have the charisma of Barack Obama. Not only will she be divisive and ethically compromised, but Hillary will also galvanize the Right. Her presidency \u2014 even more now that she\u2019s dropped the pretense of centrism \u2014 would reinforce the traditional ideological distinctions we\u2019ve debated for years. Republicans would almost certainly unite against her agenda, which will be little more than codifying Obama\u2019s legacy \u2014 a collection of policies that half the country still hates.\n\nHillary\u2019s presidency would reinforce the traditional ideological distinctions we\u2019ve debated for years. She won\u2019t be able to pass anything substantive. The most likely outcome is another four to eight years of trench warfare in D.C., with a number of winnable, state-level issues for conservatives. Probably, if historical disposition of the electorate holds, a Republican Congress. (Who knows what happens to Congress if Trump is elected.) Hardly ideal. But unless you believe that an active Washington is the best Washington, gridlock is not the end of the world.\n\nThe myth that Democrats get everything will persist. But despite plenty of well-earned criticism, the GOP has been a more effective minority party than constituents give them credit for. People are frustrated, but the idealists have (had?) been gaining ground since the Tea Party emerged. Their presence has put a stop to an array of progressive reform efforts that the pre-2010 GOP would surely have gone along with.\n\nWith a Trump presidency this dynamic disintegrates.\n\nTrump\u2019s inclination is never to free Americans from the state, but rather to do a better job administering the state through great deals and assertive leadership. Just as some Republicans are already warming to the idea of his candidacy, the temptation in Congress to follow Trumpism \u2014 a philosophy based on the vagaries of one man \u2014 will be strong. Trump\u2019s inclination is never to free Americans from the state (\u201cwe\u2019re gonna take care of everybody!\u201d) but rather to do a better job administering the state through great deals and assertive leadership. Or, everything the Founders didn\u2019t want the presidency to be.\n\nSo while gridlock will still hold up most issues conservatives do care about, chances are high, considering his long history of supporting big government, that Trump would try and cobble together a populist coalition for polices they hate. This will end up marginalizing ideological conservatism from within the party.\n\nI mean, what will Reaganites gain from this presidency? The idea that Trump could dismantle Obamacare \u2014 when he backs many of its components and has yet to offer any genuine ideas about how he\u2019s going to do it \u2014 is a fantasy. The idea that Trump would name originalists to the Supreme Court is equally risible when you consider that Trump has shown absolutely no clue or inclination to understand what originalism entails.\n\nThere is little question Trump would abuse power. In some way, it\u2019s the point of his candidacy. There is little question Trump would abuse power. In some way, it\u2019s the point of his candidacy. The thing that gets his admirers excited. \u201cFinally, someone who will use the IRS for us. Someone who will circumvent Congress for us. Obama gets everything; why shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d\n\nSome Republicans, already complicit in looking the other way on executive overreach, will likely be enablers \u2014 especially when it comes to issues they can get behind, like immigration. Maybe no one cares about free markets and constitutional idealism anymore. The working class is mad! How dare you disrespect its concerns?\n\nThere\u2019s a difference between caring about the plight of working stiffs and embracing isolationism, high tariffs, and other policies that would destroy their long-term prospects. Is everyone supposed to surrender to mercantilism because it makes 30 percent of angry voters feel better? You can\u2019t let a mob run your party. And it\u2019s not a mob because it\u2019s hyper-populist or constructed around a cult of celebrity or even because it\u2019s angry \u2014 though all those things are true. The problem is that it\u2019s incoherent and nihilistic.\n\n\u201cI hate Jeb Bush, so I\u2019m going to vote for Donald Trump and burn your whole party down\u201d is a non sequitur.\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that the chances of protectionist policies passing \u2014 with a bipartisan coalition of progressives and right-protectionists \u2014 are far higher under Trump than Clinton. Why should free traders help facilitate this kind of disaster? So they can brag about having a Republican president?\n\nAt some point there\u2019s going to be a counterrevolution. None of this is to argue the conservative movement or the Republican Party is in good shape, that the status quo is working well, or that the leadership doesn\u2019t deserve what\u2019s coming. I\u2019m not saying someone shouldn\u2019t blow up the Republican Party. I\u2019m saying that that someone shouldn\u2019t be an unprincipled imposter. Because at some point there\u2019s going to be a counterrevolution. Those who swear up and down that they would never vote for Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio because they aren\u2019t conservative enough shouldn\u2019t be surprised that a large faction on the Right (more than likely, the larger faction on the Right) won\u2019t support a candidate who is adversarial to its belief system.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 08:05:42 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "To support Trump would be an exercise in pure partisanship.
