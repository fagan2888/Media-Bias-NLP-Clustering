Health insurance premiums for customers buying both private plans as well as those available from the federal marketplace will likely rise – some significantly – in 2016, the Kansas Insurance Department said Tuesday.

The state's insurance regulator said requested premium rates for individual and small-group plans showed a range from minus .4 percent to an increase of nearly 38 percent. That range is taken from requested increases that must be reviewed by the Insurance Department and then finalized in August, the department said in a news release Tuesday.

The department said insurance company plans requesting premium increases of more than 10 percent would be posted on the department's website, www.ksinsurance.org , beginning June 1.

The department noted that this is the first time insurance companies have had a full year of claims data on which to base their proposed premiums since the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act. The ACA provides subsidized insurance coverage to income-eligible applicants via the federal or any state-run.exchange. Kansas does not operate its own marketplace.

The Insurance Department said 97 health insurance plans have been proposed for sale in Kansas through the federal online marketplace, HealthCare.gov, in 2016. That number includes 11 individual plans and four small-group choices more than were available in 2015, the department said.

Open enrollment for plans on the federal exchange begins Nov. 1, 2015.
