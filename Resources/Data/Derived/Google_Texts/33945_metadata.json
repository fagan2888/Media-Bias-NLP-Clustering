While blackjack has been doing this for years now, to the point where half of all blackjack wagers are side bets, there is no other active poker side bet right now and our introduction will pave the way.\u201d\n\nPerseverance was the key for Chaurette, who got tipped off a year ago by an industry representative that poker side bets would be the wave of the future. \u201cWe were concerned such an option might be a violation of our gaming compact signed in 2003, but while the compact was written for blackjack, it wasn\u2019t considered for poker. I got the Arizona Department of Gaming to take a look, and we found a way around any gray areas in the compact with official approval given three weeks ago. We have a 13 table poker room and every table will now allow a side bet option.\u201d\n\nThe concept has become a fast-track reality with dealers already trained, and the program already implemented where a one dollar side bet could bring up to a one thousand dollar return. \u201cThis new side bet option in poker is one of the most innovative updates to the game in decades, and we\u2019re the only one offering it,\u201d said Steve Neely, chief marketing officer for Casino Del Sol Resort.\n\nRELATED: Texas\u2019s Underground, Speakeasy-Land of Gambling\n\nAccording to Chaurette, here\u2019s how it works: You get two cards with five on the board. Basically, you end up playing five of the seven cards to make the best five card hand you can. You need to use the two cards you\u2019re holding and three of the five on the board in trying for a straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, or a straight or royal flush.\n\nA straight brings $10 for a $1 bet, a flush returns $15, a full house $25, while four of a kind bring back $100, a straight flush earns $200, and the royal flush brings a grand in the form of a bill with a photo of President Grover Cleveland on it.\n\n\u201cPeople play side bets in blackjack like crazy because they bring extra excitement,\u201d Chaurette said. \u201cPoker needs to become more exciting, and the Hot Poker Spot will bring that anticipation of not only a win, but a bigger win. Side bets will be a part of the poker industry from now on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Casino managers need to make their clients happy, and the Pascua Yaqui tribe\u2019s Casino Del Sol team thinks they\u2019ve done so by introducing The Hot Poker Spot, an optional side bet", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/28/gamblings-next-big-thing-casino-lands-first-poker-side-bet-gaming-option-160176", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/cdsr_gaming_interior.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Gambling\u2019s Next Big Thing: Casino Lands First Poker-Side Bet Gaming Option"}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-28T14:28-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/28/gamblings-next-big-thing-casino-lands-first-poker-side-bet-gaming-option-160176", "dc": {"title": "Gambling\u2019s Next Big Thing: Casino Lands First Poker-Side Bet Gaming Option"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Gambling\u2019s Next Big Thing: Casino Lands First Poker-Side Bet Gaming Option"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbdd0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is groundbreaking,\u201d Casino Del Sol\u2019s poker manager Rick Chaurette, told ICTMN in an exclusive interview.\n\u201cTo my knowledge, we are the first casino, Indian or otherwise, to have a licensed and approved poker side bet.\nYou need to use the two cards you\u2019re holding and three of the five on the board in trying for a straight, flush, full house, four of a kind, or a straight or royal flush.\nCasino managers need to make their clients happy, and the Pascua Yaqui tribe\u2019s Casino Del Sol team thinks they\u2019ve done so by introducing The Hot Poker Spot, an optional side bet wager for live Texas Hold \u2019Em games.\n\u201cPeople play side bets in blackjack like crazy because they bring extra excitement,\u201d Chaurette said."}
