They hug each other warmly and share their feelings openly. Dad is even getting in touch with his inner self, writing a confessional autobiography on a typewriter he's found.\n\nAnd so when a hit squad shows up in the village to rub them all out, we're expected to root for them to escape, even if it means a steadily mounting body count of innocent bystanders. Neighbors take bullets to the head, a fireman is assassinated, an entire police station is brutally shot down.\n\nFrom a humane standpoint, our only hope is that Tommy Lee Jones \u2014 who plays the U.S. government operative charged with keeping the family alive \u2014 might at some point turn his craggy face to the camera and drawl, \"You know what? These people are just not worth it! I'm outta here!\"\n\nNever happens, of course. The Family thunders along, following the witness protection story arc of Steve Martin's My Blue Heaven by way of Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. As cinema, it's an interesting experiment. As a movie, it's a bloody mess.\n\nBill Newcott is a writer, editor and movie critic for AARP Media.", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:AARP.org", "Division1": "Division:AARP.org", "page_title": "'The Family' Sticks to Its Guns", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-01-05T19:54:09.137-05:00", "keywords": "Movie review, The Family Robert De Niro, The Family Michelle Pfeiffer, Tommy Lee Jones The Family, Luc Besson director, movies for grownups, mob movies, gangster movies, martin scoresee", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "true", "author": "Bill Newcott", "comments": "on", "source": "aarp_org", "type": "info", "description": "\"The Family\" has a classic fish-out-of-water comedy premise \u2014 a loving mob family in the witness protection plan tries to adapt to life in rural France.", "s43": "31.Entertainment|MyPersonalTime", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Entertainment/Movies for Grownups/Movie Styles/Comedy", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Entertainment/Movies for Grownups/Movie Styles/Drama", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "\"The Family\" has a classic fish-out-of-water comedy premise \u2014 a loving mob family in the witness protection plan tries to adapt to life in rural France.", "title": "The Family Movie Review, Trailer Stars Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiff... - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-09-2013/deniro-the-family-movie-review-trailer.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/2013-09/200-michelle-pfeiffer-robert-deniro-family-movies-grownups.imgcache.rev1378387135113.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-09-2013/deniro-the-family-movie-review-trailer", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "entertainment", "IALevel2": "movies-for-grownups", "IALevel3": "info-09-2013", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-24"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf1c\"", "article_summary": "The Family thunders along, following the witness protection story arc of Steve Martin's My Blue Heaven by way of Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas.\nBill Newcott is a writer, editor and movie critic for AARP Media.\nDad is even getting in touch with his inner self, writing a confessional autobiography on a typewriter he's found.\nYes, indeed, because as we're repeatedly reminded, they're really just products of their mobbed-up environment.\nNeighbors take bullets to the head, a fireman is assassinated, an entire police station is brutally shot down."}
