Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis., told members of the AICPA\u2019s spring Council meeting Tuesday in Washington.\n\nRyan, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, federal budget architect, and a former vice presidential candidate, outlined his priorities since taking over the committee leadership at the beginning of the current session of Congress. The job is one reason Ryan, who was Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012, is not himself running for president in 2016, he said, since it gives him a chance to steer reforming the tax Code.\n\n\u201cThis is what I\u2019ve been fighting for since I became a member of Congress,\u201d said Ryan, who was first elected to the House in 1998.\n\nWays and Means has already made a \u201cdown payment\u201d on tax reform by passing out of committee bills that would make permanent certain \u201cextender\u201d provisions, he said. They include the credit for research and development activities, higher expensing limits for business depreciable property, and certain deductions for charitable contributions. As temporary provisions, they have been renewed every year or two, most recently last December. This stopgap approach plagues the U.S. economy with uncertainty, Ryan said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s no way to run a railroad; we don\u2019t want to see that happen again,\u201d he said.\n\nBroader goals for tax reform, which Ryan hopes to accomplish next year, include lowering rates and changing America\u2019s \u201cByzantine\u201d worldwide tax regime, which taxes income earned anywhere in the world, to a territorial one that taxes only U.S. income, he said.\n\n\u201cFor us, tax reform is broadening the base for lowering rates across the board,\u201d he said. Individuals, including those reporting income from passthrough businesses such as S corporations and partnerships, pay marginal rates as high as about 44.6%, he said, taking into account a 39.6% top marginal rate, the net investment income tax of 3.8%, and the effect of the personal exemption phaseout and itemized deduction limitation that can apply to high-income taxpayers.\n\nHowever, he said, \u201cnot to be too partisan, but we have a president who will not lower individual rates.\u201d\n\nCorporations pay tax at a top rate of 35%, which creates a \u201cmismatch\u201d with passthrough businesses, which are more numerous. Yet even the corporate rate is higher than the worldwide average among industrialized countries, Ryan noted.\n\n\u201cThis is not good for America\u2019s competitiveness,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986, P.L. 99-514, capped rates at 28%, which \u201ctipped off a worldwide tax reform craze, where countries lowered their tax rates,\u201d Ryan said. Now, the United States is \u201con the bad receiving end\u201d of a global tax reform movement \u201cbecause we have one of the worst tax codes in the industrialized world.\u201d\n\nThe worldwide tax regime is \u201cpushing capital overseas, triggering foreign takeovers of foreign companies buying U.S. companies, and encouraging inversions,\u201d in which a multinational company based in the United States replaces its U.S. parent with a foreign parent, thereby potentially avoiding U.S. taxation on some or all of its profits.\n\nIn response to a question from a Council member about uncertainty her midsize CPA firm experienced \u201cdue to the new laws\u201d in maintaining and affording health care coverage for its partners and employees, Ryan said he hoped health coverage will become more affordable. But, he said, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature achievement, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, P.L. 111-148, will \u201ccollapse under its own weight,\u201d causing more uncertainty for some period before the marketplace offers greater certainty.\n\n\u2014 Paul Bonner is a JofA senior editor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a speech to the AICPA\u2019s spring Council meeting, Rep.
