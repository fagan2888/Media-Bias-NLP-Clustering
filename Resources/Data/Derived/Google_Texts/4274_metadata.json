The research aligns with past studies that show sharp drops in the rate of uninsured in Kentucky since the Affordable Care Act was implemented.\n\nBenitez and his colleagues also found declines in the number of people lacking a regular source of health care and those with unmet medical needs.\n\n\u201cWe do find large up upticks in coverage among people under $25,000 of annual income as well as large improvements in having an unmet medical need because of cost,\u201d Benitez said.\n\nResearchers focused on adults between 25 and 64-years-old who earned an annual household income up to $25,000, using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Medicaid Expansion Report, compiled by Deloitte Consulting and commissioned by then-Gov. Steve Beshear, said a total of 310,887 people enrolled in Medicaid in 2014.\n\nThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act was done under former Beshear, a Democrat, by executive order. Under the ACA, Beshear expanded Medicaid to residents who earned 138 percent of the federal poverty limit.\n\nCurrent Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, is moving forward with plans to dismantle Kynect, the state\u2019s health care exchange, and reform the state\u2019s Medicaid system. Recently, Bevin announced the creation of Benefind, a website that will replace Kynect as the way for Medicaid beneficiaries and other welfare recipients to apply for services starting Feb. 29.\n\nRelated Story Bevin Offers Hints \u2014 But Few Details \u2014 of Future Medicaid Reforms In Kentucky\n\nBut Benitez said those transitions could reverse the progress the state has made in lowering its uninsured rate. Before the ACA, Kentucky\u2019s uninsured rate was 20.4 percent. Now, it\u2019s 7.5 percent.\n\n\u201cIt does seem like a large segment of people, not just among the low-income group but even some incomes \u2026 above $25,000 or even higher incomes are engaged in using Kynect \u2026 as a way to identify coverage,\u201d he said.\n\nBeshear recently launched the non-profit Board for Save Kentucky Healthcare. In a statement, he said \u201cthis recent analysis highlights a long and successful track record of providing sustainable healthcare coverage to Kentucky residents most in need.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s new Medicaid commissioner recently told legislators that the expansion will cost the state about 20 percent more over the next two years, to $3.7 billion. Bevin has said the Medicaid expansion and Kynect are too costly for the state.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "A new study says the number of low-income Kentuckians without health insurance declined by 68 percent in the first year of the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion.
