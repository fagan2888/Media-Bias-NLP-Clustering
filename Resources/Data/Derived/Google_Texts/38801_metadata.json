Russell is definitely on the right side of the political spectrum.\n\nHe first generated controversy in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter with some comments about increased gun control as a response to terrorism in the U.S.:\n\n\u201cIf you think gun control is going to change the terrorists\u2019 point of view, I think you\u2019re, like, out of your mind.. I think it\u2019s absolutely insane. If I\u2019m a hockey team and I\u2019ve got some guy bearing down on me as a goaltender, I\u2019m not concerned about what he\u2019s gonna do \u2014 I\u2019m gonna make him concerned about what I\u2019m gonna do to stop him. That\u2019s when things change.\u201d\n\nThe profile of his comments increased even more when he repeated his opinions on The View. Russell also acknowledges an extreme reluctance to talk politics, as well:\n\nHe laid out a broader explanation of his political opinions in an interview with The Daily Beast, detailing how examining the perspectives of the founders of the country influenced him:\n\n\u201cWhen I was a young guy, I was finding myself not quite being able to see the things that were going on and buy into a political culture. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I finally said, \u2018Why don\u2019t I go back and see what the Founding Fathers were all about, and see how that stacked up.\u2019 Well, I found them and I found libertarianism. They were pretty radical guys, and damn smart, and I just believe in that old-time stuff and think they had great ideas. Years later, I had the wonderful opportunity to go to the Cato Institute\u2019s 20th anniversary and spend some real time with some amazing people. I met some great people there, and that cemented it for me. I felt, guess what, there is a place where I can have a conversation and not be laughed at or smirked at.\u201d\n\nRussell also went so far as to call out another Hollywood libertarian, as well. Immediately after saying that he is a \u201chardcore libertarian,\u201d he said that he was not a fake one like Bill Maher, who doesn\u2019t even \u201cknow what it is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "description": "\"Why don\u2019t I go back and see what the Founding Fathers were all about...\"", "published_at": "2015-12-26T14:23:19+00:00", "author": "Michael Hausam", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"Why don\u2019t I go back and see what the Founding Fathers were all about...\"", "title": "Kurt Russell's Latest Interviews Reveal Him as the Libertarian Hero Hollywood Desperately Needs", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-501317436-e1450815244547.jpg", "height": 1290}, "updated_time": "2015-12-26T22:05:46-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/12/501219-kurt-russells-latest-interview-reveals-him-as-the-libertarian-hero-hollywood-desperately-needs/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"Why don\u2019t I go back and see what the Founding Fathers were all about...\"", "creator": "@MPHaus", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-501317436-e1450815244547.jpg", "title": "Kurt Russell's Latest Interviews Reveal Him as the Libertarian Hero Hollywood Desperately Needs", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "post_id": 501219, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-12-26T14:23:19-04:00", "wp-categories": 14082, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "tags": "Celebrities", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/12/501219-kurt-russells-latest-interview-reveals-him-as-the-libertarian-hero-hollywood-desperately-needs/", "wp-category-slugs": "celebrities-entertainment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Celebrities", "published_time": "2015-12-26T14:23:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-26T22:05:46-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/MPHaus.US/"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://static.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-501317436-e1450815244547.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "is_https": 0}, "article_summary": "If I\u2019m a hockey team and I\u2019ve got some guy bearing down on me as a goaltender, I\u2019m not concerned about what he\u2019s gonna do \u2014 I\u2019m gonna make him concerned about what I\u2019m gonna do to stop him.\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Longtime Hollywood star Kurt Russell has been making the rounds promoting the new Quentin Tarantino movie \u201cThe Hateful Eight,\u201d and reluctantly revealed some insights on his politics.\nThat\u2019s when things change.\u201dThe profile of his comments increased even more when he repeated his opinions on The View.\nThey were pretty radical guys, and damn smart, and I just believe in that old-time stuff and think they had great ideas.\nRussell is definitely on the right side of the political spectrum."}
