Pick of the week: The way Spanish maestro Jesús López-Cobos zips around the world, it’s surprising that he hasn’t been in the Twin Cities before, except to change planes. That oversight will be corrected Friday and Saturday. The conductor, who’s flying in from the Casals Festival in Puerto Rico, where he directed Saturday’s closing-night concert, will lead the Minnesota Orchestra in a program featuring music by Robert Schumann, Maurice Ravel and Manuel de Falla.

Cheat sheet: Want to amaze your workmates during your coffee break? Toss out these tidbits about Sunday’s arrival of daylight saving time.

• “Standard” time is a misnomer. We have it only four months of the year.

Thursday is St. Patrick’s Day, of course, which is followed, appropriately, by Friday’s National Awkward Moments Day.

spring cleaning: That odor in your backyard might be coming from the place your dog has been relieving itself all winter. It was OK to, uh, leave things lie in hopes the cold and snow would take care of the problem. Well, the snow and cold are gone, and now it’s your problem. Where’d you stash the pooper scooper?
