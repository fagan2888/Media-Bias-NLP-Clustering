FSLR, +0.20% and SunPower Corp. SPWR, +3.11% rose on Tuesday, while Canadian Solar Inc. CSIQ, +2.19% which has most of its manufacturing in China, declined. China-based solar companies were mostly higher, recovering some ground after losses on Monday.\n\nCanadian Solar said Tuesday it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d with the Commerce Department decision, which could have an \u201coverwhelming damaging impact on the U.S. solar industry.\u201d\n\nThe company will continue to serve the U.S. market, and by leveraging its supply chains in other countries it does not expect \u201cany significant disruption\u201d to its U.S. business, it said.\n\nShares of Canadian Solar were down 0.5%.\n\nTrina Solar Ltd. TSL, +1.14% which was hit with duties of 26.3%, the lowest among the Chinese exporters, also reiterated its intention to stay in the U.S. market and grow its business. The allegations of dumping are unfounded and against free and fair trade principles, Trina said. U.S.-listed shares of Trina Solar advanced 4%.\n\nInvestment banks also chimed in, with Citi analysts saying Monday that the specifics of the tariffs may be less negative than expected. Among Chinese manufacturers, Trina is likely \u201cbetter positioned than peers\u201d to weather the storm given its cost structure and resources, Citi said.\n\nFor U.S.-based First Solar and SunPower, the impact \u201cis relatively positive as they do not rely materially on Chinese suppliers,\u201d the Citi analysts said. \u201cWithin the US, the utility scale solar market is more price sensitive than in the residential distributed generation market and therefore the utility scale market and First Solar may see a greater positive impact.\u201d\n\nShares of First Solar rose 1.1%, while SunPower shares were up 0.4%.\n\nThe broad U.S. equity market rose on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 17,000 and the S&P 500 near a record on upbeat corporate earnings and better-than-expected consumer sentiment data.\n\nMore must-reads from MarketWatch:\n\nFrom the penitentiary to the podium: a MarketWatch special report\n\nConsumer confidence at highest since 2007\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Shares of solar companies were mixed Tuesday as recently imposed antidumping tariffs reverberate through the market.", "creator": "@ClaudiaAssisMW", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CH733_solar__MG_20140610132411.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Claudia Assis", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Markets", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Shares of solar companies were mixed Tuesday as recently imposed antidumping tariffs reverberate through the market.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/first-solar-sunpower-rise-as-canadian-solar-falls-2014-07-29", "author": "Claudia Assis", "parsely-title": "First Solar, SunPower rise as Canadian Solar falls", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-29T11:20:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Markets", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Shares of solar companies were mixed Tuesday as recently imposed antidumping tariffs reverberate through the market.", "title": "First Solar, SunPower rise as Canadian Solar falls", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/first-solar-sunpower-rise-as-canadian-solar-falls-2014-07-29", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CH733_solar__MG_20140610132411.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CH733_solar__MG_20140610132411.jpg"}, "article.id": "6320A582-172A-11E4-8DAE-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f00\"", "article_summary": "Perceived beneficiaries such as First Solar Inc.
