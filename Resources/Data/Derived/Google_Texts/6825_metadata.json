He felt responsible, in some small way, for the violent images of Islam broadcast across American screens.\n\n\u201cI realized I was becoming a slave to the industry,\u201d Ahmed said.\n\nThe role in which the actor was regularly cast, an Islamic extremist, has become almost as familiar a Hollywood clich\u00e9 as the noble savage or gold-hearted hooker.\n\nIn films and television shows from \u201c24\u201d to \u201cSyriana,\u201d Muslims are the olive-skinned evildoers who cloak their violent schemes in religious rhetoric while cursing their American adversaries.\n\nAhmed wanted no part of that anymore. He quit Hollywood and went back to waiting tables, where he compensated for the bad food with a bonhomie that would blossom into a standup comedy act.\n\nFast forward to 2014, and Ahmed, who turns 44 this month, is starring in \u201cSullivan & Son,\u201d a raunchy TBS sitcom that revels - or wallows, if you like - in political incorrectness. (CNN and TBS are both owned by Time Warner.)\n\nYes, his character - a hapless tow-truck driver also named Ahmed - endures a cringe-worthy barrage of ethnic jokes.\n\nBut it\u2019s a sign of progress, in his view, for Ahmed to be considered as ripe for ribbing as the rest of the multiethnic gang on \u201cSullivan & Son,\u201d one of the few sitcoms to feature an Arab-American Muslim who is a character, not a caricature.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to be the \u2018Arab guy\u2019 or the \u2018Muslim guy,\u2019\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cThose things fade into the background, and I\u2019m just a regular guy.\u201d\n\nFor decades, Ahmed and other Muslims say, Hollywood has put their faith very much in the foreground, often cast in an ominous light.\n\nAfter 9/11, the typecasting only increased, experts and activists say, especially for actors of Middle Eastern or Southeast Asian descent.\n\n\u201cWhen Hollywood dealt with Muslim characters it was completely one-dimensional,\u201d said Arsalan Iftikhar, an American writer and intellectual who blogs at TheMuslimGuy.com. \u201cThey were the seething terrorists, without any sort of humanizing attributes.\u201d\n\nBut American Muslims may be finally smashing the silver-screen stereotypes.\n\nGroups like the Muslim Public Affairs Council consult on screenplays, train Muslim writers and connect network honchos with budding talent.\n\nYoung Muslims are producing their own projects, with the Internet as their global studio and audience.\n\nAnd Muslim actors don\u2019t just play terrorists anymore: They play presidents and \u201cStar Trek\u201d captains.\n\nIt's not just about landing juicy acting roles, American Muslims say.\n\nHow Hollywood sees Islam influences the rest of the country and carries deep implications for civil liberties, foreign policy and interfaith relations.\n\n\"Intentionally or unintentionally, images teach people whom to fear, whom to hate, and whom to love,\" writes Jack Shaheen, a longtime scholar of how the media depicts Muslims.\n\nBillionaires, bombers and belly dancers\n\nHollywood\u2019s increasingly complex portrayal of Islam flickered across American screens this past Tuesday, when Ahmed\u2019s \u201cSullivan & Son\u201d began its third season and Fox debuted a new series from a producer of \u201c24\u201d and \u201cHomeland.\u201d\n\n\u201cTyrant,\u201d a drama, follows a California pediatrician back to his fictional Middle-Eastern homeland, where his father is a brutal dictator.\n\nThe plot, producer Howard Gordon says, is modeled on the Arab Spring and real-life tyrants like Moammar Gadhafi.\n\n\u201cTo have the opportunity to tell a story about people and put faces on the things that are merely headlines felt just too good to ignore,\" Gordon told Indiewire.\n\nIt\u2019s the same ripped-from-the-news recipe that brought the Hollywood veteran critical and commercial success with \u201cHomeland\u201d and \u201c24.\u201d\n\nBut Gordon\u2019s work has been controversial, even \u201cIslamophobic,\u201d according to some Muslim groups, for its depiction of their religion as rife with terrorists.\n\n\u201cTyrant\u201d displays some of the same problems, the Council on American-Islamic Relations complained after a screening in Washington this month.\n\n\u201cIf the only thing you saw or heard about the Middle East was watching \u2018Tyrant,\u2019 you\u2019d come away saying, \u2018Man, what a bunch of savages. They deserve whatever they get,\u2019\u201d said Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nShaheen, author of \"Reel Bad Arabs\" and other media studies, once said that Arab Muslims are limited to three roles in Hollywood: billionaires, bombers and belly dancers.\n\n\u201cIn \u2018Tyrant,\u2019 you get everything but the belly dancers,\u201d Hooper said.\n\nSecular critics weren\u2019t much kinder.\n\nWashington Post TV critic Hank Stuever called \u201cTyrant\u201d a \u201cstultifyingly acted TV drama stocked with tired and terribly broad notions of Muslim culture.\u201d\n\nGordon\u2019s agent said he could not be reached for comment.\n\nBut Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which consulted on \u201cTyrant\u201d scripts, said the show doesn\u2019t present Islam or the Middle East as a monolith. What's more, \"Tyrant,\" can help Americans understand the plight of Muslims who suffer under the brutal rule of dictators, he said.\n\n\u201cTwenty or 30 years ago, a show like `Tyrant\u2019 would have turned into a clash-of-civilizations plotline. With Howard, it\u2019s about the human dimensions and social realities, and how everyone is responsible for creating tyrants.\u201d\n\nAl-Marayati said he considers Gordon a partner who takes MPAC's suggestions seriously.\n\nFor example, the \u201cTyrant\u201d script was changed to make clear that one character\u2019s poor treatment of women does not derive from Islam, Al-Marayati said.\n\n\u201cWe made the point that it's not religion that drives this behavior,\u201d Al-Marayati said. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal choice.\u201d\n\nGordon has said the Muslim Public Affairs Council had a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on \u201cTyrant\u201d from the beginning of production.\n\n\u201cI tried to address their concerns regarding cultural inaccuracies and potentially incendiary characterizations,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cI may not always have been entirely successful, but the dialogue has always been open and fluid.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between the council and Gordon wasn\u2019t always so rosy.\n\nThe Muslim council opened its Hollywood bureau after 9/11 to counter negative images of Islam in popular culture. Season four of \u201c24,\u201d which broadcast in 2005, was one of its biggest tests.\n\nThe plot centered on a seemingly nice, middle-class Muslim-American family who were secretly scheming to launch a nuclear attack on the United States.\n\nThe council was one of several Muslim groups concerned about the sleeper-cell story line.\n\n\u201cThey were creating this idea in people\u2019s minds that your neighbor, who you think is a doctor and has a lovely home, is actually plotting an attack on the country,\u201d explained Deana Nassar, the council\u2019s Hollywood liaison.\n\n\u201cIt was a very scary indictment.\u201d\n\nMembers of the council met with the shows producers, including Gordon, to convey their concerns.\n\nInitially, the \u201c24\u201d team resisted the council\u2019s entreaties, citing creative license, until they realized that their show might put real Muslims in danger, said Nassar.\n\nFox agreed to run a disclaimer before each episode of \u201c24,\u201d stating that American Muslims denounce terrorism. More importantly, the council said, \u201c24\u201d began to feature more Muslim \u201cgood guys\u201d and fewer Islamic terrorists.\n\n\u201c\u201924\u2019 is a big success story for us,\u201d Nassar said.\n\nBut others weren\u2019t so sure.\n\nShaheen, the media scholar, said the disclaimer before \u201c24\u201d was laughable, and the addition of more likeable characters was a silly sop to placate Muslims.\n\n\u201cIt was like, \u2018OK, we vilified you in seasons four and five but now we\u2019ll make it up to you,\u201d he said.\n\nAl-Marayati and other Muslims acknowledge that modern Islam faces unique challenges. Terrorist groups like al Qaeda and Boko Haram weren\u2019t dreamed up by screenwriters. They are real threats to international security.\n\nThe council said its goal isn\u2019t to erase all negative images of Islam in Hollywood. It\u2019s to persuade producers and writers to include balanced, accurate and nuanced views of Muslims in their work. And it hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\n\u201cHollywood still has a long way to go to humanize Muslims,\u201d Al-Marayati acknowledged. \u201cBut we have to start somewhere. We can\u2019t just throw up our hands and refuse to engage.\u201d\n\nFrom Aladdin to Alice\n\nFew Muslim groups engage Hollywood as much as the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which has built relationships with studio executives at all four major networks, and consulted on shows from \u201cSeventh Heaven\u201d to \u201cBones.\u201d\n\nMore recently, the council advised \u201cProject X-Ray,\u201d an upcoming film about Guantanamo Bay, and a project with actor Forest Whitaker about a Muslim ex-con adjusting to life outside prison.\n\nEven when the Muslim council sharply disagrees with a television show or film, it often calls for consultation, rather than cancellation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for us not to act like watchdogs,\u201d Nassar said, \u201cbecause we don\u2019t want to discourage executives from doing stories about Arabs and Muslims.\u201d\n\nStill, word of a recent ABC project called \u201cAlice in Arabia\u201d prompted a quick call from Nassar to network executives.\n\nAccording to ABC, \u201cAlice\u201d was to be a dramatic series about an American teenager who gets kidnapped and taken to Saudi Arabia, where she copes with life \u201cbehind the veil.\u201d\n\nMany American Muslims said the show\u2019s premise \u201creinforces old racist tropes\u201d about dark-skinned men threatening white women.\n\nThis tweet pretty much sums up the sentiment.\n\nHollywood Depictions of Muslims: 1) Terrorists 2) Oppressed Women 3) Racist Immigrants 4) Oil Sheiks 5) Religious Zealots #AliceInArabia \u2014 Khaled Bey (@KhaledBeydoun) March 18, 2014\n\nABC quickly canceled the show, saying that the \u201cconversation\u201d about \u201cAlice in Arabia\u201d was \u201cnot what we envisioned\u201d and \u201ccertainly not conducive to the creative process.\u201d\n\nTo Nassar, an entertainment lawyer by training, the \u201cAlice\u201d incident reminder her of watching \u201cAladdin\u201d as a child.\n\nThe Disney movie, which takes place in a fictional sultanate, presented Arab culture as a \u201cwhole new world\u201d apart from Nassar\u2019s home in California.\n\n\u201cI loved that movie, and I was like, 'Wow, that\u2019s where my people come from?\u2019 It\u2019s so scary and mysterious,\u2019\u201d Nassar said.\n\n\u201cBut the the time is over for America to look at that place and its people as mysterious and exotic. We\u2019re here. We\u2019re in America. We\u2019re so integrated in this society that you know we\u2019re the same.\u201d\n\nMuslims are not only integrated in the United States, they\u2019re highly successful here, according to studies.\n\nMore than 80% of Muslims say they are satisfied with their lives in this country, according to Gallup surveys, which also show that only American Jews have higher education levels.\n\nThe country\u2019s estimated 3 million to 6 million Muslims are congressmen, business leaders, doctors, lawyers, and, increasingly, actors and filmmakers.\n\n\u201cThe millennial generation is starting to push back on their parents\u2019 imposition of career choices,\u201d said Iftikhar of TheMuslimGuy.com. \u201cThere are more Muslim artists, actors, academics, writers and comedians.\u201d\n\nAnd, with the help of groups like the Muslim Public Affairs Council, they\u2019re making inroads in highly competitive Tinseltown.\n\nEarlier this month, for example, the council partnered with the Disney/ABC Television Group to host a screenwriters\u2019 workshop.\n\nThirty-five young Muslim writers applied for a spot by writing sample scripts for their favorite shows; a dozen were accepted.\n\nAt the daylong event, ABC executives and a dozen young Muslim men and women, a few in colorful headscarves, crowded around a long table at the council\u2019s Los Angeles office.\n\n(The workshop was closed to the media, but the council sent a description and photos, and connected CNN with participants.)\n\nThe Hollywood insiders offered advice on how to write compelling stories, pitch projects and get good gigs on studio lots.\n\n\u201cIt's a journey to work in this business,\u201d Tim McNeal, ABC\u2019s head of creative talent development, told the writers, according to a statement released by the council.\n\n\u201cWe are here to help you along your journey. If you choose to work in a creative space in television, please think of us as a resource.\u201d\n\nHala Alsaman, an Iraqi-Canadian who applied for the workshop with a \u201cspec\u201d script on \u201cMad Men,\u201d said she appreciated the writing tips, but the chance to network with ABC executives was even more valuable.\n\nThe benefits behind the workshop can run both ways, the Muslim council and ABC said. Muslims get a voice at the writers\u2019 table, and networks can tap into new and diverse talent pools.\n\n\u201cIf we get even one person inside Hollywood who can be a source of good information about Muslims, that\u2019s our goal,\u201d Al-Marayati said.\n\nBut the information source doesn't always have to be screenwriters. Sometimes the actors can change the scripts as well.\n\nA Muslim president\n\nThose e-mail chains forwarded from your grandmother are right: America has had a Muslim president.\n\nHis name is Faran Tahir, and he played President Patel in the 2013 sci-fi flick \u201cElysium.\u201d\n\nThe 50-year-old actor also may be the first South Asian cast into outer space. He played Capt. Robau in J.J. Abrams\u2019 2009 \u201cStar Trek\u201d reboot.\n\nYes, both plots are fictional, but they\u2019re not trivial, Tahir said.\n\n\u201cThe movies might be futuristic. But the person sitting in the theaters has to accept it as a possibility.\u201d\n\nTahir didn\u2019t have an easy road in Hollywood. There weren\u2019t many roles for Pakistani-American actors 30 years ago. He couldn\u2019t find mentors or hold down an apartment. He lived in his car for a while.\n\nBut Tahir built up his chops by acting in plays while waiting for film and television roles to trickle in, and turning down parts when they felt too much like typecasting.\n\nThose oversimplifications often resulted from laziness, not an anti-Islamic agenda, the actor said, and Muslims must remember that sometimes stereotypes are accurate.\n\n\u201cIf a show is being based on current affairs, let\u2019s not forget that in this war on terrorism there are people who are doing some terrible things,\u201d Tahir said.\n\nThe actor estimates that he\u2019s played five or six Muslim terrorists during the past 15 years, but he\u2019s also played radiologists, principals and sci-fi characters.\n\n\u201cThings are definitely starting to change,\u201d Tahir said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in this culture long enough. We\u2019ve been through what everyone else has been through.\u201d\n\nThe actor himself was the source of one big change in his most famous role to date, playing the villain in the 2008 film \u201cIron Man.\u201d\n\nThe script called for his character, Raza, to be a Muslim terrorist. \u201cThat would have been fine if the movie was about current affairs,\u201d Tahir said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a superhero movie. Why would we have to bring in such a sensitive subject?\u201d\n\nThe actor said the \u201cIron Man\u201d producers agreed and stripped the religious references from the script. Tahir wasn\u2019t the only Muslim-American actor to benefit from the revisions.\n\nAhmed Ahmed, the comedian who once quit Hollywood, was cast as one of Tahir\u2019s fellow mercenaries.\n\nHe said he still had some qualms about playing a dark-skinned villain, but the chance to be part of a blockbuster movie was too good to turn down.\n\nAhmed said he\u2019s also started to take typecasting less seriously. He recently starred in a \u201cFunny or Die\u201d short film about \u201cHow to be a Terrorist - in Hollywood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gotten so out of control with the one-sided depictions of the Middle East,\u201d he said, \u201cwe might as well try to have some fun with it.\u201d\n\nBut as he drove onto the Warner Bros. lot on a recent morning, international affairs were far from Ahmed\u2019s mind.\n\nTwenty years ago he was a struggling actor, knocking around the same studio lot, just trying to find a job.\n\nNow, the third season of \u201cSullivan & Son\u201d was about to air, and the actor was readying for a stand-up comedy tour with fellow cast members. It took a long time, but by his lights, he\u2019s made it in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still playing an Arab character,\u201d he said with a laugh, \u201cbut I\u2019m not playing a terrorist!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Editor Los Angeles (CNN) \u2013 For years, Ahmed Ahmed\u2019s acting resume read like a rap sheet.
