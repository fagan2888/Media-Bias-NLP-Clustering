This cause of death knows no geographic boundaries and makes no distinction between race, age, or social class. There is, however, one salient similarity among global suicide trends that researchers can\u2019t help but notice: Men commit suicide more than women. The reason why is unclear, although there seem to be several social and possibly even biological factors at play.\n\nSecond Leading Cause of Death\n\nIf you are a man between the ages of 20 and 34, one of the biggest threats to your life is not violence or terminal cancer, but rather your own hands. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2011 report on U.S. males' leading causes of death, suicide comes in second for this demographic. In the UK, where more men died from suicide in 2014 than in all the wars since 1945, suicide is the number one cause of death for young men.\n\nAnd while this behavior is commonly associated with white males, the Suicide Prevention Resource Center reports that suicide ranks third among leading causes of death for young black males.\n\nIt\u2019s not just young men who are affected by suicide, however. The rates have recently gone up for middle-aged white men, Garra Lloyd-Lester, youth suicide prevention specialist at the Suicide Prevention Center of NYS, told Medical Daily. Statistically, as a man\u2019s age increases, so does his risk of suicide. In 2013, the highest suicide rate was among people aged 45 to 64 years of age. The second highest rates were in those 85 years and older.\n\nAlthough suicide rates in general have spiked, male rates have consistently remained higher than those among women. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, in 2013 men were four times more likely than women to die from suicide, and as reported by Mosaic Science, in some areas nearly eight in 10 of all suicides were male.\n\n\u201cThe rates of completed suicides have always been higher for men,\u201d Lloyd-Lester said. So, the question remains: why?\n\nThe Enigma of Manhood\n\nMany experts in mental health and suicide believe that society\u2019s rigid idea of what it means to be a man is actually lethal. For example, according to Martin Seager, a clinical psychologist and consultant to the Samaritans, a volunteer-based charity providing emotional support to anyone in emotional distress, the idea that manhood is a tangible entity which can be both earned and lost is detrimental to a man\u2019s feeling of self-worth.\n\n\u201cThe masculine gender feels they\u2019re responsible for providing and protecting others and for being successful,\u201d Seager told Mosaic Science. \u201cWhen a woman becomes unemployed, it\u2019s painful, but she doesn\u2019t feel like she\u2019s lost her sense of identity or femininity. When a man loses his work, he feels he\u2019s not a man.\u201d\n\nAlong with these nearly impossible to reach social expectations, men are historically told to keep their problems to themselves and never show weakness.\n\n\u201cMen tend to ask for help differently than women do and less often than women,\u201d Lloyd-Lester said. Unfortunately, it's help that could mean the difference between a suicide attempt and a suicide death.\n\nSociety also tends to present the idea of \u201cman as an island,\u201d another possible explanation for higher rates.\n\n\u201cAlthough women might think about suicide very seriously, because of their social connectedness, they may also think, \u2018My God, what will my kids do? What will my mum think?\u2019 So there\u2019s forbearance from completing the act,\u201d said Dr. Brian Little, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, as reported by Mosaic Science.\n\nSuicide is the second leading cause of death for American men between the ages of 20 and 34.

The idea of a suicide gene is an unproven yet interesting theory that could explain the gender disparity. The best candidate for this elusive suicide gene is SKA2, a gene which plays a role in controlling stress hormones, Newsweek reported.\n\n\u201cStress is like driving,\u201d Dr. Zachary Kaminsky, a researcher involved with the John Hopkins University research on the gene, told Newsweek. \u201cYou can drive really fast, and that can be useful, but you have to be able to slow down.\u201d\n\nSKA2, in essence, acts as the \u201cbreak\u201d to \u201cslow down\u201d the stress process. Researchers speculate that in some individuals this break is faulty. By looking at just this one gene, the team was able to predict with 80 to 90 percent accuracy whether an individual had thoughts of suicide or had made an attempt. The gene is also linked with the cortisol system, which does not interact with the female estrogen system, Kaminsky explained, which could shed light on suicide's stark gender differences.\n\nThe problem of male suicide doesn\u2019t seem to lie in male depression either. Women report higher rates of depression than men and more women attempt suicide in their lives than men do. The difference lies in the way that men and women carry out their suicide attempts.\n\n\u201cThe research would suggest that part of the reason for that is that men tend to use more lethal means,\u201d Lloyd-Lester said.\n\nThe preferred method of suicide among men in 2012 was firearms, a weapon reported as having the highest incidences of suicide death. The preferred method of suicide for women in the same year was poisoning, a method with one of the lowest incideces of suicide death. These choice methods give insight into the mind of the individual attempting suicide and may reflect differences in the manner that men and women seek help. For women, suicide may be viewed as a cry for help, while for men suicide is a clear execution attempt.\n\nAccording to Lloyd-Lester, there is even speculation that health professionals may treat men and women seeking help for suicidal thoughts differently.\n\nClosing The Gap And Ending The Epidemic\n\nOne of the best ways to address the male problem of suicide is by adapting society\u2019s idea of \u201cmanhood.\u201d Changing the ways that young boys view what it means to be a man may help them to develop help-seeking behavior when they get older.\n\n\u201cOne form of suicide prevention is to change the messages we give young boys about what it means to be a man,\u201d Lloyd-Lester said. \u201cTheoretically this makes sense. We start changing those messages for young boys later in life and change their expectations for seeking help.\u201d\n\nIf you or anyone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts or exhibiting suicidal behavior, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-8255, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to help individuals in suicidal crises within the United States.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "suicide", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Research suggests there may be social and biological factors for the higher rate of male suicide attempts that result in death compared to females.", "title": "Male Suicide And The Deadly Y Chromosome", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/understanding-male-suicide-how-social-and-biological-factors-created-deadly-gender-333920", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/18/sad-and-depressed-man.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research suggests there may be social and biological factors for the higher rate of male suicide attempts that result in death compared to females.", "title": "Male Suicide And The Deadly Y Chromosome", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/understanding-male-suicide-how-social-and-biological-factors-created-deadly-gender-333920", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/18/sad-and-depressed-man.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/18/sad-and-depressed-man.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-05-18T17:22:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-19T10:28:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Research suggests there may be social and biological factors for the higher rate of male suicide attempts that result in death compared to females."}, "article_summary": "For women, suicide may be viewed as a cry for help, while for men suicide is a clear execution attempt.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2011 report on U.S. males' leading causes of death, suicide comes in second for this demographic.\nThe preferred method of suicide among men in 2012 was firearms, a weapon reported as having the highest incidences of suicide death.\nAlthough suicide rates in general have spiked, male rates have consistently remained higher than those among women.\nThe rates have recently gone up for middle-aged white men, Garra Lloyd-Lester, youth suicide prevention specialist at the Suicide Prevention Center of NYS, told Medical Daily."}
