But that\u2019s not what\u2019s raising eyebrows. In Florida, managed care health plans will dominate the market place, and the emergence of a new system has some wondering, what is an EPO?\n\nFirst the bad news. According to Florida\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation, healthcare costs will rise an average of 9.5 percent next year. Now, the good news: many consumers won\u2019t pay that.\n\n\u201cThese average Florida family will not see a 9.5 percent increase. Nothing near it,\" said Gregg Mellowe, Director of Health Research and Analysis for the liberal-leaning Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic policy.\n\nMost families shopping on insurance exchanges qualify for federal subsidies to offset the cost. The state recently went through a period of rate setting, looking at what health insurers asked for and approving or denying their requests. In some cases, the state gave a company more than what they wanted. In others, they got less. At least four companies saw prices go down. Florida\u2019s 9.5 percent average rate hike may sound like a lot, but Mellowe says it\u2019s actually on par with national trends.\n\n\u201cPrior to the ACA, double-digit increases were the norm. It certainly does not reach or surpass what we\u2019ve seen in prior years. And that number [9.5 percent] is more about what insurers are charging than what consumers are paying,\" he said.\n\nAnd Laura Brennaman, Policy Director for the healthcare consumer advocacy organization Florida Chain, believes Florida\u2019s Insurance office did a good job.\n\n\u201cIt appears they used sound actuarial standards,\" she said. \"Based on the way they required companies to increase more than they expected and didn\u2019t allow some to increase as much as they wanted, and it was the same on the companies that requested decreases.\u201d\n\nA major change Floridians using the exchange will see next year is the absence of Preferred Provider Network plans. PPOs tend to be more expensive, but they also come with flexibility for consumers on which doctor to choose, which specialist, and coverage if they go out of network. Taking their place are EPOs or exclusive provider organizations, which the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Cynthia Cox explains:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say about half the products offered [nationally] are an HMO or EPO. They\u2019re similar in that you have an exclusive network of providers to choose from. EPOs are sometimes more flexible than HMO especially for people who want to see a specialist and don\u2019t want to have to go through their primary care physicians to do so.\u201d\n\nCox is the Kaiser Foundation\u2019s Associate Director of Health Reform and Private Insurance. EPOs are a hybrid of PPOs and traditional managed care plans\u2014where patients are steered to a doctor, healthcare is carefully tracked and costs tend to be lower. But not everyone believes the disappearance of the PPO in Florida is a good thing.\n\n\u201cThe goals of the ACA was three-fold: increase access, decrease cost and improve health outcomes. The way the way the insurance plans can decrease cost and reduce the premium cost is by narrowing the network,\" said Florida Chain's Brennaman.\n\nThe narrow networks can also lead to fewer choices for consumers when it comes to doctors, and even prescription medications. Also with EPOs if a person ends up in the hospital and gets an out-of-network doctor, they may have to pay for that treatment in full. An expense not many people can afford.\n\nOne way consumers can avoid price jumps, is by switching health plans. But there are also growing concerns consumers will grow weary of having to switch insurance plans each year in order to avoid cost increases.\n\n\u201cChanging doctors is a bigger deal than changing auto mechanics for most people,\" said Kaiser's Cox.\n\nShe says a switch in plans could also mean having to switch doctors, pharmacies and a tangle of paperwork.\n\n\u201cIt can be a hardship for some people, particularly people who are sicker, or those who need a specialist. So you may not always be able to see your doctor in the lowest-cost plan and you may have to go to a higher priced plan to make sure your doctor is included in that network.\u201d\n\nThose will be the consumers who could see the price they pay for insurance rise.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "Florida\u2019s health insurance market for next year is beginning to take shape, and there will be cost increases.
