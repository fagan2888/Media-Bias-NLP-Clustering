An Avon Park homeowner set a fire Friday that was meant to smoke out bees, but instead ended up damaging his home, the Highlands County Sheriff’s Office said.

The owner of a house at 1920 State Road 17, on Lake Letta southeast of Avon Park, built a fire Friday afternoon in his attic to smoke out bees, Sheriff’s Office Lt. Keith Starling said, but the fire got out of hand.

There were no injuries, Starling said.
