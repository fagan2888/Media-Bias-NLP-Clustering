Harry Reid's \"my way or the highway\" stand on Obamacare funding. Some 60 families have been kicked out of their privately-owned homes on Lake Mead by National Parks Service personnel as a result of the partial government shutdown, Newsmax reported Sunday.\n\n\"They are all vacation homes and everybody who lives in them are considered visitors,\" said Lake Mead Recreational Area spokeswoman Christie Vanover.\n\n\"If anybody needs to gather their personal belongings, we\u2019re not going to deny them access. They can go do that. They just can\u2019t spend the nights there or have barbecues during the day,\" she added. They need to get in and get out.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately overnight stays are not permitted until a budget is passed and the park can reopen,\" the NPS told KTNV.\n\nAmong those forced out of their homes by the Park Service was an elderly couple who has owned a home on the lake since the 1970s.\n\nRalph and Joyce Spencer was forced to leave their home so fast they forgot a number of essential items, like Ralph's pants.\n\nThe problem, KTNV said, is that the private home owned by the Spencers is on federal land.\n\nIn the meantime, the elderly couple is spending most of their time in the family ice cream store and is staying with nearby family members. Still, Joyce said, the move was a lot for the seniors to handle.\n\nOne homeowner told the Las Vegas Review-Journal he was never forced out of his home when the government shut down during the Clinton administration.\n\n\"This can\u2019t last forever,\u201d said 71-year-old Bob Hitchcock, a lifelong Republican. \u201cOctober 17 is going to be a big deadline with the debt limit vote coming up. Heaven help me if the government doesn\u2019t open by then.\"\n\nBut Obama and the Park Service intend to cause as much pain as possible to pressure Republicans to cave on Obamacare funding and the debt ceiling.\n\nOn Friday, we reported that a Park Ranger admitted being ordered to make life as inconvenient as possible in order to punish Americans during the shutdown.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can,\" an angry Park Ranger told the Washington Times. \"It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, Park Rangers have been doing exactly that, closing down parks, roads, and even scenic bypasses on a whim.\n\nObama, meanwhile, fomented violence against Republicans Saturday when he called them kidnappers who \u201cdemand ransom\u201d and \u201chold our democracy or our economy hostage.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you like this article, you can follow Joe on Twitter @jnewby1956, visit and like his Facebook page, or subscribe to receive email updates when a new article is published.\n\nFor hard-hitting conservative commentary, please visit Joe's blog, the Conservative Firing Line.
