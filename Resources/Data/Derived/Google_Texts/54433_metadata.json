But counting calories may not get you eating healthier, especially if you go out to eat and don\u2019t know the specific caloric intake of the food you ordered. So, what do you do? Well, one day in the future, you might have a personal food scanner that will tell you everything about the meal in front of you, from its nutritional content to any lingering harmful ingredients like allergens.\n\nHorizon Prizes are \"challenge\" prizes, in the form of a cash reward, to whoever can most effectively meet a defined challenge. The aim is to stimulate innovation and come up with solutions to problems that matter to European citizens. One of those solutions is the personal scanner, so Horizon Prizes is offering one million Euros to the inventors who can come up with the best prototypes. The first place winner will receive 800,000 Euros, with second and third place receiving 100,000 Euros each.\n\n\"Healthy eating is a key way of limiting certain diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases,\" EU project officer Gerald Cultot, who was involved in designing the terms of the prize, told Horizon Magazine.\n\nCultot said this personal scanner is the opposite end of the spectrum in relation to fitness apps. Those apps tell you how much energy you exert, but there aren\u2019t many apps that show how much you\u2019ve consumed. This personal scanner would take care of that, showing people how much food they consume at any given moment.\n\nIn order for the prize to be awarded, the scanner must be able to analyze food composition, nutrition facts, and potentially harmful ingredients such as allergens. The third stipulation is aimed at those with food allergies who may not always know exactly what went into the food they\u2019re about to eat or how their supposedly \u201callergen-free\u201d meal was created.\n\nThe reason Horizon Prizes is staging this \u201ccompetition\u201d for the public is because it wants to find inventors out there who normally wouldn\u2019t apply for a standard research project. However, this might be the most ambitious challenge yet. Previous prizes included one for a bacteria test in February, one for finding a better way to share bandwidth and higher speed optical data transmission in March, and another for materials that can improve the air quality of cities in April.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "food scanner nutrition horizon prizes one million euros", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new challenge is offering one million Euros to inventors who can come up with a personal food scanner.", "title": "The Race To Develop A Personal Food Scanner Is On", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/inventor-personal-food-scanner-tells-nutritional-value-food-one-million-euro-prize-352532", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/food-scanner.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new challenge is offering one million Euros to inventors who can come up with a personal food scanner.", "title": "The Race To Develop A Personal Food Scanner Is On", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/inventor-personal-food-scanner-tells-nutritional-value-food-one-million-euro-prize-352532", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/food-scanner.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/14/food-scanner.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-09-14T18:51:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-14T18:51:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new challenge is offering one million Euros to inventors who can come up with a personal food scanner."}, "article_summary": "Horizon Prizes are \"challenge\" prizes, in the form of a cash reward, to whoever can most effectively meet a defined challenge.\nThis personal scanner would take care of that, showing people how much food they consume at any given moment.\nWell, one day in the future, you might have a personal food scanner that will tell you everything about the meal in front of you, from its nutritional content to any lingering harmful ingredients like allergens.\nCultot said this personal scanner is the opposite end of the spectrum in relation to fitness apps.\nOne of those solutions is the personal scanner, so Horizon Prizes is offering one million Euros to the inventors who can come up with the best prototypes."}
