The final score was 20-6 in favor of the Iroquois Nationals.\n\n\u201cIt was a great game for the Haudenosaunee,\u201d Iroquois Nationals head coach Rick Kilgour said on the team\u2019s website. \u201cThis is the first international game on home soil. I think the guys showed how fired up they were in that first quarter. We kept playing hard, and they (England) showed lots of pride, playing a little rough to try and get back in it. But we stayed the course, took care of business and got out of here with a win.\u201d\n\nThe first quarter was a blow out with the Iroquois Nationals scoring 10 unanswered goals in the first quarter. The quarter was dominated by Jeff Shattler and Lyle Thompson with three goals each, Roger Vyse scored two and both Brandon Goodwin and Miles Thompson each scored one.\n\nIn the second quarter, Team England\u2019s Cole Shafer scored twice, but was soon answered with two more goals from Vyse and a first time tournament goal from 17-year-old Austin Staats.\n\nFor the remainder of the quarters, Shafer earned two more goals for England, however the Iroquois Nationals continued to step up and Shattler scored two more goals and Randy Staats, Lyle Thompson, Vyse and Tommy Montour scored one each.\n\nWith impressive goal tending by Mike Thompson who was credited with making 36 saves, while England\u2019s Nick Rose was peppered with 76 shots and Eliot Pugh faced six, the Iroquois Nationals rose to the call with an impressive win and 14 goal lead by the game\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a true honor to play this tournament here,\u201d Austin Staats said on IroquoisNationals.org. \u201cIt\u2019s a great chance to show the world what we have. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity. I\u2019m just excited to be part of it all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any pressure,\u201d Brier Jonathan also said. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s more exciting. We\u2019ve got the butterflies out early in the tournament. It really is an honor to play in front of and for our people at home. We\u2019re going to do our best to keep rolling.\u201d\n\nIroquois Nationals Coach Rick Kilgour spoke not just about the win, but the pride he and the team feels about playing in the Onondaga territory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge honor to be playing this tournament here,\u201d Kilgour said. \u201cI know when it was announced that it would be here, everyone wanted to be part of it. As soon as I heard where it would be on Native territory, and to be the first team to host something like this, I wanted to be part of it. It\u2019s an extreme honor. I think everyone has taken it seriously. And we\u2019re going to do our best to take it to the end.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Nationals\u2019 site, The Iroquois Nationals conclude their round robin portion of the tournament Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., when they take on the Czech Republic at Onondaga Arena.\n\nFor more information about the Iroquois Nationals and the remainder of the WILC \u2013 you can visit their website here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dubbed the \u201cRematch of the Colonials vs the Indians\u201d on social media, the Iroquois Nationals did not disappoint on Tuesday night with a well fought victory against Team England,Iroquois Nationals best England 20-6 in Historic First International Game on Onondaga Land", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "vincentschilling", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/09/23/iroquois-nationals-best-england-20-6-historic-first-international-game-onondaga-land", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/wilc_iroquois_vs_england-16.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Iroquois Nationals Best England in Historic First International Game on Onondaga Land"}, "abstract": "Iroquois Nationals best England 20-6 in Historic First International Game on Onondaga Land", "keywords": "Iroquois Nationals, WILC 2015, Lacrosse, Team England, 2015 FIL World Indoor Lacrosse Championships, Vincent Schilling", "dc": {"title": "Iroquois Nationals Best England in Historic First International Game on Onondaga Land"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/09/23/iroquois-nationals-best-england-20-6-historic-first-international-game-onondaga-land", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-09-23T15:24-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Iroquois Nationals Best England in Historic First International Game on Onondaga Land"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03b5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a great game for the Haudenosaunee,\u201d Iroquois Nationals head coach Rick Kilgour said on the team\u2019s website.\nFor more information about the Iroquois Nationals and the remainder of the WILC \u2013 you can visit their website here.\nThe final score was 20-6 in favor of the Iroquois Nationals.\nDubbed the \u201cRematch of the Colonials vs the Indians\u201d on social media, the Iroquois Nationals did not disappoint on Tuesday night with a well fought victory against Team England, playing at a sold out Onondaga Arena.\nAnd we\u2019re going to do our best to take it to the end.\u201dAccording to the Nationals\u2019 site, The Iroquois Nationals conclude their round robin portion of the tournament Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., when they take on the Czech Republic at Onondaga Arena."}
