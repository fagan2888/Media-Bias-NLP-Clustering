The sole dissent in that case was Justice Janice Rogers Brown. Nearly a decade later, Brown got her revenge. Though no longer a member of California\u2019s highest court \u2014 President George W. Bush appointed her to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit over the strenuous objections of Democrats \u2014 Judge Brown is now the author of a 2-1 opinion holding that religious employers can ignore the federal birth control rules. What was once a fringe view held by a lone holdout is now the law in the second most powerful court in the country.\n\nJudge Brown\u2019s opinion barely conceals her contempt for progressive legislation. Prior to her nomination to the D.C. Circuit, Brown labeled the New Deal a \u201csocialist revolution,\u201d and she likened Social Security to a kind of intergenerational cannibalism \u2014 \u201c[t]oday\u2019s senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because they have a right to get as much \u2018free\u2019 stuff as the political system will permit them to extract.\u201d Since joining the federal bench, she authored a concurring opinion suggesting that all labor, business or Wall Street regulation is constitutionally suspect. The very first sentence of her birth control opinion labels the Affordable Care Act a \u201cbehemoth.\u201d\n\nSo there was never any doubt how Brown would vote on this particular challenge to women\u2019s access to birth control. Her opinion was joined by Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a conservative George H.W. Bush appointee. Carter-appointed Judge Harry Edwards dissented.\n\nCoincidentally, Brown\u2019s opinion comes just one day after Senate Republicans reignited the filibuster wars by filibustering the first of three Obama nominees to her court. Currently, the D.C. Circuit is evenly divided between Democratic and Republican active judges, but a large number of Republican judges in partial retirement allow the GOP to dominate the court. Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn wrote in a Fox News op-ed that Republicans should prevent any of Obama\u2019s nominees from being confirmed to this court to prevent Democrats from gaining a majority. Although federal appeals courts typically hear cases via randomly drawn three-judge panels, the court\u2019s rules permit a majority of the court\u2019s active judges to displace any decision reached by a three-judge panel.\n\nSenate Democrats waged an unsuccessful effort to filibuster Judge Brown\u2019s nomination during the Bush Administration \u2014 largely because of her strident opposition to programs such as Social Security \u2014 but that filibuster was eventually defeated after Republicans threatened to invoke the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d to eliminate filibusters of judicial nominees. The deal that allowed Judge Brown to be confirmed also paved the way for Judge Priscilla Owen\u2019s nomination. Yesterday evening, Judge Owen authored an opinion reinstating a Texas anti-abortion law blocked by a lower court judge.\n\nThere is a lesson here for Democrats trying to decide whether to invoke the nuclear opinion in the D.C. Circuit fight that Senate Republicans started this week. When Republicans had the courage to demand what they wanted and put a serious threat behind it, they got two of the most conservative judges in the country. If Senate Democrats follow suit \u2014 either by forcing Republicans to cave or by carrying through on a threat to nuke the filibuster \u2014 they will also win their fight to get President Obama\u2019s nominees confirmed.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Social Security is just like cannibalism, and other crazy things Judge Janice Rogers Brown believes.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Social Security is just like cannibalism, and other crazy things Judge Janice Rogers Brown believes.", "title": "What You Need To Know About The Severely Conservative Judge Who Just Ruled Against Birth Control", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/11/01/2876381/need-know-severely-conservative-judge-just-ruled-birth-control/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Judge-Janice-Rogers-Brown-e1383325714355.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Social Security is just like cannibalism, and other crazy things Judge Janice Rogers Brown believes.", "creator": "@imillhiser", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Judge-Janice-Rogers-Brown-e1383325714355-321x214.jpg", "title": "What You Need To Know About The Severely Conservative Judge Who Just Ruled Against Birth Control", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Judge-Janice-Rogers-Brown-e1383325714355.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Judge-Janice-Rogers-Brown-e1383325714355.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-01T14:13:51+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/IanMillhiserPublic"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice What You Need To Know About The Severely Conservative Judge Who Just Ruled Against Birth Control CREDIT: Judge Janice Rogers BrownNine years ago, the California Supreme Court upheld a state law similar to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s rules requiring most employers to include birth control coverage in their employee health plans.\nThe deal that allowed Judge Brown to be confirmed also paved the way for Judge Priscilla Owen\u2019s nomination.\nThe very first sentence of her birth control opinion labels the Affordable Care Act a \u201cbehemoth.\u201dSo there was never any doubt how Brown would vote on this particular challenge to women\u2019s access to birth control.\nYesterday evening, Judge Owen authored an opinion reinstating a Texas anti-abortion law blocked by a lower court judge.\nCircuit fight that Senate Republicans started this week."}
