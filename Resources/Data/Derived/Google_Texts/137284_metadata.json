So much depends on the incumbent: Is he deemed a success or a failure? Is he loved or derided? The candidate seeking to replace a president of his own party is betting the country doesn\u2019t want to change. Bush 41 bet correctly\u2014in 1988. Al Gore and John McCain did not.\n\nHillary Clinton? Her problem was on display Thursday when she presented her anti-ISIS war plan to the Council on Foreign Relations. For ideological and political reasons, she is unable or unwilling to distinguish herself from Obama. If the war against ISIS were going well, her decision would be smart politics. But the war is not going well. The war is a disaster. A growing one, as the Paris attack made clear.\n\nThe president is quite the neoliberal\u2014mugged by reality yet refusing to press charges. His approval rating on foreign policy is consistently underwater. Two-thirds of the country says it\u2019s headed in the wrong direction. And yet Clinton\u2019s ISIS strategy is essentially the same as Obama\u2019s. Fierce airstrikes. An \u201cintelligence surge.\u201d Special forces. Pressure the Iraqi government to be nice to its Sunnis. Agree on a diplomatic resolution to the Syrian Civil War. \u201cIncreased support from our Arab and European partners.\u201d Accept Syrian refugees. Above all, no major deployment of U.S. troops. On ISIS, Clinton is Obama\u2019s prisoner. A willing captive to his strategy. Where it goes, she\u2019ll go.\n\nThe subtleties intended to convince us that Clinton\u2019s plan is more aggressive than Obama\u2019s are laughable. Obama, you see, wants to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy ISIS\u201d whereas Clinton wants to \u201cdefeat and destroy ISIS.\u201d Obama is \u201cintensifying\u201d the fight against ISIS whereas Clinton is not only intensifying but also accelerating it. Intensify and accelerate a bad policy all you want. It will remain bad.\n\nWhere does Clinton differ from the president? \u201cI thought we needed to do more to try to identify indigenous Syrian fighters, so-called \u2018moderates\u2019\u2014and I do think there were some early on\u2014that we could have done more to help them in their fight against Assad.\u201d Dude, that was like four years ago!\n\nClinton won\u2019t even say Obama was wrong to call ISIS the \u201cJV team\u201d: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to go back in and re-plow old ground.\u201d Criticizing Obama for the junior varsity comment is political free money. No one but the president and Susan Rice would be annoyed if Clinton said he should\u2019ve taken the threat more seriously.\n\nBut she can\u2019t bring herself to do it. Not just because she needs the president and his coalition to support her a year from now. Because she also approves of policies most of us see as failed or failing or counterproductive.\n\nThe Afghanistan surge, the Libya war, the Iran deal\u2014Clinton embraces all of Obama\u2019s foreign policy legacy, with the exception of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She touts Libya in particular. \u201cWe had the UAE, Qatar, Jordan involved in what we were doing on the ground\u201d in Libya, she said Thursday. In response to a question skeptical of the Libya war, she said, \u201cThe Libyan people have voted twice in free and fair elections for the kind of leadership they want.\u201d\n\nShe offered Libya as an example of successful diplomacy. \u201cThe Europeans were the ones who wanted American support, and we did not agree to do so until we had a very clear idea what they were willing to do. And then we reached out and worked with the Arab League so that there would be Arab partners as well, and that took weeks.\u201d Who besides Clinton now judges the Libya intervention a success?\n\nWhen President Obama took office, Iraq was stable. Now there are four failed states in the Middle East\u2014Libya, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen\u2014and the potential for many more. This is the foreign policy legacy to which Hillary Clinton is committed.\n\nPresident Obama is very good at advocating and implementing policies of which the public disapproves. Obamacare, the Bergdahl trade, the phony war on ISIS, the executive amnesty, gun control, the Iran deal, no changes to the Syrian refugee program\u2014he\u2019s been persistent in his flouting of majority wishes and constitutional norms. But Clinton doesn\u2019t have his talent. She doesn\u2019t have his fan boys.\n\nClinton must assume, as most Democrats do, that changes in our population and culture allow liberals to be much more dismissive and contemptuous of opposing viewpoints than they have been in the past. Clinton must assume, as most Democrats do, that the electorate will find the alternative to Democratic rule so repulsive that it will support whomever John Oliver tells it to. Clinton must assume, as many Democrats do, that the economy will be good enough, that Obama will be popular enough, that the world will be stable enough in November 2016 to ensure that the Clintons return to the White House.\n\nThat\u2019s her bet.
