(AP) \u2014 Mother Dolores Hart finds it miraculous that she was able to turn one kiss with Elvis Presley into the spark that helped save an abbey.\n\nThe former starlet who walked away from Hollywood in 1963 to become a nun spun her tale into a fundraising campaign for her crumbling monastery in rural Connecticut.\n\nBut the pot boiler about Presley\u2019s first on-screen kiss and the girl who turned from the screen to sisterhood has done more than keep open the doors of Abbey of Regina Laudis. It has inspired new interest in its monastic work. Now she and the other nuns hope to raise up to $9 million to restore the order\u2019s former brass factory for future generations.\n\nMother Dolores, now 76, first shared her story with The Associated Press in 2011 as she and about 40 other members of her Benedictine order faced the possibility that their abbey in Bethlehem would close\n\nFire officials had found numerous fire code and safety issues in what was a ramshackle collection of factory buildings, barns and sheds that were linked together in 1947 after the nuns purchased the old industrial site.\n\nMother Dolores went on to write an autobiography, embark on a speaking tour, and make TV appearances. In 2012, she returned to Hollywood to attend the Academy Awards when a documentary short about her life, \u201cGod is the Bigger Elvis,\u201d was nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\u201cOf course it was only a nomination,\u201d she joked. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting for the real thing.\u201d\n\nBut the bigger reward, she said, came as an answer to her prayers for the abbey.\n\nShortly after her autobiography was published, the monastery began receiving letters and donations from across the world. One man began sending $100 a month. A woman in New Zealand sent $3,000.\n\n\u201cThe Elvis fans didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but they sent quite a few dollars and all their love,\u201d she said.\n\nThe nuns quickly raised more than $1 million. The abbey\u2019s main building now has new alarm and sprinkler systems, an elevator and other safety improvements.\n\nWhat was once a project designed to keep the abbey from closing has become a fundraising effort to renovate the abbey for a long future.\n\nThe most recent version of the renovation plan, dubbed New Horizons, calls for a new chapel (the ceiling is sagging), housing and other environmentally friendly and disabled accessible spaces to live and pray.\n\nAmong other things, the nuns need to install new wiring and insulation to prevent the constant freezing of pipes in the winter, fix the falling gutters, replace rotting wood and get rid of the black mold that can be seen growing on the ceiling of the former barn that now houses the print shop, bakery and sewing room.\n\nMore than anything, they need more space \u2014 common areas and places where people can reflect without bumping into one another. They have no conference room and currently no way to walk inside from one end of the monastery to the other without going through the chapel and disturbing those who are praying there.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nun who kissed Elvis helps answer abbey\u2019s prayers", "title": "Nun who kissed Elvis helps answer abbey\u2019s prayers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nun who kissed Elvis helps answer abbey\u2019s prayers", "title": "Nun who kissed Elvis helps answer abbey\u2019s prayers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/16/nun_who_kissed_elvis_helps_answer_abbeys_prayers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/elvis-and-the-nun.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nun who kissed Elvis helps answer abbey\u2019s prayers", "title": "Nun who kissed Elvis helps answer abbey\u2019s prayers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/elvis-and-the-nun.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Pat Eaton-robb", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for the real thing.\u201dBut the bigger reward, she said, came as an answer to her prayers for the abbey.\n\u201cThe Elvis fans didn\u2019t have a lot of money, but they sent quite a few dollars and all their love,\u201d she said.\nMore than anything, they need more space \u2014 common areas and places where people can reflect without bumping into one another.\nThe abbey\u2019s main building now has new alarm and sprinkler systems, an elevator and other safety improvements.\nNow she and the other nuns hope to raise up to $9 million to restore the order\u2019s former brass factory for future generations."}
