But when an unaffiliated researcher took a closer look at the study, he came to quite a different conclusion; there is in fact very little difference between babies who do and don\u2019t develop autism in terms of their eye's gaze.\n\nThe Nature study likely made intuitive sense to many because \u201c[d]eficits in eye contact have been a hallmark of autism since the condition\u2019s initial description,\u201d authors, Warren Jones and Ami Klin of Emory University, wrote in their study. Specifically, they found that infants that were eventually diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) showed a decline in eye fixation from 2 to 6 months of age, which wasn\u2019t observed in infants who didn\u2019t develop ASD.\n\n\u201cThese observations mark the earliest known indicators of social disability in infancy,\u201d Jones and Klin concluded, challenging another hypothesis, which claimed that eye contact is not reduced in early infants who later develop ADD. This was big news because it offered hope for an early intervention that could prevent autism from further developing.\n\nBut Jon Brock, whose research at Macquarie University in Sydney focuses on cognitive developmental disorders including autism, not only provided a more grounded view of the study \u2014 he outright challenged it. \u201c[A]s with many studies that receive the full media treatment, there are caveats a-plenty,\u201d he wrote in his blog, Cracking The Enigma. \u201cIn fact, it could be argued that the results show the exact opposite of what the authors and the media coverage has suggested.\u201d\n\nBrock took issue with the analysis that found that boys who showed a decline in eye gaze from 2 to 6 months developed autism while \u201clow-risk boys\u201d actually showed an increase in eye gaze over the same amount of time. In other words, he summarized, \u201c[i]t doesn\u2019t matter how awkward the data collection process or convoluted the analysis, there\u2019s information about autism in a babies\u2019 eye gaze.\u201d\n\nIn addition to noticing some weaknesses with the Nature study\u2019s methods, Brock found that babies in the study who developed ASD versus those who didn\u2019t actually exhibited the same amount of eye contact at 6 months, which meant that at 2 months ASD infants actually made more eye contact. \u201cSo, to sum up,\u201d he concluded, \u201cit's far too early to be declaring that baby's eye gaze predicts future autism.\u201d\n\nThe U.K.\u2019s National Health Service also urged skepticism when interpreting this study. \u201cThe results should be interpreted with caution though, as it took place in a highly artificial environment,\u201d the health care system noted on their website. \u201cEye contact was measured in response to a video of a woman and not a real, live person, and there may have been many other confounding factors that could have accounted for the results.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "gaze, eye contact, autism, development, autism spectrum disorder, babies, eyes", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A researcher of cognitive developmental disorders challenges a study that linked the rate of decline in babies' eye contact between the ages of 2 to 6 months to autism spectrum disorder.", "title": "Jury's Still Out On Link Between Infants' Gaze And Autism", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jurys-still-out-link-between-infants-gaze-and-autism-expert-challenges-groudbreaking-study-265040", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/14/shutterstock-photo-baby.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A researcher of cognitive developmental disorders challenges a study that linked the rate of decline in babies' eye contact between the ages of 2 to 6 months to autism spectrum disorder.", "title": "Jury's Still Out On Link Between Infants' Gaze And Autism", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/jurys-still-out-link-between-infants-gaze-and-autism-expert-challenges-groudbreaking-study-265040", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/14/shutterstock-photo-baby.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/14/shutterstock-photo-baby.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2013-12-14T16:12:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-14T16:12:31-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A researcher of cognitive developmental disorders challenges a study that linked the rate of decline in babies' eye contact between the ages of 2 to 6 months to autism spectrum disorder."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02b9\"", "article_summary": "A researcher of cognitive developmental disorders challenges a study that linked the rate of decline in babies' eye contact between the ages of 2 to 6 months to autism spectrum disorder.\nLast month, a study in Nature garnered a lot of media buzz by reporting a relationship between the level of eye contact in infancy and the chances of developing autism.\nSpecifically, they found that infants that were eventually diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) showed a decline in eye fixation from 2 to 6 months of age, which wasn\u2019t observed in infants who didn\u2019t develop ASD.\nThis was big news because it offered hope for an early intervention that could prevent autism from further developing.\n\u201cThese observations mark the earliest known indicators of social disability in infancy,\u201d Jones and Klin concluded, challenging another hypothesis, which claimed that eye contact is not reduced in early infants who later develop ADD."}
