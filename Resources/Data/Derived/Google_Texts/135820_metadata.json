It originated in an article on a humor site, The Daily Currant:\n\nAccording to a report in The Detroit News this morning, the [Obama] administration is using its authority under the Affordable Care Act to \u201cimprove transportation routes to hospitals\u201d to dispense gasoline free of cost in disadvantaged neighborhoods. The $2 billion-a-year program aims to distribute 40 million gallons of free gasoline each year through 70 new gas stations constructed in major metropolitan areas. The Department of Health and Human Services (DHS) will be responsible for operating the network, whose first station opened yesterday in Detroit. \u2026 \u201cSupposedly access to the station is determined by income,\u201d says Ebony Jackson, manager of the first Obamastation. \u201cBut it\u2019s pretty unrealistic to do an income check on each and every driver. So what we do is basically let all the black people pump for free, and charge all the white people the market rate.\u201d\n\nHowever, this is satire, not real news. The site\u2019s About page reads:\n\nThe Daily Currant is an English language online satirical newspaper that covers global politics, business, technology, entertainment, science, health and media. It is accessible from over 190 countries worldwide \u2013 now including South Sudan. Our mission is to ridicule the timid ignorance which obstructs our progress, and promote intelligence \u2013 which presses forward. Q. Are your news stories real? A. No. Our stories are purely fictional. However they are meant to address real-world issues through satire and often refer and link to real events happening in the world.\n\nOther stories on the site include \u201cNASA Finds Message From God on Mars\u201d and \u201cAl Gore Claims He Invented Twitter.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, there is nothing in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that authorizes the government to dispense free gasoline to minorities or the poor. The law does, however, expand Medicaid to provide health services to more poor people, and it provides a sliding scale of subsidies for health insurance to people with annual incomes between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. But, alas, no free gas.\n\nHere at FactCheck.org, we have written about satirical news stories many times in the past, and we get emails about new ones every week. As always, we advise readers to apply a healthy dose of skepticism to reports on the web, particularly from news sources that are unfamiliar. Here\u2019s another tip: When you come across online news stories with outrageous claims, it is a good idea to check the site\u2019s \u201cAbout\u201d page. Often, if the site is in the business of writing satire, it will say so there.\n\nAs a handy guide, here is a list of some of the satirical sites we\u2019ve come across:\n\nThe Borowitz Report \u2014 Written by Andy Borowitz, a daily satire column for The New Yorker. Upon his move to The New Yorker, Borowitz wrote, \u201cThe Borowitz Report will be as inaccurate as always, and if I ever write something that turns out to be true you have my deepest apology and my promise that it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Rash \u2014 If the blog\u2019s motto, \u201cAll the news that\u2019s unfit to print,\u201d doesn\u2019t clue you in, some of the headlines should: \u201cObama Furious After Vladimir Putin Unfriends Him on Facebook\u201d and \u201cPresident Obama and North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-Un in Twitter Feud.\u201d\n\nThe Duffel Blog \u2014 We last caught up with these guys when they ran a story that said military absentee ballots that arrived a day late swung the election in favor of President Obama. \u201cWe are in no way, shape, or form, a real news outlet,\u201d the site warns. It serves up \u201cmilitary humor, funny military pictures, and faux news.\u201d\n\nDuh Progressive \u2014 It fancies itself a conservative/libertarian alternative to the Onion.\n\nFree Wood Post \u2014 We\u2019re not sure why anyone would take seriously a report from a website whose motto is \u201cNews That\u2019s Almost Reliable.\u201d This site serves up satire with a left-leaning bent, as evidenced by headlines such as \u201cLouie Gohmert: \u2018Healthcare.gov Smiling Woman Taken Out By Death Panel,'\u201d and \u201cSarah Palin: \u2018Thanksgiving is for Real Americans Not Indians.\u2019\u201d\n\nNational Report \u2014 Sometimes, satirical sites even fool the media, with embarrassing results. Such was the case when Fox News host Anna Kooiman bought and repeated on air a story from National Report that claimed President Obama personally funded the International Museum of Muslim Cultures.\n\n\n\nNewslo \u2013 Newslo describes itself as \u201cthe first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.\u201d It provides its readers with a \u201cfact-button\u201d on stories containing satire. It also marks stories that are completely true with \u201c#NNTS,\u201d which stands for \u201cNo Need To Satirize.\u201d\n\nThe Onion \u2014 Plenty of media outlets have mistaken satirical Onion articles for the truth. One of our favorites was when the website of China\u2019s state paper, People\u2019s Daily Online, noted that the Onion had named North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un as the \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d in 2012. Even the New York Times has fallen victim to the Onion\u2019s satire. It had to run an embarrassing correction explaining that Tiger Beat had not, in fact, run a cover with Obama appealing to \u201ctween\u201d voters \u2014 that it was a parody cover created by the Onion.\n\n\u2014 Madeleine Stevens, with Robert Farley\n\n\n\nSources\n\n\u201cGovernment Opening Free Gas Stations in Poor Neighborhoods.\u201d The Daily Currant. 29 October 2013, accessed 21 November 2013.\n\n\u201cAbout \u2013 The Daily Currant.\u201d The Daily Currant.
