But not this time.\n\nA nod from a police officer who inspected Matthew's house confirmed their worst fears.\n\n\u201cI just hit the ground,\u201d Kay Warren said.\n\nOn April 5, Matthew Warren killed himself with a gun after a lifelong battle with mental illness.\n\n\u201cThe day that I had feared might happen one day, since he had been born, and the day that I had prayed would never happen \u2026 happened,\u201d Rick Warren told CNN's Piers Morgan in an exclusive interview.\n\nFor the first time since Matthew Warren's death on April 5, Rick and Kay Warren are speaking out about his troubled life, how the tragedy changed their faith and their new mission to draw attention to mental illness.\n\nThe full interview aired Tuesday night on CNN\u2019s \"Piers Morgan Live\" at 9 pm ET.\n\nIn 1980, Rick and Kay Warren founded Saddleback Church, now one of the largest in America, in Orange County, California. Twelve years later, Warren published \"The Purpose Driven Life,\" a runaway best-seller that catapulted the pastor into stardom.\n\nAt the same time, though, their son Matthew Warren struggled with borderline personality disorder and deep depression for much of his life, the Warrens told CNN.\n\nHe had a loving family and access to mental health care, but not even that could spare him, they said.\n\nMatthew was a young man with a \"tender heart and tortured mind,\" Rick Warren said.\n\n\u201cIf love could have kept my child alive, he'd be alive today, because he was incredibly loved,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Warrens also spoke during the interview about how their son's death has affected their Christian faith.\n\nGALLERY: Rick Warren over the years\n\n\u201cI never questioned my faith in God; I questioned God\u2019s plan,\u201d Rick Warren said. \u201cGod isn\u2019t to blame for my son\u2019s death. My son took his life. It was his choice.\u201d\n\nSlightly more than half of Americans - 53% - think that churches should do more to prevent suicide in America, according to a new poll by LifeWay Research, a Christian company based in Nashville.\n\nEvangelicals and other Americans appear to disagree, however, about using religion to overcome mental illness, according to the LifeWay poll, which surveyed some 1,000 Americans and was released on Monday.\n\nNearly half of evangelicals, 48%, say that people with serious mental illnesses like depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia can be cured by Bible study and prayer alone. Sixty percent of Americans overall disagree.\n\nThe Warrens want to spread the word that even though their story had a tragic ending, \u201cthere\u2019s hope,\u201d Kay Warren said during the interview with CNN.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important that people know, no matter how desperate their despair, there is hope, and not to give up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Eric Marrapodi, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor Lake Forest, California (CNN) -- Rick and Kay Warren stood outside their son's home, sobbing in each other's arms.
