Ellis calls the latter \u201cObamaTrade.\u201d\n\nThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on a trade promotion authority (TPA) measure on Friday. If it passes it will allow President Barack Obama more latitude to negotiate and enact the TPP deal.\n\n\u201cThe politics of ObamaTrade are poisonous,\u201d Ellis wrote on Wednesday at the conservative Breitbart News. \u201cPoll after poll shows a majority of Americans across the political spectrum oppose these phony \u2018free trade\u2019 deals\u2014and conservatives oppose them in even greater numbers than Democrats.\u201d\n\nEllis runs a site called ObamaTrade.com that takes a conservative line of attack against the free trade agreement. It features commentary by Donald Trump, former Rep. Allen West, GOP pollster Dick Morris, and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), a leading TPA opponent.\n\nEllis has appeared on conservative talk radio to criticize TPA, and his work is being promoted by a conservative public relations firm alongside Heritage Foundation president Jim DeMint and talk radio giant Mark Levin.\n\nObamaTrade is a phrase designed to call to mind Obamacare, and he has unfavorably compared TPA to the Affordable Care Act and the president\u2019s efforts to unilaterally reform the nation\u2019s immigration system.\n\n\u201cThe grassroots are on fire against ObamaTrade,\u201d he declared in his Breitbart column. However, until recently, Ellis was an outspoken Democratic critic of the Tea Party movement.\n\n\u201cThey fancy themselves the vanguard of a revolution, when in fact they are typical self-absorbed, privileged children used to having their way\u2014now\u2014and uninhibited about complaining loudly when they don\u2019t,\u201d Ellis wrote in a 2010 column for the Los Angeles Times criticizing the movement.\n\nEllis disavowed the column in an email.\n\n\u201cMy \u2018hot take\u2019 in 2010 was wrong,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Tea Party is alive, well and perhaps the most important movement in American politics today.\u201d\n\nEllis has a documented history as a Democratic operative. The Times identified him as one, calling him and the column\u2019s coauthor \u201cDemocratic political consultants.\u201d On a since-deleted page on liberal blog Talking Points Memo, Ellis described himself as a progressive Democrat.\n\nEllis did not respond to questions about his political background or former employers, which include two Democrats backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from labor unions.\n\nOne of them is behind ObamaTrade.com.\n\nThe American Jobs Alliance, ObamaTrade\u2019s publisher, was founded and received early funding from New York industrialist Jack Davis in 2011, the same year that Ellis managed Davis\u2019 congressional campaign in New York\u2019s 26th district.\n\nAfter unsuccessfully running as a Democrat for the seat in 2004, 2006, and 2008, Davis declared himself a Tea Party candidate and ran in a 2011 special election. He was criticized by conservative and Tea Party groups as a spoiler and a \u201cfraud.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Kathy Hochul won the race, besting Republican Jane Corwin by about 5,000 votes\u2014half of the roughly 10,000 that Davis received.\n\nThroughout his congressional runs, Davis received contributions from the political action committees of a number of prominent Democrats, including Obama. The then-senator\u2019s leadership PAC, Hopefund, gave Davis\u2019 campaign $5,000 during the 2006 cycle.\n\nUnions also contributed heavily, donating more than $69,000 to his 2004 and 2006 campaigns.\n\nLabor groups also backed another former Ellis employer, Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Steve Kagen. Ellis served as communications director for Kagen, who, campaign finance records show, received more than $700,000 in campaign support from labor unions throughout his congressional tenure.\n\nConservative critics of the law should be wary of some of those opposing the bill said Scott Lincicome, a trade attorney and adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute, in an email.\n\n\u201cOne would think that supposed supporters of fiscal conservatism and limited government would look at their protectionist allies on the left\u2014folks with whom they disagree on almost everything\u2014and realize that maybe, just maybe, they were wrong to oppose free trade, but so far that hasn\u2019t really happened,\u201d Lincicome said in an email.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Ellis or his ideology, but it would hardly be surprising to see a progressive leftist being promoted by the far right in order to oppose freer trade,\u201d he added.\n\nTPA supporters were less charitable. Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), called Ellis\u2019 advocacy \u201cdespicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiberals are trying to fool conservatives with bogus arguments to advance their union agenda,\u201d Buck said in an emailed statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Self-described progressive Democrat Curtis Ellis finds receptive ears on conservative blogs and talk radio", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A leading voice against a pending Asian free trade agreement is tailoring his message to the country\u2019s grassroots conservatives, but until recently he described himself as a progressive and worked f", "title": "Dem Operative Rallies Conservatives Against \u2018ObamaTrade\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/dem-operative-rallies-conservatives-against-obamatrade/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Barack-Obama1-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A leading voice against a pending Asian free trade agreement is tailoring his message to the country", "title": "Dem Operative Rallies Conservatives Against \u2018ObamaTrade\u2019", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Barack-Obama1-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@lachlan", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Tea Party is alive, well and perhaps the most important movement in American politics today.\u201dEllis has a documented history as a Democratic operative.\nBY: Follow @lachlanA leading voice against a pending Asian free trade agreement is tailoring his message to the country\u2019s grassroots conservatives, but until recently he described himself as a progressive and worked for union-backed Democrats.\nHowever, until recently, Ellis was an outspoken Democratic critic of the Tea Party movement.\n\u201cThe politics of ObamaTrade are poisonous,\u201d Ellis wrote on Wednesday at the conservative Breitbart News.\nEllis calls the latter \u201cObamaTrade.\u201dThe House of Representatives is expected to vote on a trade promotion authority (TPA) measure on Friday."}
