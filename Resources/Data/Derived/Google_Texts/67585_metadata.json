After departing Mexico, the pontiff appeared to criticize Trump in an interview, suggesting that building walls \u2014 not bridges \u2014 \u201cis not Christian.\u201d\n\nCalling the comment \u201cdisgraceful,\u201d the presidential front-runner and insulter-in-chief compelled the Vatican to Think Again before retreating. Meanwhile, comedians joked that the perceived papal putdown would cause church attendance to fall and Trump\u2019s poll numbers to surge.\n\nIndeed, by crossing swords with the pontiff, Trump burnished his image as a fearless fighter, a trait his voters prize. Unfazed by his incoherence, lack of policy specifics or controversies, Trump supporters, like columnist Jim Nolte, are tired of losing and want \u201csomeone who will do whatever it takes to win.\u201d\n\nBuoying Trump is Americans\u2019 sense of powerlessness and insecurity. Consider these controversial policies imposed on disapproving majorities using extra-constitutional means: the Iran deal, the irresponsible and never-debated Omnibus budget, Obamacare, trade promotion, and executive actions and sanctuary-city policies that nullify immigration laws.\n\nBut for Trumpkins, \u201cmaking America great again\u201d isn\u2019t about restoring government of, by and for the people. It\u2019s about elevating their own Julius Caesar to make deals with a ruling class that runs government like a spoil system \u2014 of special interests, by unelected bureaucrats and for political elites.\n\nApparently, Trumpkins want a warrior who\u2019ll \u201cbork\u201d political opponents. The angry verb \u201cto bork\u201d means to discredit by whatever methods necessary. It was coined after the character assassination of eminent jurist Robert Bork, killing his 1987 Supreme Court nomination the year after recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia won a 98-0 Senate confirmation.\n\nAnti-Bork activist Ann Lewis later explained the unprecedented smear campaign: There\u2019d be a \u201cdeep and thoughtful discussion about the Constitution, and then we would lose.\u201d Hence, Sen. Ted Kennedy\u2019s fabrication that in Bork\u2019s America, \u201cwomen would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters.\u201d\n\nWriting 24 years later, New York Times columnist Joe Nocera lamented the nomination battle\u2019s \u201cessential unfairness,\u201d noting \u201cthe line from Bork to today\u2019s ugly politics is a straight one.\u201d Whatever one thinks about Bork\u2019s views, Nocera argued, \u201cthey cannot be fairly characterized as extreme. ... Rarely has a failed nominee had the pedigree \u2014 and intellectual firepower \u2014 of Bork.\u201d\n\nThat Bork was Scalia\u2019s ideological and intellectual equal but was rejected shortly after Scalia\u2019s unanimous approval speaks to how politicized the theoretically independent judiciary has become. Consider that it was President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s fellow Democrats who foiled his plan to pack the Supreme Court.\n\nThomas Jefferson warned that giving \u201cjudges the right to decide what laws are constitutional and what not \u2026 would make the judiciary a despotic branch.\u201d Now, having morphed from \u201cthe least dangerous branch\u201d into an unelected super-legislature of nine philosopher kings with lifetime appointments, it\u2019s not surprising Supreme Court nominations are hotly contested and fraught with hypocrisy.\n\nThough waxing indignant over Republican refusals to consider a lame-duck president\u2019s Supreme Court nomination during this election year, Sens. Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden favored obstructing Republican judicial nominees.\n\nIn 1992, Biden, then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, proclaimed in a speech that \u201caction on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over,\u201d insisting the president not nominate anyone. And in 2006, then-Sen. Barack Obama voted to block an up-or-down vote on Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s nomination.\n\nIronically, an activist and politicized judiciary is what Scalia wanted to roll back, favoring the founders\u2019 original intent: separation of powers, checks and an independent judiciary with limited authority to resolve legal disputes by applying \u2014 not writing \u2014 the law. Other issues should be decided democratically \u2014 at the ballot box or by representatives accountable to the people.\n\nBy short-circuiting the democratic process for resolving emotionally charged issues, Scalia believed the court was violating \u201ca principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation.\u201d\n\nFeeling voiceless and powerless in an America that\u2019s migrated away from its founding purpose \u2014 the democratic self-governance of a free people \u2014 many Trumpkins want a strong-arm \u201cborker\u201d to wield power on their behalf. But do they really want a vengeful president using the IRS, NSA, FBI and CIA to target and punish critics?\n\nAs Scalia argued while pointing to unfree nations that have charters of rights, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the Bill of Rights that produces freedom; it\u2019s the structure of government that prevents anybody from seizing all the power.\u201d\n\nEssentially, the founders used constitutional walls to separate and check power so that diverse people with differing beliefs would be free to build bridges of mutual respect and tolerance, forging an open and decent society. The Supreme Court\u2019s unlikely \u201cbest buddies\u201d \u2014 rivals Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2014 built a remarkable bridge, a lesson for Pope Francis, Trump and Trumpkins.\n\nThink Again \u2014 Isn\u2019t the best way to \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d to elect a president who\u2019ll adhere to America\u2019s great constitution?\n\nMelanie Sturm lives in Aspen.
