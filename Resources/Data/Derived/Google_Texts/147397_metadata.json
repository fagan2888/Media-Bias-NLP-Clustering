Luebkemann says the FRLA pushed for both the guidelines and the effective-date extension.\n\nThose standards state menus must list calorie intake for each item and have a statement on daily caloric intake information, as well as have written nutrition information available.\n\nBut consumers will have to wait a little bit longer because the FDA has pushed back the effective date a year till December 2016. In a statement, the FDA says that many corporations requested more time to implement the regulations.\n\n\"That's a lot of money to invest in new menu boards, new menus, training staff the technology that's needed to both manage the process and the restaurant and the technology needed to ensure that the data is correct that the nutrition information we're putting up is accurate,\" Luebkemann says.\n\nLocal nutritionists say that as long as it happens eventually, it's a great step towards a healthier US.\n\n\"The food industry is obviously there to sell a product. It's buy or beware so the more informed the consumer can be, the better off,\" says Rodger Young, the clinical nutrition manger for Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The FDA has extended the effective date for nation-wide menu-labeling regulations till December 2016.", "language": "english", "author": "Jennie Gutierrez", "og": {"description": "The FDA has extended the effective date for nation-wide menu-labeling regulations till December 2016.", "title": "FDA Delays Menu-Labeling Effective Date Until December 2016", "url": "http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/FDA-Delays-Menu-Labeling-Effective-Date-313382501.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0CC/3A2/0CC3A252936D4F129569C3A779815BBA", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/96C/F4B/96CF4BB9160C4EBAB03C3CF220BD1D28.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wctv.tv", "description": "The FDA has extended the effective date for nation-wide menu-labeling regulations till December 2016.", "creator": "@wctv", "url": "http://www.wctv.tv/home/headlines/FDA-Delays-Menu-Labeling-Effective-Date-313382501.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/subway+menu.jpg", "title": "FDA Delays Menu-Labeling Effective Date Until December 2016", "site": "@wctv", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "FDA Delays Menu-Labeling Effective Date Until December 2016", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "VLpGbxCsgs1871fd1G59F0FVrlUu5DfthTQ8LrtSaNQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "FDA Delays MenuLabeling Effective Date"}, "article_summary": "JULY 10, 2015BY: JENNIE GUTIERREZTALLHASSEE, Fla.-- The FDA has extended the effective date for nation-wide menu-labeling regulations till December 2016.\nBut consumers will have to wait a little bit longer because the FDA has pushed back the effective date a year till December 2016.\nIn a statement, the FDA says that many corporations requested more time to implement the regulations.\nThose standards state menus must list calorie intake for each item and have a statement on daily caloric intake information, as well as have written nutrition information available.\nLocal nutritionists say that as long as it happens eventually, it's a great step towards a healthier US."}
