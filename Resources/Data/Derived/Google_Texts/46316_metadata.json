Ellensburg Police Detectives subsequently arrested the brothers and booked them into the Kittitas County Corrections Center on suspicion of Attempted Homicide 1st Degree, Arson 1st Degree and Possession of Improvised Explosive Devices.\n\nWilliam Bledsoe continues to stand by his sons, both of whom worked at the family roofing business, Bledsoe & Sons Gutters and Sheet Metal and lived with him at his Ellensburg home.\n\n\u201cI want you to remember, I am their dad, I am not their victim,\u201d Bledsoe, who was treated for smoke inhalation, told ABC News. \u201cI\u2019m probably not the easiest guy to live with. \u2026 I\u2019m not the easiest guy to work with. My boys are my boys and I\u2019ll never abandon them and not support them.\u201d Adding, \u201cI know what they [the court] told me \u2026 but I have a hard time believing that.\"\n\nWhen arrested, the twins allegedly told officers their 70-year-old father is \"difficult to live with and work for\" and that was part of their motivation, according to Washington's Daily Record News. On Tuesday, Sept. 17, Caleb and Joshua Bledsoe were ordered to be held on $1 million bail each.\n\nThe twins allegedly discussed various ways to kill their father an hour before starting the fire, the Daily Record reported, including shooting him and burying his body in a hole already dug on the property. After the twins allegedly set the fire, Joshua held the door shut while William Bledsoe attempted to get out, according to a statement read by prosecutors in court.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Twin brothers Caleb and...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-22 16:49:29 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Twin brothers Caleb and...", "title": "Twin Brothers Accused Of Trying To Kill Their Father", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/21/caleb-joshua-bledsoe_n_3968522.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1366374/images/o-CALEB-JOSHUA-BLEDSOE-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twin brothers Caleb and...", "creator": "cavanshays", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1366374/images/o-CALEB-JOSHUA-BLEDSOE-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Twin Brothers Accused Of Trying To Kill Their Father", "site": "@HuffPostCrime", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-21 16:49:29 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=3968522", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "crime", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "william bledsoe sons,Joshua Bledsoe,william bledsoe,william bledsoe murder,ellensburg twins murder,caleb bledsoe,twins attempted murder father,ellensburg twins,william bledsoe twins,twins attempted murder", "article": {"section": "Crime", "tag": "william bledsoe sons,Joshua Bledsoe,william bledsoe,william bledsoe murder,ellensburg twins murder,caleb bledsoe,twins attempted murder father,ellensburg twins,william bledsoe twins,twins attempted murder", "published_time": "2013-09-21 16:49:29 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-09-21 16:49:29 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb91f\"", "article_summary": "Twin brothers Caleb and Joshua Bledsoe are accused of trying to kill their father, but their father doesn't see himself as a victim, saying he will \"never abandon\" his sons.\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 17, Caleb and Joshua Bledsoe were ordered to be held on $1 million bail each.\nAfter the twins allegedly set the fire, Joshua held the door shut while William Bledsoe attempted to get out, according to a statement read by prosecutors in court.\nThe twins allegedly discussed various ways to kill their father an hour before starting the fire, the Daily Record reported, including shooting him and burying his body in a hole already dug on the property.\nWhen arrested, the twins allegedly told officers their 70-year-old father is \"difficult to live with and work for\" and that was part of their motivation, according to Washington's Daily Record News."}
