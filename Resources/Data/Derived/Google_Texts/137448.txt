A former employee at the Eastgate postal facility has pleaded guilty to stealing medicine being sent to veterans by the Veterans Administration.

Paula Gass appeared before Federal Magistrate Bill Carter.

She faces up to five years in prison at sentencing on April 6.

Prosecutor Perry Piper said postal agents had determined that an Eastgate facility employee was stealing mail. Agents narrowed their focus to Ms. Gass.

Agents placed a package from the VA into the mail that appeared to be like many others than had been stolen.

On the morning of Dec. 12, 2013, agents observed Ms. Gass open the corner of the package, rifle it, then eventually place it under a bundle of magazines on a cart. She later left with the package under her jacket.

The package was found after a traffic stop.

The prosecutor said Ms. Gass admitted that she had been stealing packages for six months. She said he is addicted to pain pills and was using those she was stealing to supplement the ones she was prescribed.
