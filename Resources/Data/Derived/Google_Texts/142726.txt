Mary Ellen Balchunis will be the sole challenger to incumbent Pat Meehan’s reelection bid in the wake of this Tuesday’s candidacy deadline.

Republican Meehan is the incumbent for Pennsylvania’s 7th Congressional District which extends into lower Berks and Montgomery counties as well as parts of Chester and Delaware counties.

A former U.S Attorney and current Chester Hill resident, he was reelected into his second term in 2012 with a near 60 percent majority, beating out Democrat George Bradley.

As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, the lawmaker has made addressing the risk of cyber threats one of his priorities.

In the business realm he advocates tax cuts for small businesses and investment in infrastructure.

In Congress he has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and to defund organizations like National Public Radio. He also voted for the Cut, Gap and Balance Act heavily supported by the Tea Party.

Balchunis, a political science professor at La Salle University, declared her candidacy after earning the unanimous endorsement of the Delaware County Democratic Committee in February.

In contrast to Meehan, she favors upholding the Affordable Care Act.

She has also gone on record as a strong supporter of equal pay and “sensible” gun laws.

Primary elections for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will take place on May 20.
