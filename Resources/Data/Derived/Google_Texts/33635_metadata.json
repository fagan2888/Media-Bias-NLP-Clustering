But the bottom line is this: I think we should be celebrating today, and it\u2019s discouraging to me that instead this has become such a divisive day. We had a great election in November. \u2026 For the first time we\u2019ve got a united front where we can oppose President Obama.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a united Congress, and they\u2019re giving the green light to the president on amnesty,\u201d Beck said. \u201cThey\u2019re giving a green light on the CRominbus \u2014 that\u2019s a trillion dollars, Chris!\u201d\n\nBeck reversed and analogized the situation, asking Stewart what he would do if he found Beck in a brothel, insisting that he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong and was just friends with all the women.\n\nStewart laughed. \u201cWell, it depends, Glenn. How attractive are the young ladies in the brothel, right?\u201d\n\nBeck shook his head. \u201cYou told, us, Chris, to come down on you like a bag of bricks if we ever felt you were losing your soul. This is bag of bricks time. We think you\u2019re losing your soul.\u201d\n\nStewart said he appreciated Beck\u2019s words, but remained firm in his decision, saying he thinks Beck may have misunderstood some of his previous stances.\n\n\u201cI do think that there are times where, you and I agree, that you\u2019ve indicated, that I haven\u2019t agreed with you,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve indicated that I\u2019ve said or implied things that I certainly haven\u2019t, and I never have. And I think you and I agree on far more than we disagree.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the game, Chris,\u201d Beck said heatedly. \u201cYou\u2019re playing the game. Stop playing the game!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think we can do better, Chris?\u201d Beck\u2019s co-host Stu Burguiere added. \u201cYou don\u2019t think we can do better than John Boehner?\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, gentlemen, who do you suppose that we should support here?\u201d Stewart retorted.\n\nAll three immediately said Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert would make a far better speaker than John Boehner.\n\n\u201cDo you know how many votes Louie Gohmert will get?\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAs much as I like Louie, he\u2019s not the person to lead the house right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut John Boehner is?\u201d Beck said.\n\n\u201cWe can agree to disagree on that,\u201d Stewart remarked.\n\nBeck told Stewart that people are \u201cdone\u201d with the kind of games he is playing, and that he will not be re-elected if he continues playing politics against the interests of the American people.\n\n\u201cGlenn, I disagree with you,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI think that by 2016, when the American people see what the Republicans have been trying to do for the last years, when we now have allies in the Senate who will help us to do those things in the next two years, we\u2019re going to be able to move forward on the REINS Act, on reforming Obamacare, or eliminating Obamacare \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe you,\u201d Beck said flatly. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence. You\u2019ve never done it, Chris! It\u2019s never happened!\u201d\n\nBeck concluded by saluting Stewart for having the courage to come on the show, but reiterated that he is \u201cworried\u201d about the man\u2019s soul.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
