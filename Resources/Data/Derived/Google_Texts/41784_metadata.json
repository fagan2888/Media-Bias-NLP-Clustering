From 2006 through 2010, it was 15.6 percent, strongly suggesting that healthcare reform is having an impact on the tenures of hospital CEOs. For example, the law established financial penalties for hospitals with poor patient safety records and high rates of patient readmissions.In Minnesota, the hospital CEO turnover rate was 16 percent in 2015, or two percentage points lower than the national average, placing it 33rd among states, tied with Kentucky and South Dakota. Although the rate held steady nationally between 2014 and 2015, it jumped in Minnesota from 11 percent in 2014 to 16 percent last year.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "david burda, healthcare, health care, hospital, ceo, hospital leadership, leadership, turnover, american college of healthcare executives, ache, deborah bowen, patient protection and affordable care act, affordable care act, ppaca, aca, obamacare, healthcare reform, health care reform, patient safety, patient readmission", "og": {"url": "http://tcbmag.com/News/Recent-News/2016/March/High-Turnover-Of-Hospital-CEOs-Continue/", "image": "http://tcbmag.com/CMSTemplates/TCB/Images/fb-twin-cities-business.png", "type": "article", "description": "Nearly one in five top hospital posts changed hands in 2015, new data show.", "title": "High Turnover Of Hospital CEOs Continue"}, "fb": {"app_id": 385902024814671}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,tcbmag.com", "description": "Nearly one in five top hospital posts changed hands in 2015, new data show."}, "article_summary": "From 2006 through 2010, it was 15.6 percent, strongly suggesting that healthcare reform is having an impact on the tenures of hospital CEOs.\nDo you want to get the week\u2019s freshest health care news and insights delivered directly to your inbox?\nFor example, the law established financial penalties for hospitals with poor patient safety records and high rates of patient readmissions.In Minnesota, the hospital CEO turnover rate was 16 percent in 2015, or two percentage points lower than the national average, placing it 33rd among states, tied with Kentucky and South Dakota.\nAlthough the rate held steady nationally between 2014 and 2015, it jumped in Minnesota from 11 percent in 2014 to 16 percent last year.\nTo receive business news directly in your inbox each Tuesday and Thursday, sign up for our free e-newsletter, Briefcase, and be sure to join the conversation by commenting below."}
