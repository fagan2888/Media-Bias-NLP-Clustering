Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Tuesday offered up some words of advice to fans of Sen. Ted Cruz who haven’t liked his criticism of the Texas Republican’s tactics: “Get over it.”

The radio host told his listeners that although “so many people have been mad” at him for questioning Cruz’s effort to defund Obamacare, he was standing by his critique of the senator.

“I’ve questioned whether or not what he did was the best thing for this argument,” he said on “The Mike Huckabee Show.” “It’s not that I don’t like Ted Cruz. It’s not that I’m disrespecting Ted Cruz. You know, I’ve found that some people, if you say anything other than Ted Cruz is the greatest living senator that America has ever had, they’re mad at you.”

“Well, get over it,” he said. “I’m going to call it like I see it, folks.”

And in this case, Huckabee said, “I’m telling you that it’s harder to get 60 Democrats to vote against their party and their president than it is to get 51. And so I’m sticking by this.”

“And the reason that a lot of the very conservative Republican senators… were completely against this whole effort and move was because they knew what they were doing was moving toward a situation that they could not get themselves out of,” he said.

Huckabee again knocked Cruz’s marathon speech on the Senate floor, noting it “was not a filibuster.”

“I think the one thing that he did that was valuable, he brought out a lot of things about Obamacare that we needed all to know and be reminded of,” he said. “But the unfortunate thing, that vote still went forward. He didn’t stop the progress or the flow of the Senate business.”
