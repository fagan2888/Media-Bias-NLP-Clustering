A Smyrna couple was away from their house, meeting with potential buyers for it, when it caught fire Saturday morning.

The fire, which was contained in less than 10 minutes by five units of the Smyrna Fire Department, may have started in the dryer that was left running. The call came in at 9:15 a.m. Saturday.

Justin and Tiffany Granstaff and their two children have lived in the house at 300 Whitney Drive in Smyrna in the Bent Tree community. No one was home at the time.

“We thank God for that,” said Justin Granstaff.

The house was saved, but is unlivable right now. There’s fire damage in the kitchen and utility room and smoke damage throughout the house, Smyrna Fire Chief Bill Culbertson said.

“We will get the house fixed,” said Justin Granstaff. “And we’ve had multiple people say we can stay with them.”

Once repaired, the Granstaffs still plan to sell the home, which was built in 1991.
