Your medical file might also include personal financial information if, for instance, you used your credit card to cover your co-pay.\n\nIt might come as a surprise to learn that medical data are actually worth more to cyber thieves than financial records. \u201cOn the black market, health information is more valuable than credit or debit card information,\u201d according to Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute. That\u2019s because it includes a lot more than just details about your medical condition. For instance, by knowing your weight, height, eye color and other physical characteristics, \u201cbad guys like Al Qaeda can create fake identities.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s No Taking It Back\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf a thief steals your financial information, you have to go through the hassle of closing credit cards, changing passwords on bank accounts, notifying lenders and the three major credit bureaus, etc. Granted, it\u2019s a pain in the neck, but once you open new accounts, your financial data is again private.\n\nHowever, if your medical identity is stolen, you don\u2019t have the opportunity for a clean start.\n\n\u201cIf it leaks out, it\u2019s out forever,\u201d says Ponemon. If there\u2019s a negative stigma associated with your health data, you can\u2019t undo it. Imagine the potential consequences if your medical records indicate you were once treated for a sexually-transmitted disease or had an abortion or underwent a sex change or have a slow-growing cancer or a body mass index (BMI) that indicates you are excessively obese.\n\nEven worse, the consequences of having your medical information fall into the hands of unscrupulous individuals can literally be life threatening. \u201cIn addition to the financial impact, there can be a medical impact, says Lisa Schifferle, an attorney in the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Division of Privacy and Identity Theft Protection. When a thief uses your identity to get medical care, the imposter\u2019s information could end up on \u201cyour\u201d medical record. If you are in an accident and rushed to the emergency room, doctors retrieving your electronic record could see the wrong blood type or not know that you are allergic to certain medications, or that you have a pre-existing condition. This could lead to misdiagnosis or mistreatment, with potentially deadly consequences.\n\nDiagnosing the Problem\n\nUnfortunately, the very organizations and individuals we turn to when we are sick--hospitals, doctors, nurses and medical personnel--are making the situation worse.\n\nOften, it's simple negligence: The receptionist leaves your file on the desk when s/he goes home at the end of the day--in plain sight of the office cleaning crew. Or patient records are simply thrown in the trash instead of being shredded. A growing issue is that doctors, nurses and other medical personnel are now communicating with patients and accessing medical records using their own personal devices- cell phones, home computers and tablets. These don\u2019t have the level of security needed to protect patient information.\n\nAnother factor is that hospitals are reluctant to spend money on the personnel or technology needed to stay ahead of potential threats because they feel it would be better spent on things that could directly improve patient care, like a new MRI machine, updated operating room equipment or increasing staff, according to Ponemon.\n\n\u201cMedical providers don\u2019t consider privacy and security a high priority. They\u2019re not using state-of-the-art technology. A lot of these organizations really don\u2019t have professional [IT] staff like other industries have. They don\u2019t feel they\u2019re a target of cyber crime. And they\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nUnintended Consequences\n\nThe Ponemon study found that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has also made Americans more susceptible to medical identity theft, citing \u201cthe documented insecure websites, databases and health information exchanges that are highly vulnerable to insider and outside threats.\u201d\n\nHealth information exchanges (HIEs), which are at the forefront of the trend toward creating a national digital database of patient information, are making us much more vulnerable. According to Healthit.gov, HIEs make it possible for \u201cdoctors, nurses, pharmacists, other health care providers and patients to appropriately access and securely share a patient\u2019s vital medical information electronically.\u201d This is supposed to result in faster and more accurate treatment and lower health-care costs. But HIEs contain the medical records of hundreds of millions of individuals; if identity thieves manage to break in, it will make the Target (TGT) hackers seem like amateurs.\n\nThe scary part is that it would not be especially difficult to obtain the records, the data on these systems is only as secure as the weakest link. All an identity thief has to do is find one vulnerability--a hospital with a bad firewall, or a doctor\u2019s office with out-dated security software--and this could open up hundreds of thousands of records.\n\nUncle Sam Wants\u2026 Your Medical Data\n\nIn addition, HIE\u2019s send patient data to the federal government. In theory, the purpose is to supply information on such things as the number and types of surgeries performed, the rate of infection, complications, how many patients died and the costs involved so that the government can do economic modeling.\n\nBut this information doesn\u2019t just land in the hands of statisticians at the Department of Health and Human Services. Other government agencies- such as the Internal Revenue Service, which is charged with enforcing participation in the Affordable Care Act- also have access to it. In Ponemon\u2019s words, \u201cYour information may not be very secure when it is kept at a local hospital or medical network, but once it is shared with the federal government, it\u2019s totally out of your control.\u201d\n\nHealth care is a scarce and expensive resource, and Ponemon suggests that at some point we as a society, \u201cwill have to make choices about who\u2019s going to get treatment. You can\u2019t help but think that older, less productive individuals won\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nTo help stay ahead of the scammers and protect your information, experts offer the following steps: :\n\n1.Inquire about what specific steps the hospital/doctor\u2019s office takes to safeguard your medical and financial information.\n\nAfter his own mother was a victim of medical identity theft in a nursing home, this was one of the first questions Ponemon asked when looking for a new facility for her.\n\n2. Ask who on staff is in charge of maintaining the privacy of patient records. (Hint: If a provider doesn't know or don\u2019t have such a person, consider other options)\n\n3. Don\u2019t automatically provide your Social Security number when filling out a medical or new patient form. There\u2019s no legal reason a doctor needs this, according to Ponemon. If they insist, compromise by giving just the last four numbers.\n\n4. If you are on Medicare, don\u2019t carry your Social Security or Medicare card with you. For some reason, the Department of Health and Human Services doesn\u2019t get it. Despite the danger, they insist on using your Social Security number on your Medicare card! \u201cThere\u2019s no question they are putting us in harm\u2019s way, providing the bad guys with rich information because they\u2019re not smart enough to come up with an alternative,\u201d says Ponemon.\n\n5.
