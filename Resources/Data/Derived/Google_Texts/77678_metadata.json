Twenty hours after Peyton Manning called out the offense \u2014 \u201d We stunk,\u201d \u2014 the Broncos\u2019 first-teamers scored touchdowns on Manning\u2019s first two passes, precise spirals to Julius Thomas and Demaryius Thomas.\n\nWell into the second day of hitting each other, and the first in full pads, the teams became testy. Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib and Texans running back Ronnie Brown jawed at each other, and Houston\u2019s J.J. Watt didn\u2019t seem particularly pleased with Denver right tackle Chris Clark.\n\nIt was more of a slow boil than a feud, typical for these shared practice sessions.\n\nFor the second consecutive week, the Broncos likely lost a key player. Jordan Norwood, who appeared to have the team made as the sixth receiver and starting punt returner, injured his left knee on a passing play while covered by Houston\u2019s Brandon Harris. Norwood walked into the Broncos\u2019 facility on crutches and sporting a heavy brace. There\u2019s concern that he tore his left anterior cruciate ligament, which would sideline him for the season.\n\nNorwood\u2019s absence leaves free-agent receiver Isaiah Burse a potential path to the final roster. He must show improvement, however, as the Broncos could elect to go with Wes Welker on punt returns. Denver has had an undrafted free agent make its final roster for 10 consecutive seasons.\n\nLast week, the Broncos lost linebacker Danny Trevathan for 6-to-8 weeks with a fractured left tibia. Trevathan had his toe stepped on, locking his leg as he was struck.\n\nFootnotes\n\nDefensive coordinator Jack Del Rio remains pleased with Von Miller\u2019s progress. The linebacker continues to receive full practice work, and remains on track to start the season opener. It has not been decided whether Miller will play in the preseason. \u2026 Emmanuel Sanders (quadriceps), Kayvon Webster (ankle) and Virgil Green (calf) worked out with the trainer, but did not practice. Sanders said that he isn\u2019t sure if he will play again in the preseason. It\u2019s unlikely the receiver will this week. The Broncos, for now, believe he has time to get ready and regain his timing with Manning. \u2026 Manning wasn\u2019t the only one upset with the offense on Monday. Coordinator Adam Gase spoke his mind in a meeting. \u201cI said my piece. It was important that we had a better day. It\u2019s not like we are in there patting each other on the back (based on the preseason),\u201d Gase said. \u2026 Top overall draft pick Jadeveon Clowney didn\u2019t finish practice Wednesday, leaving with a half-hour remaining with an undisclosed injury. He collided with an offensive player before leaving. The Texans\u2019 linebacker watched the rest of practice from a tent, removing his shoulder pads. He has been a limited participant in the preseason as he recovers from sports hernia surgery performed in June. \u2026 Bennie Fowler made a leaping catch from third-string quarterback Zac Dysert during 11-on-11 work.\n\nTroy E.
