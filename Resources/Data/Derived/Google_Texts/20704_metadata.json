At least that is the hope of Congressional Democrats hoping to seize the landmark ruling in favor of same-sex marriage at the Supreme Court earlier this summer to expand LGBTQ rights to the workplace, the classroom and in public spaces.\n\nIn 28 states, gay and lesbian Americans have no protection from workplace discrimination while transgender Americans are only protected in 19 states.\n\nDemocrats in Congress are looking to change that statistic once again. Congressional democrats will introduce the Equality Act in both the House and Senate today, a bill that would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity to the existing list of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin, protected against discrimination. The bill would also clarify that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act cannot be used as a defense for anti-LGBTQ discrimination. The Equality Act would also expand the types of public accommodations covered under the Civil Rights Act to include banks, grocers, retail outlets, bars and taxi cabs.\n\nIn 2013, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act died in the Republican-led House after passing the Senate in a historic vote.

David Cicilline, who is openly gay, in the House.\n\n\u201cIn most states, a same-sex couple can get married on Saturday, post pictures on Facebook on Sunday, and then risk being fired from their job or kicked out of their apartment on Monday,\u201d Cicilline wrote in a letter seeking Congressional support. \u201cA majority of states in our country do not have laws that protect LGBT individuals against discrimination \u2026 We need a uniform federal standard that protects all LGBT Americans from discrimination.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats look to expand the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity", "title": "\u201cThe Equality Act\u201d: Democrats push bill banning LGBT discrimination", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Democrats look to expand the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity", "title": "\u201cThe Equality Act\u201d: Democrats push bill banning LGBT discrimination", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/23/the_equality_act_democrats_push_bill_banning_lgbt_discrimination/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/LGBT-793x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrats look to expand the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity", "title": "\u201cThe Equality Act\u201d: Democrats push bill banning LGBT discrimination", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/LGBT-793x960.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Congress, Democrats, LGBTQ, lgbtq rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9b7\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Congress, Democrats, LGBTQ, lgbtq rights, News, Politics NewsWhere EDNA failed, the Equality Act will succeed.\nThe Equality Act would also expand the types of public accommodations covered under the Civil Rights Act to include banks, grocers, retail outlets, bars and taxi cabs.\nThis time, the same senator who ushered EDNA through the upper chamber is a co-sponsor of the Equality Act.\nIn 28 states, gay and lesbian Americans have no protection from workplace discrimination while transgender Americans are only protected in 19 states.\nThe bill would also clarify that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act cannot be used as a defense for anti-LGBTQ discrimination."}
