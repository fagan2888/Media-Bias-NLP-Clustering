Our petition asks the companies to take commonsense steps to help put a stop to the scammers\u2019 abilities to prey on the unsuspecting.\u201d\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center reports that romance scams cost Americans more than $82 million in losses during the last six months of 2014. To combat such losses, specific anti-fraud measures the Fraud Watch Network urges the online dating sites to implement include:\n\nEmploy algorithms to detect suspicious language patterns used by scammers.\n\nSearch for fake profiles across multiple dating websites.\n\nIssue alerts to any member who has been in contact with someone using a fraudulent profile.\n\nEducate members with tips on how to avoid romance scammers.\n\nAs part of its current campaign, the AARP Fraud Watch Network has posted tips to advise dating site members how to avoid online scams. One handy tip is: Before you engage with anyone on a dating site, use Google\u2019s \u201csearch by image\u201d feature to see if that person\u2019s image shows up in other places using a different name. If an email from a potential suitor seems suspicious, cut and paste it into Google and see if the words pop up on any romance scam sites. Consumers can learn more for themselves, their friends and family members at the Fraud Watch Network.\n\n# # #\n\nAbout AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
