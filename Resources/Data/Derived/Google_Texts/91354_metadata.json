The stunner was the increase in people who reported no leisure-time physical activity.\n\nIn 1988, 19 percent of women were inactive. By 2010, that number had jumped to 52 percent.\n\nFor men, the rate nearly quadrupled, going from 11 to 43 percent in the same time period.\n\nBut what didn\u2019t change was the number of calories people consumed. In other words, people were eating about the same but exercising significantly less.\n\nDr. Uri Ladabaum, a gastroenterologist at Stanford University Medical Center, led the study. He said that the research can only suggest an association between inactivity and increasing obesity, but that people should not decide diet is irrelevant to obesity.\n\n\u201cWe would not want to suggest in any way that caloric intake is not important,\u201d Ladabaum said. \u201cBut it raises the question of how much of the change in obesity prevalence might be related to physical activity.\u201d\n\nThe researchers analyzed results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. Participants reported their activity over the last month and their diet over the last 24 hours. Ladabaum said the team did not find a difference in total caloric count or breakdown by protein, carbohydrate and fat, over the 22-year study period.\n\nThe prevalence of obesity increased from 1988-2010, from 25 to 35 percent of women and from 20 to 35 percent of men.\n\nThe data included survey results from more than 17,000 participants between 1988-1994 and about 5,000 people each year from 1995 through 2010.\n\nThe study was published in the American Journal of Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a national survey, 52% of women and 43% of men said they got no exercise in the prior month.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Stanford Study: Inactivity, More Than Diet, Linked to Obesity Increase\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/07\\/stanford-study-inactivity-more-than-diet-linked-to-obesity-increase\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-07 18:17:01\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-09 12:38:39\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20066,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Obesity\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/07\\/153764421.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "In a national survey, 52% of women and 43% of men said they got no exercise in the prior month.", "title": "Stanford Study: Inactivity, More Than Diet, Linked to Obesity Increase", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/07/stanford-study-inactivity-more-than-diet-linked-to-obesity-increase/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/07/153764421-640x425.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "obesity,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09c8\"", "article_summary": "Stanford Study: Inactivity, More Than Diet, Linked to Obesity IncreaseNew research from Stanford shows that physical activity \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 may be a bigger driver of the obesity epidemic than diet is.\nThe researchers looked at national survey results of people\u2019s health habits \u2014 including diet and exercise \u2014 from 1988 to 2010.\nThe data included survey results from more than 17,000 participants between 1988-1994 and about 5,000 people each year from 1995 through 2010.\nHe said that the research can only suggest an association between inactivity and increasing obesity, but that people should not decide diet is irrelevant to obesity.\nDr. Uri Ladabaum, a gastroenterologist at Stanford University Medical Center, led the study."}
