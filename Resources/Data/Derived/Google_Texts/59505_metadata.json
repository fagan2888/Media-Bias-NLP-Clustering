Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards have officially declared their candidacies for the seat being vacated by outgoing Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski. But while both are longtime Democrats, they could not be more different in how they are perceived by voters, both in terms of their relationship to Maryland\u2019s Jewish community and in their support for Israel.\n\nWith more than a year until the primary elections, Van Hollen \u2014 who has represented the state\u2019s 8th Congressional District from his base in Montgomery County since 2002 \u2014 is widely regarded as the party establishment\u2019s favored son, having scooped up an endorsement by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) just days after Mikulski\u2019s March 2 announcement that she was retiring. He\u2019s also been endorsed by the Montgomery County Executive Isiah \u201cIke\u201d Leggett and all nine members of the Montgomery County Council.\n\nEdwards, by contrast, is seen as the populist underdog, the first African-American woman to represent Maryland in the House of Representatives and bearer of a coveted endorsement from the progressive women\u2019s organization, Emily\u2019s List.\n\nOn Israel, observers say the candidates hold vastly different records.\n\n\u201cLooking at their pro-Israel record closely over the years, there\u2019s a huge contrast between Van Hollen\u2019s excellent record and Edwards\u2019 very poor record,\u201d said Morris Amitay, a former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). \u201cThere were times when you had 350 co-sponsors and she wasn\u2019t one, or good letters where 317 members signed and she did not.\u201d\n\nEdwards, who represents the 4th Congressional District in Prince George\u2019s County, has received campaign contributions in her previous congressional races from J Street PAC, the political funding arm of the left-leaning pro-Israel organization.\n\nThe PAC\u2019s bio of Edwards, available on its website, quotes her 2008 campaign platform, in which she wrote that she believes that \u201cthe U.S. should not cease in its efforts to achieve a two-state solution in which Israel\u2019s neighbors recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state, living in security alongside an independent and autonomous Palestinian state\u201d and that \u201cresolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be pursued in parallel to diplomatic engagement that must take place with Iran, Syria and Arab allies.\u201d\n\nAlthough a majority of American Jews support a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, Edwards\u2019 belief that Iran, Syria and America\u2019s Arab allies \u2014 almost all of whom are sworn enemies of Israel \u2014 should be engaged in the negotiations may be outside of the mainstream Jewish community\u2019s pro-Israel outlook.\n\nDuring her time in Congress, Edwards often voted in the minority against legislation considered \u201cpro-Israel\u201d by most lawmakers. A few examples include voting against a 2009 bill that passed by a vote of 344-26 condemning the United Nation\u2019s Goldstone Report, an investigation that accused the State of Israel of human rights violations but was later recanted as a fabrication. She also refused to sign congressional letters supporting Israel, such as a 2010 letter drafted by Reps. Ted Poe (R-Texas) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.) declaring Congress\u2019 view that Israel has the right to defend itself and a 2014 letter drafted by Reps. Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) taking a firm stance against Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n[pullquote]Van Hollen caught flak in 2006 when he authored a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice critical of Israel\u2019s actions in Lebanon. [/pullquote]\n\nEdwards, though, has voted with the majority on legislation providing financial aid to Israel, including last year\u2019s emergency appropriations bill providing $225 million to resupply Israel\u2019s Iron Dome missile defense system.\n\nAttempts to reach Edwards for comment for this article were unsuccessful.\n\nMany in Maryland\u2019s Jewish community describe Van Hollen\u2019s as nearly perfect, but it wasn\u2019t always that way.\n\nVan Hollen caught flak in 2006 when he authored a letter to then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that was critical of Israel\u2019s actions in its battle against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.\n\n\u201cThe killing and kidnapping of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah precipitated the current crisis in the region. Those actions were followed by Hezbollah rocket attacks that have fallen indiscriminately in Haifa and other Israeli population centers. Like any sovereign country, Israel has the right and responsibility to defend itself,\u201d wrote Van Hollen. \u201cThe Israeli response, however, has now gone beyond the destruction of Hezbollah\u2019s military assets. It has caused huge damage to Lebanon\u2019s civilian infrastructure, resulted in the large loss of civilian life and produced over 750,000 refugees. Hezbollah is undeniably the culprit, but it is the Lebanese people \u2014 not Hezbollah \u2014 who are increasingly the victims of the violence.\u201d\n\nThough Van Hollen angered some in the Jewish community with his letter, he quickly clarified his position in a follow-up letter, writing that he never \u201ccalled Israel\u2019s actions unjustified\u201d and that the letter to Rice was \u201cmeant as a critique of Bush administration policy in the Middle East,\u201d according to JTA.\n\nToday, few of his Jewish supporters even remember the incident.\n\nIn a recent phone interview, Van Hollen reflected on the letter.\n\n\u201cThis was a situation where there were some differences with some in the community, but it was not a situation where we had separate goals,\u201d said Van Hollen. \u201cThe goals were the same, which was to ensure the safety of Israel. [But] there were some different perspectives on the best approach to achieving that.\u201d\n\nVan Hollen spoke about what he believes to be his \u201cclose, working and personal\u201d relationship with the local community.\n\n\u201cWe have shared values, shared priorities,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, only Hoyer, the House minority whip, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley have ruled out a Senate campaign, and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake is mulling over a possible run. But while the establishment coalesces around Van Hollen, the shadow of Mikulski\u2019s historic firsts, including being the first woman popularly elected to the Senate, have some feeling that Mikulski\u2019s replacement should be a woman.\n\nEmily\u2019s List, whose first endorsed candidate was Mikulski in 1986, endorsed Edwards last week.\n\n\u201cDonna Edwards is a true progressive champion with an outstanding record of fighting for women and families in Congress,\u201d Stephanie Schriock, the organization\u2019s president, said in a press release. \u201cShe is poised to make history as the second African-American woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate \u2014 the first in over two decades.\u201d\n\nThe group cited Edwards\u2019 work to get Congress to pass the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, when Edwards was a community organizer, and her more recent work backing much of the group\u2019s supported legislation, such as the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Affordable Care Act and funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nMeanwhile, Van Hollen has swayed a number of women\u2019s issues activists of his own, namely membership of NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland and current and former lawmakers, including state Sens. Susan Lee, Nancy King and Mary Boergers, and Dels. Ana Sol Gutierrez and Carol Petzold.\n\nIn endorsing Van Hollen, Susan Turnbull, former chair of the Maryland Democratic Party, former vice chair of the Democratic National Committee and former chair of Jewish Women International, said that the choice between Van Hollen and Edwards was an easy one.\n\n\u201cFor me, looking at who I might want to replace Barbara Mikulski in the U.S. Senate, there is no other candidate that I can see who I think would be a better senator for the state of Maryland,\u201d said Turnbull. \u201cTo me, what a leader does is bring people with you and throughout his career, Chris Van Hollen has done that. He has taken on the issues that I personally feel are important for myself, for my family and for my community.\u201d\n\nTurnbull said that she did consider backing a female candidate, but felt that her belief in Van Hollen\u2019s abilities exceeded this concern.\n\n\u201cI have no qualms about women running for office,\u201d she said. \u201c[A woman has] every right and responsibility [to run for office] if she thinks she is the best candidate for that seat.\u201d\n\ndshapiro@midatlanticmedia.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://jewishtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/032715_mikulski-300x213.jpg"}, "shareaholic": {"site_name": "Baltimore Jewish Times", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://jewishtimes.com/35737/vastly-different-candidates/news/", "article_author_name": "Ebony Brown", "image": "http://jewishtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/032715_mikulski.jpg", "site_id": "1ecfd5bf5145368b2e27a3c31c39063d", "article_published_time": "2015-03-27T13:30:01+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-25T15:50:00+00:00", "keywords": "featured right, national news, news", "wp_version": "7.6.1.9"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce374\"", "article_summary": "On Israel, observers say the candidates hold vastly different records.\n\u201cTo me, what a leader does is bring people with you and throughout his career, Chris Van Hollen has done that.\n\u201cThis was a situation where there were some differences with some in the community, but it was not a situation where we had separate goals,\u201d said Van Hollen.\nLike any sovereign country, Israel has the right and responsibility to defend itself,\u201d wrote Van Hollen.\nIn a recent phone interview, Van Hollen reflected on the letter."}
