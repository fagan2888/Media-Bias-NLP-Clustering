Mug shot\n\nFour people from Mayfair in Philadelphia have been arrested after they forcibly held down a man and tattooed racial slurs across his body.\n\nThe victim, 52, called police on Tuesday, claiming that he had been held against his will at his home on Brighton Street, and was bruised and tattooed. The police report states that he had been tattooed with \u201cinappropriate racial and sexual terms and images.\u201d\n\nPolice found the four alleged criminals asleep in the basement of his home. Police believe it may have been the cause of a \u201cdrug-fuelled\u201d argument that lasted several days.\n\nThe four people involved in the case have been identified as Corry Campbell, 20, Jennifer Pratt, 29, Sandra Ng, 19, and David Thomas, 27, all of whom lived on that same block or in the neighborhood. They face charges of simple assault, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering a person, possessing an instrument of crime, kidnapping, theft, robbery and conspiracy, and potentially hate crimes as well.\n\nWhen police searched the home where the incident took place, they discovered several prescription drugs containing Xanax and Oxycodone, marijuana, tattoo ink bottles, tattoo needles, and a station.\n\nAccording to a police statement, the victim \"displayed severely bruised and swollen hands, bruised eyes along with bruising to his legs, ribs and torso. The complainant informed police that he called 911 and left the location when the offenders fell asleep.\"\n\nThe report brings up memories of others who have been forcibly tattooed for revenge, such as the girl who got a tattoo of a poo pile on her back after cheating on her boyfriend, or the tattoo artist Andy Sakai who tattooed inappropriate Chinese words on any white person who asked for a Chinese symbol like \"peace\" or \"love\" out of pure frustration.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "forced tattoo, racial tattoo", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Four suspects are now facing charges after reportedly forcing racial tattoos onto a man.", "title": "Man Calls Police After Being \u2018Forcibly Tattooed\u2019 With Racial Slurs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-forcibly-tattooed-racial-slurs-after-4-suspects-held-him-down-274654", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/04/suspect-forced-tattoo-case.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Four suspects are now facing charges after reportedly forcing racial tattoos onto a man.", "title": "Man Calls Police After Being \u2018Forcibly Tattooed\u2019 With Racial Slurs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/man-forcibly-tattooed-racial-slurs-after-4-suspects-held-him-down-274654", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/04/suspect-forced-tattoo-case.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/04/suspect-forced-tattoo-case.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-04T15:57:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-04T15:57:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Four suspects are now facing charges after reportedly forcing racial tattoos onto a man."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd1b6\"", "article_summary": "Mug shotFour people from Mayfair in Philadelphia have been arrested after they forcibly held down a man and tattooed racial slurs across his body.\nCory Campbell, 20, was one of the suspects in the forced tattoo case that left a 52-year-old man bruised and tattooed with racial slurs.\nThe victim, 52, called police on Tuesday, claiming that he had been held against his will at his home on Brighton Street, and was bruised and tattooed.\nThe police report states that he had been tattooed with \u201cinappropriate racial and sexual terms and images.\u201dPolice found the four alleged criminals asleep in the basement of his home.\nAccording to a police statement, the victim \"displayed severely bruised and swollen hands, bruised eyes along with bruising to his legs, ribs and torso."}
