And he is still at it as he enters his seventh year in office, wildly exaggerating the impact of his actions by cherry-picking the good numbers and ignoring the bad ones.\n\nThis week, he was in Wayne, Michigan, speaking to a labor union audience at the Ford Motor Co., trumpeting his belief that the nation\u2019s manufacturing sector is back as a result his big-spending economic stimulus policies at the beginning of his administration.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt thanks to the steps we took early on to rescue our economy. \u2026 America is coming back,\u201d the president said. \u201cThe facts are the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s resurgence is real. Don\u2019t let anybody tell you otherwise,\u201d he said. Did he miss the results of last year\u2019s midterm elections?\n\nAs he has many times before, he ticked off some the statistics that he said showed the economy was humming right along. The stock market was up (but it plunged a few days before), wages were \u201con the rise again,\u201d and job creation was the strongest since the 1990s, he said.\n\nBut the truth is that wages over the course of Obama\u2019s administration have been largely flat, and job creation numbers were far below monthly rates in the recoveries of the \u201990s and \u201980s under Presidents Clinton and Reagan. Annual economic growth rates remained weak.\n\nHeading into the sixth year of this so-called recovery, the 140 million employment payroll count in November was up by a pathetic 1.2 percent over the 138.4 million in January 2008. New housing starts of nearly 1 million units in 2014 were far below the 2.1 million in 2005.\n\nAs for Obama\u2019s boast that unemployment was down to 5.8 (a figure riddled with statistical fiction), that\u2019s a long way from the 4.4 percent full-employment rate in May of 2007.\n\nAnd the president\u2019s boast that Detroit was churning out lots of cars conveniently leaves out the slowdown of our overall manufacturing sector, which grew at its slowest rate in six months in December.\n\nNone of these facts were mentioned in the news stories about Obama\u2019s speech, especially the one that Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate was 7.1 percent going into November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nOthers were underwhelmed. \u201cIt has been a slog,\u201d says economist Robert J. Samuelson. \u201cGenerally, the numbers aren\u2019t impressive.\u201d\n\nEven one of Obama\u2019s chief economic advisers and his Democratic critics in Congress are uncomfortable with the president\u2019s exaggerated claims.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s morning in America. I think we\u2019re digging our way out of a really deep hole, and we\u2019re still not all the way out of that hole,\u201d said Jason Furman, who is chairman of the president\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\n\u201cWages are certainly not all the way to where they want to be,\u201d he added. Not even close.\n\nIn a burst of speeches, including a major address at an AFL-CIO conference here, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a leftist firebrand, says that despite the numbers claimed by Obama, many millions of Americans have not benefited and are still struggling.\n\nThe \u201coverall picture doesn\u2019t tell us much about what\u2019s happening at ground level to tens of millions of Americans. Despite these cheery numbers, America\u2019s middle class is in deep trouble,\u201d she said.\n\nMany Democrats on Capitol Hill agree with Warren\u2019s criticism, though few are willing to criticize Obama and his policies for what is now considered the slowest, longest economic recovery since the Great Depression.\n\nFor the past six years, the liberal news media have been exaggerating anemic job numbers in the 200,000 range as if they were stunning, record-breaking achievements. But the fact that the numbers are swollen by large increases in part-time, low-paying work is rarely reported.\n\n\u201cThe jobless rate is down to 5.8 percent, but that is deceptive,\u201d University of Maryland economist Peter Morici wrote Thursday in his weekly analysis.\n\n\u201cFor example, one in six adult males between the ages of 25 and 54 is not working. Many (discouraged workers) don\u2019t show up in the unemployment count, because they are not actively looking for a job.\u201d\n\nThe news media similarly went bananas over the 4.8 percent second- and third-quarter economic growth rate. But the annual growth rate for the past year is about 2 to 3 percent, not enough to push good-paying, full-time jobs up to needed levels.\n\nIn the last decade or so, the economy has grown by an average of about 1.8 percent a year and produced around 7.3 million jobs. Compare that to the tax-cutting Reagan-Clinton years of 3.4 percent growth and 43 million jobs.\n\nObama was scheduled to take his Everything\u2019s Coming Up Roses sideshow to Arizona and Tennessee, where the unemployment rates are 6.8 and 7.1 percent, respectively.\n\nIt\u2019s doubtful you will hear those numbers on the nightly news.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Obama will be remembered for telling us over and over again that our existing medical insurance policies were safe from Obamacare, and that no one could take them away from us.", "title": "Behind Obama's positive statistics is a lackluster economy | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015_01_08_231204_37-480x300.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2015/01/09/behind-obamas-positive-statistics-is-a-lackluster-economy/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Obama will be remembered for telling us over and over again that our existing medical insurance policies were safe from Obamacare, and that no one could take them away from us.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2015_01_08_231204_37-480x300.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "Obama will be remembered for telling us over and over again that our existing medical insurance policies were safe from Obamacare, and that no one could take them away from us."}}, "article_summary": "But the annual growth rate for the past year is about 2 to 3 percent, not enough to push good-paying, full-time jobs up to needed levels.\nAs he has many times before, he ticked off some the statistics that he said showed the economy was humming right along.\nNone of these facts were mentioned in the news stories about Obama\u2019s speech, especially the one that Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate was 7.1 percent going into November, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAnnual economic growth rates remained weak.\n\u201cGenerally, the numbers aren\u2019t impressive.\u201dEven one of Obama\u2019s chief economic advisers and his Democratic critics in Congress are uncomfortable with the president\u2019s exaggerated claims."}
