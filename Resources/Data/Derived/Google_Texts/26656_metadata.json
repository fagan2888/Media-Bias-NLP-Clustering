Federal tax credits for doing so are available only through Connect for Health Colorado, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\n\nThe exchange plans to open its downtown store, at 1600 California St. on the mall, from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday to accommodate last-minute customers.\n\nPeople can also check the Connect for Health Colorado events calendar, talk to a health insurance broker or call the exchange at 855-752-6749.\n\nThe exchange planned to extend its hours to 10 p.m. Friday and midnight Saturday and Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe know from experience that we will see a number of customers in these final days of open enrollment,\u201d said Kevin Patterson, the exchange chief. \u201cBut I want to emphasize it is time to act. There are just a few days left for Coloradans to get covered in 2016. The penalty for going without coverage this year has increased.\u201d\n\nPeople who lost plans, such as customers of the closed Colorado HealthOP, will have until Feb. 29 to sign up for coverage that begins Mar. 1.\n\nThe federal tax penalty for going without coverage is expected to average nearly $1,000 per household, depending on 2016 income.\n\nExchange spokesman Luke Clarke said nearly 140,000 people had signed up through mid-January. Sixty-two percent are returning customers, and the rest are new.\n\nAdditionally, about 45,000 people had qualified for Medicaid through the exchange as of mid-January.\n\nThe Colorado Health Institute reported last year that expanded Medicaid eligibility had driven a huge increase in health coverage, but estimated that several hundred thousand people remain uninsured.\n\nClarke said last-minute applicants who fail to get an immediate decision will be accommodated. \u201cWe can get them in,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado health insurance exchange launches deadline push for coverage", "title": "Colorado health insurance exchange launches deadline push for coverage", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/29/colorado-health-insurance-exchange-launches-deadline-push-for-coverage/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151216_045606_denverpost.com-20150831__Connect_For_Health_Colorado-p1-1.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151216_045606_denverpost.com-20150831__Connect_For_Health_Colorado-p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-29T16:58:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:39:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Federal tax credits for doing so are available only through Connect for Health Colorado, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\nPeople can also check the Connect for Health Colorado events calendar, talk to a health insurance broker or call the exchange at 855-752-6749.\nThe Colorado Health Institute reported last year that expanded Medicaid eligibility had driven a huge increase in health coverage, but estimated that several hundred thousand people remain uninsured.\nColorado\u2019s health insurance exchange is making a last-minute push to sign people up for coverage and warning of tax penalties if they don\u2019t.\nThe exchange plans to open its downtown store, at 1600 California St. on the mall, from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday to accommodate last-minute customers."}
