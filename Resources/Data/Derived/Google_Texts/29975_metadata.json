But an August update found that the number of taxpayer accounts violated was closer to 114,000. But there was yet another caveat: It seems an additional 220,000 accounts had been \u201cinappropriately accessed,\u201d which brought the overall total to 330,000 accounts.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Website Still Vulnerable to Hackers, Federal Watchdog Warns\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. A February 2016 \u201cupdate\u201d showed that another 390,000 accounts had been inappropriately accessed, bringing the new grand total to 720,000 \u2013 at least for now.\n\nThe seemingly endless breaches of some of the most sensitive data the government keeps of its citizens, including its tax records, Social Security numbers and other personal identity, was highlighted in a new Government Accountability Office (GAO) progress report released on Monday.\n\nThe 36-page study provided an update on how well the often beleaguered agency is performing in trying to fortify the protection of key finance and tax processing systems and networks in order to combat fraud and identity theft, prevent disruptions of agency operations and ward off malicious and destructive cyber-attacks from outsiders.\n\nTo be sure, the IRS has made some progress in implementing information security controls, the GAO acknowledged. It cited, for example, steps the agency has made to tighten access to key financial applications and to develop \u201cmulti-factor authentication processes\u201d throughout the agency to safeguard data.\n\nRelated: Obamacare Fraud Is Rampant and Unchecked, GAO Warns\n\n\u201cHowever, weaknesses in the controls limited their effectiveness in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer data,\u201d the report states. For instance, the IRS has not always applied proper password settings for identifying and authenticating users. It has also failed to take appropriate steps to restrict access to servers. And it hasn\u2019t done enough to insure that \u201csensitive user authentication data were encrypted.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAn underlying reason for these weaknesses is that IRS has not effectively implemented elements of its information security program,\u201d the report complained. \u201cThe agency had a comprehensive framework for its program, such as assessing risk for its systems, developing security plans, and providing employees with security awareness and specialized training. However, aspects of its program had not yet been effectively implemented.\u201d\n\nThe IRS has daunting tasks and often operates under tight budgetary strictures imposed by Congress. It collects taxes, processes tax returns, audits business and individual taxpayers, enforces U.S. tax laws and, most recently, assists in implementing the Affordable Care Act to make sure individuals seeking government health care subsidies meet the income requirements.\n\nThe IRS -- like most other major government departments -- depends on computerized systems to support its mission and to protect sensitive financial and tax data from hackers. The GAO has criticized other agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management, for breaches of their computerized records by hackers. Just last week, the GAO outlined numerous security vulnerabilities in an Obamacare Internet data \u201chub\u201d that links the Obamacare website to the IRS, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and other agencies.\n\nRelated: IRS May Have Allowed Insurers to Escape Millions in Fees and Penalties\n\nIn response to the latest GAO report, Koskinen asserted that while the \u201cintegrity of IRS\u2019s financial systems continues to be sound,\u201d the agency is in the process of adding many additional safeguards and is reviewing GAO\u2019s latest batch of recommendations.\n\nHowever, as GAO cautioned, \u201cUntil IRS takes additional steps to (1) address unresolved and newly identified control deficiencies and (2) effectively implement elements of its information security program, including, among other things, updating policies\u2026 and testing and evaluating procedures, its financial and taxpayer data will remain unnecessarily vulnerable to inappropriate and undetected use, modification, or disclosure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Back in February 2015, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen disclosed that unauthorized indi", "title": "Criminals Accessed IRS Taxpayer Info 720,000 Times in 2015", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/29/Criminals-Accessed-IRS-Taxpayer-Info-720000-Times-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01172013_IRS_Envelope.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/29/Criminals-Accessed-IRS-Taxpayer-Info-720000-Times-2015", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01172013_IRS_Envelope.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Back in February 2015, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen disclosed that unauthorized indi", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Back in February 2015, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen disclosed that unauthorized individuals or groups had illegally gained access to sensitive taxpayer information such as Social Security numbers, birthdates and street addresses.\nThe IRS -- like most other major government departments -- depends on computerized systems to support its mission and to protect sensitive financial and tax data from hackers.\nRelated: Obamacare Fraud Is Rampant and Unchecked, GAO Warns\u201cHowever, weaknesses in the controls limited their effectiveness in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer data,\u201d the report states.\nTo be sure, the IRS has made some progress in implementing information security controls, the GAO acknowledged.\nA February 2016 \u201cupdate\u201d showed that another 390,000 accounts had been inappropriately accessed, bringing the new grand total to 720,000 \u2013 at least for now."}
