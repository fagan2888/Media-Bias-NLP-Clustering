Ferguson is about two-thirds black. It\u2019s police force is nearly 100 percent white. Less than a third of its residents are white, but whites hold five of Ferguson\u2019s six city council seats.\n\nWhen the black community in a city like Ferguson loses faith in its police force, and the police respond by crushing the community\u2019s civil and constitutional rights, it isn\u2019t a stretch to say that the white ruling class has created de facto apartheid. Probably temporarily, perhaps without segregationist intent. But functionally, that\u2019s what it is. They\u2019ve also denied the people they serve the services to which they\u2019re entitled. Ferguson\u2019s police department commands a third of the city\u2019s budget and they are using those resources to provide aggressive disservice to the people who finance that budget.\n\nFerguson presents an unusually extreme and condensed example of this sort of racial-civic polarization. But you can find expressions of the same basic dynamic\u2014of white public officials using their power to socially weaken black constituents\u2014all across the country.\n\n\u201cOverall,\u201d according to the ACLU, \u201c42 percent of people impacted by a SWAT deployment to execute a search warrant were Black,\u201d and yet black people comprise just over 12 percent of the national population.\n\nThough not explicitly violent, voter suppression efforts in southern (and non-southern, GOP-controlled) states constitute a much broader and more insidious exercise of state power along the same racial axis. The politicians passing those laws are overwhelmingly white, the affected constituencies are heavily black. And the consequence is that black citizens everywhere, like black residents of Ferguson this week, become ill equipped to advance their interests before their political leaders. (Shifting back to an explicitly political frame for a moment, Rand Paul\u2019s intrusions on this score have been less inspiring. Back in May, Paul briefly chastised his party for obsessing over voter IDs law on the pragmatic rather than principled grounds that it is ultimately counterproductive. Within a week, he\u2019d reversed himself.)\n\nThe strong resistance southern state governments have shown to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (essentially free) Medicaid expansion (which the Supreme Court made purely optional in 2012) reflects a similar act of discretion by lily-white elites at the expense of disproportionately black constituents.\n\nProliferating open-carry and Stand Your Ground laws are also nominally colorblind phenomena, but ones that effectively heighten racial disparities in homicide convictions and promote a cultural undercurrent of white vigilantism. The same forces operating in reverse allow a group of well-armed, white anti-government reactionaries in Nevada to ward off federal law officers seeking to enforce grazing laws, and generate a tremendous amount of solidarity.\n\nWhat happened in Ferguson is a national disgrace. But it was also abrupt and characterized by astounding incompetence. Those ingredients will allow order to be restored and hopefully create the scrutiny required for a thorough reckoning, from the killing of Michael Brown through the changing of the guard Thursday afternoon. But that scrutiny is unlikely to extend past the city limits of Ferguson. And that is a national disgrace as well.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "In the St. Louis suburb, the white ruling class has created de facto apartheid", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "In the St. Louis suburb, the white ruling class has created de facto apartheid.", "title": "Ferguson Is a Microcosm of Our Racially\u2014and Politically\u2014Polarized Country", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/0d7fc9123f4041599076cf23b755a1ff5f47f401.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119099/ferguson-underscores-larger-white-black-power-disparity", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the St. Louis suburb, the white ruling class has created de facto apartheid.", "title": "Ferguson Is a Microcosm of Our Racially\u2014and Politically\u2014Polarized Country", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/0d7fc9123f4041599076cf23b755a1ff5f47f401.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/0d7fc9123f4041599076cf23b755a1ff5f47f401.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ferguson Is a Microcosm of Our Racially\u2014and Politically\u2014Polarized Country\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119099/ferguson-underscores-larger-white-black-power-disparity\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-15T11:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119099,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Ferguson\",\"Stand Your Ground\",\"Open Carry\",\"Medicaid\",\"voter suppression\",\"voter id\",\"Rand Paul\",\"Barack Obama\",\"Jay Nixon\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-08-15"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8fad\"", "article_summary": "And the consequence is that black citizens everywhere, like black residents of Ferguson this week, become ill equipped to advance their interests before their political leaders.\nBut that scrutiny is unlikely to extend past the city limits of Ferguson.\nLess than a third of its residents are white, but whites hold five of Ferguson\u2019s six city council seats.\nBut you can find expressions of the same basic dynamic\u2014of white public officials using their power to socially weaken black constituents\u2014all across the country.\nFerguson is about two-thirds black."}
