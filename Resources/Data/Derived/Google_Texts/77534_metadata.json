Such a change is favored by the GOP and had been included in Mr. Obama\u2019s budget plan last year. Instead, Mr. Obama\u2019s budget, which will be released in full early next month, will propose $56 billion in new government spending on programs such as education, manufacturing and job training, which would be offset by spending cuts and tax increases on high-income earners.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday the decision to leave out the cost-of-living adjustment to Social Security benefits reflected a change in approach on the part of congressional Republicans.\n\n\u201cThere was a point in time when there was a little bit more optimism about the willingness of Republicans to budge on closing some tax loopholes,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cBut over the course of the last year, they\u2019ve refused to do that.\u201d\n\nStill, Earnest refused to shut the door completely on reaching an agreement with GOP lawmakers, saying the move \u201cdoes not reflect any reduction in the president\u2019s willingness to try to meet Republicans in the middle and find a balanced way to reduce our deficit.\u201d\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill had a different take on the administration\u2019s choice.\n\n\u201cThis reaffirms what has become all too apparent: the president has no interest in doing anything, even modest, to address our looming debt crisis,\u201d said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. \u201cThe one and only idea the president has to offer is even more job-destroying tax hikes, and that non-starter won\u2019t do anything to save the entitlement programs that are critical to so many Americans. With three years left in office, it seems the president is already throwing in the towel.\u201d\n\nDemocrats who opposed the president\u2019s decision last year to offer adjustments to Social Security payments praised the turnabout.\n\n\u201cBudget conversations should focus on how we can work to help struggling seniors in this country, not on how to shift the burden to working people and retirees,\u201d Reps. Raul Grijalva and Keith Ellison, the co-chairs of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in a statement.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the president\u2019s budget \u201cwill be a powerful statement of Democratic principles.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn particular, I commend President Obama for his commitment to keeping Social Security strong, and for rejecting Republican calls to cut badly-needed cost of living increases,\u201d he added.\n\nGiven the partisan climate in Washington these days and the looming midterm campaign, the odds on any significant legislative action on the deficit were long to begin with. Thursday\u2019s move by the administration simply recognized that reality.\n\nWALKER EMAILS\n\nIt would appear that Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has survived the initial wave of reports tied to the release of some 27,000 emails to and from a former aide who pleaded guilty in 2012 to working on the Republican\u2019s 2010 campaign while at her government job. The documents were unsealed as part of the former aide\u2019s appeal.\n\nThe Washington Post notes that Democrats were eager to get their hands on the documents in hopes they revealed Walker knew about the activities being done on county time.\n\nThe investigation, which concluded last year, did not result in charges for Walker, and these fresh emails don\u2019t provide any further indication Walker knew about the email system. But the 2016 GOP presidential hopeful does face another probe into whether or not his 2012 recall campaign coordinated with outside groups.\n\nOne of the emailed conversations the Wisconsin Court of Appeals released showed that Walker had ordered a doctor who worked for the county fired because she had previously modeled thongs. Other correspondence revealed racially-charged statements from his two top aides at the county executive\u2019s office. The Fix highlights the six new things the emails reveal about Walker\u2019s time as county executive.\n\nThe Journal Sentinel editorial board has called on Walker to hold a news conference to explain how much he knew about the email system and take unlimited questions.\n\nDemocrats have seized on the scandal\u2019s flare up in hopes of tying Walker\u2019s troubles to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s lane closure scandal, helping them paint a pattern of Republican abuse of government. Just as the emails were released Wednesday, the liberal super PAC American Bridge 21st Century launched the website JohnDoeWalker.com. The site is intended to expose information about the governor unearthed by two dozen staffers in Washington dedicated to reviewing the 27,000 pages of emails.\n\nLINE ITEMS\n\nNEWSHOUR ROUNDUP\n\nA report issued Tuesday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office detailing the effects of raising the minimum wage sparked a heated political debate.
