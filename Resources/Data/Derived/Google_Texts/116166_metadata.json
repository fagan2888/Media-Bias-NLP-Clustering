Beyonc\u00e9 spent the year on a lengthy tour with anticipation mounting for an album she had never acknowledged she was working on, trying out different songs in commercials before \u2014 surprise! \u2014 dropping a self-titled album onto iTunes in the middle of the night. It had seemed that a burst of promotion she\u2019d done at the very beginning of the year had been wasted effort; instead, it became clear her new record didn\u2019t need the promotion in the first place. She\u2019s since released two songs off the record as singles, but the album was designed to be bought all in one piece \u2014 all without a single track getting previewed on a live performance or on the radio.\n\nKaty Perry, by contrast, went through the paces in the run-up to the release of her album \u201cPrism\u201d; covers of Vogue and Entertainment Weekly, talk-show appearances, a performance at the end of August\u2019s Video Music Awards, set up in opposition to putative rival Lady Gaga\u2019s number at the show\u2019s start. And though \u201cPrism\u201d debuted at number one on the charts and lead single \u201cRoar\u201d was huge, the follow-up \u201cUnconditionally\u201d wasn\u2019t nearly as strong a chart performer as any of Perry\u2019s nine singles since 2010, peaking at 14 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her label had invested significant resources into \u201cPrism,\u201d and Perry seemed at least temporarily against the ropes.\n\nParticularly among female pop stars, the perception of rivalry has become the coin of the realm. \u201cRoar\u201d and Lady Gaga\u2019s \u201cApplause\u201d were put into a perceived \u201cchart battle\u201d that Perry won, but it was a pyrrhic victory; with her widely-remarked-upon performance, Miley Cyrus consumed all the oxygen at the Video Music Awards and had a number-one single by early fall. (The awards ceremony, designed as it was to be bookended by established stars on lengthy promo cycles, thus provided one of the year\u2019s many surprises.) A New York magazine cover on Taylor Swift pointedly noted in its headline that she was a bigger pop star than Perry, Cyrus or Gaga. Around that time, the writing was on the wall about Gaga\u2019s luxuriantly promoted album \u201cArtpop\u201d \u2014 its lengthy roll-out, complete with Jeff Koons album cover and two-day release party, came to seem utterly vexed, with misinformation about the cost of the album\u2019s promotion seeming credible enough to end up reprinted in major news outlets. Young star Lorde found herself the subject of controversy, time and again, for seemingly insulting remarks about Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, inadvertently playing into a public appetite for female artists fighting over slices of a smaller and smaller pie. At the end of the year, pop culture provocateur Perez Hilton posted a GIF of Beyonc\u00e9 pushing albums by Lorde, Perry, Cyrus, Gaga and Britney Spears off a table. It really was, in ways Hilton couldn\u2019t have known, the GIF of the year.\n\nThe problem was that not every fixed idea at the end of 2013 was accurate. \u201cArtpop,\u201d relative to its performance, seemed vastly more like a \u201cflop\u201d than it had been. That perception came thanks to a series of unlucky turns (the fate of single \u201cDo What U Want,\u201d whose R. Kelly feature seemed in poor taste once allegations of his sexual impropriety resurfaced, among them) and a general market correction from Gaga\u2019s onetime most-famous-singer-on-earth status. \u201cThe idea that it\u2019s hard to sustain that frenzied level of engaged popularity that Lady Gaga had when she was on top of the world with \u2018Just Dance,\u2019 \u2018Poker Face,\u2019 and \u2018Bad Romance\u2019 \u2014 that can\u2019t necessarily last at that level forever. Every artist has ebbs and flows and I think that it\u2019s hard to sustain that momentum,\u201d said Keith Caulfield, the associate director of charts at Billboard. \u201cThese comparisons that people try to make from one album to another \u2014 it\u2019s just not that easy sometimes.\u201d\n\nSimilar comparisons between Perry singles, Caulfield said, were equally ineffective: \u201cUnconditionally\u201d \u201ccertainly was not not a hit, it was still a top 20 record! It performed quite respectably.\u201d\n\nSo why are pop fans so eager for a narrative whereby an artist either unequivocally succeeds or utterly fails? It was easy, in media-saturated 2013, to view an artist\u2019s traditional promotional cycle as exhausting. Longtime pop-world observer Maura Johnston, Journalism Fellow at Boston College\u2019s Institute for the Liberal Arts and editor of Maura Magazine, noted the particular case of \u201cArtpop\u201d\u2018s drawn-out release cycle: \u201cThe genesis of it was so long \u2014 the period after [prior album] \u2018Born This Way\u201ds release was two years, which five years ago would not have been too long. But in the era of hyper-compressed promotional cycles, it seemed like a lot for not a lot of payoff. It got to the point of \u2018Release this damn record already!'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beyonc\u00e9 is the only pop star who's broken free of the old model -- can the Katy Perrys of the world figure it out?
