Miller was arrested later the same day.\n\nThat occurred a day after Miller was released from New Jersey State Prison in Trenton, where he was paroled from a 15-year prison term imposed for robbing the same clerk at the Toms River Stride Rite store on Hooper Avenue, as well as committing two other armed robberies over three straight days, authorities said.\n\nSuperior Court Judge James M. Blaney imposed the latest prison term on Miller on Friday and ordered that he serve 85 percent of the term before he can be considered for release on parole, authorities said. Laura Pierro, chief trial attorney for the Ocean County Prosecutor\u2019s Office, argued for the maximum term of 20 years.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1McqlRN", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Man who returned to same store for robbery the day after he was paroled gets 16-year term", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Man who returned to same store for robbery the day after he was paroled gets 16-year term", "title": "16 years in prison for 2nd robbery at same shoe store", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2015/06/05/years-prison-nd-robbery-shoe-store/28570451/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Man who returned to same store for robbery the day after he was paroled gets 16-year term", "title": "16 years in prison for 2nd robbery at same shoe store", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1018987167a29ed85043434549545ae2e2f6f4e/c=0-89-534-623&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/05/AsburyPark/B9317628974Z.1_20150605191206_000_G3HB0FS85.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d87\"", "article_summary": "In fact, in both holdups, Miller robbed the same store clerk, authorities said.\nChristopher Miller was sentenced to 16 years in prison Friday for returning to the Stride Rite shoe store in Toms River last year to rob it the day after he was paroled from a prison sentence for committing a holdup at the same store 15 years earlier, authorities said.\nSuperior Court Judge James M.
