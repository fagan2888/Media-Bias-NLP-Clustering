Selectively edited videos filmed by an anti-abortion activist have given partisans another excuse to attack women's reproductive services, starting with those provided by a well-established non-profit dedicated to women's health care.\n\nNever mind that abortions represent a tiny percentage of Planned Parenthood's work. Some Republicans have gone so far as to threaten to shut down the government unless all federal funding for Planned Parenthood is eliminated.\n\nBy law, none of that money supports abortion services.\n\nEven as prominent Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell try to tamp down that impulse, others -- firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, among them -- continue to insist that the entire government should be brought to its knees when Congress returns to work after Labor Day.\n\nThis is really just another opportunity to try to limit women's reproductive choices, another chance to grandstand and exaggerate.\n\nIf this outrage reflected genuine concern about lives ended while still in the womb, wouldn't more conservatives be worried about what happens to poor babies once they are born?\n\nRead More: Wait - Donald Trump is defending Planned Parenthood? (op-Ed)\n\nFor decades now, I've listened to anti-abortion activists rail against a \"culture of death,\" a callous disregard for the unborn, the \"murder\" of babies still in the womb.\n\nI've witnessed protests outside abortion clinics, listened to \"pro-life\" state legislators mischaracterize rape, and covered misleading campaigns that suggest abortions lead to breast cancer and mental illness.\n\nI've watched as hostility toward Roe v. Wade has become a litmus test inside the Republican Party.\n\nBut here's the disconnect: Over those years, I've also seen anti-abortion crusaders become increasingly hostile to programs and policies that would aid poor kids once they've come into the world.\n\nConservative lawmakers have disparaged welfare, criticized federal housing subsidies and even campaigned against food assistance. How does that affect those children for whom they claim so much concern?\n\nIn Alabama, where anti-abortion sentiment is as commonplace as summer heat waves, the state legislature is contemplating cutting millions from Medicaid, the program that provides health care for the poorest citizens, including children.\n\nRead More: Defunding Planned Parenthood isn't the same as banning abortion (op-Ed)\n\nMeanwhile, the state's two U.S. senators, Republicans Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby, are among those demanding that Planned Parenthood receive no more federal funds because of the controversy over the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nTo be fair, there are those among abortion critics who show a principled concern for poor children, whose opposition to abortion is paired with a passion for social justice.\n\nTake Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is among the rare GOP governors to support the Medicaid expansion offered by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Now, when you die and get to the meeting with Saint Peter, he's probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor.You better have a good answer,\" he said in June.\n\nThen there are the Catholic Health Association and the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, led by nuns. They've also adopted assistance to the poor as a core mission.\n\nTheir compassion stands in contrast to the U.S. Conference of Bishops, which is largely known for its conservative stances on abortion and same-sex marriage. (That may change with Pope Francis, who has made social justice his hallmark.)\n\nLast year, I attended a Catholic high school commencement where the headmaster, a priest, bragged about the number of his students who had attended anti-abortion protests.\n\nHe said nothing about protests over cuts in assistance to the poor. It's easy enough to inflame with the Planned Parenthood videos; without context (again, selective editing), leaders of the organization are heard discussing money for the donation of fetal tissue.\n\nThat's not a conversation that's easy to hear. But Planned Parenthood is doing nothing illegal, and fetal tissue research has been vital to improving the quality of life for an aging America.\n\nMany of those who are angered by the videos would be surprised to know that they may have benefited from fetal tissue research. Still, I'd take their criticism more seriously if they'd spend as much time trying to help poor children once they are born.\n\nSince they don't, they're just engaging in a war on women -- especially women who don't have any money.\n\nCynthia Tucker is a syndicated columnist.
