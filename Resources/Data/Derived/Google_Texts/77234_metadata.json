The new mom could be seen dancing the \u201cTootsie Roll\u201d even while explaining that her water was beginning to break.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be laughing because I\u2019m the husband,\u201d Nishitzawa\u2019s husband Connell Cloyd can be heard saying while filming the video, \u201cbut she wanted to be famous and I guess this is how you do it.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, labor pains are a part of human childbirth. According to the \u201cobstetric dilemma \u201d (OD) hypothesis, the pains are caused by an evolutionary design compromise stemming from the tug-of-war between a woman\u2019s hips and the large skull-size needed to enclose a growing brain.\n\nWhile Nishitzawa\u2019s technique may be unorthodox, there may be some science behind it. According to the American Pregnancy Association, listening to music can be an effective way to help you relax and work through your contractions. Light dancing, as well as walking, can help to draw your baby\u2019s head toward your pelvis, and the pressure of the baby on your pelvis can help to induce labor.\n\nEarlier this year, Bonnie Northsea of Florida found brief Internet stardom when she posted a video of herself dancing to Michael Jackson\u2019s \"Thriller\" in an effort to induce her labor.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dance, dance, pregnant, woman, does, tootsie, roll, attempt, alleviate, labor, pains", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A pregnant woman from Boston did The Tootsie Roll this week to help relieve some of her labor pains.", "title": "Let Me See That Tootsie Roll: Woman Dances To Ease Labor Pains [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dance-dance-pregnant-woman-does-tootsie-roll-attempt-alleviate-labor-pains-348838", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/20/dance-dance-pregnant-woman-does-tootsie-roll-attempt-alleviate-labor-pains.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A pregnant woman from Boston did The Tootsie Roll this week to help relieve some of her labor pains.", "title": "Let Me See That Tootsie Roll: Woman Dances To Ease Labor Pains [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/dance-dance-pregnant-woman-does-tootsie-roll-attempt-alleviate-labor-pains-348838", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/08/20/dance-dance-pregnant-woman-does-tootsie-roll-attempt-alleviate-labor-pains.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/20/dance-dance-pregnant-woman-does-tootsie-roll-attempt-alleviate-labor-pains.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-20T17:47:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-20T17:47:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A pregnant woman from Boston did The Tootsie Roll this week to help relieve some of her labor pains."}, "article_summary": "The new mom could be seen dancing the \u201cTootsie Roll\u201d even while explaining that her water was beginning to break.\nLight dancing, as well as walking, can help to draw your baby\u2019s head toward your pelvis, and the pressure of the baby on your pelvis can help to induce labor.\nFor the soon-to-be-mother, Yuki Nishitzawa, not even labor could stop her from busting out her favorite dance moves, USA Today reported.\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be laughing because I\u2019m the husband,\u201d Nishitzawa\u2019s husband Connell Cloyd can be heard saying while filming the video, \u201cbut she wanted to be famous and I guess this is how you do it.\u201dUnfortunately, labor pains are a part of human childbirth.\nThis Tuesday, a pregnant woman at Boston's Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital danced in an attempt to relieve her labor pain, and thankfully her husband managed to capture the whole performance on video and share it with the world."}
