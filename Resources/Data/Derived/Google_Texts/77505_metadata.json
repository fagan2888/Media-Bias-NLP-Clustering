Four years ago, I\u2019d have been there cheering for ObamaCare\u2019s passage. But the real ObamaCare has made my life a nightmare.\n\nI suffer from a difficult chronic illness called lupus, an autoimmune disease with devastating symptoms that strike when you least expect them. At age 40, my life is filled with visits to doctors, specialists and the emergency room. While paying for this care is expensive, I have no other choice.\n\nPrior to ObamaCare, I bought my health insurance through CoverTN, a program run by the state of Tennessee. The coverage was perfectly suited to my unique medical condition. It offered me low premiums, a low deductible and low co-pays for my regular trips to doctors and specialists. This plan was perfect for someone with my unique medical condition and limited financial means.\n\nMy plan was canceled last fall. According to the regulators behind ObamaCare, it was a subpar plan that should no longer be sold to consumers. Another 16,000 Tennesseans on the same plan were similarly dumped. Many, like me, liked their plans and wanted to keep them.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t my insurer\u2019s fault at all. CoverTN actually fought for me to keep my health care. After I received my cancellation notice, the folks at CoverTN requested that the federal government give them a waiver, which would let them grandfather my plan into ObamaCare. Their request was rejected.\n\nThis left me with no health plan and only one choice: Buy a plan through the ObamaCare exchanges.\n\nAfter weighing my options, I settled on a \u201cplatinum\u201d plan. This was the best plan that I could choose. A \u201cbronze,\u201d \u201csilver\u201d or \u201cgold\u201d plan all would leave me paying exorbitant amounts of money on my frequent, and expensive, trips to doctors and specialists.\n\nBut the platinum plan was the lesser of two expensive evils. My new plan costs me $373 a month, even after a small subsidy.\n\nBy comparison, my old plan only cost me $57 a month. And I now pay 25 percent co-insurance on all doctor visits until I reach my out-of-pocket maximum of $1,500. This is much higher than under CoverTN.\n\nAll told, I\u2019m likely going to pay more than $6,000 more each year for my medical care.\n\nI\u2019ve had to take a second job in order to pay for my ObamaCare plan. Given my health problems, the physical and emotional drain that this puts on me is difficult to bear. It\u2019s also made it much more difficult for me to care for my ailing mother, who depends on me for help.\n\nFor me, the impact of ObamaCare is a health plan that is both unaffordable and uncaring. For a law named \u201cThe Affordable Care Act,\u201d this is both backward and perverse.\n\nIt\u2019s also not what you promised me when I voted for you, Mr. President. When you were on the campaign trail, you promised that ObamaCare would help me with my medical problems. You promised that people like me with pre-existing conditions would be better off. And you promised that if I liked my health-care plan, I could keep it.\n\nMr. President, you\u2019ve now broken all of these promises \u2014 and not just to me.\n\nEmilie Lamb lives in Tennessee.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "ObamaCare was supposed to help me.\nThat\u2019s all I could think as I sat in the House of Representatives last Tuesday night as the guest of my congresswoman, only a few hundred feet away from President", "creator": "@nypost", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/obama15.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "title": "Betrayed by the President and ObamaCare", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-2806010\"}", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,obamacare,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-03 05:08:06", "sailthru.title": "Betrayed by the President and\u00a0ObamaCare", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/obama15.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "ObamaCare was supposed to help me.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s all I could think as I sat in the House of Representatives last Tuesday night as the guest of my congresswoman, only a few hundred feet away from President Obama as he gave his State of the Union address.
