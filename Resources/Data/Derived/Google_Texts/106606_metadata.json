The exchanges don\u2019t officially take effect until early 2014, but in the meantime signing up for one is somewhere between difficult and impossible.\n\nBut how bad is the Healthcare.gov rollout, in historical terms? According to a Georgetown journalism professor, the persistent computer glitches are almost, basically, equivalent to the devastation of New Orleans and other parts of the Southern United States in 2005, including more than 1,800 deaths, many of which could have been prevented:\n\nCommentary editor John Podhoretz agrees!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople have been looking for \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d for quite a while now: Both major parties trotted it out after the BP oil spill, and Republicans did the same before, during, and after Hurricane Sandy.\n\nIn Beckwith\u2019s calculation, though, Hurricane Katrina doesn\u2019t represent actual devastation and suffering so much as it represents something people are criticizing the president for. Either way, what would \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d really mean? The third-worst disaster of his presidency? The fifth-worst? Where does Hurricane Katrina even rank as George W. Bush\u2019s Katrina?\n\nSponsored\n\nBut first, let's settle the analogy at hand. If we limit our political imagination to the Bush administration\u2019s serial incompetence and/or corruption, then which particular fuck-up would Healthcare.gov\u2019s bugginess best be compared to?\n\nCast your vote below. Then, after submitting your ballot, try ranking Bush\u2019s disasters in the comments. How does 9/11 compare to the collapse of the entire economy?\n\n[Photo credit: Healthcare.gov]", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "poll, obamacare, hurricane katrina, bush, disasters, Gawker", "author": "J.K.
