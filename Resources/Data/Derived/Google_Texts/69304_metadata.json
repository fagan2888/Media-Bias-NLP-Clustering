The deepest thrust of the task force's efforts addresses the growing expenses in active-duty health care for rank-and-file members of the police and fire departments.\n\nThe task force, which concluded its work Monday, was charged with studying the health care and retirement benefits of San Antonio's rank-and-file uniform personnel and their families.\n\nLast August, City Manager Sheryl Sculley proclaimed that the overall public safety budget would consume the entire general fund, which currently is about $1 billion, by 2031 if left unchecked.\n\nLess than a week later, Mayor Juli\u00e1n Castro announced he would create a task force to study the issue and make recommendations to the council. The task force is made up of members representing active-duty and retired police and fire personnel, the business community, the civilian workforce and others. Sculley was one of the 13 members appointed to the panel.\n\nCastro tapped former Councilman Reed Williams to lead the group.\n\nOn Monday, after eight meetings since late October, Williams declared the task force's work a success.\n\n\u201cWe confirmed that we've got a problem: The public safety expenses are growing faster than the general fund revenue,\u201d he said after the task force's final meeting. \u201cIt's important because a lot of people didn't believe that.\u201d\n\nBut don't count fire union President Chris Steele as one of the converted.\n\nSteele said he doesn't believe that the so-called \u201clegacy costs\u201d \u2014 active-duty health care benefits, pension contributions by the city, prefunded retiree health care and other benefits \u2014 are forcing public safety expenditures to outpace general-fund revenue growth.\n\nSteele places the blame on the city manager and the council for misplaced priorities.\n\n\u201cWe don't want a $6 million fire station,\u201d he said. Steele also complained about city expenditures on its computer-assisted dispatch system and radios.\n\nWilliams said the task force's direction was to focus on legacy costs \u2014 not the entire public safety budget.\n\n\u201cWe weren't put in here to study that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe studied benefits costs.\u201d\n\nWilliams said when the task force first convened the public perception was that legacy costs were \u201cout of control\u201d and would eventually consume San Antonio like they did in Detroit.\n\n\u201cThat's not the case. It's controllable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it's going to take hard negotiations.\u201d\n\nThose negotiations will happen this year. The police and fire collective bargaining agreements, known as \u201cCBAs,\u201d are set to expire in September. As the two sides meet at the negotiation table, one priority will be to discuss active-duty health care.\n\nThe task force acknowledged in one of its sweeping general statements for the City Council that health care benefits for uniform personnel and their families are \u201cricher by a large margin\u201d than their civilian counterparts, private employers in San Antonio and peer cities in Texas, including Houston, Dallas, Austin and El Paso.\n\nTheir contribution levels, too, are \u201cricher by a large margin\u201d than those comparison groups. The task force will recommend to the council that it review adjusting the level of health care benefits and contributions to more closely align with everyone else's.\n\nAdjustments to the active-duty health care plan could only be made through collective bargaining.\n\nThe task force also recommended that council have its intergovernmental relations subcommittee study prefunded retiree health care, which serves as a bridge insurance plan between when public safety officials retire and when they turn 65 and receive Medicare. Once retirees join Medicare, their city-funded retiree health care becomes supplemental.\n\nWilliams suggested that going forward, it might make sense to purchase insurance for retirees under the Affordable Care Act rather than keeping them in a small pool of insured local retirees.\n\nThe task force will also recommend to council that while the Police and Fire Pension fund is \u201cwell-managed\u201d and growing only slightly faster than general fund revenues, it should \u201ccontinue to study active compensation and retiree benefits\u201d \u2014 wages and pension contributions.\n\nChanges to wages would be made under collective bargaining while altering pension contribution requires action by the Texas Legislature.\n\nAs if to illustrate the breadth and importance of health care issues, the task force is forwarding to council several general recommendations within the umbrella of health care, including:\n\nImplementing a vigorous wellness strategy;\n\nNegotiating a uniform health care plan design and premiums as part of CBAs;\n\nPrioritizing the control of health care costs during CBA negotiations;\n\nExecuting regular employees' dependents audits.\n\nIf the council doesn't rein in public safety expenditures, the only other option is to increase revenues, Williams said. That translates to increasing the property tax rate, he said, and that's an option no one wants to consider.\n\njbaugh@express-news.net", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Among the group's recommendations is that the City Council establish policies that ensure the overall police and fire budgets are managed in a way that their expenses don't crowd out other portions of the city's general fund \u2014 such as libraries and parks.
