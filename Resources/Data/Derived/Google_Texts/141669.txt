After reading the AP story “Silicon Valley struggles to speak FDA’s language” yesterday, this graphic resurfaced on my Twitter feed and served as a reminder of one of the reasons why disruption in this sector can be challenging, especially for outsiders trying to break into healthcare.

Let’s get this out of the way first: This chart was created by two Republican legislators, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas and former Sen. San Brownback of Kansas, during a 2010 campaign to repeal Obamacare. As some Twitter users have pointed out, it’s politically motivated and all of the boxes representing government agencies, regulations and mandates aren’t drawn to scale.

But it certainly drives home the point about why change often happens so slowly in healthcare – and this chart doesn’t even account for individual state regulations, agencies and programs.
