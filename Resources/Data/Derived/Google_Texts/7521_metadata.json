We just told each other to look for (bootlegs).\u201d\n\nCoach Doug Marrone was more relieved by how the Bills (7-5) overcame a sloppy first half.\n\nBuffalo took control by scoring touchdowns 10 seconds apart midway through the third quarter. Veteran QB Kyle Orton bounced back from two interceptions by throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan. Hughes returned Terrance West\u2019s fumble for a touchdown on the Browns\u2019 next play from scrimmage.\n\n\u201cI concentrate on my own team,\u201d Marrone said when asked about Manziel, a rookie. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of film on him, so you\u2019ve got to see how he plays.\u201d\n\nManziel did provide an initial spark in enjoying his most significant playing time of the season, and in his first appearance since a 23-21 loss to Baltimore in Week 3. The first-round draft pick capped an eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown run that cut the Bills\u2019 lead to 20-10.\n\nThe Bills then put the clamps on Manziel during Cleveland\u2019s next possession.\n\nWilliams got in Manziel\u2019s face and forced what was initially ruled a fumble before a replay review ruled it an incomplete pass.\n\nThe Browns (7-5) then gave up the ball on downs on the next play.\n\nBroncos\u2019 next opponent: Bills at Broncos, 2:05 p.m. Sunday, KCNC-4", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Buffalo Bills stop Johnny Manziel\u2019s spark in win over Cleveland Browns", "title": "Buffalo Bills stop Johnny Manziel\u2019s spark in win over Cleveland Browns", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/30/buffalo-bills-stop-johnny-manziels-spark-in-win-over-cleveland-browns/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141130__20141201_B7_SP01FBNNEXTp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141130__20141201_B7_SP01FBNNEXTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-30T21:46:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:27:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc29c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt didn\u2019t change too much,\u201d Searcy said of the Bills\u2019 approach after Manziel took over with 12:01 left.\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. \u2014 Once safety Da\u2019Norris Searcy and the Buffalo defense chased Cleveland Browns quarterback Brian Hoyer, the Bills weren\u2019t going to let Johnny Manziel change the outcome.\nWilliams got in Manziel\u2019s face and forced what was initially ruled a fumble before a replay review ruled it an incomplete pass.\nThe first-round draft pick capped an eight-play, 80-yard drive with a 10-yard touchdown run that cut the Bills\u2019 lead to 20-10.\nHughes returned Terrance West\u2019s fumble for a touchdown on the Browns\u2019 next play from scrimmage."}
