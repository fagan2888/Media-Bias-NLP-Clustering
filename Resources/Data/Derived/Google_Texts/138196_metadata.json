He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners, 2 To proclaim the year of the Lord\u2019s favor and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all who mourn, 3 And provide for those who grieve in Zion-to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor.\u201d \u2014 Isaiah 61:1-3 (NIV)\n\n\u201cNew Testament: 16 This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? 18 Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. \u2014 I John 3:16-18 (NIV)\n\n\u201cIn some cases, we can best accomplish that objective by executing clearly defined, focused collaborative efforts amongst denominations and other faith based groups. We believe in those cases we can accomplish more together than we can separately.\n\n\u201cThe issue of providing all Americans with access to quality health care is one of those issues. We believe that access to quality health care is a fundamental civil and human right in America. Historically, over seven million African Americans have been uninsured and denied access to care with devastating consequences. The Affordable Care Act provides African Americans, along with Americans of all nationalities, access to desperately needed quality health care.\n\n\u201cWe affirm our support for the Affordable Care Act. We understand that over time aspects of the Act will be revised as government learns more and to-be-expected administrative glitches will be appropriately addressed, but it is essential that we work aggressively with what we have right now. We cannot afford to put this off any longer. Any further delay will have catastrophic effects on the nation\u2019s uninsured.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, we have pledged to work together to:\n\nFacilitate the critical enrollment numbers necessary to ensure the success of the Affordable Care Act, and,\n\nSeek other opportunities to work towards improving the health status of our constituencies, e.g. , \u201cHealth and Wellness Sundays,\u201d which will include thematic preaching on specified Sundays along with other related activities.\n\n\u201cIn support of this truly interfaith effort, we affix our names:\n\nThe Reverend Dr. Otis Moss, Jr.\n\nChair, Faith Partnerships, Inc.\n\nThe Reverend Dr. Barbara Williams-Skinner\n\nCo-Chair, National African American Clergy Network\n\nThe Reverend Dr. T.
