A marketing ploy from the group Organizing for Action is taking a popular conservative symbol and using it to encourage Americans to sign up for the Affordable Care Act.

Organizing for Action, the nonprofit spurned from President Obama’s reelection campaign, unveiled new bumper stickers Friday that put a liberal spin on the Gadsden flag.

The design removes the snake featured on the flag and replaces it with a coiled stethoscope. OFA’s revamped design also replaces the words “Don’t Tread on Me,” which have become a staple of the Tea Party, with “Don’t Tread on My Obamacare.”

In an email blast to supporters, OFA Executive Director Jon Carson encouraged backers to support the Affordable Care Act by displaying the sticker.

“This is for everyone who’s tired of hearing the other side talk smack about health care reform that is helping millions of Americans get affordable, quality care,” Carson said in a statement. “They’ve spent hundreds of millions to tear it down. We’ve worked hard to make sure they didn’t succeed.”

The Gadsden flag has been removed from several government buildings, including the New Rochelle Armory in New Rochelle, N.Y., and the New Haven, Conn., fire department’s flag pole for what were deemed to be negative connotations.
