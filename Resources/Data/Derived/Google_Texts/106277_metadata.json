The clients of vendors Epic Systems and athenahealth had a lot of success in moving along to stage 2; more than 99 percent did so, with very few availing themselves of CMS\u2019s flexibility rules.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThose vendors formed the upper stratum; most other vendors\u2019 clients settled in the 5 to 15% range of flexibility usage.\n\nThen there were companies whose clients used the flexibility rule frequently: GE Healthcare, NextGen, and Greenway.

Next Thursday will see yet another HELP conclave, this time with administration officials on the hot seat. That won\u2019t be the end of legislative activity, in case you were wondering.\n\nWe\u2019ve been told the Government Accountability Office has delivered a report on health information exchange to HELP that was requested by committee chair Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and the senators who penned the \u201creboot\u201d report two years ago. (HELP hasn\u2019t confirmed this to us.)\n\nThere\u2019s also a Wednesday markup of a mental health reform bill; one provision requests a GAO report on 42 CFR Part 2, the legal language that restricts sharing information on patient substance abuse.\n\neHealth tweet of the day: Steven Posnack @HealthIT_Policy Ah! But is there a #ICD10 code for selfie accident? If not, we should bag the whole thing for ICD11 http://bit.ly/1FvNYX7\n\nENTOMBMENT THURSDAY: Day 1 of the Franciscan Invasion featured mild temperatures, smiling children hollering in the park, and a moderately longer line than the typical weekday at his local deli. Your correspondent, as a member of the media, knows that its outlets would never hype, exaggerate, misunderstand, or poorly predict the implications of a major event. Therefore he assumes yesterday was a mere opening skirmish and is redoubling his fortification efforts. Send him mortar, supplies, or \u2026 perhaps even news tips at dtahir@politico.com.

But Clinton has also embraced health care innovation.\n\nThe candidate is committed to \u201cexpanding access to high-quality data on cost, care quality, and health delivery system performance to help patients and doctors make informed choices and entrepreneurs build new products and services, making our health care markets more price and quality transparent as well as efficient,\u201d the plan states.\n\nIt also praises the \u201cinnovative entrepreneurs\u201d who are creating technology helping patients \u201cmonitor their heart rhythms and count their calories, matching patients with doctors, making prices more transparent and easier to understand for consumers, and even offering new ways of providing health insurance coverage that are accessible and affordable.\u201d\n\nThe rhetoric here is pretty similar to what one hears these days in the Humphrey building (HHS' HQ), which may mean the digital health status quo would be maintained in a Clinton administration.\n\nAPPLE BACKS DOWN ON HINDER: Hinder \u2013 the app aiming to educate users on politicians\u2019 views of abortion, sexual education, and birth control \u2013 will be coming to the App Store after all. UltraViolet, the women\u2019s rights group campaigning against Apple's removal of the app, declared victory today after the tech company backed down. For details see yesterday's Morning eHealth...\n\nFINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THE OPM HEIST: The hackers who entered OPM\u2019s system burgled reams of sensitive biometric data \u2013 far greater than previous estimates, in fact. Nearly 5.6 million current and former federal employees have had their fingerprint data taken, the agency revealed; the previous estimate was 1.1 million. The agency is convening a working group to .... close the barn door.\n\nFDA SEARCHING FOR DIGITAL HEALTH SCIENTISTS: As tweeted by head digital honcho Bakul Patel (appropriate medium!), the FDA is searching for some digital health scientists.\n\nThe job descriptions seek employees who will spend time \u201cresearching emerging digital health technologies,\u201d \u201cdrafting technical papers and presentations for delivery to a variety of audiences,\u201d and \u201cnegotiating with regulated industry to accept requirements which involve substantial changes in established methods, policies, or programs,\u201d among other things. Get your resumes in.\n\nEHRA \u2013 WE SUPPORT DIAGNOSTIC IMPROVEMENT: EHR vendors come in for their share of criticism in this week\u2019s Institute of Medicine report on diagnostic errors. Their professional organization points out that they are working hard with the rest of the IT community on interoperability, and that the 2013 EHR Developer Code of Conduct commits those who sign it to alerting customers of product safety issues. \u201cIn terms of the proposal for independent evaluation and notification of adverse effects on the diagnostic process ... most EHRs do not provide native diagnostic decision support, but instead integrate various third party tools and resources to provide these capabilities to clinicians,\u201d says the group\u2019s vice chair, NextGen Chief Medical Officer Sarah Corley. And while EHR companies encourage customers to share best practices with one another, \u201cwe note that any public commentary must respect the boundaries of intellectual property, and is something addressed by each individual company in their partnership with researchers.\u201d\n\nSTUDY ASKS PATIENT PREFERENCE FOR POST-OP FOLLOW-UPS: A majority of veterans preferred a telephone or video-based follow-up visit after their surgery, a JAMA Surgery letter reported Wednesday. Researchers at Vanderbilt University followed 35 veterans who received in-person, telephone and video follow-ups and asked them about their preference. Thirty percent preferred video and 39 percent preferred telephone. Those who preferred telehealth visits traveled almost twice as much compared to than those who preferred in-person visits, an average of 162 miles versus 75 miles, the researcher reported. \u201cImportantly, there were no instances in which we failed to detect a wound or postoperative complication by telephone or video,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nHANDLING COMPLEX NEEDS PATIENTS: An issue brief from the National Governor\u2019s Association provides states tips on how to use data analytics to handle the high-spenders and super-utilizers, a persistent budgetary bugaboo. Among the recommendations: use data to understand their needs, determine who are most likely to benefit from intervention and monitor their progress to shift tactics. Sounds simple enough. The brief: http://bit.ly/1NTAQhi\n\nMARK YOUR CALENDARS: The Bipartisan Policy Center and Council of Accountable Physician Practices will hold an event Nov. 4 on how technology is changing the patient-physician relationship. http://bit.ly/1NMLEwb\n\nMORE BAD STATE PAYMENTS IN MEANINGFUL USE: Oklahoma Medicaid mispaid $888,000 to 47 hospital-based doctors, the HHS\u2019s Inspector General said Wednesday. The HHS watchdog recommended the state refund the federal government $127,500 in incorrect EHR incentive payments. The OIG has previously investigated Texas, Massachusetts and Louisiana.\n\nPEW ON UDI: Pew Charitable Trusts has released a report on one of its favorite ideas \u2014 the unique device identifier\u2019s potential to help healthcare, and how to implement it throughout the healthcare system.\n\nThe idea of a UDI is to give each device a numeric identifier \u2014 in effect naming it \u2014 so it can be tracked throughout the healthcare system. That\u2019s in opposition to the current system, where a given device \u2014 say, an intraocular lens \u2014 will have different numbers in different parts of the system. That complicates efforts to track devices and determine whether there\u2019s a problem, and to recall devices when there is.\n\nThe key, Pew says, is to the get the identifiers into the patient\u2019s EHR. That makes them more likely to flow to other hospitals, registries, and other stakeholders. Pew would also like to see UDIs included in a \u201cBlue Button+\u201d and summary-of-care documents like the C-CDA.\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE CLICKING ON:\n\nThe Pitfalls of Health-Care Companies\u2019 Addiction to Big Data -- http://bloom.bg/1KSyZXx\n\nOnline Prediction of Health Care Utilization in the Next Six Months Based on Electronic Health Record Information -- http://bit.ly/1YCSTfi\n\nJodi Daniel lists her 'greatest hits' at ONC -- http://bit.ly/1iy177w\n\nWhy Cleveland Clinic Shares Its Outcomes Data with the World \u2013 http://bit.ly/1Fhc2Nz\n\nTips, comments, suggestions?
