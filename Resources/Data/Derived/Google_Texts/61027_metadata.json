In fact, it\u2019s about to unleash a serious flood of cash in an effort to stop Obama in his tracks.\n\nBut it won\u2019t matter.\n\nIt\u2019s all in the game\n\nThis is Obama\u2019s proverbial middle finger to those who don\u2019t find the data on climate change to be sound. It\u2019s his \u201cHail Mary\u201d before his eight-year reign comes to an end. And there is no overtime in this game.\n\nWe know that Obama talked a good game about climate change when he first ran for office. But, being the master chess player he is, the president strategized this move long before the first pawn was even captured.\n\nDespite the fact that Obamacare was a vicious battle from day one, it pales in comparison to the battle that awaited him in regards to climate change action. And that, dear reader, is why he didn\u2019t even attempt to present this plan until well into his second term, and of course, in alignment with the next presidential election.\n\nYou see, while there are plenty of outspoken folks who don\u2019t find the data on climate change to be sound, when it comes to public opinion, more than 50% of Americans do find the data to be sound. Or at least as much as they can understand. Which is why most polls will present the question: \u201cHow Concerned are you about Climate Change?\u201d\n\nOf course, there are so many polls these days, it\u2019s hard to determine which are objective and which are not. But here\u2019s what I do know \u2026\n\nThe two democrat frontrunners are Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Both have been extremely vocal about supporting plans to slow carbon emissions. And rest assured, both will support any plan Obama has put into action - if not making it even more aggressive.\n\nSo why would both of these candidates focus so heavily on climate change? Because their intelligence gathering has indicated that this is an issue on which they can win, and it\u2019s an issue that concerns enough Americans that it\u2019s worth parading around on the campaign trail.\n\nRepublicans would be wise to take a page from this playbook, because even if Jeb Bush or Rand Paul were to support Obama\u2019s plan, it wouldn\u2019t hurt their chances against Hillary or Bernie.\n\nI don\u2019t know of any individual that has been more loathed by the republicans than Hillary Clinton. She poses a threat, and the GOP knows it. And Bernie? Well, he\u2019s a socialist, and no republican is going to even pretend to support a socialist.\n\nJust like Omar Little from the \u201cThe Wire\u201d said, \u201cIt\u2019s all in the game.\u201d\n\nOf course, I\u2019m not a big fan of these types of games. I don\u2019t think screwing with our freedoms or our economy is a game. It\u2019s serious business and should be dealt with accordingly. But I don\u2019t make the rules, I just profit from them.\n\nGet a piece of the action\n\nI don\u2019t care if you think climate change is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the planet. Actions are being taken - on a global scale - to address CO2 emissions. And while I fault no man for questioning climate change, I think it\u2019s beyond stupid to let an opportunity like this pass you by.\n\nEven if Obama\u2019s plan is met with a fight every step of the way (which it will be), a sea change is underway. Public opinion is a powerful thing, and it will facilitate action.\n\nMore importantly, however, is this \u2026\n\nThe main catalyst for climate change mitigation is a transition of our global energy economy from one heavily weighted in fossil fuels to one heavily weighted in renewables. And there\u2019s the rub.\n\nWhile environmentalists have long spent their years singing the praises of renewable energy, it usually fell on deaf ears because renewable energy was just too cost prohibitive to pursue. But that\u2019s just no the case anymore.\n\nWe know that rapid cost declines in solar and wind have resulted in massive growth for those industries. In many parts of the world, solar and wind are already cost competitive with fossil fuels, and within the next ten years, this will be the case almost everywhere. And by the way, this is without subsidies.\n\nTruth is, I\u2019m not even sure Obama\u2019s climate plan is even necessary, given the fact that solar and wind continue to gain market share. But again, I don\u2019t make the rules, I just profit from them. And with this new plan being presented, solar and wind, which are already enjoying significant momentum, are just going to become even more profitable. So you might as well get a piece of the action.\n\nIf you\u2019re not already profiting from the boom in solar and wind, I suggest you do so immediately.
