In other words, stating the obvious. The reaction was swift and furious \u2013 from the Democrats, that is.\n\nEvery leftist from presumptive presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to Smiling Joe Biden piled on, calling the letter \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cout of step with the best traditions of American leadership\u201d (rimshot!), while claiming it was motivated by a \u201crush to war\u201d by Republican \u201ctraitors.\u201d If anyone is a traitor, it\u2019s the guy negotiating the deal \u2013 John Kerry.\n\nAll that said, it would have been better if the Republican senators had not sent this letter to Iran. In addition to being a poor method of conducting diplomacy, it\u2019s bad politics. It will be spun by the Democrats and their sycophants in the media as just another example of personal animus and racism toward Barack Obama. And it will probably end up being a self-inflicted political wound that could have been avoided. Those who defend it on the basis that Democrats have done it before miss the mark. Since when has imitating Democrats been good practice?\n\nA better approach would have been to address the letter to Obama himself and the American public, and publish it in The Washington Post and other newspapers.\n\nIn doing so, the 47 senators, led by Iraq and Afghanistan veteran Tom Cotton, could have framed the issue in terms of the Senate\u2019s role in treaty-making, and insisted the president respect the Senate in this regard. They could have emphasized the foolishness of accepting a handshake deal with Iran instead of a binding treaty. They could have highlighted Obama\u2019s absurd notion that deals of this magnitude should be done in secret and then presented to the American people and their representatives as a fait accompli \u2013 something that would have resonated strongly given Obama\u2019s past deceptiveness about keeping your health plan under the Affordable Care Act. The senators could have pointed out that Iran could nullify an agreement at any time, just as the United States could.\n\nAll of this could have been used to challenge Obama to make his case to the American people before reaching a deal with Iran \u2013 to explain how a deal would somehow not do fatal damage to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nWhat\u2019s done is done, and the letter may at least have the salient effect of making the current deal with Iran less likely to come to pass. It will also force 2016 presidential hopefuls to stake out their positions on this matter, which will be beneficial over the next 18 months. But this continues a trend in which Republicans are missing the target.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans wrote Iran to warn that a deal wasn't binding long-term.", "csrf-token": "941HHNmN1q20pFDsdqTjxQWudBPk9Wxg+YDpfmTEuDs=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Republicans wrote Iran to warn that a deal wasn\u2019t binding long-term.", "title": "Iran Letter Went to the Wrong Recipient", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/33788", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-03-11-76f6ae88.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1d5\"", "article_summary": "All that said, it would have been better if the Republican senators had not sent this letter to Iran.\nThey could have emphasized the foolishness of accepting a handshake deal with Iran instead of a binding treaty.\nA better approach would have been to address the letter to Obama himself and the American public, and publish it in The Washington Post and other newspapers.\nWhat\u2019s done is done, and the letter may at least have the salient effect of making the current deal with Iran less likely to come to pass.\nThe senators could have pointed out that Iran could nullify an agreement at any time, just as the United States could."}
