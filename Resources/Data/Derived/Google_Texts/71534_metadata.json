No other Maryland basketball team - men\u2019s or women\u2019s - had gone unbeaten in league competition.\n\nBut they sure got all they could handle in this one, hanging on after Ohio State (23-10) cut a 15-point lead to one.\n\nMaryland was leading by four when Cait Craft raced back on defense to strip Maryland\u2019s Shatori Walker-Kimbrough as she went for a layup following a turnover by Ohio State\u2019s Kelsey Mitchell. Craft then nailed a 3 with a minute left to make it 75-74, but the Terrapins hung on.\n\nMitchell, who had 31 points, got called for traveling with 7 seconds left, and Brown hit two free throws to make it a three-point game. Mitchell caught the inbounds and raced up the right side, but her heave from just inside the half-court line hit the back of the rim, preserving the win for Maryland.\n\nBrown, a candidate for Naismith Women\u2019s College Player of the Year, had six assists. Walker-Kimbrough added 13 points and six rebounds. Laurin Mincy scored 12, and Malina Howard chipped in with 12 points and 12 rebounds.\n\nDespite Mitchell\u2019s big scoring game, Ohio State came up short going for its fifth Big Ten tournament title. Alexa Hart finished with 13 points and 10 rebounds, but the Buckeyes\u2019 six-game win streak came to an end.\n\nA 17-3 run by Maryland turned a one-point lead late in the first half into a 15-point advantage in the second, with Walker-Kimbrough nailing a 3 to make it 50-35. But with the score 52-37, Ohio State jumped right back into it.\n\nThe Buckeyes went on a 17-4 run, cutting it to 56-54 on Mitchell\u2019s 3 midway through the half.\n\nHart\u2019s layup pulled Ohio State within one - 61-60 - with 6:44 remaining, and it remained tight until the rest of the way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lexie Brown scored 19 points, and No. 4 Maryland beat Ohio State 77-74 Sunday night to capture the Big Ten tournament title and cap a perfect run through the conference.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Lexie Brown scored 19 points, and No. 4 Maryland beat Ohio State 77-74 Sunday night to capture the Big Ten tournament title and cap a perfect run through the conference.", "title": "Maryland beats Ohio State to win Big Ten tournament title", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/8/no-4-maryland-beats-ohio-state-77-74-in-big-ten-fi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/08/13259317cd6d370a700f6a7067008eba.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/08/13259317cd6d370a700f6a7067008eba.jpg", "title": "Maryland beats Ohio State to win Big Ten tournament title", "description": "Lexie Brown scored 19 points, and No. 4 Maryland beat Ohio State 77-74 Sunday night to capture the Big Ten tournament title and cap a perfect run through the conference.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Kelsey Mitchell, Lexie Brown"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb0f\"", "article_summary": "Despite Mitchell\u2019s big scoring game, Ohio State came up short going for its fifth Big Ten tournament title.\n4 Maryland beat Ohio State 77-74 Sunday night to capture the Big Ten tournament title and cap a perfect run through the conference.\nHart\u2019s layup pulled Ohio State within one - 61-60 - with 6:44 remaining, and it remained tight until the rest of the way.\nBut they sure got all they could handle in this one, hanging on after Ohio State (23-10) cut a 15-point lead to one.\nLaurin Mincy scored 12, and Malina Howard chipped in with 12 points and 12 rebounds."}
