Ron Harris ran for 139 on Sept. 14, 1974 at New Mexico.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll be the first to tell you, our team players of the week were the offensive line,\u201d said CSU coach Jim McElwain. \u201cHe was the recipient of some great work up front. As you guys know, we lost some really good running backs from a year ago (Kapri Bibbs and Donnell Alexander) and I thought both Dee and Treyous (Jarrells) stepped up and played how we expected them to play. That\u2019s a great honor and believe me, I\u2019m happy as heck for Dee and really that offensive line.\u201d\n\nMcElwain helped recruit Hart to Alabama when he was the Crimson Tide\u2019s offensive coordinator before becoming the Rams\u2019coach for the 2012 season. He said he was told many of the Alabama players and coaches watched the CU-CSU game Friday night, the night before Alabama\u2019s win over West Virginia, and he had heard from some of them congratulating him and Hart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing about the University of Alabama that really kind of makes it a special place,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cOnce you\u2019re one of them, you\u2019re one of them forever. . . Dee did a lot of good things for them when he was there, on special teams, and they\u2019ll be the first ones to tell you. They\u2019re really proud of him. They all watched the game because that was their Friday night in the hotel.\u201d\n\nRoberts made all four of his extra points Friday night and made a 52-yard field goal late in the Rams\u2019 31-17 win over Colorado. He now has been the Mountain West\u2019s special teams player four times in his three seasons with the Rams.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Addison Gillam,Alabama,Buffaloes,Buffs,Colorado,Colorado Buffaloes,Colorado State,Colorado State University,CSU,CU,Dee Hart,Denver,Denver Post,Donnell Alexander,Jared Roberts,Jim McElwain,Kapri Bibbs,Mile High,Mountain West,Mountain West Conference,New Mexico,Rocky Mountain Showdown,Running,Running back,Terry Frei,The Denver Post,Virginia,West Virginia", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "CSU running back Dee Hart was named Mountain West offensive player of the week and kicker Jared Roberts was named special teams player of the week.", "title": "Dee Hart, Jared Roberts of Colorado State honored by Mountain West", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/09/01/colorado-states-dee-hart-jared-roberts-honored-mountain-west/31286/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/09/jared-roberts-csu-kicker.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "CSU running back Dee Hart was named Mountain West offensive player of the week and kicker Jared Roberts was named special teams player of the week.", "creator": "@TFrei", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/09/01/colorado-states-dee-hart-jared-roberts-honored-mountain-west/31286/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/09/jared-roberts-csu-kicker.jpg", "title": "Colorado State\u2019s Dee Hart, Jared Roberts honored by Mountain West", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "CSU running back Dee Hart was named Mountain West offensive player of the week and kicker Jared Roberts was named special teams player of the week."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf604\"", "article_summary": "He now has been the Mountain West\u2019s special teams player four times in his three seasons with the Rams.\nColorado State running back Dee Hart, who ran for 139 yards and two touchdowns in his first game for the Rams Friday night, Monday was named Mountain West Conference offensive player of the week and senior kicker Jared Roberts was named special teams player of the week.\nDee did a lot of good things for them when he was there, on special teams, and they\u2019ll be the first ones to tell you.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing about the University of Alabama that really kind of makes it a special place,\u201d McElwain said.\nHart\u2019s 139 rushing yards equaled the top mark for a CSU running back in his first game."}
