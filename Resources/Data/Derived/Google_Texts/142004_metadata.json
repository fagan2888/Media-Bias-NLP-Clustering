The fund plans to update those findings with 2016 numbers later this year.\n\n\u201cThis (report) doesn\u2019t mean that the law is working well for every single person,\u201d Collins said. \u201cBut in general, it seems to be enabling people to get the health care that they need.\u201d\n\nMore than 8 in 10 people said their ability to get needed care has either improved or stayed the same since they enrolled in coverage through the health law.\n\nThe law allows Americans who don\u2019t get health benefits at work to shop among plans on state-based exchanges operated by the federal government or by the states themselves.\n\nConsumers making less than four times the federal poverty level \u2014 about $47,000 for a single adult or $97,000 for a family of four \u2014 qualify for subsidies. Insurers must provide a basic set of benefits and cannot turn away consumers, even if they are sick.\n\nVery-low-income Americans in most states can enroll in the government\u2019s Medicaid program at virtually no cost, an option provided by the health law that leaders in 31 states and the District of Columbia have elected to make available to their residents.\n\nThe dual coverage expansions have led to the largest drop in the nation\u2019s uninsured rate in at least half a century, surveys show.\n\n(EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\nThe new Commonwealth Fund survey found that 45 percent of adults enrolled in a marketplace plan in 2016 and 62 percent of adults newly covered by Medicaid were previously uninsured.\n\nMore state leaders are now considering Medicaid expansions, including in very conservative states such as Oklahoma.\n\nAnd enrollment in the marketplaces has been increasing, albeit at a slower rate than initially forecast; there are about 12 million people in marketplace plans.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM)\n\nBut the law remains a political hot button, with Republican congressional leaders and presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump promising full repeal.\n\nAt the same time, many insurers are seeking significant premium increases next year, in part because enrollees in marketplace plans are sicker and more expensive than they anticipated.\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund survey was conducted between Feb. 2 and April 5 among a random, nationally representative sample of 4,802 adults ages 19 to 64. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92016 Tribune Co.\n\nVisit Tribune Co. at www.latimes.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\n_____\n\nTopics: t000002537,t000023148,t000023139,t000002827,t000002863,t000003813,t000412858,t000418709,t000002861,t000002953,t000047686,t000047684,t000047683,t000193420,t000038516,t000032262", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "AP > News > Nation  |", "og": {"url": "http://readingeagle.com/ap/article/obamacare-is-helping-millions-get-health-care-survey-finds", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reading Eagle", "description": "More than 60 percent of working-age Americans who signed up for Medicaid or a private health plan through the Affordable Care Act are getting health", "title": "Obamacare is helping millions get health care, survey finds | Reading Eagle - AP"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://readingeagle.com/ap/article/obamacare-is-helping-millions-get-health-care-survey-finds", "site": "@ReadingEagle", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare is helping millions get health care, survey finds | Reading Eagle - AP"}, "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 177057515645359}, "keywords": "AP > News > Nation  |", "article": {"section": "AP"}, "description": "More than 60 percent of working-age Americans who signed up for Medicaid or a private health plan through the Affordable Care Act are getting health"}, "article_summary": "The Commonwealth Fund, like Kaiser, has found that many Americans are concerned about the cost of their health care.\nMore than 60 percent of working-age Americans who signed up for Medicaid or a private health plan through the Affordable Care Act are getting health care that they couldn\u2019t previously get, a new nationwide survey indicates.\nAmericans with employer-provided health plans \u2014 which have lower premiums and deductibles than many marketplace plans \u2014 are the happiest, with 90 percent reporting satisfaction with their coverage.\nThe Commonwealth Fund survey was conducted between Feb. 2 and April 5 among a random, nationally representative sample of 4,802 adults ages 19 to 64.\nNearly half of consumers in marketplace plans reported difficulty paying premiums in 2015."}
