Reynolds Tobacco Co., Philip Morris USA Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. The deal resolves about 400 cases pending before a federal judge in Jacksonville, but does not affect thousands of other lawsuits pending in Florida state courts.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the cases pending in state court, we will continue to defend them vigorously, which includes appealing adverse verdicts,\u201d said Jeff Raborn, vice president and assistant general counsel for R.J. Reynolds, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\nThe lawsuits stemmed from a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision, known as Engle v. Liggett Group, which threw out a $145 billion class-action verdict against cigarette makers.\n\nThat decision let stand findings that the companies knowingly sold dangerous products and hid smoking hazards, meaning future juries could consider that as proven fact. But the ruling also required smokers and their families to pursue individual wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits based on cigarette use.\n\nThe settlement Wednesday, which requires final approval from a federal judge, would end the federal cases that would have taken years had they gone to trial.\n\n\u201cWhenever people are suffering, we always welcome serious, fair offers that may more quickly resolve their claims and help them move on with their lives as best they can,\u201d said Joe Rice, co-founder of the South Carolina-based Motley Rice law firm and a chief negotiator for the plaintiffs.\n\nUnder the deal, R.J. Reynolds and Richmond, Virginia-based Philip Morris would each pay $42.5 million and Lorillard, based in Greensboro, North Carolina, would contribute $15 million. Each individual plaintiff who agrees to the settlement can share in the funds, but any that do not may negotiate further. The goal, Rice said, is for full participation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve committed to try to get 100 percent of the cases resolved, and if we don\u2019t we\u2019ll go back to the table,\u201d he said.\n\nThe settlement does not affect those federal cases that have already been tried or are on appeal. It will use a model formula based on past trials and rulings to determine how much money each plaintiff could receive, subject to approval by U.S. District Judge William G. Young.\n\nStill, the companies and plaintiff lawyers were optimistic the federal lawsuits are near an end.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to have these federal Engle cases behind us,\u201d said Ronald Milstein, Lorillard\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel.\n\n\u201cThis settlement will provide immediate compensation to our clients, many of whom are very elderly,\u201d said attorney Robert J. Nelson of the San Francisco-based Lief Cabraser law firm.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A $100 million settlement has been reached between three major tobacco companies and hundreds of people who sued them for smoking-related deaths and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/100m-settlement-fl-tobacco-lawsuits", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201410/smoking2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A $100 million settlement has been reached between three major tobacco companies and hundreds of people who sued them for smoking-related deaths and", "title": "$100M Settlement in FL Tobacco Lawsuits"}, "story_id": 389236567, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "$100M Settlement in FL Tobacco Lawsuits"}, "nid": 9716, "datePublished": "2015-02-26", "keywords": "tobacco lawsuits, tobacco lawsuit, tobacco companies, smoking-related deaths, smoking-related illnesses, R.J.
