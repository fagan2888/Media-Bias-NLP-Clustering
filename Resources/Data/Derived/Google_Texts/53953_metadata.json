They found jewelry and other items belonging to the victims, and they also recovered a sawed-off shotgun that had been reported stolen during a Jan. 8 burglary in Wake County.\n\nInvestigators also found an AK-47 rifle, $400 in cash, marijuana and a small amount of cocaine. Authorities said Saturday that the robbery did not appear to be random.\n\nBoth men were in the Durham County jail Saturday. Jayne received a $1.5 million bond and Fabela received a $500,000 bond.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-01-25 10:19:00", "description": "Durham police have charged two men who they say broke into a home on Cole Mill Road Monday night, tied up the couple living there and then stole several items and an SUV.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-01-25 10:19:46", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13327656|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "Durham police have charged two men who they say broke into a home on Cole Mill Road Monday night, tied up the couple living there and then stole several items and an SUV.", "title": "Two men charged in connection with Durham home invasion :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/two-men-charged-in-connection-with-durham-home-invasion/13327656/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/news_briefs/2014/01/25/13327660/13327660-1390663098-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-25T10:19:00-05:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "Durham police have charged two men who they say broke into a home on Cole Mill Road Monday night, tied up the couple living there and then stole several items and an SUV.", "title": "Two men charged in connection with Durham home invasion :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/two-men-charged-in-connection-with-durham-home-invasion/13327656/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/news_briefs/2014/01/25/13327660/13327660-1390663098-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb52\"", "article_summary": "Both men were in the Durham County jail Saturday.\nJayne was also charged with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, one count of possession of a weapon of mass destruction and one count of possession of a stolen firearm.\nInvestigators also found an AK-47 rifle, $400 in cash, marijuana and a small amount of cocaine.\nJayne received a $1.5 million bond and Fabela received a $500,000 bond.\nInvestigators searched Fabela and Jayne's Snowcrest Trail residence Friday evening."}
