Democrats hoped the co-ops would increase competition in state insurance markets, creating additional choices for consumers and holding down premiums. But 12 of the 23 co-ops have shut down, disrupting coverage for more than a half-million consumers, many of whom had to search for other providers of insurance for 2016. And many of the remaining co-ops continue to lose money.\n\nHealth Republic Insurance of New York, with an enrollment of more than 155,000 people, was by far the biggest co-op to close. Doctors say they have been left with unpaid claims for services provided to some co-op members. The federal government has awarded $2.5 billion in loans to the co-ops, including at least $1.2 billion to those that are shutting down. At a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said the administration \u201cfailed in overseeing the co-op program,\u201d even though \u201cwarning signs were there\u201d as early as 2012. Federal health officials, he said, failed to respond promptly to concerns expressed by federal auditors and state insurance regulators who scrutinized the co-ops, including one that collapsed in Iowa and Nebraska.\n\nSenator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said that data submitted to the government by the co-ops raised \u201cfinancial red flags\u201d that should have caused alarm. Instead, he said, the Department of Health and Human Services continued to disburse federal loan money to the co-ops.\n\n\u201cH.H.S. blew it,\u201d Mr. Portman said. \u201cThis was terrible management.\u201d\n\nAndrew M. Slavitt, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the committee that the administration had increased monitoring of the co-ops. \u201cIn 2015,\u201d he said, \u201cwe conducted 27 financial and operational reviews and 16 in-person visits and had 43 formal communications, not to mention hundreds of phone calls\u201d with co-op executives. Asked if any of the remaining co-ops would fail this year, Mr. Slavitt did not answer directly, but he said the co-ops had \u201cevery opportunity to be successful\u201d in 2016. He noted that the co-ops had to create networks of doctors and hospitals from scratch and were typically small businesses competing against big insurance companies with decades of experience.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Slavitt said the administration would try to make it easier for co-ops to raise capital and attract outside investors or merger partners. The health law stipulates that co-ops must be governed by their members and that any profits must be used to lower premiums or improve benefits. Federal guidelines say that \u201ca co-op may not merge with a for-profit entity.\u201d Mr. Slavitt said the Obama administration was trying to protect co-op members and taxpayers. \u201cWe will use every available tool to recoup federal funding,\u201d Mr. Slavitt said, but he offered no estimate of how much money the government might recover from loans to co-ops.\n\nConsumers who were enrolled in co-ops that shut down at the end of 2015 \u201chave access to a special enrollment period, and are able to shop for 2016 coverage on the marketplace until Feb. 28,\u201d four weeks after the deadline for other people, he said.\n\nThe hearing was something of an audition for Mr. Slavitt. President Obama nominated him to be administrator of the Medicare and Medicaid agency in July, but the Senate Finance Committee has not held a confirmation hearing and is still reviewing his qualifications.\n\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said that some co-ops had set premiums far below the prices of their competitors and incurred costs that greatly exceeded revenue. Moreover, he said, the administration obscured the co-ops\u2019 problems by allowing them, in effect, to count some of their federal loans as assets rather than liabilities. \u201cAs a result,\u201d Mr. Hatch said, \u201chundreds of thousands of Americans have lost or will lose their health insurance, and taxpayers are still on the hook.\u201d\n\nSenator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said some of the co-ops had been victims of politics. \u201cEven though the Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act multiple times,\u201d Mr. Wyden said, \u201cthe political battles have continued, and co-ops are one of the big targets.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160121183212, "twitter": {"description": "Twelve of the 23 health insurance cooperatives set up with $2.5 billion in federal funding have shut down, rather than spur competition as intended.", "title": "Republicans Say Government Mismanaged Health Care Co-ops", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/us/politics/republicans-say-government-mismanaged-health-care-co-ops.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004159521"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/us/politics/republicans-say-government-mismanaged-health-care-co-ops.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004159521", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/us/politics/republicans-say-government-mismanaged-health-care-co-ops.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "\u2018Red Flags\u2019 Missed on Health Co-ops, Republicans Say", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 21, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),States (US),United States Politics and Government,Medicare,Medicaid,Senate,Health and Human Services Department,Republican Party,Obama  Barack", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Medicaid,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Twelve of the 23 health insurance cooperatives set up with $2.5 billion in federal funding have shut down, rather than spur competition as intended.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Twelve of the 23 health insurance cooperatives set up with $2.5 billion in federal funding have shut down, rather than spur competition as intended.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 21, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-01-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2016-01-21", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "22health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160122170142, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/us/politics/republicans-say-government-mismanaged-health-care-co-ops.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Twelve of the 23 health insurance cooperatives set up with $2.5 billion in federal funding have shut down, rather than spur competition as intended.", "title": "Republicans Say Government Mismanaged Health Care Co-ops"}, "pdate": 20160121, "des": "Medicaid", "articleid": 100000004159521, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Republicans Say Government Mismanaged Health Care Co-ops", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Asked if any of the remaining co-ops would fail this year, Mr. Slavitt did not answer directly, but he said the co-ops had \u201cevery opportunity to be successful\u201d in 2016.\nThe co-ops were created with federal money under the Affordable Care Act, which was adopted in 2010.\nInstead, he said, the Department of Health and Human Services continued to disburse federal loan money to the co-ops.\nDemocrats hoped the co-ops would increase competition in state insurance markets, creating additional choices for consumers and holding down premiums.\nThe hearing was something of an audition for Mr. Slavitt."}
