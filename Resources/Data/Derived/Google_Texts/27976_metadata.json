The handsome lab welcomed the love, eventually falling asleep on the cool stone floor.\n\n\"It's really hard work being this adored by everyone,\" Collier joked.\n\nThe theme for teams like Collier and Cooper visiting the law school this week is \"Paws to Refresh.\" CU undergrads start a week of finals today before heading off for a three-week winter break. The winter commencement ceremony is Saturday.\n\nCollier said she gets new requests each semester for therapy dogs to visit campus departments and buildings. A group of dogs and their humans visited Norlin Library last week and saw more than 400 students in two hours, Collier said.\n\nOlivia Abrant was one of three undergraduate students who spent the better part of an hour with Cooper and Collier, blowing off steam before she finished a final paper and studying for several upcoming tests.\n\nCooper, a therapy dog, takes a nap while being petted by Zach Maas, left, freshman in chemistry, and Leah Sauerwein, right, a sophomore in integrative physiology and psychology, in the Wolf Law Building at the University of Colorado.

So I've started studying now and my break time is minimal.\"\n\nReider Larsen, a freshman studying aerospace engineering, stopped by because he said Cooper reminded him of his yellow lab at home.\n\nThough he has four finals this week, Larsen said there's one that really worries him \u2014 calculus.\n\nHe said he de-stresses by making sure not to talk about finals during meals.\n\n\"I'm not too stressed at the moment,\" he said. \"I'm actually doing pretty well. I'm not too worried about most of them.\"\n\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_27126897/cu-boulder-gears-up-finals-week", "sailthru.author": "By Sarah Kuta \n \n  Camera Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27126897:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-13T14:00:00-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "It's a ruff time of year for University of Colorado students, many of whom are spending the weekend holed up in the library, coffee in hand, as they prepare for final exams.", "title": "CU-Boulder gears up for finals week", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_27126897/cu-boulder-gears-up-finals-week", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/1212/20141212__14DCAFINw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2014-12-14T08:58:23-0700", "endDate": "2024-12-12T17:33:03-0700", "news_keywords": "CU News, CU News news, Boulder Colorado CU News news, Boulder Colorado news, CU News Boulder news, CU News Colorado news, US CU News news, world CU News news.", "byline": "By Sarah KutaCamera", "pubDate": "2014-12-12T17:48:38-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-13T14:00:00-0700", "sailthru.title": "CU-Boulder gears up for finals week", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "CU News", "description": "It's a ruff time of year for University of Colorado students, many of whom are spending the weekend holed up in the library, coffee in hand, as they prepare for final exams.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_27126897/cu-boulder-gears-up-finals-week", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "It's a ruff time of year for University of Colorado students, many of whom are spending the weekend holed up in the library, coffee in hand, as they prepare for final exams.", "title": "CU-Boulder gears up for finals week"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9dde\"", "article_summary": "CU undergrads start a week of finals today before heading off for a three-week winter break.\nThough he has four finals this week, Larsen said there's one that really worries him \u2014 calculus.\nThe theme for teams like Collier and Cooper visiting the law school this week is \"Paws to Refresh.\"\nCollier said she gets new requests each semester for therapy dogs to visit campus departments and buildings.\nA group of dogs and their humans visited Norlin Library last week and saw more than 400 students in two hours, Collier said."}
