Threaten to shelve construction plans, as the retail giant has warned it will do if the legislation is approved, and democratic governments will remain undeterred. He\u2019ll demonstrate that elected officials, instead of being cowed by businesses that blackmail, can bring them to heel. He\u2019ll prove that policies which corporations bitterly oppose, which negatively affect their best efforts at unbridled accumulation, don\u2019t have to be deep-sixed.\n\nAt issue, in other words, is the relationship between democracy and capitalism. Can the prerogative of capital be curtailed, or must self-governing communities accept the terms that corporations dictate?\n\nGray, who expended a great deal of energy trying to lure Walmart to the nation\u2019s capitol, is expected to veto the living wage legislation; it\u2019s set to hit his desk today. The Large Retailer Accountability Act is narrowly drawn, applying only to stores which exceed 75,000 feet and whose parent companies pull in more than $1 billion in gross annual revenue. The businesses who meet those criteria\u2014the most prominent of which is Walmart\u2014would be required to pay workers at least $12.50. In July, less than than 24 hours before the DC Council was set to vote on the proposal, Walmart said they\u2019d forgo construction of at least three stores if the city imposed the wage floor. But the Council stood fast. They approved the legislation by a vote of 8-5, one shy of a veto-proof majority. Since then, Target, Home Depot, and other retailers\u2014unaffected, as of yet, but still vexed\u2014have registered their own disapproval.\n\nIn defense of the living wage bill, pro-labor liberals have rightly argued that Walmart, an immensely profitable company, can easily afford to pay its employees a relatively paltry $12.50. They\u2019ve also pointed to the stimulative effect of boosting low-wage workers\u2019 pay. What\u2019s been missing, however, is a forceful defense of public power to rectify injustice in the market, of the right of citizens and their representatives to constrain capitalism\u2019s cruelty. Government action shouldn\u2019t supplant collective, extra-legislative worker action. But when corporations unceasingly quash organizing attempts, it\u2019s salutary for the state to step in.\n\nNot to say it\u2019s easy. The vituperation with which Walmart has attacked the living wage bill is perhaps most striking because capital\u2019s threats, typically tacit, have actually been openly made. The City Council dared question the untrammeled control of capital, and now they\u2019re seeing the result of such temerity. Even marginally shifting the locus of power from capital to labor\u2014 even if it\u2019s done by a state that usually does the bidding of business\u2014is enough to occasion outcry from the business community. DC\u2019s deputy mayor, for instance, has said,\u201cPeople have no idea how damaging this is,\u201d and argued that even a veto wouldn\u2019t be enough to restore business confidence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Politicians like D.C.
