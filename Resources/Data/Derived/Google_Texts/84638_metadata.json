Villanueva is also, unsurprisingly, a virgin.\n\nMargaret Lyons, a television critic at Vulture, praises \"Jane the Virgin,\" calling it \u201cone of the savviest, sharpest new shows in years,\u201d in part because \u201c[e]ach part of the story is driven by clear character wants, informed by their backstories, and complicated by their loyalties.\u201d This isn\u2019t a show primarily about immigration politics\u2014it\u2019s about having some random guy\u2019s baby\u2014but immigration is part of the backstory, and it plays the same role in shaping the characters\u2019 wants and loyalties as it would real life. That\u2019s also evident in the other social issues the show covers.\n\n\u201cJane is the first, second, third generation Latino story.\u201d Gina Rodriguez\n\nOne such issue, for example, is reproductive health. Jane is the daughter of a teen mom (Xiomara, played by Andrea Navedo) and promises her grandmother (Alba, played by Ivonne Coll) she\u2019ll wait to have sex until she\u2019s married. In the pilot episode, as Jane debates keeping her own baby, she finds out that her devoutly Catholic grandmother advised Xiomara to get an abortion. That\u2019s not a knock on her grandmother\u2019s character, but an example of how the lines between pro-life and pro-choice aren\u2019t as rigid in people\u2019s everyday lives.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl8XhzQ7yrc\n\nLater in the season, the show touches on the realities of mixed immigration status homes. On this Monday\u2019s episode, Jane drops her lawsuit against the doctor who inseminated her because court cases make her grandmother\u2014an undocumented immigrant\u2014extremely anxious. In a flashback from the same episode Jane\u2019s grandmother lectures Xiomara for not paying a parking ticket for the same reason.\n\nRegardless of a viewer\u2019s personal stance on deportations and the president\u2019s immigration order, that\u2019s the reality for millions of families. While pitching Obamacare, President Obama made a point of telling people that signing up for health insurance wouldn\u2019t result in immigration agents showing up at the front door. \u201cYou know, if you have a family where some people are citizens or legally here, and other are not documented, the immigration people will never get that information,\u201d he said.\n\nIn November, Diane Guerrero, the Colombian actress who plays Jane\u2019s best friend, wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times about her family\u2019s deportation and the need for permanent reform from Congress.\n\nThroughout my childhood I watched my parents try to become legal but to no avail. They lost their money to people they believed to be attorneys, but who ultimately never helped. That meant my childhood was haunted by the fear that they would be deported. If I didn\u2019t see anyone when I walked in the door after school, I panicked. And then one day, my fears were realized. I came home from school to an empty house. Lights were on and dinner had been started, but my family wasn\u2019t there.\n\nThe importance of a show like \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d is that it portrays people like Guerrero in a way that isn\u2019t demeaning, or dark, but motivational. Studies have shown that young girls and children of color experience lower self esteem after watching TV because of the way they\u2019re portrayed\u2014emotional, threatening, sexual, but rarely as the lead character. Seeing Jane\u2019s story may mean something for children in similar situations\u2014or at least Rodriquez hopes so.\n\n\u201cJane is the first, second, third generation Latino story,\u201d she said in June during an interview with Fusion. \u201cYou know, she grew up here in the States, her grandmother speaks to her in Spanish, she responds in English. She\u2019s hard working, educated, going to school, trying to do everything that\u2019s in her mind, and I want little girls to be able to follow something like that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Arit John", "description": "The CW\u2019s \"Jane the Virgin,\" a show about a pregnant virgin from a mixed immigration-status home, was nominated for two Golden Globe awards.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The CW\u2019s \"Jane the Virgin,\" a show about a pregnant virgin from a mixed immigration-status home, was nominated for two Golden Globe awards.", "title": "How the Personal Side of Immigration Politics Plays Out on 'Jane the Virgin'", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-11/how-the-personal-side-of-immigration-politics-plays-out-on-jane-the-virgin", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i80pJqJXfV78/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The CW\u2019s \"Jane the Virgin,\" a show about a pregnant virgin from a mixed immigration-status home, was nominated for two Golden Globe awards.", "title": "How the Personal Side of Immigration Politics Plays Out on 'Jane the Virgin'", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-11/how-the-personal-side-of-immigration-politics-plays-out-on-jane-the-virgin", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i80pJqJXfV78/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "The CW\u2019s \"Jane the Virgin,\" a show about a pregnant virgin from a mixed immigration-status home, was nominated for two Golden Globe awards."}, "parsely-title": "How the Personal Side of Immigration Politics Plays Out on 'Jane the Virgin'", "parsely-tags": "Immigration,Small Screen,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NGFR926JTSEH01", "parsely-author": "Arit John", "date": "2014-12-11T20:51:02.665Z", "keywords": "Immigration,Small Screen", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Immigration,Small Screen", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-11T20:51:02.665Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i80pJqJXfV78/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-11/how-the-personal-side-of-immigration-politics-plays-out-on-jane-the-virgin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01ad\"", "article_summary": "Breakout star Gina Rodriguez plays Jane Villanueva, a religious young woman who\u2019s accidentally artificially inseminated\u2014she went in for a pap smear\u2014and becomes pregnant.\nOn this Monday\u2019s episode, Jane drops her lawsuit against the doctor who inseminated her because court cases make her grandmother\u2014an undocumented immigrant\u2014extremely anxious.\nIn a flashback from the same episode Jane\u2019s grandmother lectures Xiomara for not paying a parking ticket for the same reason.\nRegardless of a viewer\u2019s personal stance on deportations and the president\u2019s immigration order, that\u2019s the reality for millions of families.\nIn November, Diane Guerrero, the Colombian actress who plays Jane\u2019s best friend, wrote an essay for the Los Angeles Times about her family\u2019s deportation and the need for permanent reform from Congress."}
