WEST ALLIS (WITI) -- As tens of thousands celebrate the dairy state at the Wisconsin State Fair, one group is putting on a show both inside and outside the barns.

Many of the animals being shown at the fair are done so by members of the 4-H Youth Club. However you don't have to raise animals to be involved in the organization.

"That's actually a really big stereotype about 4-H. You don't have to be on a farm or anything," said member Leah Kasprzak. "I do a lot of arts and crafts and stuff like that."

Some 4-H members are also part of the Showcase Singers -- a group of kids from around the state who compete at various fairs.

"We work from sun up to sun down, basically," said director Luke Talen.

"It's definitely molded me into the person I am today," said 4-H member Randy Niffenegger.

The organization also offers activities such as sewing, painting, mechanical arts and more.

"I know a lot of people think it's only about animals and agriculture, but you become such a well-rounded individual in 4-H," said Talen.

The Wisconsin 4-H celebrates 100 years in 2014. They will host a Fair Day on August 5th.
