Many lawmakers are looking for a way to work around constitutional restrictions that may require taxpayer refunds even as some state programs face cuts. The outcome will carry important implications for school districts and state colleges and universities.\n\nBeyond money, protection of student data already is teed up to be a major education issue this session, as it was last year. Testing, school ratings and teacher evaluation also are expected to be in play.\n\nSome Capitol observers think 2016 could be as busy as the 2015 session, when nearly 120 education-related bills were introduced. The vast majority died.\n\nThe Capitol cast of characters looks much the same as 2015. Republicans hold a one-vote majority in the Senate while Democrats control the House. The membership of the House and Senate education committees remains largely the same.\n\nLawmakers are more seasoned than last year, when a fifth of the 100 members were freshmen. But 2016 is an election year, which creates partisan dynamics that can make compromise harder.\n\nHandicapping a legislative session is tricky, but here\u2019s a look at the education issues taking shape for 2016.\n\nThe big issues\n\nBudget & school finance\n\n\u201cOur budget is our biggest challenge this year,\u201d Democratic House Speaker Dickey Lee Hullinghorst of Boulder told reporters at a recent briefing. \u201cWe are going to have to cut education this year if we don\u2019t find a solution.\u201d\n\nOur improved and expanded daily Capitol newsletter is now the place for everything you need to know about education doings under the dome. Sign up here.\n\nGov. John Hickenlooper\u2019s proposed 2016-17 budget includes such cuts, including a $50 million increase in the K-12 \u201cnegative factor.\u201d That\u2019s the formula the legislature uses to reduce school funding from what it otherwise would have been in order to balance the overall state budget. The budget also calls for a $20 million cut in higher education support and recommends that college and university boards be free to raise tuition rates as they see fit.\n\nHere\u2019s the dilemma lawmakers face: A formula mandated by the state constitution limits annual increases in spending. Revenues that exceed the limit are supposed to be refunded to taxpayers, and that\u2019s the situation Colorado now faces.\n\nThose revenues include both taxes, which can spent at the legislature\u2019s discretion, and various revenues called \u201ccash funds,\u201d which generally can be used only for specific purposes.\n\nA $750 million chunk of cash is generated by something called the hospital provider fee, which is used to support the Medicaid program.\n\nHickenlooper and Democratic leaders want the legislature to change the provider fee so that it doesn\u2019t count against the revenue limit, freeing up tax revenues for spending on things like transportation and education and eliminate the requirement for taxpayer refunds.\n\nBut Republican leaders last week hardened their opposition to reclassifying the provider fee, casting new doubts on whether a deal can be struck.\n\nEducation advocates also are eying another pot of money as a way to ease the pressure on school and college funding.\n\nTotal school funding \u2014 $6.2 billion this year \u2014 comes from a combination of state and local tax money. If there\u2019s more local revenue than projected, the state is able to reduce its share. District property tax revenues are higher than projected last spring, and enrollment is down, meaning the state could cut its contribution by about $159 million in the middle of the current school year.\n\nDistricts will fight to keep that money for their budgets, but some lawmakers will argue that state support should be cut for the current year so the money can be saved for the 2016-17 budget.\n\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are pledging to keep the negative factor at is current $855 million.\n\n\u201cIt will not be my intention to let the negative factor grow,\u201d said Rep. Millie Hamner, D-Dillon at a recent legislative forum sponsored by Chalkbeat. (Listen to the audio of that event.) She\u2019s the chair of the Joint Budget Committee and will be a sponsor of the 2016-17 school finance bill.\n\nMany observers are skeptical there will be major movement on school finance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just very bleak, how we are going to fund education,\u201d said Jane Urschel, deputy executive director of the Colorado Association of School Boards.\n\nData privacy\n\nThe spread of online testing, use of new tools to evaluate the readiness of preschool and kindergarten students and the proliferation of classroom apps have generated a lot of anxiety among some parent groups and policymakers.\n\nA bill intended to impose greater privacy and security requirements on software and service vendors died in the 2015 session after lawmakers couldn\u2019t reconcile a stronger Senate bill with a somewhat softer House version.\n\nThe issue is back this year, with Republican Rep. Paul Lundeen of Monument and Democratic Rep. Alex Garnett of Denver trying to reconcile the wishes of parents, school districts and the software industry.\n\nThe key questions are disclosure of what data is collected, how it\u2019s protected, whether it can be sold or shared, how long student data is retained and whether personal information about individual students can really be protected when data is aggregated.\n\nAny legislation on data privacy will need to walk a fine line between protecting student privacy and not stifling educational innovation. \u201cThis is an extremely heavy lift,\u201d Lundeen said.\n\nSen. Chris Holbert, R-Parker, was the author and would-be broker of last year\u2019s unsuccessful data privacy bill. He\u2019s not closely involved in the issue this year, but feels, \u201cWe have a better chance.\u201d\n\nGarnett, Lundeen\u2019s partner in the effort, said the state \u201ccan\u2019t go another year without putting some guardrails\u201d on data privacy.\n\nTesting, ratings & evaluation\n\nThere\u2019s rising chatter about assessments and how test results are used, but no big initiatives have jelled yet.\n\nHere are the key questions in the air:\n\nWill the legislature revisit testing issues in 2016, perhaps sparked by the controversy over whether SAT tests should replace ACT tests that have been given to all high school juniors?\n\nWill recent changes in federal education law \u2013 the new Every Student Succeeds Act \u2013 prompt lawmakers to try to take advantage of the additional flexibility the federal government has given states?\n\nWill there be moves to extend current timeouts in use of state testing data for rating districts and schools and in evaluating teachers?\n\nWill the relatively high rate of opting out of last spring\u2019s PARCC tests raise doubts about the reliability of that data in rating schools and evaluating teachers?\n\nPHOTO: Craig F. Walker, Denver Post\n\nThere\u2019s talk about testing bills, including proposals to eliminate 9th grade testing and perhaps pull Colorado out of the PARCC tests. A couple of legislators say they\u2019re \u201clooking into\u201d the switch to SAT tests for 11th graders, which is all but certain to be delayed until spring 2017.\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear whether such ideas will go very far.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there will be a lot stomach in the legislature to deal with more testing bills,\u201d said Sen. Andy Kerr, D-Lakewood.\n\nA similar air of uncertainty hangs over possible changes to the accountability and evaluation systems.\n\nThere likely will be bills to exempt teachers in early elementary grades and nationally board certified teachers from some provisions of the teacher evaluation law. There\u2019s also talk of trying to change the current law\u2019s requirement that 50 percent of teacher evaluations on student academic growth.\n\nWhether lawmakers tackle those issues in a serious way may depend on how they look at the reliability of last spring\u2019s PARCC testing results.\n\nIn a recent meeting with lawmakers, interim education Commissioner Elliott Asp defended the PARCC exams as \u201cwell designed\u201d and \u201cvalid.\u201d But he acknowledged \u201cwhat makes the data questionable\u201d for use in rating districts and schools is the participation rates.\n\nThe testing law passed last year requires the Department of Education to recommend to the legislature\u2019s education committees whether the accountability timeout should be extended, based on whether test results can be used fairly. The department hasn\u2019t yet made a recommendation.\n\nColleges also face a money pinch\n\nSchool districts would receive an increase in funding next year under Hickenlooper\u2019s budget, even they wouldn\u2019t get all the money they want because of the proposed increase in the negative factor.\n\nIn contrast, state colleges and universities would take an actual cut of $20 million in their state support.\n\nDuring meetings with the Joint Budget Committee last week, college presidents gently suggested that lawmakers find money to avoid those cuts. But higher education leaders are realistic about what\u2019s possible.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a cut, let\u2019s just take the cut and move on,\u201d said University of Colorado President Bruce Benson.\n\nTuition increases, the inevitable side effect of state budget cuts, likely will the big higher education issue of 2016. The Hickenlooper administration is proposing that college trustees be given full discretion to raise tuition. A 6 percent annual cap on tuition hikes imposed by lawmakers two years ago is expiring.\n\nStatehouse observers expect bills to set a new cap will be introduced. \u201cIt\u2019s low-hanging fruit,\u201d said one lobbyist.\n\nOther issues to watch\n\nDespite perennial promises to restrain themselves, lawmakers love to introduce bills about schools. Here\u2019s a sampling of other issues that are being bandied about at the Capitol:\n\nCharters \u2013 Lobbyist Dan Schaller of the Colorado League of Charter Schools said the group is looking at a legislative package to deal with charter funding inequities. Schaller said the league hasn\u2019t decided what it might propose on the touchy issue of districts\u2019 authority to authorize charters. A measure to reduce those powers died last year.\n\nConcurrent enrollment \u2013 More than 20,000 Colorado high school students take college classes, and some lawmakers would like to boost that number. Lundeen said he\u2019s planning a bill on the issue. The trick is figuring out how to split student funding between school districts and community colleges.\n\nConstruction \u2013 State aid for building and renovating schools has plateaued ever since the Building Excellent Schools Today program reached its annual cap on debt repayments a couple of years ago. BEST board members are pushing for an increase in that $40 million cap. They may get a sympathetic ear, because some lawmakers now are more comfortable with the stability of marijuana tax revenues, a small portion of which go to BEST.\n\nEarly education \u2013 Recent efforts to increase funding for the state preschool program and for full-day kindergarten have fallen afoul of budget realities. That doesn\u2019t mean the issue won\u2019t be debated again this year as both Wilson and Kerr promise bills on full-day kindergarten.\n\nSchool safety & district liability \u2013 The 2015 legislature passed a law that make school districts liable, in some cases, for violent acts committed on school grounds. Districts were nervous about the idea from the start, even the law doesn\u2019t fully go into effect until next year. A legislative study committee took a lot of testimony about the law over the summer but recommended no changes. Districts still want more specificity about what they should do to keep students safe, but it\u2019s unclear if legislation will be proposed or be successful this year.\n\nTeachers \u2013 Expect to see a bill to change the current law requiring mutual consent for placement of teachers in schools. This has been a sore subject for teachers unions, particularly in Denver, for five years. But previous attempts to change this portion of the teacher evaluation law have gone nowhere. And heightened worries about teacher shortages, particularly in rural districts, are expected to prompt legislation intended to help teacher recruitment and retention. This is another issue where lack of money may stymie meaningful action.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more \u2026\n\nHere\u2019s a quick list of other education ideas and issues that are in the air as the session prepares to kick off: Reduction of the paperwork and data reports districts have to file with CDE, expansion of blended learning opportunities, possible tweaks to current school readiness and graduation guidelines requirements, a bill on suspension and expulsion of children in early grades, resident tuition eligibility for homeless students, STEM and career and technical education, adjustments to the breakfast-after-the-bell law, changes in regulation of multi-district online schools, tax credits for donations to private school scholarships and limits on campaign contributions to school board candidates.\n\nIf most of those sound familiar, they should. Almost every education issue in play this year has been kicked around in previous sessions. Of course, most of those bills have died, which is why they\u2019ll be back this year. Hope springs eternal at the Capitol.\n\nNeed to refresh your memory about what lawmakers did and didn\u2019t do last session?
