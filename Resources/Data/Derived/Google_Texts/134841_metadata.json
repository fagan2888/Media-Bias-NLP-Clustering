We\u2019re all feeling the same thing. We all want to win a national title.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Is NCAA Final Four to blue-blooded this year?\n\nIf the Wildcats do, they\u2019ll be the first program since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers to finish a season as undefeated champions \u2014 an accomplishment that hovers over everything this week at what is shaping up as a monumental Final Four because of the history involved.\n\n\u201cIf we do complete that goal, I couldn\u2019t even put it into words,\u201d said Andrew Harrison, whose two free throws were the difference in the 68-66 win over Notre Dame in the Midwest Regional final.\n\nBut undefeated doesn\u2019t necessarily mean perfect, and Wisconsin is hardly in awe.\n\nThis is a rematch of last year\u2019s semifinal. In that game, the Badgers (35-3) were leading Kentucky by two when Harrison\u2019s twin brother, Aaron, spotted up from behind the upper-left part of the arc with 5.7 seconds left and made his second straight game-winning 3-pointer.\n\n\u201cHe has that clutch gene,\u201d Dekker said after that one.\n\nOne notable stat from that 74-73 thriller: Kaminsky finished with only eight points and five rebounds.\n\nThe 7-foot center, who averages 18 points and almost nine rebounds this season and will likely go in the first round of the NBA draft, said he would have returned for his senior season either way. Still, the loss \u2014 and the way it went down \u2014 left a mark.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously motivating because you want to come back to this stage,\u201d Kaminsky said. \u201cThis is what seasons are remembered for. You remember the national champion at the end of the season.\u201d\n\nWin or lose, these Kentucky players will be remembered \u2014 and watched some more. Freshman Karl-Anthony Towns \u2014 likely to become one of Calipari\u2019s much-discussed \u201cone-and-dones\u201d \u2014 is a probable lottery pick, as is junior Willie Cauley-Stein. The Harrison brothers and four or five more are also expected to wind up in the NBA, too.\n\nWisconsin has a few future pros \u2014 Kaminsky, Dekker and Hayes. But it\u2019s no big secret that the Badgers won\u2019t win on raw talent.\n\n\u201cDo you think I have to tell my players that this is a big game or that Kentucky\u2019s pretty good?\u201d Badgers coach Bo Ryan said. \u201cThey are. I think our guys are astute enough to figure that part out.\u201d\n\nTHE POSTMEN\n\nThe big man is back \u2014 at least at this Final Four. This game will feature three of best: Kaminsky for Wisconsin and 6-11 Towns and 7-foot Cauley-Stein for Kentucky. The Wildcats also have Trey Lyles at 6-10 and Marcus Lee at 6-9. To practice for Kentucky\u2019s height, Ryan tinkered with the idea of using tennis rackets to swat down shots at practice. \u201cBut with these guys, they might have started whacking each other with them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t simulate what they have.\u201d\n\nANALYTICS\n\nWhen asked what stats he pays most attention to, Ryan focused in on one: Points per possession. It\u2019s pretty clear why. The Badgers lead the nation in that stat at 1.22. Kentucky\u2019s not far behind, ranked ninth at 1.156.\n\nBALANCE\n\nPart of Calipari\u2019s coaching brilliance this season has been figuring out how to spread the minutes and the touches, while keeping everyone happy. Nobody on Kentucky averages more than 26 minutes a game, and Andrew Harrison leads the team in scoring with a modest 11 points a game. The Badgers, whose roster isn\u2019t as deep, have three players who score more \u2014 Kaminsky (18.7), Dekker (13.9) and Hayes (12.4).\n\nENDS AND ODDS\n\nThe Wildcats are five-point favorites, matching the lowest number they have been favored by all season. Also, for those thinking this Kentucky team will go down as the best in college basketball history if it runs the table, think again. The 2014-15 Wildcats would be a 3\u00bd-point underdog against the 2011-12 title team, according to R.J.
