An equal share of the electorate picked Clinton.( http://polling.reuters.com/#!poll/TM743Y15\n\nGiven Clinton's background as a former secretary of state it is perhaps not surprising that she did reasonably well in the poll. However, Trump's good showing upends an emerging narrative that the Paris shootings and suicide bombings would prompt voters to rethink their support for the real estate billionaire, who leads the field of Republican presidential candidates.\n\nSome pollsters and political pundits had predicted that Republican voters would now gravitate toward establishment candidates like Florida Senator Marco Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has been languishing in the polls. Both are seen as stronger on foreign policy than Trump and his main Republican rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, neither of whom have any experience in government and are running as Washington outsiders.\n\nGlenn Matlosz, 71, of Audubon, New Jersey, said Trump would be the most able to address terrorism because he's proven to be a straight talker.\n\n\"He\u2019s telling it as it is,\" said Matlosz, who describes himself as a Democrat. \"He\u2019s not mincing any words. There is no gobbledygook there. Everybody else is squawking.\"\n\nMirroring national primary polls, Clinton and Trump also took the top marks in the Reuters/Ipsos survey when looking at just voters from their own party. Asked to pick the best Democratic candidate, 52 percent of Democrats polled selected Clinton. When Republicans were asked to choose among their potential nominees, 33 percent said Trump.\n\nAfter Trump, Republican voters viewed Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee known for his hawkish views, as the strongest candidate (17 percent) to deal with terrorism. Carson was tied with Bush at around 9 percent.\n\nOf the Republicans polled, 36 percent said they now have more confidence in Trump's ability to be president - the largest show of support in the primary field. Only 10 percent said they were less confident in his abilities following the attacks.\n\nCarson and Rubio were also viewed more favorably as potential presidents by Republicans in the poll. Bush, however, got no immediate bump in confidence of his ability to be president. And only 8 percent of Republicans polled thought he would be the best leader to address terrorism.\n\n\"LET'S GO BOMB ISIS\"\n\nRepublican strategist Steve Schmidt said voters respond to candidates they perceive as taking a tough stance and aren't necessarily looking at their biographies.\n\n\u201cSure, if Colin Powell was running, it would benefit him. Or if David Petraeus was a candidate, it would benefit him,\" he said, referring to the two retired army generals. \"But which of these candidates has an actual plan as opposed to piecemeal tactical solutions or platitudes?\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cSo they default to the guy who with the most conviction says, \u2018I\u2019m going to bomb the shit out of them,\u2019 Mr. Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump has argued he would take the fight directly to ISIS by bombing oil fields that are occupied by the group. He has opposed bringing Syrian refugees to the United States and argued for building camps where they are already located.\n\n\u201cEverybody else keeps talking about what should\u2019ve been done and what could\u2019ve been done, instead of their opinion of what they would do now,\u201d said Trump supporter Mildred Borden, 58, of Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump is talking broadly about his approach instead of bogging voters down with details, said Republican strategist John Feehery.\n\n\"He's the one who is speaking in the simplest language that is most understandable to the average voter,\" Feehery said. \"He\u2019s not talking about 'no-fly' zones. He\u2019s not getting into policy. He\u2019s talking about, 'Lets go kill ISIS.'\"\n\nThe poll has a credibility interval of 3.4 percentage points for all voters. When looking at just Democrats or Republicans, the poll has a credibility interval of about 5.4 percentage points.\n\n(Additional reporting by Chris Kahn in New York and Emily Stephenson and Alana Wise in Washington, editing by Ross Colvin)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American voters are evenly split between Republican presidentia", "title": "Exclusive: After Paris, Americans view Trump, Clinton as best able to tackle terrorism - poll", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/17/Exclusive-After-Paris-Americans-see-Trump-Clinton-most-able-address-terrorism", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/17/Exclusive-After-Paris-Americans-see-Trump-Clinton-most-able-address-terrorism", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American voters are evenly split between Republican presidentia", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "After Trump, Republican voters viewed Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee known for his hawkish views, as the strongest candidate (17 percent) to deal with terrorism.\nHe\u2019s talking about, 'Lets go kill ISIS.'\"\nWhen looking at just Democrats or Republicans, the poll has a credibility interval of about 5.4 percentage points.\nSome pollsters and political pundits had predicted that Republican voters would now gravitate toward establishment candidates like Florida Senator Marco Rubio and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who has been languishing in the polls.\nTrump is talking broadly about his approach instead of bogging voters down with details, said Republican strategist John Feehery."}
