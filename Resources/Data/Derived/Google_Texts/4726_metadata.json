(For uncovered children, the tax penalty is $165 per child.) However, by enrolling in the California Coverage plan, California residents can save up to several hundred dollars per year, and thus mitigate their tax penalties, by receiving advanced premium tax credit from the IRS every month to help lower their health insurance.\n\nAccording to Deputy Director of Communications and Public Relations, Dana Howard, all tax credits are income-based, meaning that those with a lower income may qualify for more tax credits under the new plan. California residents with very low incomes, such as under $17,000 per year, may also meet the requirements for low-cost or no-cost Medi-Cal benefits. Under the plan, applicants will be eligible for insurance with name-brand companies such as Anthem, Blue Shield, and Kaiser.\n\nThose interested in enrolling in the new program should visit www.coverageca.com before the April 30 deadline. From the website, visitors can click on the \u201cGet Help Find Answers\u201d tab, where they will be given the option to enter their zip code to find local health agencies offering assistance with the process. There is no cost to enroll. Those interested in enrolling without the help of a certified enroller or insurance agent can do so using the coveredca.com website, but must check the box that says, \u201cJust found out about tax penalty.\u201d\n\nApril 30, 2015 will be the final deadline to sign up. Late applications will only be accepted by applicants who have experienced some life-changing event (ie: marriage, moving into a new home, having a child, etc.) after the regular February 15 open enrollment deadline.\n\nMore information can be found at www.coverageca.com, or by calling 1 (800) 300-1506.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Uninsured California Residents Will Get A \u201cSecond Chance\u201d To Apply For Coverage.", "title": "Covered California Deadline Extended"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "Uninsured California Residents Will Get A \u201cSecond Chance\u201d To Apply For Coverage.", "title": "Covered California Deadline Extended"}, "article_summary": "Covered California, the state\u2019s health benefit exchange, has issued an extension \u2013 or a \u201cspecial enrollment period\u201d\u2014 for California residents who did not sign up for health insurance in February before this year\u2019s tax deadline.\nCalifornia residents with very low incomes, such as under $17,000 per year, may also meet the requirements for low-cost or no-cost Medi-Cal benefits.\nHowever, by enrolling in the California Coverage plan, California residents can save up to several hundred dollars per year, and thus mitigate their tax penalties, by receiving advanced premium tax credit from the IRS every month to help lower their health insurance.\nThose interested in enrolling in the new program should visit www.coverageca.com before the April 30 deadline.\nUnder the plan, applicants will be eligible for insurance with name-brand companies such as Anthem, Blue Shield, and Kaiser."}
