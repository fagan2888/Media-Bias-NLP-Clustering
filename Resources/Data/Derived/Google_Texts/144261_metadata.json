The second reading scheduled for Friday will be immediately followed by a formal vote. An affirmative vote is widely expected.\n\nRight-to-Work Set to Take Root in Additional Counties\n\nOther counties in Kentucky already are following suit. On Monday, the Fulton County Fiscal Court voted unanimously in favor of a right-to-work ordinance as did the Simpson County Fiscal Court on Tuesday. Both votes were on first readings. Second readings will take place Dec. 29 in Fulton County and Dec. 30 in Simpson County.\n\nBeing without right-to-work status puts Kentucky at a \u201ccompetitive disadvantage\u201d that often results in \u201clost business opportunities,\u201d Mike Buchanon, the Warren County judge-executive, told The Daily Signal in an interview.\n\nBuchanon said \u201csite-selectors\u201d who are hired by companies to identify places to build factories and other workplaces have told him right-to-work was a critical factor in determining which regions and states receive new economic development.\n\nKentucky Is the Odd State Out\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been losing out to Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and now Indiana and Michigan,\u201d he said. \u201cWho would have thought that Indiana and Michigan would become right-to-work states before Kentucky? I felt like time had passed us by, which is why we had to act at the local level.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been losing out to Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and now Indiana and Michigan,\u201d says one Kentucky right-to-work supporter.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have tried to enact this reform at the state level without success. And since Democrats retained the majority in the Kentucky House of Representatives in November\u2019s elections, it will be at least two more years before the legislation would have a chance in Frankfurt.\n\nWhich is why local lawmakers took matters into their own hands.\n\n\u201cThe unions have such a stranglehold on certain segments of the political spectrum once you get up to high office holders, and they don\u2019t want to be at odds with the unions,\u201d said Jim Henderson, the Republican judge-executive in Simpson County. \u201cThey can be very vocal and persuasive at election time. But the story is different at the local level.\u201d\n\nIndeed, all the magistrates in Simpson and Fulton counties who were part of the unanimous votes in favor of right to work are Democrats. In Warren County, two Democratic magistrates joined with two Republican magistrates, and with Buchanon, who also is Republican, to pass the first reading.\n\nThe \u201cbroad, bipartisan support\u201d for right to work evident at the local level is motivated in part by the need to become \u201cmore competitive,\u201d Henderson suggested.\n\n\u201cMy county sits across the border from Tennessee and people in both parties understand that we are losing out on business opportunities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a strong manufacturing base and a lot to offer, but Tennessee is right to work and we are not.\u201d\n\nUnions to Challenge Legality of Local Ordinances?\n\nBut do counties have the legal authority to advance right-to-work laws in the absence of state-level legislation?\n\nEldon Renaud, president of United Auto Workers Local 2164, does not think so.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that this can only be done through state law,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are two court cases invalidating local right-to-work laws that back up Renaud. They are Kentucky State AFL-CIO v. Puckett, decided by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, and New Mexico Federation of Labor v. Clovis, decided by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico.\n\nBut Jason Nemes, an attorney in Louisville who is coordinating the legal defense of the ordinances, says Section 14B of the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act allows states to delegate the authority to pass right-to-work laws through \u201chome rule\u201d to their political subdivisions such as counties.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court had said numerous times that local ordinances are included when a federal statute says state law, unless otherwise expressed by Congress,\u201d Nemes told The Daily Signal in an email. \u201cThis is because counties derive their authority and actual existence from the state\u2019s sovereignty and have been established by the state to help govern the state. This is particularly true in states like Kentucky, where the state legislature has delegated significant authority to counties by enacting what is known as \u201chome rule\u201d statutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the people pushing this are doing this for working people,\u201d Renaud said. \u201cThey just want to destroy unions.\u201d\n\nHenderson, the Simpson County judge-executive, disagrees.\n\n\u201cThe fastest growing union activity is in right-to-work states,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this is not anti-union, it\u2019s about giving people a choice. They can certainly join the union if they want to, but it should not be a requirement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we are seeing in response to the action in Warren County is very encouraging from a right-to-work perspective,\u201d said James Sherk, senior policy analyst in labor economics for The Heritage Foundation.\n\n\u201cThis is now cascading into other parts of the state, and I expect that these local initiatives will continue to gain momentum,\u201d Sherk added. \u201cThose counties in Kentucky that are not right to work will begin to feel pressure not just from neighboring states but from neighboring counties inside the state. Local officials have a strong self interest in improving their competitive position and this is one way to do it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kentucky is still not a right-to-work state, but one of its counties soon may be.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Kentucky is still not a right-to-work state, but one of its counties soon may be.", "title": "Counties on Verge of Bringing Right-to-Work Laws to Kentucky", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141217_RightToWork.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-18T12:47:29+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yZ7G3X"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Kentucky is still not a right-to-work state, but one of its counties soon may be.", "title": "Counties on Verge of Bringing Right-to-Work Laws to Kentucky", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141217_RightToWork.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2014-12-18T03:01:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-18T12:47:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "right-to-work, union, right-to-work states, kentucky, ky, right-to-work laws"}, "article_summary": "Kentucky is not a right-to-work state, but one of its counties soon may be.\n\u201cWho would have thought that Indiana and Michigan would become right-to-work states before Kentucky?\nRight-to-Work Set to Take Root in Additional CountiesOther counties in Kentucky already are following suit.\nOn Monday, the Fulton County Fiscal Court voted unanimously in favor of a right-to-work ordinance as did the Simpson County Fiscal Court on Tuesday.\nSecond readings will take place Dec. 29 in Fulton County and Dec. 30 in Simpson County."}
