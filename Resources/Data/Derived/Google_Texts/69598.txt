Colorado State Sen. Kevin Grantham and Colorado State Rep. Jim Wilson enjoy reporting back to their constituents, but a big part of the town hall-style meetings is hearing what their people want the politicians doing.

Nearly 30 people gathered at City Hall on Saturday for the first of this year's Legislative Hour sessions.

Grantham said he gets feedback in all sorts of ways from his constituents including phone calls and emails, but what he enjoys about events such as Saturday's Legislative Hour is the face to face dialogue.

"It's good to hear that feedback because I know what I was elected to do, and I know the principles I was elected on," Grantham said before the one-hour event that was moderated by Preston Troutman.

"It's critical," Grantham added. "We're citizen legislators, and we take our marching orders from our citizens here in District 2 and District 60.

Grantham represents Senate District 2, which covers Fremont, Teller, Park, Clear Creek and southern and rural El Paso counties. Wilson represents District 60 and covers Fremont, Custer, Chaffee and Park counties.

Colorado State Rep. Clarice Navarro-Ratzlaff was scheduled to be at the Legislative Hour but had other things come up.

"The bonus on these meetings is you actually get to see the people face to face," Wilson added. "As you well know, in this era of social media, you don't always understand what people are saying because there's no tenor or inflection with the messages. When you meet with them face to face, you can actually see what their emotional state is as well as what the emphasis is that they have on their concerns."
