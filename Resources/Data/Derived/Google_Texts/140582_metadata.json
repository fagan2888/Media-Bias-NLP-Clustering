However, he added, it is \u201calarming\u201d to see that the number of health plan options continue to shrink.\n\nAccording to an ACRH report, the number of insurers on the federal marketplace decreased from seven to two or three in 13 of the state\u2019s counties between 2014 and 2015. Pima and Maricopa counties also saw a dip in health insurers from 10 to eight during the same time span.\n\nWhenever consumers have fewer options, Derksen said, it drives up premium prices and may deter them from enrolling in the ACA marketplace.\n\nACRH attempts to assist residents with navigating the federal marketplace by sending out staff members to rural communities during the enrollment period. Latinos and Native Americans are still highly uninsured in Arizona, Derksen said, and are priority populations for ACRH.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nDispatch Staff Writer Kevin Reagan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "arizona_news", "og": {"url": "http://www.trivalleycentral.com/casa_grande_dispatch/arizona_news/large-insurer-plans-to-leave-marketplace/article_4da157fa-07d9-11e6-84e4-ff36e5c58d0c.html", "site_name": "trivalleycentral.com", "type": "article", "description": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 One of Arizona\u2019s largest health care insurers is leaving the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act marketplace, a move that will reduce or eliminate options in rural counties.", "title": "Large insurer plans to leave marketplace"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "<266179467961>", "app_id": 266179467961}, "keywords": "arizona_news", "google-site-verification": "pnob7A_ZlKDY1isdeDLyU6W1kqaqdp1JUZJ3eDCa61w", "description": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 One of Arizona\u2019s largest health care insurers is leaving the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act marketplace, a move that will reduce or eliminate options in rural counties."}, "article_summary": "The exit of both companies could leave residents in some rural counties without a way to get subsidized health insurance.\nUnitedHealthcare told state officials that it won\u2019t sell individual plans to residents next year, the Arizona Republic reported.\nPima and Maricopa counties also saw a dip in health insurers from 10 to eight during the same time span.\n\u201cMy concern is that rural Arizona is left with too few choices,\u201d said Kim VanPelt of Vitalyst Health Foundation.\nPHOENIX (AP) \u2014 One of Arizona\u2019s largest health care insurers is leaving the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act marketplace, a move that will reduce or eliminate options in rural counties."}
