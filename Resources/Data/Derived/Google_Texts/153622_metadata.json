He\u2019s now on the 40-man roster and all indications are that he will break camp on the 25-man roster.\n\nTo make room for Axford, the club placed placed right-handed pitcher Tyler Chatwood on the 60-day disabled list. Chatwood is rehabbing from Tommy John elbow surgery he underwent last July.\n\nAxford, 31, signed a minor-league deal Feb. 2 after splitting time between Cleveland and Pittsburgh in 2014. He made 62 appearances last season and went 2-4 with 10 saves and a 3.95 ERA.\n\nThe former closer chose Colorado because he saw an opportunity to pitch with the game on the line.\n\n\u201cI had opportunities elsewhere, but the Rockies were the team I chose, because I think I can play a big role here,\u201d Axford said early in spring training.\n\nAxford notched nine saves in 10 opportunities with the Indians through May 3 last season. Then he ran into trouble because of an ugly combination of walks followed by home runs.\n\nChatwood, who is in camp and working out, said he\u2019s aiming to be back this summer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure, but I would expect to pitch sometime this year,\u201d he said last week. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of up to the (Rockies) as far as how fast I progress.\u201d\n\nChatwood went 8-5 (3.15 ERA) in 2013 and was pegged as a middle-of-the-rotation starter last spring. But he pitched just four games before injuring his arm.\n\nWith spring training underway, he\u2019s taking it slow getting his arm back in shape under a strict rehab plan.\n\n\u201cNo problems at all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s a slow process.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies add John Axford to roster, place Tyler Chatwood on 60-day DL", "title": "Rockies add John Axford to roster, place Tyler Chatwood on 60-day DL", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/01/rockies-add-john-axford-to-roster-place-tyler-chatwood-on-60-day-dl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150301__john-axfordp1.jpg", "height": 464}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150301__john-axfordp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-01T10:52:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T01:21:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "To make room for Axford, the club placed placed right-handed pitcher Tyler Chatwood on the 60-day disabled list.\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 Right-handed reliever John Axford and his $2.6 million contract have been selected by the Rockies.\nHe\u2019s now on the 40-man roster and all indications are that he will break camp on the 25-man roster.\nWith spring training underway, he\u2019s taking it slow getting his arm back in shape under a strict rehab plan.\nHe made 62 appearances last season and went 2-4 with 10 saves and a 3.95 ERA."}
