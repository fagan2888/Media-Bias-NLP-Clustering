Since then, the bones had been the subject of empirical study until local tribes requested the bones be returned.\n\nScience writer Carl Zimmer notes that tribes went to court in 2006 to have the skeletons returned.\n\nSeveral scientists sued to have control over the bones, but lost their battle on two fronts: a district court rejected their claims in 2012, and a federal court upheld the decision to repatriate the skeletons to tribes in 2014.\n\nIn January 2016, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case, thus upholding the lower court decision that would allow the bones to return home.\n\nWhat makes the case doubly significant is that Kennewick Man, the ancient skeleton discovered in the Northwest Pacific in 1996, has yet to be repatriated to tribes despite the finding in 2015 that The Ancient One\u2019s DNA matches that of Colville tribal members\u2019.\n\nThe scientific discovery of the DNA match, covered widely in the popular press on the heels of the April report in Nature\u2014one of science\u2019s most prized journals\u2014has armed American Indian tribes with the empirical gravitas to make a claim for the return of ancestors.\n\nThe new data, in concert with the 1990 Federal law that enables the return of artifacts and human remains to tribes (the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) should empower Native Americans to invoke their sovereignty, which affords tribes dominion over their property, laws, values, mores and customs.\n\nYet some scientists continue to up-end NAGPRA by claiming their interests trump those of the tribes.\n\nOne of the professors who challenged the court\u2019s initial decision to return the bones to tribes said: \u201cTo have them [the two skeletons] slip through our fingers this way is a tremendous loss for science.\u201d\n\nSimilarly the lawyer representing the scientists responded to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to refuse to hear the case by calling the judgment a \u201ctragedy and a disgrace\u2014a tragedy for science, and a disgrace for the court.\u201d\n\nIronically news consumers need to dig for viewpoints from Indian perspectives, and few reporters explain to readers that federally recognized tribes are sovereign nations: they signed treaties with representatives of the United States that their rights and freedoms, and cultures and traditions, would be honored and protected by laws.\n\nBut when perspectives come to loggerheads over discovery of ancient bones\u2014when Indian knowledge systems meet Western knowledge systems\u2014then tribal views are diminished in favor of mainstream values.\n\nAnd scientific pursuits are valued by politicians, courts and mainstream press over Indian concerns.\n\nIn the case of Kennewick Man\u2019s bones, the Umatilla spokesman\u2014Armand Minthorn\u2014told the press repeatedly that cultural tradition requires that the skeleton be returned to the earth.\n\nSuch views are marginalized as quaint or silly: hardly salutary when compared with the needs of Scientific Progress.\n\nBut when the argument plays out in terms of sovereignty and self-determination, the contention over ancient bones becomes a political one.\n\nSo it\u2019s not about which viewpoints are more rational or empirical; rather, the argument centers on who gets to make decisions about the provenance of ancient remains.\n\nAnd since legislation has been in place for 26 years to return found and stolen objects to tribal governments, it make sense that Native Americans\u2014not Western scientists\u2014should determine how best to manage their artifacts.\n\nCynthia-Lou Coleman Emery, PhD [https://www.pdx.edu/communication/cynthia-lou-coleman-0] is a professor and researcher at Portland State University, where she teaches and studies science communication, particularly issues that impact American Indians.
