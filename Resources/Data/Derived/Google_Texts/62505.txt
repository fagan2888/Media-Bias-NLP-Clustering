PA-9: Shuster Releases First Ad Of 2016 (VIDEO)

Written by Kerry Rugenstein, Contributing Writer

Congressman Bill Shuster has released his first TV ad for the 2016 election cycle.

The thirty-second spot, which is titled “Shuster Fights” and is airing throughout the district, focuses on Shuster’s opposition to Obamacare, abortion, amnesty and the EPA’s regulatory position on coal.

The commercial asserts that Shuster’s positions on these issues are the same as conservative darlings like Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, Sarah Palin and Ben Carson.

“I am honored to represent central and southwestern Pennsylvania, a region I have called home my entire life, and I am asking the voters of these communities for their support this year,” Congressman Shuster said in a statement attached to the ad. “The fight for our shared conservative values has not been easy and while I’ve led the way on major conservative initiatives, I am confident with a new Republican president and a strong Republican majority in Congress, we can continue implementing real reform needed to get our country back on track.”

Last week Shuster’s opponent, Art Halvorson, called for the Congressman’s resignation when Politico reported his close ties to the airline lobby. Shuster’s campaign responded by stating that the report was “nothing more than a political stunt from a candidate desperate to make news.”

The 9th Congressional District consists of all or parts of Bedford, Blair, Cambria, Fayette, Franklin, Fulton, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland Counties.

The primary election will be held on April 26th.
