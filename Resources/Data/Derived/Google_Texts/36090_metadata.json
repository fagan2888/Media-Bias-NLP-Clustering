The Cavaliers\u2019 opener brought encouraging signs from a player Bennett is counting on to support those two.\n\nCenter Mike Tobey had 15 points and eight rebounds and the No. 6 Cavaliers shook off early shooting problems to beat Morgan State, 86-48, on Friday night.\n\n\u201cHe looks a little stronger and a little more explosive,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHe made some nice up-and-unders. He showed good hands on the catch, so that was good to see.\u201d\n\nThe 7-foot Tobey took full advantage of the five inches he had on Morgan State big men Kyle Thomas and Phillip Carr. He converted a pair of second-half putbacks during a 17-0 run coming out of the halftime break that put the injury-ravaged, outmanned Bears away.\n\n\u201cI knew that size was going to be a factor,\u201d Morgan State coach Todd Bozeman said. \u201cI\u2019m not telling you that if we\u2019d had all those guys we\u2019d have come down here and beat them. I knew that we were overmatched.\u201d\n\nThe Cavaliers missed 12 of their first 13 shots before pulling away with a 24-9 run at the end the first half, and a 17-0 burst at the start of the second. Devon Hall added 13 points, and Gill and Darius Thompson had 12 points each.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really remember all the misses, but I do remember the makes,\u201d Gill said. \u201cWe just kept fighting until we could put the ball in the bucket.\u201d\n\nThomas led Morgan State with 14 points. The Bears trailed just 16-14 before Tobey kicked off the Cavaliers\u2019 decisive run with a layup and a dunk.\n\nThompson got the start at guard in his first game at Virginia after transferring from Tennessee. Thompson and Gill, previously of South Carolina, give the Cavaliers two SEC transfers in their starting lineup.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tobey added 15 rebounds and took advantage of size mismatches inside all night as Virginia opened its season on Friday with an 86-48 victory over Morgan State.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Tobey added 15 rebounds and took advantage of size mismatches inside all night as Virginia opened its season on Friday with an 86-48 victory over Morgan State.", "title": "Mike Tobey scores 15 points, helps No. 6 Virginia hammer Morgan State in opener", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/14/mike-tobey-virginia-morgan-state/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/14/AP_591192918761.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/14/AP_591192918761.jpg", "description": "Tobey added 15 rebounds and took advantage of size mismatches inside all night as Virginia opened its season on Friday with an 86-48 victory over Morgan State.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mike Tobey scores 15 points, helps No. 6 Virginia hammer Morgan State"}, "Author": "Chip Knighton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Mike Tobey, Anthony Gill"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe just kept fighting until we could put the ball in the bucket.\u201dThomas led Morgan State with 14 points.\n\u201cI knew that size was going to be a factor,\u201d Morgan State coach Todd Bozeman said.\n6 Cavaliers shook off early shooting problems to beat Morgan State, 86-48, on Friday night.\nCenter Mike Tobey had 15 points and eight rebounds and the No.\nDevon Hall added 13 points, and Gill and Darius Thompson had 12 points each."}
