The bill then sets forth how that negotiation is to take place and forces the doc to accept payment that is \u201cthe greater of the following\u201d (or as it says in Obamacare, \u201cequal to the greatest of the three amounts\u201d).\n\nHere are the three ways Trujillo\u2019s Straight-Outta-Obamacare bill sets forth how the doctor is to be paid by the insurance provider:\n\nThe first way is on line 41 of HB 221: \u201cThe amount negotiated with a provider\u2026reduced only by any coinsurance amount or copayment\u2026\u201d\n\nThis language comes from Obamacare, which reads: \u201cThe amount negotiated with in-network providers\u2026excluding any in-network copayment or coinsurance.\u201d\n\nNearly the same words, with the exact same effect.\n\nThe second one (line 44 of HB 221) reads, \u201cThe usual and customary reimbursement\u2026reduced only by any coinsurance amount or copayment that applies to the provider;\u201d\n\nObamacare reads: \u201cthe usual, customary and reasonable amount\u2026reduced by the in-network copayment or coinsurance\u2026\u201d\n\nAgain, similar words,with the exact same effect.\n\nAnd the third (line 48 of HB 221) reads: \u201cThe amount that would be paid under Medicare for the service, reduced only by any coinsurance amount or copayment that applies to the provider.\u201d\n\nAnd Obamacare? \u201cThe amount that would be paid under Medicare \u2026 for the emergency service, excluding any in-network copayment or coinsurance imposed with respect to the participant or beneficiary.\u201d\n\nClose enough, as they say, for government work.\n\nIn short, House Bill 221 tracks the language of the balance billing section of Obamacare.\n\nSeeing the word-for-word language makes it hard to conclude anything other than the fact a whole bunch of lawmakers are going to be asked to vote for a bill that is taken right from a law that many of those same lawmakers have spent the last five years railing against.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Carlos Trujillo\u2019s attempt to fix balance billing (HB 221 \u2013 Health Insurance Coverage for Emergency Services) is LITERALLY lifted from the federal law commonly referred to as \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 or as some Republicans have called it, \u201cThe end of the world as we know it.\u201d To be fair, sometimes Trujillo\u2019s bill tracks the federal law \u2026", "title": "Carlos Trujillo\u2019s balance billing: Straight Outta Obamacare - Florida Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1974, "identifier": "http://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/trujillo-carlos.jpg", "height": 1650}, "updated_time": "2015-10-20T18:10:22-04:00", "url": "http://floridapolitics.com/archives/192847-carlos-trujillos-balance-billing-straight-outta-obamacare", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/flpolitics", "section": "Peter", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-10-20T14:30:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T18:10:22-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1643817879175164}, "twitter": {"description": "Carlos Trujillo\u2019s attempt to fix balance billing (HB 221 \u2013 Health Insurance Coverage for Emergency Services) is LITERALLY lifted from the federal law commonly referred to as \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 or as some Republicans have called it, \u201cThe end of the world as we know it.\u201d To be fair, sometimes Trujillo\u2019s bill tracks the federal law [\u2026]", "creator": "@Fla_Pol", "image": "http://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/trujillo-carlos.jpg", "title": "Carlos Trujillo\u2019s balance billing: Straight Outta Obamacare - Florida Politics", "site": "@Fla_Pol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In short, House Bill 221 tracks the language of the balance billing section of Obamacare.\nTrujillo\u2019s bill basically says that in an emergency situation, a doctor, who is required by law to provide the service, cannot seek payment from the patient but must instead go on bended knee to the insurer.\nAnd the third (line 48 of HB 221) reads: \u201cThe amount that would be paid under Medicare for the service, reduced only by any coinsurance amount or copayment that applies to the provider.\u201dAnd Obamacare?\n\u201cThe amount that would be paid under Medicare \u2026 for the emergency service, excluding any in-network copayment or coinsurance imposed with respect to the participant or beneficiary.\u201dClose enough, as they say, for government work.\nThe second one (line 44 of HB 221) reads, \u201cThe usual and customary reimbursement\u2026reduced only by any coinsurance amount or copayment that applies to the provider;\u201dObamacare reads: \u201cthe usual, customary and reasonable amount\u2026reduced by the in-network copayment or coinsurance\u2026\u201dAgain, similar words,with the exact same effect."}
