The few moderates left seem to be losing any control they once had of the platform or direction of the party.\n\nThat makes it difficult to convince people in places like Massachusetts to even consider electing a Republican. Take the case of congressional candidate Richard Tisei who is being touted as a moderate gay Republican who can change the party from within. The facts challenge that assumption. When he ran on a ticket for lieutenant governor with Charlie Baker who claimed to be a moderate, he couldn\u2019t even get him to support basic equality for the transgender community. The Blue Mass group said, \u201cIf he can\u2019t convince his own running mate in Massachusetts to be less extreme, how in the world will he convince Republicans from conservative states to be less extreme on gay rights or any other issue?\u201d\n\nAnother problem with electing someone like Tisei to Congress is that his first vote would be for Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) as House Speaker \u2014 the same speaker who has blocked ENDA since the Senate passed it last year.\n\nThis week, we will be treated to the annual spectacle of the Conservative Political Action Conference, a place where the most outrageous Republicans are invited to spew their venom to the party faithful. In the past the conference has hosted the likes of irrelevant figures like Donald Trump and Ann Coulter. This year promises to bring more of the same; the intellectual giant Sarah Palin will be there.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and embattled New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will be two of the big draws. I understand they were excited to invite and get an acceptance from Christie before he got entangled in Bridgegate. It will be interesting to see how far right Christie will go to attract the GOP faithful. They forced Mitt Romney far enough right in the last election to ensure a loss to President Obama. Huckabee, on the other hand, already has just the kind of far-right cred they love.\n\nThen CPAC attendees will surely hear from Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.). This is the same Ryan who ran as Romney\u2019s running mate and managed to gain a reputation as someone who had a few problems telling the truth. He recently spoke about the budget he is preparing for the Republican House, which will question all the programs meant to help those in need, the safety net programs like Medicare, food stamps, Head Start etc. Democrats wait with baited breath to see if his solution is simply to cut these programs or to legitimately improve them.\n\nCPAC attendees will also get to hear from that Joseph McCarthy-like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ken.). They will also get another chance to hear from right-wing Johns Hopkins retired surgeon turned Fox News commentator Dr. Ben Carson. This is the same Carson forced to withdraw as the Johns Hopkins commencement speaker after he compared gay marriage to bestiality and pedophilia. He attacked the Affordable Care Act as socialism by quoting Lenin: \u201cLenin thought so. He declared: \u2018Socialized medicine is the keystone to the arch of the Socialized State.'\u201d Carson apparently took that quote from a brochure attacking Harry Truman for his attempt to get everyone medical insurance and some have disputed that Lenin ever said it.\n\nDemocrats aren\u2019t perfect and there are Blue Dog Democrats whose voting records clearly don\u2019t match the Democratic Party platform. The difference is those Democrats don\u2019t control the party and they vote for a leadership team that is progressive and favors ensuring the human and civil rights of all people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week, we will be treated to the annual spectacle of CPAC, a place where the most outrageous Republicans are invited to spew their venom.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "This week, we will be treated to the annual spectacle of CPAC, a place where the most outrageous Republicans are invited to spew their venom.", "title": "Opinion | Republicans continue to self-destruct | CPAC | gay news", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 404, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2010/02/Ann_Coulter_thumb_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 404}, "updated_time": "2014-03-04T16:29:10-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/03/04/republicans-continue-self-destruct/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This week, we will be treated to the annual spectacle of CPAC, a place where the most outrageous Republicans are invited to spew their venom.", "creator": "@WashBlade", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2010/02/Ann_Coulter_thumb_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "Opinion | Republicans continue to self-destruct | CPAC | gay news", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "Opinions", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2014-03-04T16:45:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-04T16:29:10-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, Ben Carson, Blue Mass, Charlie Baker, Chris Christie, Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, ENDA, gay, GOP"}, "article_summary": "He attacked the Affordable Care Act as socialism by quoting Lenin: \u201cLenin thought so.\nThere is a certain Schadenfraude when I hear Republicans say things that are sure to quicken the downward spiral of the national Republican Party.\nTake the case of congressional candidate Richard Tisei who is being touted as a moderate gay Republican who can change the party from within.\nDemocrats aren\u2019t perfect and there are Blue Dog Democrats whose voting records clearly don\u2019t match the Democratic Party platform.\nThe few moderates left seem to be losing any control they once had of the platform or direction of the party."}
