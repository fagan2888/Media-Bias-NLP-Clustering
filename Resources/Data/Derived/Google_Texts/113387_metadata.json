Or is he just a nicer version of Ted Cruz?\n\nIn its short history, the Tea Party has offered its own response to the president\u2019s State of the Union address with a colorful cast of characters: Rep. Michele Bachman\u2019s (R-Minn.) deer-in-the-headlights production in 2011 became rich fodder for late night comedians; she was followed in 2012 by the inimitable pizza CEO Herman Cain and last year by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has since moved in a more mainstream direction as he gears up for a possible presidential run. In contrast, this year\u2019s Tea Party representative, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah)\u2014a mild-mannered Mormon Eagle Scout whose father served in the Reagan administration\u2014seems a sensible choice: The insurgent right appears to be developing some self-awareness that its message demands a better messenger.\n\nThat has become clear over the past several months. After more and more establishment Republicans criticized the Tea Party\u2019s eagle-eyed anti-Obamacare agenda for holding the rest of the GOP hostage, the Republican insurgents then saw their strategy backfire in the government shutdown last fall, with the Tea Party\u2019s unfavorability rating rising to 49 percent in October. The face of that insurgency and the march to a shutdown was the firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who, ever since riding into the upper body in the 2012 election, has bucked the leadership in both houses, memorably speaking for more than 21 hours on the Senate floor about the push to defund the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz\u2019s bomb-throwing has met a palpable backlash in the press and among the Republican Party establishment\u2014and has handicapped his chances as a viable national candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s always the wacko birds on the right and the left that get the media megaphone,\u201d Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) famously said last year, referring to Cruz, among others. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for Republican leaders around the country to speak out against him,\u201d said Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.). I\u2019d venture that Cruz was probably considered for the response speech Tuesday night, though he appears to have been relegated to finding free media on the Sunday shows.\n\nEnter Mike Lee, the low-key Utahan whose rhetorical style and demeanor are notably more mannered\u2014a nicer version of Ted Cruz, perhaps. On all of the most pressing issues in Congress\u2014budgetary policy, taxation, foreign relations (read: Benghazi) and the overall role of government\u2014Lee has stood shoulder to shoulder with Cruz and the Tea Party, denouncing Obamacare, resisting a debt-ceiling increase, calling for a restrained foreign policy and forcing the government shutdown. Rhetorically, however, Lee presents a study in contrast. He has not jumped for sound-bite attention, and his name recognition is low (not to mention that he comes from a state wholly without the obvious electoral-vote pull of Cruz\u2019s Texas).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: In style, if not substance, the senator takes a different tack from his firebrand peers.", "title": "Can Mike Lee Save the Tea Party?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/mike-lee-tea-party-102684.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/27/140127_mike-lee_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "State Of The Union,Tea Party,State Of The Union 2014,Politics,Mike Lee,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: In style, if not substance, the senator takes a different tack from his firebrand peers.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17b8\"", "article_summary": "Politics Can Mike Lee Save the Tea Party?\nEnter Mike Lee, the low-key Utahan whose rhetorical style and demeanor are notably more mannered\u2014a nicer version of Ted Cruz, perhaps.\nIn contrast, this year\u2019s Tea Party representative, Sen.
