We\u2019ve all been in a position where everything has felt out of control.\n\nBut forcing an entire population to pay for ideas that really are misguided, while going home feeling smug and self-congratulatory, isn\u2019t helping, and certainly isn\u2019t something to crow about.\n\nAnd the defense of these programs can be pretty vicious, including calling naysayers anti-Christian, racist, anti-women, anti-children, etc., you\u2019ve heard those kinds of things, I\u2019m sure.\n\nThe one argument that has had me most fascinated was the one where the anti-Christian crowd had the audacity to use the Bible as a basis for defense of welfare programs. The hypocrisy of a group of people largely responsible for the removal of prayer from schools, the Decalogue from county courthouse lawns and any mention of deities (except for Allah, for some reason) lecturing Christians on proper Christian behavior is jaw-dropping, to say the least.\n\nBut here, as with most liberal programs, is where I ask the questions I always ask when the government is involved:\n\nWhat\u2019s the end game?\n\nWhy is the government the only entity capable of administering social aid programs?\n\nTaking the last question first, it could be said that the government has the capability to build infrastructure quickly, and administer the program in a fair manner, since it really doesn\u2019t have a dog in the fight.\n\nBut that argument flies in the face of the Constitution, which, other than saying in its preamble and the taxing and spending clause about providing for the general welfare, doesn\u2019t grant specifically the right to administer welfare programs \u2014 and that includes things like Medicaid, Medicare, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThere can be really wild interpretations of what general welfare means, but in and of itself, that while these programs are available to everyone, only the people that qualify can make use of them. To my mind, that doesn\u2019t really qualify as general, but is really targeted at a specific body of people.\n\nDuring the debates for the ACA, in fact, the thing most discussed was the 30 million citizens who did not have medical insurance. That, then, was the target, and that is not general; it\u2019s 1/10 of the population of the country, which is a pretty specific number.\n\nAnd then, what happens after that? Do we suppose that there\u2019s no chance of ever getting out from under this program once you\u2019ve enrolled? Then is that what we do now, enroll people into government programs for life?\n\nWhich is why I ask the other question. How do we transition the people we help into becoming self-sufficient?\n\nI suspect the answer is we don\u2019t, because once you\u2019ve joined, you\u2019ve joined for life.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t live with a government that looks to entrap me like that.
