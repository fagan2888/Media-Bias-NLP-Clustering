Now, it appears as though the Obama administration finally is listening to the health insurance industry.\n\nSince its implementation in 2003, the MA program--introduced to increase competition--has taken some significant blows in the form of proposed cuts to the program, as politicians claim the program pays too much to insurers, reported the Hill.\n\nMedicare Advantage good for business\n\nInsurers continue to fight for the program--for instance, by making $28 million in federal campaign contributions across the 2012 and 2014 cycles--because it's good for their business. Humana, for example, receives about two-thirds of its revenue from the program, noted the article. Following this week's MA rate announcement, Humana shares rose about 1 percent to $180 in after-hours trading, FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\n\nAdditionally, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) has launched lobbying campaigns each time the administration proposed Medicare Advangate cuts. AHIP argues that cuts to the program would negatively impact seniors. The administration has not been immune to this lobbying effort, the Hill said.\n\nThe Medicare Rights Center released a statement applauding CMS for \"heeding calls from consumer advocates, pharmacists, case managers, and others to build a better Part D appeals process.\"\n\nPrivate plans help cut government Mediare spending\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was implemented in 2010, government spending for MA beneficiaries was as much as 13 percent higher than for those enrolled in traditional Medicare, FierceHealthPayer previously reported. Now, the federal government spends close to 2 percent more per MA beneficiary\n\nAHIP noted that insurers' bids are 6 percent lower than traditional Medicare, reported the Hill. The difference between the bids and the actual payments is used to provide extra benefits, which proves to be popular among seniors.\n\n\"The finalized policies will continue to strengthen the growing Medicare Advantage program, and continue the successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act's reforms that improve quality and provide greater protections for beneficiaries and value for taxpayers,\" CMS said in the announcement.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the Hill article\n\n- read the Medicare Rights Center statement\n\n- check out the CMS statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCMS increases Medicare Advantage payments, reverses February proposal\n\nCMS proposes slight decrease in Medicare Advantage rates for 2016\n\nMedicare Advantage cuts still in the cards for some insurers", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reversed a February proposal to decrease Medicare Advantage rates by 0.95 percent, announcing this week a 1.25 percent rate increae next year.
