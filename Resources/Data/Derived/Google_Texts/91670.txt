× Colorado health care exchange now has walk-in locations

DENVER — Consumers wanting help renewing their health insurance plans can now get some face-to-face help.

Connect For Health has opened 13 walk-in enrollment centers in 11 cities. New and existing customers can visit the centers to purchase policies and get information during the open enrollment period, which runs through Feb. 15.

Certified brokers will be available to provide free assistance. No appointment is necessary.

Colorado opened its own health care exchange after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.

The centers are located in Adams County, Southeast Denver/Aurora, Colorado Springs, downtown Denver, Fort Collins (2), Grand Junction (2), Greeley, Lafayette, Lakewood, Pueblo, and Wheat Ridge.

“We want to make it easier to choose a health insurance plan, and one of the best ways for us to do that is to meet with customers face to face,” said Chief Marketing Officer Linda Kanamine in a statement. “Brokers, Health Coverage Guides and Connect for Health Colorado teams are working hard to reach Coloradans and assist them where they live.”

Connect for Health announced on Monday that 6,144 people had signed up for health insurance coverage since the open enrollment period began.

That compares to 291 enrollments during the same period last year.
