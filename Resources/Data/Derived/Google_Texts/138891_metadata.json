Larson says the reimbursement rates are too low. KURT MILLER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article \u00bb\n\nThe Riverside Medical Clinics \u00e2\u0080\" with 140 doctors in five offices \u00e2\u0080\" is one of the largest providers of health services in the county. But it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be participating in the new health exchange marketplace called Covered California.\n\nDr. Steven Larson, the CEO, said he was taken aback when he saw what insurance companies were willing to pay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rates were 70 percent of Medicare [reimbursement]. It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t leave room for making a living,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nThe clinics serve 300,000 patients under a variety of plans, including many Medicare patients who are not affected by the new exchanges. But the patients who want their care covered under a health exchange plan will now to have to look elsewhere for a doctor.\n\nLarson wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure how many of the clinics\u00e2\u0080\u0099 patients would be affected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potentially a huge problem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Larson, who also is the chairman of the California Medical Association Board of Trustees.\n\nLarson is not alone by any means. Many physicians around the state are grappling with insurers over participation in Covered California health plans. In some cases they are trying to decide whether to join. In other cases they are finding that they have been dropped from plans. And many are just trying to get information about whether they are listed in an exchange plan or not.\n\nThe struggle has serious implications for consumers who are trying to pick a plan in the exchange that will include their current physician. For uncounted thousands statewide, the answer is, it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\n\nTo get coverage beginning Jan. 1 under Covered California, consumers must sign up by Monday. As the deadline approaches and uncertainty about the breadth of provider networks remains, odds increase that patients will show up for treatment next year thinking they have signed up for a plan with their doctor in it, and find out otherwise.\n\nCovered California maintains that the plans offered through the exchanges include 80 percent of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physicians. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe arrived at the 80 percent by comparing our network to the two largest commercial networks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Covered California spokeswoman Anne Gonzales.\n\nBut physicians and medical society chapters around the state aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t buying it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe plans have no reason to be transparent about networks \u00e2\u0080\" the bigger it looks, the better for them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said California Medical Association President Dr. Richard Thorp. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMany times when we look at their physician directories, they include names of people who have moved out of state, are retired or dead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome physicians have been listed in the exchange after they refused to participate because of the low reimbursement rates.\n\nDOCTOR OUT \u00e2\u0080\" OR IN?\n\nDr. Jennifer Hone, an endocrinologist in Santa Barbara, wanted to see for herself if she was listed among the providers in Covered California, even though the clinic where she works, American Indian Health Services, had opted out of the exchange plans over the reimbursement issue.\n\nWhile on the phone with a reporter, she searched Covered California and found, to her dismay, that her name was erroneously listed as part of the Blue Cross network, and at the wrong address.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think people who signed up in Santa Barbara are frankly getting screwed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hone said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are being told by insurance companies that they can get coverage and that doctors are participating when in fact that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big fat lie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCovered California takes pains to note that the insurers, not the state exchange, are responsible for assembling lists of physicians. Doctors \u00e2\u0080\u009ccontract with plans and the plans submit networks to us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Covered California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gonzales.\n\nA cursory search of doctors listed in current insurance networks compared to exchange plan networks shows dramatic reductions.\n\nIn Riverside County\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 92503 zip code, for example, Anthem Blue Cross currently has 1,460 family and internal medicine doctors in its individual prudent buyer plan. Under its silver plan PPO in the state exchange, it lists 644 providers for the same zip code.\n\nBlue Shield\u00e2\u0080\u0099s database showed a similarly shrunken network of doctors for the 92503 zip code: 1,429 versus 463 for the comparable Covered California plan.\n\nIn Modesto and Santa Barbara zip codes, the differences under Blue Cross were 577 vs. 367 and 257 vs. 87.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "LAURIE UDESKY", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n22ye4-rdoctors1221akfmbinary1352897.jpg", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "HEALTH: Some doctors back away from Obamacare", "author": "LAURIE UDESKY", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "Health Care: HEALTH: Some doctors back away from Obamacare | california, covered, plans, exchange, doctors, plan, health, medical, networks, blue", "title": "HEALTH: Some doctors back away from Obamacare", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/n22ye4-rdoctors1221akfmbinary1352897.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/california-681398-covered-plans.html", "type": "article"}, "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-20 18:35:06", "content_author": "LAURIE UDESKY", "sailthru.title": "HEALTH: Some doctors back away from Obamacare", "sailthru.tags": "news, california, covered, plans, exchange, doctors, plan, health, medical, networks, blue", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/n22ye4-rdoctors1221akfmbinary1352897.jpg", "content_type": "article", "Keywords": "california, covered, plans, exchange, doctors, plan, health, medical, networks, blue", "publication_date": "2013-12-20", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/n22ye4-rdoctors1221akfmbinary1352897.jpg", "Description": "Health Care: HEALTH: Some doctors back away from Obamacare | california, covered, plans, exchange, doctors, plan, health, medical, networks, blue"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd58ee\"", "article_summary": "HEALTH: Some doctors back away from Obamacare Share Pin It 1 of 2 More Galleries Dr. Steven Larson is CEO of Riverside Medical Clinic, which has declined to be part of the California Covered insurance exchange, an outgrowth of Obamacare.\nA cursory search of doctors listed in current insurance networks compared to exchange plan networks shows dramatic reductions.\nBut it won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be participating in the new health exchange marketplace called Covered California.\nBut the patients who want their care covered under a health exchange plan will now to have to look elsewhere for a doctor.\nMany physicians around the state are grappling with insurers over participation in Covered California health plans."}
