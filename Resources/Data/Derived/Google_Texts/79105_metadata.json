(NYSE: REV) has recruited a pair of seasoned retail veterans for the top spots, as the global cosmetics maker sorts out its future. In January, billionaire Ron Perelman, who has controlled Revlon since 1985 through holding company MacAndrews & Forbes Inc., announced the maker of Revlon ColorSilk hair color, Almay color cosmetics, beauty tools, and Mitchum deodorant, would explore \u201cstrategic alternatives,\u201d sparking speculation that company would soon be up for sale. But the additions of Fabian Garcia as CEO and Juan Figuereo as CFO decrease the likelihood that the global cosmetics purveyor is aiming for a sale to a strategic buyer. A turnaround, or a potential take-private deal by a private equity firm seem more likely now.\n\nJuan Figuereo, who has previously held positions at Wal-Mart International (NYSE: WMT) as vice president of mergers and acquisitions, CFO of Newell Rubbermaid (NYSE: NWL); and most recently as executive vice president of NII Holdings, now holds the CFO position at Revlon effective immediately, the company says in an April 12 statement. In March, Fabian Garcia, former chief operating officer of global innovation and growth for Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL), was named CEO. Garcia\u2019s role with Revlon begins April 15.\n\nThese changes to the executive team came just months after a filing from MacAndrews that there were possible changes in play. \u201cThe MacAndrews & Forbes Reporting Persons have determined to explore strategic alternatives involving the company,\u201d Perelman\u2019s firm said in a Jan. 15 Securities and Exchange Commission filing. \u201cIn that regard, the MacAndrews & Forbes Reporting Persons expect from time to time to communicate with third parties as well as with the Company as to the possibility of such a transaction and related strategic, financial and other matters.\u201d\n\nWhile it was never specified which alternatives were being considered by MacAndrews & Forbes, the new appointments to Revlon\u2019s management team surely makes it less likely that it will pursue a pure sale to a strategic buyer. Typically, when such additions occur, this is not the precursor to a sale.\n\nCompared with other companies in the cosmetics space, Revlon is more vulnerable to changes in the economic environment and consumer\u2019s demands for products, mainly due to its high leverage. In April 2015, Revlon purchased U.K.-based global fragrance management company CBBeauty in a deal that also included the U.K. distributor, SAS & Company. In August 2013, Revlon also acquired nail polish maker Colomer Group from CVC Capital Partners in a $660 million cash deal.\n\nAccording to Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Revlon\u2019s acquisition of Colomer in 2013 increased its leverage to roughly 6.8 times. As of Sept. 30, 2015 the company\u2019s leverage has been reduced to 5.5 times.\n\n\u201cMr. Perelman is an economic animal, and putting it out there that they are exploring strategic alternative could put a lot of animals out there,\u201d Steven Davis, managing director, head of beauty & personal care at Intrepid Investment Bankers, tells Mergers & Acquisitions. \u201cThey could look at private equity or a take-private. They could be viable and likely options.\u201d\n\nTake-private deals, often executed by a consortium of private equity firms, can offer financial benefits. One being that management typically has more free time and can place more effort on simply operating and growing the business, as seen with beauty products retailer Steiner Leisure Ltd.(Nasdaq: STNR), maker of Bliss products. On August 20, 2015, the company entered into a $925 million take-private deal with Greenwich, Connecticut-based middle market private equity firm Catterton. The arrangement was made to provide Nassau, Bahamas-based Steiner with greater flexibility to focus on its long term business initiatives, the company said then.\n\nA representative for MacAndrews & Forbes declined comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Revlon\u2019s stock reacted more positively to the news of the CFO appointment than the CEO hire, closing at 36.45 on April 12. On March 28 when Garcia was named CEO, the stock closed at 34.64. To compare, it was trading at 28.08 at close of business when MacAndrews and Forbes\u2019 plan to look into \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d was announced.\n\nRevlon reports a 4.2% growth in sales ($521.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2015, over the same time period in 2014. Total net sales for 2015 were $1.9 billion, a decline of 1.4%, however. As of Dec. 31, 2015, the beauty products company\u2019s long-term debt totals $1.8 billion.\n\nFor the previous edition of Turnaround Talk, see, \u201cMany Energy Companies Flirt with Bankruptcy and May Run Out of Options\u201d.
