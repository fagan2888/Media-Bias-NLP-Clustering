After an investigation into whether Justin Bieber and his fellow passengers interfered with a flight crew in January, officials have cleared the pop singer and his cohorts, according to a report by CNN.

Following a flight from Ontario, Canada to New Jersey's Teterboro Airport ahead of the Super Bowl in January, Justin Bieber's plane was held and reportedly searched for drugs after the pilot detected a smell of pot.

Law enforcement officials told CNN in January that Bieber and his father were "extremely abusive verbally" to a flight attendant during that flight on a chartered Gulfstream IV. They both refused to stop smoking pot on the plane, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection report obtained by CNN.

The Federal Aviation Administration found no evidence the passengers violated Federal Aviation regulations, according to a statement it released Friday.
