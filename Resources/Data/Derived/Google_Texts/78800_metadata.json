Going forward, the state is forecasted to gain around 10,000 new jobs a year, for annual job growth rates of 1.1 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2016, Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cVery importantly, Albuquerque, if you go back to 2012, was very negative,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will turn.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico has missed out on the broad job recovery taking place nationwide, he said, noting that nationwide employment returned to its pre-recession level toward the end of 2014.\n\n\u201cThis is very much a tale of two cities,\u201d he said. \u201cNew Mexico over the last five years has been a place apart. We have not seen much of what\u2019s happening nationwide happening here.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s economy has been underperforming those of other states in the Southwest, Mitchell said. Finding the path to catch up to other states does not mean copying what they\u2019re doing in terms of economic development initiatives, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of finding somebody else\u2019s model and grafting it onto us,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of finding our own.\u201d\n\nTwo signs to watch for economic improvement are job gains in the business and professional services employment sector and improvements in housing, he said.\n\nBusiness and professional services includes a huge chunk of white-collar jobs, running the gamut from lawyers and accountants to architects, engineers and computer techs, according to federal guidelines.\n\nDescribing it as a \u201cbellwether of where we\u2019re going,\u201d Mitchell said business and professional services is leading the national rebound in jobs while, in New Mexico, it has been shrinking almost continuously since 2010. The employment sector must expand for the economy to improve, he said.\n\nAs for housing, the pace of home construction needs to improve, although Mitchell cautioned, \u201cIn our wildest dreams we\u2019re not getting back to 50 percent of where we were during the boom years (of) 2004-2007.\u201d\n\nMitchell was among a slate of speakers at the morning conference at the Crowne Plaza Hotel. Presenting sponsors included Wells Fargo Bank, PNM Resources, the city of Albuquerque and BBER.\n\nWells Fargo Securities senior economist Eugenio Alem\u00e1n said the employment picture nationwide was \u201cthe strongest labor market since 1999\u201d in some ways.\n\nThe national picture, however, remains muddy for reasons like the dropping participation rate in the labor force, frozen wages, the high proportion of part-time jobs and prolonged unemployment periods for people out of work, Alem\u00e1n said.\n\nWhen asked about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the nation\u2019s economic growth over the next few years, he replied that the data aren\u2019t clear yet. Based on the simple fact that the national economy grew 5 percent in the first year of the ACA\u2019s rollout, he said, \u201cThis is a complete success.\u201d\n\nThe act gradually discouraged people from going to a physician or seeking medical services \u201cfor fun,\u201d he said, since they are more likely to be liable to pay deductibles in insurance coverage than they were before.\n\n\u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m not going to the doctor as often as I used to because I have to pay for it,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom a pricing point of view, I think it\u2019s relatively effective because people aren\u2019t going to the doctor unless they\u2019re dying.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Job growth returned to New Mexico in 2014, but slowly, and it's going to take another three years before overall employment in the state returns to its pre-recession level, a\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Richard Metcalf | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/526759/tepid-nm-job-growth-lags-national-recovery.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Income_graph.png", "type": "website", "description": "Job growth returned to New Mexico in 2014, but slowly, and it's going to take another three years before overall employment in the state returns to its pre-recession level, a University of New Mexico economist\u2026", "title": "Updated: Tepid NM job growth lags national recovery"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa95\"", "article_summary": "The state registered 14,700 new jobs as of November compared to a year earlier, which approaches 2 percent job growth.\nWhen asked about the impact of the Affordable Care Act on the nation\u2019s economic growth over the next few years, he replied that the data aren\u2019t clear yet.\n\u201cThat will turn.\u201dNew Mexico has missed out on the broad job recovery taking place nationwide, he said, noting that nationwide employment returned to its pre-recession level toward the end of 2014.\nGoing forward, the state is forecasted to gain around 10,000 new jobs a year, for annual job growth rates of 1.1 percent this year and 1.3 percent in 2016, Mitchell said.\n\u201cAlbuquerque must be part of the recovery,\u201d Jeffrey Mitchell, director of UNM\u2019s Bureau of Business & Economic Research, told the annual Economic Outlook Conference in Albuquerque."}
