Melina Mara/The Washington Post\n\nThe former secretary of state visits key states in her quest to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Clinton visits key states in her quest to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nFormer secretary of state Hillary Clinton visits key states in her quest to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nThey began arriving a full four hours early, hundreds of people stretching single file outside a Phoenix high school. It was a hot and cloudless day, but the people had come prepared to endure, preparation and endurance being hallmarks of a Hillary Clinton rally.\n\nThey slathered on sunscreen. They popped open umbrellas. They reached into purses and fanny packs for little baggies of trail mix, ignoring the yelling Donald Trump supporters across the street, and the carload of Bernie Sanders fans that kept whizzing by \u2014 \u201cBernieeeee!\u201d they shouted through the window, their hair flying free. Their own hairlines glistened with sweat.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a serious candidate, and she doesn\u2019t have to entertain me,\u201d said Chris Haggerty, 58, a pastor in her third hour of waiting, of moving in small increments toward the high school doors.\n\nElsewhere in America, Sanders was thundering about a \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d The Republican front-runner Trump was promising to \u201cbomb the sh--\u201d out of the Islamic State. These were the emotionally cathartic rallies that had come to define this unorthodox political season so far \u2014 angry, raucous, anti-establishment and, in Trump\u2019s case, \u00adoccasionally violent.\n\nA Clinton rally was decidedly none of these things.\n\nHillary Clinton reached out to \u201cworried\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d voters after the March 22 primaries. But worried and angry voters have been flocking to other candidates so far. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nWhat was it, then? What happens at a rally for the presidential candidate who has gotten more votes than anyone else so far \u2014 nearly 9 million, which is roughly 2.5 million more than Sanders and 1 million more than Trump?\n\nWhat does it mean to cheer a person often described by pundits as having a \u201cpassion gap\u201d compared with her rivals, to go bonkers for a detail-laden stump speech that crescendos on words such as prudent and percent of your income?\n\n***\n\nIn the line, Clinton campaign workers handed out bottles of water.\n\nRose Smith, 55, took one and glanced over at the Trump yellers, which included a man with a Smith & Wesson 9mm strapped to his thigh shouting that Clinton should be \u201ctaken down a notch.\u201d She did not yell back.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s angry; Bernie\u2019s angry all the time,\u201d said Smith, a retired elementary schoolteacher who said she was not angry other than whatever frustration she felt toward the other candidates and their followers, which she sublimated. \u201cJust realistically, I think it\u2019s not a matter of pumping the team up, it\u2019s a matter of playing the game. You can\u2019t have that kind of demeanor. I can\u2019t imagine these men being in the room when some crisis really happens. Is emotion going to rule them, or are they going to have a level head and make calm decisions?\u201d\n\nThe Fix's Aaron Blake breaks down what's at stake for the GOP candidates in the April 5 Wisconsin primary. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThe man next to her was nodding.\n\n\u201cThey always say she\u2019s not emotional enough,\u201d said Rick Beitman, 31, a graduate student sipping from a Starbucks cup. \u201cI like Bernie \u2014 my heart is where his heart is, but my head is where Hillary\u2019s is. She\u2019s more logical. She has more structure and organization to her ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like a steady plateau,\u201d Smith said.\n\nTo her and others baking in the sun, this was in fact the paradox of being a Clinton supporter at a Clinton rally, the thing that no one seemed to understand. They were excited by her lack of excitability; thrilled by her boring wonkiness; enthusiastic not about the prospect of some dramatic change but about Clinton\u2019s promise of dogged, small-bore pragmatism, a result of decades of government experience they considered a qualification rather than a liability.\n\nTheirs was the campaign that voters so often said they wanted \u2014 one of substance and detail, of practicality rather than dreamy idealism, of freedom through discipline. The Bernie car sped by again.\n\n\u201cBernieeee! Wooo!\u201d the young people yelled through the windows.\n\nVincent Medina, 40, who took the day off from his job as director of early-childhood education, rolled his eyes.\n\n\u201cI know with Bernie it\u2019s all revolutionary,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s excitement here, too.\u201d\n\nNot the thrill of revolt and rage, he explained, but rather the joy of hearing a candidate speak in excruciating yet accurate detail about Head Start and Early Head Start, the federally funded programs to help low-income children prepare for kindergarten.\n\n\u201cLike when she went to Flint,\u201d Medina continued, referring to the Michigan city where possibly hundreds of children have been poisoned by toxins in the water supply. \u201cShe was strongly encouraging the government to put Head Start in place because she knows one of the requirements is annual lead screening.\u201d\n\nSweat was beading on his forehead.\n\n\u201cShe really gets down to specifics,\u201d he said as the line inched forward, and Clinton campaign workers, many in blue blazers, began shouting out instructions.\n\n\u201cNo homemade signs!\u201d one said, and a few people threw away their hand-drawn placards.\n\n\u201cStickers?\u201d another said, handing out little \u201cH\u201d stickers with Clinton\u2019s arrow logo.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m very excited!\u201d said Randall Clark, who owns a small delivery business and pressed the H onto his shirt.\n\nBy \u201cexcited,\u201d he explained, he meant that he looked forward to \u201ccontinued, incremental, small changes\u201d on issues such as global warming, gun control and health care, for this was the worldview inside the Clinton camp. Progress was a thing achieved not in grand, sweeping gestures but rather by relentless, often unrecognized toil, not unlike their own here, now.\n\nA carload of Trump supporters sped by \u2014 \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d they yelled.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an embarrassment \u2014 I can\u2019t wait for her to win,\u201d said Bea Rios, 65, a retired bank teller who came to support Clinton even though her back was hurting.\n\n\u201cThe Trump clown car,\u201d muttered Haggerty, the pastor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d said her friend Bonnie Coon, 68, as they finally reached the doors of the gym, where the music was not \u00adFlogging Molly\u2019s \u201cRevolution,\u201d which often blares at Sanders\u2019s rallies, or Twisted Sister\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It,\u201d which usually blasts at Trump\u2019s.\n\nIt was the Gap Band\u2019s \u201cOutstanding,\u201d circa 1982, which was followed by a Top 40 melange, played at medium volume.\n\n\u201cWe are mature and responsible people,\u201d said Balbir Grewal, 65, raising her voice slightly over the music.\n\n***\n\nInside, the mature and the responsible milled around or sat on the bleachers.\n\nA lone woman in a red hat danced without inhibition when Pharrell Williams\u2019s \u201cHappy\u201d came on. People who knew one another from fundraisers said hello. Grewal sat down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a kid,\u201d continued the retired restaurateur, who became an activist in the local Sikh community when a young Sikh man was murdered after 9/11. \u201cI don\u2019t need to get angry and yell.\u201d\n\nShe was here, she said, because she was a serious person. And in Clinton, Grewal saw a larger, more powerful version of her own serious self: a person who could be doing anything but was working with local law enforcement to prevent another pointless death, teaching young Indian women English, and counseling others about how to stick up for themselves in a sexist and restrictive culture.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a strong person, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s getting such crap,\u201d Grewal offered, her voice rising. \u201cShe knows she can do it, and she\u2019s not going to take any crap from anybody. I just love her.\u201d\n\nKaren Powell, a community volunteer and former school vision planner, leaned over.\n\n\u201cPeople are always telling me I\u2019m too intense and serious \u2014 well, okay then. How bad could that be?\u201d she said over the music. \u201cWe are rolling up our sleeves and working.\u201d\n\nAnd if nothing else, this was what a Clinton rally was about: work.\n\nOn stage, a local elected official began by introducing Clinton as a \u201cdoer!\u201d\n\nThe civil rights and labor activist Dolores Huerta spoke about Clinton\u2019s role in passing the federal Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program.\n\n\u201cThe CHIP program,\u201d Huerta said, revving up the crowd, \u201cthat was Hillary! That was Hillary!\u201d\n\nMark Kelly, the husband of former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, compared the Clinton candidacy with a space shuttle mission.\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of hard work, over a long period of time,\u201d the retired astronaut said, and soon, Clinton walked onstage, and the crowd roared and waved their briefcase-size, campaign-approved signs.\n\n\u201cIt is so exciting to be here!\u201d Clinton began.\n\n\u201cWe love you!\u201d someone yelled, but very soon Clinton turned serious, introducing a couple whose daughter was killed in the Aurora, Colo., theater shooting and explaining the need for \u201ccommon-sense gun reform,\u201d at which point the crowd began roaring.\n\n\u201cAnd I want you to think about this,\u201d Clinton said over the cheers, but the crowd would not settle down.\n\n\u201cWe want you!\u201d a man yelled out.\n\n\u201cI want you, to want me!\u201d Clinton yelled back a bit haltingly, and people began chanting: \u201cWe want you! We want you!\u201d\n\nBut Clinton would not indulge. She moved on through her talking points, which did not really make for catchy zingers but were cheered nonetheless: Not free college tuition, but debt-free college tuition. Not scrapping the Affordable Care Act, but improving it. Not just education, but early -childhood education.\n\n\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d a teacher yelled from the back row, and Clinton moved on to how sad it was that Arizona did not participate in CHIP.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a three-to-one federal match!\u201d she said in the depths of her stump speech.\n\nPeople cheered this, and they cheered all the way until the very end, which was not so much an emotional moment as it was a sobering call to action.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to roll up our sleeves and get to work!\u201d Clinton said, deploying the rallying cry that the people now standing and cheering understood. They had their instructions, and when the rally ended, they did not linger long.
