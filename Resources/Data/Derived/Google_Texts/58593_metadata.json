It\u2019s tough to find a Republican who is not pushing outright falsehoods about Obamacare. Senator Ted Cruz has been falsely claiming for years that Obamacare is the biggest job-killer in America. Former Governor Jeb Bush has said, \u201cYou get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn\u2019t suppress wages and kill jobs.\u201d Governor Bobby Jindal has pushed the myth that Obamacare kills jobs, \u201cWhy not delay all of the mandates in Obamacare [which] has become such a job killer in our economy.\u201d\n\nBoth writers are from the the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. They went over the latest job numbers and they agree with previous studies; Obamacare is not a job killer. Not only is Obamacare reducing the number of uninsured as intended, but it is also not a job killer. Sorry Republicans.\n\nA few points to remember from the Washington Post:\n\nStrong health-care employment growth shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone. Demand for labor is derived from the demand for the goods and services that people want and need. Thus, we\u2019d expect the expansion of health coverage to boost jobs in that sector \u2014 in addition to driving historically large reductions in the number of Americans without health coverage, saving states money and slowing growth in health-care costs.\n\nYet House Republicans are still trying to repeal parts of the law, claiming that \u201cmany of the key elements of Obamacare [are] harming individuals and families [and] hurting job creation.\u201d Fox News commentator Bill O\u2019Reilly maintains that, \u201cWhile some of the poor benefit, other Americans are punished because the job market is smaller.\u201d Some presidential candidates agree: Jeb Bush calls the ACA \u201cthe president\u2019s job-destroying health-care law\u201d and Ted Cruz\u2019s Senate Web site asserts that \u201cObamacare is causing millions to lose their jobs.\u201d Cruz and Marco Rubio aren\u2019t even content to repeal parts of the law \u2014 they want to repeal the entire thing.\n\nBut but\u2026Obama is just subsidizing jobs in healthcare with rich people\u2019s money! Nope, not that either:\n\nEven if we\u2019re generous here and assume that those shouting \u201cjob killer\u201d mean that the gains in the health-care sector are coming at the expense of the rest of the job market, there\u2019s no evidence to support that claim, either.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d injured Republicans will huff, \u201cObamacare is certainly turning America into a part-time nation!\u201d We\u2019ve addressed this in the past when it was also found to be untrue, but as a reminder:\n\nNor is there any evidence that Obamacare is causing a shift from full-time to part-time jobs \u2014 the number of involuntary part-time workers is actually down since 2013 (and as Dean Baker notes, the evidence that the ACA\u2019s premium subsidies may be encouraging voluntary part-time work is a good thing), while full-time employment has been steadily rising. Again, steady job growth is surely a function of the broad employment recovery, not health reform, but it is yet another trend going the wrong way for the critics.\n\nDiscussing September\u2019s job numbers, Jason Fuhrman, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, noted, \u201cFull-time jobs more than fully account for all job gains since early \u201910, with part-time jobs holding steady.\u201d\n\nIn reality, Obama is setting records for job growth. The October jobs report showed that President Obama has overseen 68 consecutive months of private sector job growth. That\u2019s 13.5 million private sector jobs over 68 straight months. He has also overseen the strongest three years for overall job creation (even with the Republican sequester impacting the public sector) since 2000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's tough to find a Republican who is not pushing outright falsehoods about Obamacare.
