A 30-year-old Colorado man has died following a rollover accident in western Kansas.

It happened around 5 a.m. Saturday on County Road 17 A, just south of Cimarron in Gray County. The Kansas Highway Patrol said a late 90s Ford Expedition was heading north on the county road when the driver veered left of the center line, over-corrected and went into a ditch.

The SUV rolled several times before coming to rest on its wheels.

The driver was taken to a hospital in Dodge City where he later died. Troopers identified him as Ramon Humberto of Brighton, Colorado.

No one else was in the vehicle.
