Sen. Ted Cruz is one of the big opponents of the Affordable Care Act. In a press release from Thursday, Cruz informed the American people that one of the many unintended consequences of Obamacare is that some production companies are likely to stop filming in the U.S., in order to avoid Obamacare regulations.

“Because of Obamacare, the next time you see American amber waves of grain and purple mountain majesties in the movies, they might not even be filmed in the United States,” Cruz said during his Freedom minute segment.

In social media, Cruz continues to show his dislike toward the Affordable Care act through tweets containing frequent “Obamacare facts”.

Thursday night on Fox News, the Texas Senator called the fight to defund Obamacare “the most important domestic fight we have had in years”, while urging people to go on the national website DontFundIt.com and sign the national petition.

“If the American People stand together, we can defund Obamacare”, Cruz said to Sean Hannity on Fox news.
