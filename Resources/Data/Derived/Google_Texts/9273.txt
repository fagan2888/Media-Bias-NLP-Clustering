At the age of 101 Joe Newman is has put himself up for election to Congress seeking to break the Republican grip on Florida’s Congressional District.

Mr Newman will be a write-in candidate in the midterm elections in the autumn where he will be looking to unseat Vern Buchanan, a Republican as he tries to convince voters that experience matters more than youth.

The US constitution sets a minimum age of 25 to run for Congress, there is no maximum.

Mr Newman said he had decided to run after Mr Buchanan voted in favour of continuing the tax cuts introduced by George Bush and against ObamaCare.

Originally from Indiana, Mr Newman’s mother ran a grocery store. Having graduated from Notre Dame University he embarked on a career working for the US Government’s embryonic social security programme.

After his wife gave birth to a mentally handicapped daughter he campaigned for programmes to provide support for families in a similar position.

Mr Newman insisted that his advanced years should not prevent him running for office.

“At what age does a person become too old to think and reason? At what age does a person no longer have a concern for society?

“At what age does a person no longer have a responsibility to act when acting may help?”

Currently the oldest member of Congress is Ralph Hall, a 91-year old Republican from North Texas who is serving his 17th term in office.

However Mr Newman said he has no wish to emulate Mr Hall’s congressional service.

“At 101 years of age, a natural term limit exists and I have no designs on a lengthy political career that requires me to sell out my ideals, my values, or my constituents for a potential future payoff.”
