A secret message has reportedly been uncovered in the coding used to make the exchange website for President Barack Obama’s signature health care program — and it involves the privacy of potential enrollees.

“You have no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system,” the message reads, according to the Weekly Standard.

“At any time, and for any lawful Government purpose, the government may monitor, intercept, and search and seize any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system,” the message reportedly continues. “Any communication or data transiting or stored on this information system may be disclosed or used for any lawful Government purpose.”

The message allegedly appears when the terms and conditions page is visible and can only be seen using an Internet browser’s “view source” tool.

The wording, however, does not appear in the actual terms and conditions agreement users sign when they enroll in the exchanges.

Multiple attempts to verify the Weekly Standard’s report were made by TheBlaze Monday, but were ultimately unsuccessful due to glitches in the website preventing TheBlaze from even creating an account on Healthcare.gov.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services was not immediately available for comment to TheBlaze.

According to the Weekly Standard, however, the phrase “no reasonable expectation to privacy” is a “stock phrase” that is “used in the terms and conditions of many government websites and information systems.”
