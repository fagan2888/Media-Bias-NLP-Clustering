If Democrats let him work across the aisle, we may get the first tax reform in 30 years.\n\nFor two years, Senators Ron Wyden and Judd Gregg met almost every week to talk about taxes. The exuberant, indefatigable Democrat from Oregon and the dour, taciturn Republican from New Hampshire made an odd couple. But they shared a singular, nerdy passion for wanting to overhaul the tax code and their lengthy negotiations ultimately resulted in the Bipartisan Tax Fairness and Simplification Act they introduced in 2010.\n\nGregg, who left the Senate that same year, describes Wyden as \u201csomebody who has relentless optimism.\u201d There were many substantive disagreements between them along the way as they tried to hash out the details of the plan, and Gregg recalls, \u201cOn numerous occasions I gave up on the process but he (Wyden) would track me down on the floor or in an elevator and insist we keep at it.\u201d\n\nTheir plan to simplify the tax code, reduce corporate and personal rates and eliminate many exemptions and write-offs didn\u2019t have much chance of being enacted, but both men thought it was worth the effort. \u201cWe enjoyed it because it was so tough,\u201d says Wyden.\n\n\u201cSomething like that takes a long time, it\u2019s like a cork floating to the surface of the ocean,\u201d Gregg says.\n\nThat same year President Obama created the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform co-chaired by former GOP Senator Alan Simpson and Clinton White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles to come up with a bipartisan \u201cgrand bargain\u201d for tax and entitlement reform. The plan, though widely discussed, didn\u2019t go very far either. But Gregg, a member of the commission who voted in favor of its final report, says a lot of its ideas came from his and Wyden\u2019s tax plan and will be the basis for future discussions.\n\nWhile a grand bargain is extremely unlikely, Wyden intends to keep pushing for piecemeal reform. After years as an earnest, wonky backbencher toiling on seemingly impossible legislative quests, Wyden as the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee will now have a seat at the table when big decisions are made.\n\nThe Finance Committee is the most consequential and powerful committee in the Senate with far-reaching jurisdiction over tax, trade, and health care issues affecting every American, and it provides a huge platform for Wyden\u2019s ideas along with the staff and resources to implement them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had these tax reform bills for a decade. We\u2019ve put some sweat equity into this,\u201d Wyden told me the day he formally took over the chairmanship just before the Senate adjourned for its President\u2019s Day recess. \u201cI come to play every day. I\u2019m going to be looking for activist opportunities that have a strong bipartisan coalition behind them\u2026 This is the go-to place for tackling big things.\u201d\n\nWyden is popular with GOP colleagues for his collegiality, work ethic and willingness to include their ideas in legislation. \u201cAt his core he is very liberal but he\u2019s also willing to go across the aisle and be bipartisan which is what you have to do to get anything done and really govern,\u201d asserts Gregg.\n\nBut the Democratic leadership and White House have not always been fans. In pursuit of a goal, Wyden can go off message.\n\nFor example, Wyden\u2019s work in 2011 with Republican House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan on a national Medicare reform plan that included a proposal to allow seniors to choose either existing Medicare or private insurance\u2014an option already available to seniors in both Oregon and Wisconsin. The plan became a flashpoint during the 2012 presidential campaign when Ryan was selected as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate. Romney proudly pointed to Ryan\u2019s bipartisan Medicare reform plan while Democrats blasted it as a plot to privatize Medicare, never mentioning Wyden\u2019s involvement.\n\n\u201cI called him after I got picked (as vice presidential candidate) and told him I hope this doesn\u2019t get you in too much trouble\u2026and he laughed and said\u2014\u2018Too late\u2019\u201d, Ryan said. \u201cIt took courage for him to do this with me.\u201d Ryan still thinks their plan is \u201cthe best way to save Medicare,\u201d but many Democrats won\u2019t even entertain discussions about entitlement reform.\n\nWyden also had his own health care reform plan co-sponsored with Republican Robert Bennett of Utah. Bennett lost his Senate seat in 2010 as a result of a Tea Party challenge and due in no small part to his work with Wyden. Their plan would have guaranteed the availability of portable, private health insurance that would not be tied to employment and offer individual tax credits to help pay for it. Wyden, also up for reelection in 2010, was attacked by union-sponsored ads in Oregon over a provision in the plan that would have made so-called platinum health care plans taxable. But Wyden answered with his own ads and easily won reelection using the campaign slogan \u201cRon Wyden: Different. Like Oregon.\u201d\n\nWyden says the Finance Committee will hold hearings this year on potential changes to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere are a number of things that can be done administratively\u201d to make it work better, he explains.\n\nMax Baucus, Wyden\u2019s predecessor as Finance Chair, had a rocky\u2014one Capitol Hill observer called it \u201ctoxic\u201d\u2014relationship with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the rest of the Democratic leadership who felt he compromised too much with Republicans on legislation, went his own way without consulting them, and voted against his party too often. As a result, they shut Baucus out on health reform and signaled he wouldn\u2019t be able to advance anything else he wanted to do. As one GOP senator described it, Democratic \u201cleadership treated Baucus like dirt.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

The move allowed Montana\u2019s Democratic governor Steve Bullock to appoint the state\u2019s lieutenant governor John Walsh as Baucus\u2019 replacement, giving him an incumbency advantage and the Democrats a greater chance of holding the seat in November.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how much more running room Reid will give Wyden but the Oregon Democrat is bound to be more politically deft and deferential in dealing with the party leaders than Baucus. Until he was officially confirmed as chairman by the Senate last week Wyden said very little, not wanting to antagonize the leadership or get too far out ahead of himself.\n\n\u201cHe could have been dancing with glee but he was very restrained,\u201d observes Orrin Hatch, the Finance Committee\u2019s ranking Republican. \u201cI think Ron will go slow at first and feel his way with the leadership but sooner or later there will come a time when he has to stand up.\u201d\n\nWyden is not the type to poke his finger in Reid\u2019s eye or go out of his way to highlight differences with the party line but he also isn\u2019t overly concerned about toeing that line when he is trying to get something he considers important accomplished.\n\nAs a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Wyden has been one of the most outspoken opponents of dragnet intelligence gathering and domestic spying on American citizens by U.S. intelligence agencies and introduced legislation to ban the mass collection of phone and email records and reform the court that oversees the National Security Agency\u2019s domestic surveillance.\n\nWhen asked about his relationship with the majority leader, Wyden points to a picture in his office of Reid with one of his young children. The 64-year-old Wyden and his wife Nancy Bass Wyden, 52, had twins Ava and William in 2007 and a daughter Scarlett in 2012. Nancy runs downtown New York\u2019s iconic Strand Book Store a family business started by her grandfather in 1927. The couple met in Portland, Oregon when she was visiting Powell\u2019s, another of the nation\u2019s most famous independent book stores and they married in 2005. Wyden also has two children from a previous marriage. Wyden and his wife have a bicoastal and tri-city marriage. Wyden has homes in Portland and Washington; Bass is based in New York with their children, which means a lot of traveling to spend time together. \u201cShe\u2019s the wonder of the operation,\u201d says Wyden of his wife and the juggling it takes to maintain their complicated life and schedule.\n\nWyden moved to Oregon to attend the University of Oregon Law School and founded an Oregon chapter of the senior advocacy group the Gray Panthers before being elected to the House in 1980, two years before Reid. Reid spent only four years on that side of the Capitol before his 1986 election to the Senate. Wyden won his Senate seat in a special election in January 1996.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other since we both came to Washington,\u201d Wyden says. \u201cWe talk all the time. Both of us are not long on formality. We recognize that you have to move quickly, not surprise people and give everyone a chance to be heard.\u201d\n\nWyden, who had never headed a full committee until last year, gave up the chairmanship of the Energy Committee for the Finance post. He has only been on the Finance Committee since 2005. His swift ascent was made possible because half a dozen more senior Democrats were defeated, retired or took administration jobs over the past few years. Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, was next in line but is also retiring at the end of this year and passed on the job.\n\nReid may have preferred New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer, a party stalwart and member of the leadership for the Finance chairmanship, but Senate tradition dictated the post go to Wyden because he was next in line. It\u2019s been a hundred years since the Senate bypassed seniority in awarding a chairmanship, a fact researched in advance by Wyden\u2019s staff. All Wyden will say about the matter is that Schumer and the Democratic caucus followed the seniority tradition.\n\nBen Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and member of the Finance Committee, says Wyden knows he is part of the leadership now. \u201cI think Ron understands the difference between being a member and being chairman. What he does with partners on the other side of the aisle will need to be consistent with the (Democratic) caucus game plan.\u201d\n\nRepublican Mike Crapo of Idaho, whose office is located next to Wyden\u2019s in the Dirksen building, is also on the Finance Committee. Like Gregg, Crapo was a member of the Simpson-Bowles commission and supported its reform proposal. Crapo predicts that in pursuit of legislative success Wyden \u201cwill work his hardest to build consensus on the committee among both Republicans and Democrats and that may involve pushing the envelope with both parties including possibly his own leadership.\u201d\n\nNeither Reid nor Obama has signaled they want to make tax reform a priority and it won\u2019t happen without their support. But Wyden says \u201cI want to advance tax policy that gives everybody a chance to get ahead and helps the middle class\u2014I think the Democrats will be interested in that.\u201d\n\nIt has been thirty years since there was a major overhaul of the tax code. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was a joint effort among President Ronald Reagan, House Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill, House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, and Senate Finance Chair Robert Packwood, the man Wyden replaced in the Senate when Packwood resigned over sexual harassment and ethics charges. Another of its most important proponents was former Democratic Senator Bill Bradley.\n\nWyden and Bradley are both smart guys, socially liberal but fiscally centrist pragmatists who enjoy focusing on policy and don\u2019t mind diverging from their party. Both men were basketball players although Wyden played only for his first two years at USC Santa Barbara before transferring to Stanford where he majored in political science. Bradley, a history major at Princeton, was an NBA hall of famer who played for the New York Knicks. \u201cI don\u2019t have as good a jump shot as him\u2026 I was too small and I made up for it by being slow,\u201d quips the 6\u20194\u201d Wyden.\n\nWyden says the two men have talked about tax reform and Bradley\u2019s advice was to \u201ckeep pushing\u2014you get it by pushing it.\u201d\n\nWyden, who seems eager to follow that advice, says his goals for tax reform are \u201cto clean out the junk\u201d of write-offs and exclusions, make the code more progressive and lower rates except for capital gains which he thinks should be taxed more like regular income. But a big difference now compared with the \u201986 effort Wyden explains is \u201cthey weren\u2019t dealing with the social media\u2026 the first time some powerful interest isn\u2019t getting what it wants they will take their message viral and claim Western civilization is going to end if this particular tax break is touched in any way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy. Everybody and their dog has an issue in the tax code,\u201d agrees Hatch.\n\nTax reform will also be harder this time around because the political climate is much more polarized than it was in 1986. There\u2019s virtually no chance of it happening in this election year but Wyden and Hatch both think it could be possible in 2015.\n\nWyden plans to start by working on the extensions of more than 50 tax provisions that expired at the end of 2013 including deductions for state and local sales taxes, credits for research and development and renewable energy. Wyden says completing the tax credit extensions this year could be a bridge or \u201ctrampoline\u201d to more comprehensive tax reform.\n\nHatch clearly is game to work with Wyden. \u201cI have high hopes for him. He\u2019s going to have a good friend in me,\u201d says Hatch. \u201cI think we\u2019ll make a good team.\u201d\n\nWhether it will be Wyden or Hatch captaining that team depends on whether the Republicans win back control of the Senate in November. Another roster change that could have a big impact on tax reform in 2015 involves the House Ways and Means Committee. Paul Ryan, currently Budget chair, wants to replace David Camp who is losing the Ways and Means chairmanship at the end of this year because of GOP term limit rules.\n\nLike Hatch, Ryan wants to work with Wyden on tax reform and says they have a lot in common. \u201cWe\u2019re both policy guys with nice demeanors. He\u2019s a liberal but he\u2019s not an angry liberal\u2014he\u2019s a happy liberal.\u201d\n\nJosh Kardon, a lobbyist who served as Wyden\u2019s chief of staff for 17 years, concurs. \u201cRon\u2019s fundamentally a legislator, not fundamentally a message or a political guy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Ron Wyden, Harry Reid, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201402181045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Ron Wyden, Harry Reid, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Senates New Taxman Wont Be Controlled By His Own Party", "tags": "entity:person/ron_wyden,entity:person/harry_reid,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Ron Wyden gets along with some Republicans better than Harry Reid or the White House.
