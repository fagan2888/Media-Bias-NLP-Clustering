Literally.\n\nSome truck enthusiasts are intentionally producing copious amounts of diesel exhaust, spewing black smoke into the air as a form of political protest. It's called \"rolling coal.\" Vocativ covered the subculture in an article last month, reporting \"coal rollers\" can spend thousands of dollars altering their rides to produce ever greater amounts of smoke.\n\nRollin coal #Chevy pic.twitter.com/MbDJfliVmo \u2014 Country Boy (@hickcountry28) April 11, 2013\n\nModifications include a variety of components that increase the amount of fuel entering the truck's engine. When there's so much fuel that it fails to combust properly, \"it leaves the engine as soot,\" according to an article on DieselHub.com, a website dedicated to diesel truck owners.\n\nThat soot, which coal rollers call \"Prius repellent\" in online videos and forums and on decals on their trucks, can then be channeled up through \"smoke stacks,\" where it exits onto bystanders (or a Prius following too closely) in a thick, pollutant-heavy black cloud.\n\n\u201cI run into a lot of people that really don\u2019t like Obama at all,\u201d an unnamed Wisconsin seller of smoke stack kits told Slate's David Weigel, explaining some of the rationale behind the movement. \u201cIf he\u2019s into the environment, if he\u2019s into this or that, we\u2019re not. I hear a lot of that. To get a single stack on my truck\u2014that\u2019s my way of giving them the finger. You want clean air and a tiny carbon footprint? Well, screw you.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the negative environmental impacts of increased emissions, the American Cancer Society has linked exposure to diesel exhaust to a variety of negative health effects, including lung cancer.\n\nSee more photos and video of coal rollers, below:\n\n\n\nRollin coal anthem @rollincoalclub pic.twitter.com/b7pkl6FQFO \u2014 Travis Spruitenburg (@EDH_Redneck) August 21, 2013\n\nRollin coal? #Hellyeah pic.twitter.com/HYXddVYH \u2014 CodyNotNice (@CDuBzzT3P) January 28, 2013\n\nNow.
