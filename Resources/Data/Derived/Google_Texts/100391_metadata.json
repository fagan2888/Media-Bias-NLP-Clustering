They mimiced their candidate\u2019s stances on education, healthcare and homeland security.\n\nNathaniel Brown, a freshman portraying Jeb Bush, talked about his experience as a governor and hammered out \u201cconservative principles\u201d in listicle-like fashion.\n\nBrown said that he had fun acting as Bush, a candidate he actively supports.\n\n\u201cIt was an immense amount of fun,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI get to work on Jeb\u2019s campaign [as] campaign captain at UTC. It\u2019s exhilarating playing someone with so much influence [who is] such a good politician and can connect with voters.\u201d\n\nDuring the 30-minute mock debate, Brown responded twice to the \u201clow-energy candidate\u201d comments levied against him by Seth Harrell as Donald Trump.\n\nHarrell, UTC College Democrats president and East Tennessee Young Democrats vice chair, explained Trump's stance against common core and other policies. He said he, as Trump, was the \"serious candidate\" for education reform because of his business experience.\n\n\u201cI built buildings before, so I can build education,\u201d Harrell said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a huge success.\u201d\n\nBlake Kitterman, a sophomore who works closely with Hamilton for Hillary, represented the stances of Hillary Clinton. Throughout the debate, Kitterman lauded President Barrack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and said he, as Clinton, closely identified with the president.\n\nWhile he said he enjoyed playing the role, he said it was \u201ca bit different\u201d to portray Clinton.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely interesting,\u201d Kitterman said. \u201cI did not prepare myself with the pant suits, but it was definitely fun. I think it went real well.\u201d\n\nWhen all was said and done, Lothian shared his experiences covering presidential debates in 2004, 2008 and 2012. He said that covering this year\u2019s campaign cycle \u201cwould have been a fun one.\u201d\n\nBefore a Q&A session with those gathered, he gave the competitors the following tips for their next debate:\n\n\u2014Keep the voters in mind as you present.\n\n\u2014Tell stories to get your points across.\n\n\u2014Explicitly tell your voters how a policy item would affect them.\n\n\u2014Always have a line or thesis ready for each various issue.\n\n\u2014Don\u2019t be afraid to show emotion.\n\nThe Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce's downtown council hosted and moderated today\u2019s debate.\n\nUTC will host a mock debate with a larger field of candidates March 24.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chattanooga news, entertainment, opinion, editorials", "og": {"site_name": "Nooga.com", "description": "The debaters took on the points and personas of Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz\u2014and of course, Donald Trump.", "title": "UTC students unravel political issues during mock presidential debate", "url": "http://nooga.com/172234/utc-students-unravel-political-issues-during-mock-presidential-debate/", "image": "https://noogacms.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/_/5543ea60fe789a714128902ecdf18f6b68377_large.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NoogaNews", "image": "https://noogacms.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/_/5543ea60fe789a714128902ecdf18f6b68377_large.png", "description": "The debaters took on the points and personas of Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz\u2014and of course, Donald Trump.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UTC students unravel political issues during mock presidential debate"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "10861fd2fb15c60793c07348980e295e"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1400280486890380}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nooga.com", "published_time": "20160125T2203", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/nooga.com"}, "msvalidate.01": "1FCFAF85DD84EF15FE1F984BAA51D8EC", "google-site-verification": "ZV6KJxYZmuIj2xB89lDEfnaBCsDCtzILRcc-orlSZm8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Five UTC students portrayed presidential candidates and sparred on ideas of political interest during a mock debate Monday.\nThe debaters took on the points and personas of Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.\nUTC will host a mock debate with a larger field of candidates March 24.\nThroughout the debate, Kitterman lauded President Barrack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and said he, as Clinton, closely identified with the president.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a huge success.\u201dBlake Kitterman, a sophomore who works closely with Hamilton for Hillary, represented the stances of Hillary Clinton."}
