They \u201ccannot guarantee that their children will see the world as they do\u201d, he says. \u201cIn fact, I can guarantee the children will not.\u201d\n\nThe philanthropist\u2019s natural desire to see their wishes carried out is hardly unique to one side of the political spectrum. But conservatives are more likely to believe there are enduring values that must be protected and less likely to agree with Andrew Carnegie that \u201cconditions upon erth [sic] inevitably change; hence, no wise man will bind trustees forever to certain paths, causes or institutions\u201d.\n\nOne does not need a conspiratorial mind to see that when charitable institutions drift from their original lane, they are more likely to veer leftwards than right. Henry Ford was \u2014 how shall we put this? \u2014 no friend of liberal causes in his lifetime; the same cannot be said of the professional staffers who dispense money from his foundation these days.\n\nAnd if one cannot rely on one\u2019s children or (especially) grandchildren, how best to ensure that fortunes, which today fund conservative causes, are not later diverted into something a little more liberal or, heaven forbid, socialist?\n\nAn obvious first step is giving more detailed instructions and information about your own philosophy. Jeffrey Cain, author of Protecting Donor Intent, tells the story of the Daniels Fund, founded by cable industry pioneer Bill Daniels, which has an interactive archive of its founder\u2019s videos and writings to keep his values in view.\n\nThere are also tricks to be learnt from philanthropists of the last century. When James Duke, the tobacco and electrical power magnate, set up the endowment that funds the university that now bears his name, in 1924, he made it a requirement that trustees read out the entire indenture, a 45-minute exercise that is still done at a board meeting annually.\n\nThe Roe Foundation, built on a fortune made in lumber by Thomas Roe, has two external watchdogs \u2014 the Mont Pelerin Society and the Philadelphia Society, both conservative think-tanks \u2014 with a brief to sue trustees if they stray from Roe\u2019s philosophy.\n\nA conservative-minded donor-advised fund (Daf) might be an even safer option. While Dafs generally allow philanthropists and their heirs to decide how donated monies are distributed, legally the money belongs to the Daf itself and the fund\u2019s administrators can shut out heirs who stray from conservative orthodoxy.\n\nThis is the promise of DonorsTrust, which has distributed $740m to more than 1,500 \u201cliberty-minded charities\u201d. Donors are free to pass on influence over the fund to their heirs, its marketing says, but \u201crest assured that their involvement would never compromise your original charitable intent\u201d. Most wealthy philanthropists are keen to involve their children and grandchildren in their charitable work and hand over the reins in due course. But for those who worry about the leftward drift of what Luntz calls \u201cthe Snapchat Generation\u201d, there are ways of keeping them on the right track.\n\nStephen is reading . . .\n\nDear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism, by Jeff Gramm, in which Warren Buffett appears as a \u2018friendly\u2019 activist supporting the management of American Express amid a scandal in 1964. The picture is a partial one. He was just as likely to be hostile to management in his early activist days, making him the Daniel Loeb or Carl Icahn of his day.\n\nStephen Foley is the FT\u2019s US investment correspondent", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "wealth, Bolivia, Atlantic City, Brutalist architecture, Mayfair galleries, St Peter's seminary, hedge funds, succession plan, behavioural finance, medical research, Lucian Freud, British butlers, McLaren 650S, Cessna Citation M2, Patrick Thomas", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Times", "description": "Frank Luntz, the Republican political consultant who persuaded his party to rebrand inheritance tax as a \u201cdeath tax\u201d and Obamacare as a \u201cgovernment takeover of healthcare\u201d, worries that no amount of clever linguistic tinkering can prevent a", "title": "Ambitious Wealth: Heirs will be heirs - FT.com", "url": "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/7ed82b5e-0230-11e6-99cb-83242733f755.html", "image": "http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/4f0df334-7e91-4c47-aed6-f91b94e40191.img", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 653531613, "page_id": 8860325749}, "THUMBNAIL_URL": "http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/e0ce7ad5-53c1-412b-9293-0821e2707637.img", "description": "Frank Luntz, the Republican political consultant who persuaded his party to rebrand inheritance tax as a \u201cdeath tax\u201d and Obamacare as a \u201cgovernment takeover of healthcare\u201d, worries that no amount of clever linguistic tinkering can prevent a"}, "article_summary": "It frightens conservative donors, too, which is why preserving \u201cdonor intent\u201d has moved up the philanthropic agenda.\nWhile Dafs generally allow philanthropists and their heirs to decide how donated monies are distributed, legally the money belongs to the Daf itself and the fund\u2019s administrators can shut out heirs who stray from conservative orthodoxy.\nDonors are free to pass on influence over the fund to their heirs, its marketing says, but \u201crest assured that their involvement would never compromise your original charitable intent\u201d.\nMost wealthy philanthropists are keen to involve their children and grandchildren in their charitable work and hand over the reins in due course.\nDarrell West, a vice-president at the Brookings Institution think-tank, says a \u201cmassive intergenerational transfer of wealth\u201d is coming over the next 15 years from the ageing millionaires and billionaires who fund the conservative movement\u2019s think-tanks and educational programmes."}
