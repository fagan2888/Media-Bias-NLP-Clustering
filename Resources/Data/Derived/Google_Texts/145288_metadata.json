Matt Mead\u2019s expansion plan, and a House committee then pulled its bill. The double whammy effectively killed the state\u2019s chances of enacting the Obamacare option this year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLawmakers there acted just days after the Tennessee Legislature shot down an expansion proposal by Gov. Bill Haslam. Together, the two rejections diminish the momentum that Medicaid expansion supporters were enjoying last month, when Indiana Gov. Mike Pence won federal approval of his particular plan and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson agreed to extend that state\u2019s \u201cprivate option\u201d program for 18 months. Both Pence and Hutchinson are also Republicans.\n\nMead had negotiated his alternative approach with federal officials and unveiled it in November. The SHARE plan would have connected participants to work assistance benefits while requiring some beneficiaries to pay co-pays and premiums.\n\nBut after the state Senate defeated it 19-11 on Friday afternoon, the chair of the House\u2019s Labor, Health and Social Services Committee decided its own legislation \u201cwasn\u2019t going to go anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an exercise in futility,\u201d Republican Rep. Elaine Harvey told POLITICO.\n\nArkansas\u2019 bill will soon be heading to Hutchinson\u2019s desk, and the Republican is expected to sign the measure to extend funding of the state\u2019s \u201cprivate option\u201d program through June 2016. The bill easily cleared the three-fourths threshold needed in both chambers of the Legislature, passing 82-12 in the House on Thursday after a 29-2 vote last week in the Senate.\n\nBecause Hutchinson has called for the program to continue until the end of 2016, a separate appropriation will be needed next year to cover that six-month gap. The governor has proposed creation of a task force to devise a replacement for the private option in 2017 and to reform Medicaid more broadly.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "It's another state where a Republican governor\u2019s effort to expand Medicaid has been defeated.", "title": "Wyoming turns down Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/wyoming-not-medicaid-expansion-114977.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/02/06/150206_matt_mead_wyoming_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care,Wyoming,Medicaid", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "It's another state where a Republican governor\u2019s effort to expand Medicaid has been defeated.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6414\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro Wyoming turns down Medicaid expansionWyoming has become yet another state where a Republican governor\u2019s effort to expand Medicaid has been defeated by his own Legislature.\nThe governor has proposed creation of a task force to devise a replacement for the private option in 2017 and to reform Medicaid more broadly.\nAsa Hutchinson agreed to extend that state\u2019s \u201cprivate option\u201d program for 18 months.\nTogether, the two rejections diminish the momentum that Medicaid expansion supporters were enjoying last month, when Indiana Gov.\nStory Continued BelowLawmakers there acted just days after the Tennessee Legislature shot down an expansion proposal by Gov."}
