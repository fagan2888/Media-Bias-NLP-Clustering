Anti-Obamacare wingnuts are carping about healthcare freedom. So it was only a matter of time before the cultured lovers of foie gras coined the term, and the cause, of \u201cculinary freedom\u201d.\n\nIndeed, flying the same (beige? taupe?) banner, a federal judge struck down the state of California\u2019s ban on the yummy concoction that, alas, often is produced by force-feeding geese. Yesterday, California appealed.\n\nContrary to the lofty rhetoric of animal-rights activists and gourmands, however, the court\u2019s opinion actually was based on fairly dull regulatory interpretation. At issue was not the ban on producing foie gras, but the ban on selling it. Here, the court found, California overreached. In fact, the sale of poultry products is regulated by the federal government\u2014in particular, by the Poultry Products Inspection Act. Those federal regulations trump the state regulations. So California can\u2019t make illegal what the feds have made legal.\n\nFoie gras for everyone.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s something ridiculous about the whole controversy. The court\u2019s opinion is littered with jokes like, \u201cDefendants want to have their foie gras and eat it too.\u201d Ludicrously, some Californians set up \u201cduckeasies\u201d that circumvented the sales ban (which went into effect in 2012) by offering foie gras for free. Even the words are silly: fwah grah. So aspirated, so French.\n\nBut underneath the silliness, the battle of the foie may well be a precursor to broader debates about animal rights and food production.\n\nReally, the whole reason we\u2019re talking about foie gras in the first place is that it is a niche product made by small operations without the political clout of, say, Tyson or Perdue. The cruel practices of large-scale poultry, pig, and cattle farming\u2014extensively documented by animal rights activists and filmmakers alike\u2014put force-feeding a few ducks to shame. My unsubstantiated guess is that more chickens suffer in a single day in Arkansas than a year\u2019s worth of ducks fattened up for foie gras.\n\nPlus, foie gras is easy to ban. It\u2019s a luxury item, not a staple. It\u2019s sold in a handful of restaurants and stores to elites; it\u2019s the very opposite of red-meat America. And it\u2019s decadent. Foie gras isn\u2019t a fur coat keeping someone warm in winter\u2014it\u2019s a pointless mink stole. Delightful, but decorative.\n\nBut the same logic behind the foie gras debate holds for far larger questions as well.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s argument, as it files its appeal, is that the ban is not really a food regulation at all. No one is claiming the foie gras is bad for people\u2014the claim is that it\u2019s bad for geese. This is an animal-rights regulation, more like bans on horse-drawn carriages than bans on raw cheese. The PPIA should have nothing to do with it.\n\nBut if that\u2019s true, then couldn\u2019t California also ban bacon from factory-farmed pigs, whose stalls are so small they can\u2019t even sit or turn around? How about chickens whose beaks were singed at birth, or milk from cows sick from drugs and hormones?\n\nIn each of these cases, California wouldn\u2019t be regulating food, exactly\u2014not in the way that the FDA does. They\u2019d be regulating the sale of a product produced in an objectionable way. It could be goose liver, or mink fur\u2014the point is not that the item is a foodstuff, but that it\u2019s the product of what the people of California consider to be torture.\n\nNow, presumably we\u2019d all agree that the state shouldn\u2019t force a single food ethic on everyone. Some of us are vegetarians, some of us are not; some eat only organic, some do not. These are, in a sense, matters of conscience and ethical decision-making, which we ordinarily do not want to assign to the state. Is foie gras really that different?\n\nYet the government dictates ethics all the time, including when it comes to animals. You can\u2019t torture dogs just because you think it\u2019s okay\u2014just ask Michael Vick. Likewise, presumably the state can say that you can\u2019t torture geese by force-feeding them, and can\u2019t make use of the products derived from such a practice.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

It isn\u2019t\u2014certainly not categorically. The ethics of animal use are regulated all the time, even if carriage drivers, French chefs, and dogfighters disagree with the majority. Indeed, even if we disagree about whether \u201canimal rights\u201d exist at all, governments have regulated the treatment of animals since Roman and biblical times.\n\nFoie gras is only a gray area because reasonable people disagree about whether force-feeding constitutes animal cruelty; because relatively few consumers and producers are impacted by these regulations; and because the whole thing is faintly ridiculous.\n\nBut as more and more people raise doubts about the American food supply, and the ways in which it is produced, the gray zone is only going to grow. For now, the Smithfield Foods of the world have captured the legislative process, and ensured that their visions of animal rights (or lack thereof) remain dominant. That may not last forever, however, especially as consumers learn more than they wanted to know about just how that bacon got to the plate.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "jaymichaelson"}, "keywords": "U.S. News,", "publicationDate": 201502061045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/us-news", "description": "California\u2019s fight over trendy goose liver seems ridiculous, but it may be a harbinger of bigger debates to come about animal rights and food production.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "You'll Pry This Foie Gras From My Cold, Dead Hands", "tags": "topic:us-news", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"You\\\\u0027ll Pry This Foie Gras From My Cold, Dead Hands\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/06/you-ll-pry-this-foie-gras-from-my-cold-dead-hands.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/06/you-ll-pry-this-foie-gras-from-my-cold-dead-hands/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47440650.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/06/you-ll-pry-this-foie-gras-from-my-cold-dead-hands\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-06T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"U.S. News\",\"author\":\"Jay Michaelson\",\"tags\":[\"us-news\"]}", "news_keywords": "US News", "sectionTaxanomies": "us-news", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jay Michaelson", "article": {"section": "us-news", "published_time": "2015-02-06T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jay-michaelsonhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/06/you-ll-pry-this-foie-gras-from-my-cold-dead-hands", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "California\u2019s fight over trendy goose liver seems ridiculous, but it may be a harbinger of bigger debates to come about animal rights and food production.", "title": "You'll Pry This Foie Gras From My Cold, Dead Hands", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/06/you-ll-pry-this-foie-gras-from-my-cold-dead-hands.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/06/you-ll-pry-this-foie-gras-from-my-cold-dead-hands/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1423219518293.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jay-michaelson", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd302\"", "article_summary": "So it was only a matter of time before the cultured lovers of foie gras coined the term, and the cause, of \u201cculinary freedom\u201d.\nNo one is claiming the foie gras is bad for people\u2014the claim is that it\u2019s bad for geese.\nAt issue was not the ban on producing foie gras, but the ban on selling it.\nBut the same logic behind the foie gras debate holds for far larger questions as well.\nFoie gras isn\u2019t a fur coat keeping someone warm in winter\u2014it\u2019s a pointless mink stole."}
