Counihan said Alabama hit that number at the end of December 2015, one month before open enrollment ends.\n\nMore young people are also purchasing health insurance through the exchange this year, Counihan said. An infusion of young customers may encourage insurance companies to enter or stay on the exchange, he said.\n\n\"I think the best thing we can do is grow the customer base and create a vibrant market with a good mix of risk,\" Counihan said.\n\nEnrollment has exceeded expectations this year. Many experts and officials expected growth to slow substantially this year because many of the older and sicker customers who needed insurance coverage had already enrolled.\n\nCounihan said more customers are enrolling to avoid tax penalties of at least $695. Those penalties don't apply to customers who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, but too little for subsidized insurance on the exchange. Open enrollments ends on Jan. 31.\n\nHealthcare.gov also introduced several new features this year to make the site more user-friendly, including tools that allow users to estimate out-of-pocket expenses and search plans by doctor or hospital.\n\n\"Buying health insurance is not easy and simple, but our job is to make it easier and simpler,\" he said.\n\nBut the enrollment period hasn't been completely uneventful. Demand overwhelmed the system on Dec. 15 \u2013 the deadline to purchase insurance that would start on Jan. 1 \u2013 and officials extended the deadline by two days.\n\n\"You build these waiting rooms to accommodate big surges,\" Counihan said. \"What we saw was a strong, stable system that withstood the pressure.\"\n\nIn Alabama, navigators, brokers and others raised concerns about competition on the exchange. Three health insurance companies offer plans in the state, but one has said it could leave the exchange next year. Counihan also said they discussed outreach efforts in communities with limited access to the internet.\n\nCounihan visited Birmingham on Wednesday, following stops in Louisiana and Mississippi earlier this week. He met at Princeton Baptist Medical Center with officials from Enroll Alabama, Birmingham Health Care and the Dannon Project, groups that promote health insurance enrollment.\n\nHis visit happened on the same day that Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives promised to deliver a bill to President Barack Obama that would repeal much of the Affordable Care Act. Counihan declined to comment on the bill.\n\n\"I got hired to keep the trains running on time,\" he said. \"The politics of it are above my pay grade.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kevin Counihan, health insurance, Obamacare, news", "title": "Obamacare enrollment could hit 200,000 in Alabama", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Enrollment in health insurance in Alabama has already hit the final number for last year, a month ahead of schedule.
