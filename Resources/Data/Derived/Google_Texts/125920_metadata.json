But there is a way to help employees feel a little more secure in the workplace.\n\nWhat would you do if a shooter came into your place of work? Do you know where there are emergency exits or shelter during a storm?\n\nThese are the questions that could mean life or death in any emergency situation.\n\n\"The more things that we prepare for. The more responses that we train our employees for. The better they are to handle those unexpected things. And it becomes second nature,\" said Kathy Jacobs, Director of Environmental Safety and Emergency Preparedness for Avera McKennan.\n\n\n\nKathy Jacobs with Avera McKennan says they train their staff to be prepared at all times, for any circumstance. The best way to do that is with repetitive reminders.\n\n\"We start with our children at a very young age. When they're in school we teach them how to respond. They have fire drills in school. They have other kinds of disaster drills that they do in school. So as adults, why aren't we doing the same thing,\" said Jacobs.\n\nEven though the shooting at Pro-Tech is fresh on people's minds, there are other emergencies everyone should be ready for.\n\nOne way to get that training now, is by contacting the Sioux Falls Police Department.\n\n\"We can come out and talk about safety for their building. We can come out and talk to their employees and address their concerns. Or even if they want to use our expertise and reviewing their policies. We'll be helpful in that also,\" said Sioux Falls Police Officer, Jim Larson.\n\nEven if your company never has to utilize these life saving skills, the fact that they are armed with this knowledge could make the workplace a better environment for everyone.\n\n\"We're not going to come in and be able to give you an exact example of what may happen. But by doing these exercises, by doing this training, it gives those employees the ability to if they're out in their normal life and something were to happen at a mall or movie theatre, those things. It gives them options. It gets their brains thinking and they're able to react quicker,\" said Larson.\n\nIn the case of an emergency, Officer Larson says having a floor plan of your building ready for emergency responders helps them to do their job more efficiently.\n\nNews\n\nGeneral {{Title}} Remove Change News General Courts Web Only Crime Outdoors Events Center Non-Homepage Boredom Busters Pipeline Positively KELOLAND Technology Hunger Affordable Care Act Shops Flooding Remembering 9/11 Drought JazzFest Spring Storm Honor Flight Spencer Anniversary\n\nDoApp Health News Business News Sports\n\nAgriculture Markets Livestock Crops Politics\n\nHealthBeat Cancer Children's Health Heart Health Wellness & Nutrition General Health Beat Women's Health RX Resources What's Going Around OTC Diabetes Recalls Dental Health Men's Health\n\nPolitics South Dakota Legislature Budget Congress Taxes General Local Campaign President US Senate New Laws US House Iowa Ballot Issues Local Races Minnesota Gubernatorial\n\nEducation Funding College Elementary High School Pre K School Supplies Middle School\n\nSports Professional College High School Sports Zone Headlines Summit League Tournament Olympics\n\nBusiness Industry Your Money Matters Development Gas & Energy Legislation Economy/Stocks Employment General Health Care Technology Education Funding Tourism Banking/Finance Housing Transportation Insurance Meetings & Events Retail & Restaurants All Industries On The Move Shops Agriculture\n\nFeatured Stories Eye on KELOLAND Inside KELOLAND\n\nWeather Snow Forecast Records Rain Flooding Drought WX Corner General\n\nWorld News\n\nInvestigates GEAR UP\n\nSponsored Done\n\n\u00a9 2016 KELOLAND TV.
