Mike Lee's Tea Party rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union speech. Read full speech coverage from U.S. News here.\n\nGood evening.\n\nI\u2019m Senator Mike Lee, from Utah.\n\nIn the few minutes I have tonight \u2013 I\u2019d like to speak especially to those Americans who may feel they have been forgotten by both political parties:\n\nThose individuals and families who work hard, play by the rules, balance their budgets, honor the Golden Rule ... and don\u2019t understand why their government in Washington can\u2019t do the same.\n\nYou are probably as frustrated as I am about an ever-growing government that somehow thinks it is okay to lie to, spy on and even target its own citizens. Many hard-working Americans are discouraged and wondering what, if anything, can be done.\n\nI believe we need to do what Americans have always done \u2013 come together and press for positive change. Protesting against dysfunctional government is a great American tradition, going back to the original Tea Party in Boston, about 240 years ago. Americans have a natural instinct to stand up and speak out when they know something is wrong.\n\n[READ: Republicans Propose Broad School Choice Plan]\n\nIn 1773, Americans had simply had it with a London-based national government that had become too big, too expensive and far too intrusive.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that had the founding generation stopped at just protesting against the kind of government Americans did not want, the Boston Tea Party would have been little more than a footnote in history. At most, it would have been remembered as just one more futile protest against an abusive national government.\n\nFortunately for all of us, those early patriots moved on from Boston and moved past their protest against the government they didn\u2019t want. They marched forward on a road toward the kind of government they did want.\n\nIt took them 14 long years to get from Boston to Philadelphia, where they created, with our Constitution, the kind of government they did want.\n\nIn America, the test of any political movement is not what that movement is against, but what it is for. The founders made a point at Boston Harbor, but they made history in Philadelphia\u2019s Independence Hall.\n\n[OPINION: Mike Lee Points the Way to a Conservative Revival]\n\nUnfortunately, in recent years, we have had no choice but to engage in a number of protests against our current president\u2019s Washington-centered agenda.\n\nAs Americans we must always be willing to fight the Boston-type battles -\u2014 boldly calling out bad policy whenever we see it \u2014 but we must do so with an eye toward Philadelphia, maintaining a positive focus on the kind of nation we want to be and become.\n\nToday, Americans know in their hearts that something is wrong. Much of what is wrong relates to the sense that the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d is falling out of reach for far too many of us. We are facing an inequality crisis \u2014 one to which the President has paid lip-service, but seems uninterested in truly confronting or correcting.\n\nThis inequality crisis presents itself in three principal forms:\n\nimmobility among the poor, who are being trapped in poverty by big-government programs;\n\ninsecurity in the middle class, where families are struggling just to get by and can\u2019t seem to get ahead;\n\nand cronyist privilege at the top, where political and economic insiders twist the immense power of the federal government to profit at the expense of everyone else.\n\nTo be fair, President Obama and his party did not create all of these problems. The Republican Establishment in Washington can be just as out-of-touch as the Democratic Establishment.\n\nHowever, tonight, as on numerous occasions of late, the President\u2019s lofty rhetoric ignored the fact that his administration continues to leave poor and middle-class families further behind, while he and his allies insist that the real problem is \u201cinequality\u201d itself.\n\nBut where does this new inequality come from? From government \u2014 every time it takes rights and opportunities away from the American people and gives them instead to politicians, bureaucrats, and special interests.\n\nInequality \u2013 real inequality - is trapping poor children in failing schools to benefit bureaucrats and union bosses. It\u2019s penalizing low-income parents for getting married, or getting better jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s guaranteeing insurance companies taxpayer bailouts if Obamacare cuts into their profits.\n\nInequality is blocking thousands of middle-class jobs in the energy industry as a favor to partisan donors and radical environmental activists.\n\nInequality is denying viable, unborn children any protection under the law, while exempting unsanitary, late-term abortion clinics from basic safety standards.\n\nIt\u2019s denying citizens their right to define marriage in their states as traditionally or as broadly as their diverse values dictate.\n\nIt\u2019s the federal government hurting rural communities, especially in the west, by controlling and mismanaging public lands.\n\nIt\u2019s changing laws without congressional approval, and spying on American citizens without constitutional authority.\n\nAnd of course, Obamacare \u2013 all by itself \u2013 is an inequality Godzilla that has robbed working families of their insurance, their doctors, their wages and their jobs. Many Americans are now seeing why some of us fought so hard to stop this train-wreck over the last four years.\n\nGovernment-driven inequality is the reason why, as hard-working families across the country struggle to make ends meet, six of the ten wealthiest counties in America are now suburbs of Washington, D.C.\n\nThroughout the last five years, President Obama has promised an economy for the middle class; but all he\u2019s delivered is an economy for the middle-men.\n\nAnd tonight his party cheered as he asked for more of the same, as if the solution to inequality were ... well ... more inequality.\n\nCritics might push back and argue that my own party has been part of the problem, too often joining the Democrats to rig our economy to benefit the well-connected at the expense of the disconnected.\n\nI know, because I\u2019m one of those critics.\n\nBut I\u2019m speaking to you tonight because I think maybe - just maybe - that\u2019s finally starting to change.\n\nAs a nation we are, once again, at a critical turning point.\n\nNow, as in 1773, Americans have had it with our out-of-touch national government. But if all we do is protest, our Boston Tea Party moment will occupy little more than a footnote in our history.\n\nHopefully our leaders, reformers and citizens will join the journey from Boston to Philadelphia \u2013 from protest to progress. Together we can march forward and take the road that leads to the kind of government we do want.\n\nWe have a new generation of leaders in Washington with positive, innovative ideas \u2013 thoughtful policy reforms to, as my friend Senator Ted Cruz says \u2013\u201cMake D.C. listen.\u201d Reforms to help poor families work their way into the middle class, to help middle-class families start to get ahead, and to level the playing field and put corporate and political insiders back to work for the rest of us.\n\nConservative reformers like Senator Marco Rubio, Congressman Paul Ryan and Congressman Jim Jordan are working on new welfare-reform ideas to help underprivileged families escape poverty.\n\nSenator Rand Paul and I are working with some of the most liberal Democrats in Congress to reform the federal criminal-justice system \u2013 to help keep violent predators behind bars while creating opportunities for reformed, non-violent offenders to return to the families and neighborhoods that so desperately need them.\n\nSenator John Cornyn has legislation that would empower states to improve K-12 education across the country. Senator Tim Scott has reforms to improve our job-training programs. And I\u2019ve introduced a bill to modernize higher education, making it more accessible and affordable for lower-income and non-traditional students.\n\nCongressman Tom Graves has a transportation-reform bill to ensure our infrastructure dollars are invested in roads and bridges, and not wasted on bureaucrats and special interests.\n\nCongressman Mike Pompeo introduced a bill to end all federal subsidies for the energy industry. And others are working on proposals to do the same for every industry \u2013 so that business profits are won from customers, not through political connections. After all, if we\u2019re going to reform welfare, we really should start with corporate welfare.\n\nOne proposal that should directly help you and your family is a bill I have introduced to simplify our tax code, and provide relief from the hidden double-tax Washington currently imposes on working parents, especially moms and dads in the middle class.\n\nWhen it comes to healthcare, we know the best way to repeal Obamacare is to deliver better solutions.\n\nWe can\u2019t just return to the old system. Healthcare policy used to give too much power to insurance companies; Obamacare now gives far too much power to government. We know that real reform will put healthcare dollars and decisions where they belong, in the hands of patients and families and their doctors and nurses.\n\nSo reformers in both the House and the Senate are hard at work developing new, patient-centered reforms to control healthcare costs, ensure access to affordable coverage for all Americans, and provide extra help for the poor and the sick.\n\nAll of these proposals within this new conservative reform agenda, along with many more to come, mark the road to Philadelphia. These principles and these policies will work - and will put Americans back to work.\n\nNot just by cutting big government, but by fixing broken government. Not just by making government smaller but by promoting bigger citizens, stronger families and more heroic communities. Our goal should be an America where everyone has a fair chance to pursue happiness - and find it. That\u2019s what it looks like when protest grows into reform.\n\nSo if you\u2019re one of those Americans that big government is leaving behind... if you work hard, play by the rules and teach your kids to do the same, I want you to know that your family will not be forgotten anymore.\n\nThis new generation of reformers still has a long way to go to win over our Party in Washington, and even further to go to earn your trust.\n\nI am confident that our best days as a nation are ahead of us \u2013 not because of government, but because within America\u2019s diverse society of individuals and families, neighborhoods and churches, businesses and communities, freedom doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re on your own. Freedom means we\u2019re all in this together.\n\nI invite you to join us on the road to a more prosperous America \u2013 together we can create the kind of government we do want and the kind of nation our children and grandchildren deserve.\n\nThank you very much for your time.
