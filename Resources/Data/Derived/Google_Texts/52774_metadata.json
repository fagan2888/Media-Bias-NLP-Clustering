Government forces have also been accused of executing ethnic Tamil rebel leaders who tried to surrender.\n\nU.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay announced Wednesday a heavyweight panel including a Nobel laureate and a former judge on a U.N.-backed tribunal trying former Cambodian leaders for genocide and war crimes, to advise a 10-month investigation by her office. Its goal, laid out in a U.S.-backed resolution, is to establish the facts about alleged abuses by both sides in the conflict, \u201cwith a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability.\u201d\n\nThe government denies its forces targeted civilians or committed serious abuses in defeating the Tamil Tigers\u2019 26-year rebellion for an ethnic homeland.\n\n\u201cWe have taken the view that this investigation is utterly uncalled for,\u201d said Palitha Kohona, who was Sri Lanka\u2019s foreign secretary at the end of the war and now serves as ambassador to the U.N. \u201cIt\u2019s like this poor third-world country is being punished in an unforgiving manner for having defeated a terrorist group.\u201d\n\nBut the allegations could prove worrying to the ruling circle of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, notwithstanding his tightened grip on power at home in the five years since the fighting ended.\n\nIn particular, one of his brothers, Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who is a U.S. citizen, has been dogged by allegations that he ordered rebel leaders killed. A recent report by a South African human rights lawyer also examines what Kohona knew of a purported surrender deal and the role of a senior military officer, who now serves as Kohona\u2019s deputy at the U.N.\n\nForeign diplomats say that in the final two days of the war in May 2009, the Tigers\u2019 top two political chiefs, Balasingham Nadesan and S. Pulidevan, had expressed a desire to surrender \u2014 a message diplomats conveyed to Sri Lankan leaders \u2014 but ended up dead. Six months later, victorious army chief Sarath Fonseka told a Sri Lankan newspaper that the defense secretary had ordered the commander of the army\u2019s 58th Division, which pressed the final offensive, to kill rebel leaders attempting to surrender. Fonseka, who emerged as an opposition leader after the war, said he was misquoted, but was still sentenced to three years in prison for his comments under harsh emergency laws in a 2011 trial. He was freed in 2012.\n\nGotabhaya Rajapaksa is a decorated Sri Lankan army officer who migrated to the U.S. in the 1990s and worked in information technology before returning to his homeland in 2005 to support his brother\u2019s election as president. Although residing in Sri Lanka, as a U.S. citizen he could potentially face prosecution under a U.S. war crimes statute.\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment whether it has investigated the possible involvement of U.S. citizens in war crimes in the South Asia nation. The statute, passed in 1996, has yet to be used.\n\nBut the Sri Lankan government has in the past complained to Washington about U.S. authorities probing Rajapaksa. A November 2009 diplomatic cable published by Wikileaks reproduces a diplomatic note Sri Lanka sent to the State Department after Fonseka, at the time a U.S. green card holder, was called for interview by the Department of Homeland Security in Oklahoma City during a visit to the U.S. The cable says that Fonseka was told \u201cthe intention behind the request for the interview is to use him \u2018as a source against human rights violations done by Secretary/Defence\u2019.\u201d\n\nFonseka left the country before the scheduled interview, but the U.S. Embassy in Colombo noted in the cable, \u201cthe prospect of U.S. officials questioning Fonseka regarding Gotabhaya Rajapaksa\u2019s actions during the conflict clearly is of great concern in Colombo and puts the leadership in a tight spot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New UN rights probe intensifies pressure on SLanka", "author": "Matthew Pennington", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New UN rights probe intensifies pressure on SLanka", "title": "New UN rights probe intensifies pressure on SLanka", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/30/new_un_rights_probe_intensifies_pressure_on_slanka/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/sri-lanka-white-flag.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New UN rights probe intensifies pressure on SLanka", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/sri-lanka-white-flag.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "New UN rights probe intensifies pressure on SLanka", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "New UN rights probe intensifies pressure on SLanka", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9a2\"", "article_summary": "The Department of Justice declined to comment whether it has investigated the possible involvement of U.S. citizens in war crimes in the South Asia nation.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A new U.N. investigation into allegations of war crimes in Sri Lanka will intensify international pressure on its government and could probe the purported responsibility of senior Sri Lankan officials with U.S. ties.\nAlthough residing in Sri Lanka, as a U.S. citizen he could potentially face prosecution under a U.S. war crimes statute.\nBut the Sri Lankan government has in the past complained to Washington about U.S. authorities probing Rajapaksa.\nGovernment forces have also been accused of executing ethnic Tamil rebel leaders who tried to surrender."}
