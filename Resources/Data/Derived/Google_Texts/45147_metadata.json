A judge might carve out an exemption for the practice in question, and life would go on as usual for everyone else.\n\nBut after years of culture wars, and amid recent gains for gay rights, the politics of religious liberty has been transformed. Now exemptions are being sought by the largest faith groups in the country, the burning issues are marriage and sex, and the term religious freedom has taken on a new, politicized meaning.\n\n\u201cThings have changed dramatically in the last 20 years,\u201d said Michael Moreland, vice dean and professor at Villanova University Law School. \u201cBack then, the Catholic Church wasn\u2019t very often in the position of needing exemptions.\u201d\n\nThe new terms of the debate were on display in the recent Hobby Lobby case over birth control coverage for workers.\n\nThe plaintiff was a multibillion-dollar arts and crafts chain owned by conservative Christians. At stake was broader access to contraception for many women. And the religious leaders championing the Hobby Lobby case were from the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention \u2013 the largest and second-largest denominations in the country.\n\nThe justices ruled June 30 that Hobby Lobby and other closely held private businesses with religious objections could opt out of providing the free contraceptive coverage required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMany opponents, outraged by the decision, vowed they would fight to repeal the law at the center of the case: the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a moment a quarter century ago where it\u2019s small religious minorities who want to do their thing in private to very large religious minorities \u2013 Catholics and evangelicals and Mormons \u2013 who feel they\u2019re being oppressed by a hostile society,\u201d said Mark Silk, director of the Leonard Greenberg Center for the Study of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re talking about potentially significant numbers of women who do not get contraceptive coverage, or significant numbers of men and women who are gay and lesbian,\u201d said Silk.\n\nContinue reading \u2192\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Story Filed Under", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Religion, Religious Freedom", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LGBTQ Nation", "description": "Not long ago, when religious liberty cases reached the courts, the people seeking protection for their beliefs were mostly from small faith groups and their lawyers were liberals.
