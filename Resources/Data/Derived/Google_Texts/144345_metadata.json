Pete Sessions, R-Dallas.\n\n\u201cA feisty fighter for freedom, Katrina is taking on a powerful incumbent who has so lost touch with the people of his district that he\u2019s not even bothering to spend much time in Texas anymore,\u201d Palin posted on her Facebook page. \u201cIt\u2019s not only his district he\u2019s lost touch with, but also the issues important to the voters there. He used his powerful position to oppose the movement to defund Obamacare, has voted to raise the debt ceiling, and has been an advocate for the NSA intrusion into our freedoms.\u201d\n\nCritics have charged Sessions with spending less time in his district than in Florida, where his wife lives. Palin\u2019s attacks echo those from Pierson, who says that Sessions lacks commitment to conservative values and hasn\u2019t fought hard enough to cut government spending and repeal Obamacare.\n\nPalin, a one-term Alaska governor and 2008 GOP nominee for vice president, remains a star in tea party circles. She urged conservatives to take advantage of early voting to cast ballots for Pierson.\n\nShe also put her support behind Greg Abbott in his race for governor.\n\nPierson is hoping to rev up tea party support. She\u2019s basked in the praise of Sen. Ted Cruz, and collected a more explicit endorsement from his father, Rafael Cruz.\n\nSessions, chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee and a member of the House GOP leadership, remains the favorite, with fundraising that vastly overshadows that of his rival.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMi9zYXJhaC1wYWxpbi1zdXBwb3J0cy1rYXRyaW5hLXBpZXJzb24tamFicy1hdC1wZXRlLXNlc3Npb25zLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Nick Swartsell", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "WASHINGTON-- Sarah Palin gave a glowing social media shoutout today to Katrina Pierson, throwing her support to Pierson's bid to unseat Rep.
