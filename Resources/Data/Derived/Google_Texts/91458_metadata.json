Frank Pallone in the November general election.\n\nOriginally from Westfield, with an undergraduate degree from Middlebury (also Pallone\u2019s alma mater), a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA from the Wharton School of Business, the GOP candidate moved to Atlantic Highlands in 2007 where he occupies a seat on the local board of education.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s motivating me to run as that I reached out to Pallone\u2019s office a number of times and never got a response,\u201d Sonnek-Schmelz, 39, told PolitickerNJ. \u201cConstituent service is so important.\u201d\n\nRather than get discouraged, he decided to personally run against Pallone, who for years has handed every Republican thrown at him, from state Senator Joe Kyrillos (R-13) back in the 1990s to then-Atlantic Highlands Mayor Anna Little in 2010 and 2012.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of things he has not done well, including, as I said, just a general sense of not really listening to constituents,\u201d said the Republican hopeful.\n\nSonnek-Schmelz said he believes time in office has something to do with what he perceives as Pallone\u2019s constituent resistance.\n\nHe favors term limits, in fact: ten years and out. \u201cThere are lots of congresspeople doing a wonderful job over a longer period of time, but too many have been there for too long.\u201d\n\nIf elected, the Republican candidate said he would make constituent service his top priority. \u201cI want to be the voice of the people every day,\u201d he said. He would focus on small business and jobs creation. \u201cI know the agony people go through everyday with so many hurdles and roadblocks throughout the regulatory system,\u201d said the co-owner of the family business Soccer Post.\u201dI\u2019m going to focus on streamlining the process so that the basic structure allows them to succeed in business.\u201d\n\nHe also wants to get rid of Obamacare and roll back the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIts implementation was very painful to people. Premiums, co-pays and deductibles are up and benefits down for a lot of people in my district.\u201d\n\nFocused on his own campaign, which he promises will be well-funded and aggressive in the Democratic-leaning district, Sonnek-Schmelz does not at present have a preferred presidential candidate.\n\n\u201ci am supporting whoever is above me on the ticket,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, an energized Pallone at the Monmouth County Democratic Convention derided Republicans \u2013 and the party prez front-runner Donald Trump in particular \u2013 as nativist blockades to human progress, drawing a very positive response in the roomful of party diehards.\n\nSonnek-Schmelz doesn\u2019t necessarily see his party\u2019s current volatility as a bad thing.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our party, we have the opportunity here,\u201d he said. \u201cIn times of turmoil, there is the greatest opportunity for change and good. We have the opportunity to double down and address why people are unhappy or feel left behind by the pace of the world. The Republican Party can and will make sure we remain the land of opportunity.\n\n\u201cHillary\u2019s not the greatest candidate on the other side and Pallone\u2019s run for 28 years,\u201d Sonnek-Schmelz added. \u201cSome say it\u2019s never a good year, but I think I\u2019m going to be a great candidate. I\u2019m going to go at it hard. I\u2019m going to run the kind of campaign that has not happened for a long time in this district.\u201d\n\nHe says he a great network and plans to raise competitive money.\n\nOn the issues front, the candidate decried President Barack Obama\u2019s decision to stay in Cuba in the aftermath of the Brussels terror killings.\n\n\u201cI think President Obama needs to reassess how he acts in times of crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not the right response for the leader of the free world.\u201d\n\nWhatever his personal views on the subject, he accepts the Supreme Court\u2019s safe and legal abortions as the law of the land. \u201cI\u2019m not going to spend time on [abortion]. My job is to focus on economic issues,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate\u2019s opposition to giving Obama Supreme Court nominee Judge Merrick Garland a hearing, Sonnek-Schmelz said, \u201cObama clearly has the right to nominate someone, and the senate has to determine how to deal with that. ..The senate has some obligation. The question is around when. Are they obligated within eight months or after?\u201d\n\nOn foreign policy, he describes himself as a devotee of Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cspeak softly and carry a big stick\u201d philosophy.\n\n\u201cI think that torture in any way, including waterboarding, gives us false answers and it\u2019s often wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nTaking a question apropos of Trump\u2019s campaign decree to ban MUslims fromthe United States, Sonnek-Schmelz said, \u201cWe\u2019re a nation made up of a variety of backgrounds. Banning Muslims is a very slippery slope, similar to when we interred Japanese Americans in WWII. We have to be really careful about who we let across the border. If you look at the situation in Europe, there are too many people flowing through who are ISIS. \u2026We have to manage the process a lot better. We can\u2019t have a leaky faucet.\u201d\n\nRegarding the national and state level push for a $15 minimum wage, Sonnek-Schmelz said that hike would hurt small businesses.\n\nUltimately, said the candidate, \u201cIt\u2019s alll about jobs and the economy, transparency, and efficiency in government. Bottom line. That\u2019s what I care about: making sure people can care for their families. Government right now is too big, too complex, and too convoluted. I\u2019m an attorney with two ivy league degrees, I\u2019m a smart guy, and much of the time I can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. We have to change it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/brent.jpg?w=50", "description": "It's difficult for American history buffs not to get excited about a candidate who nails a Civil War Who Wants to be a Millionaire question about the Monitor and Merrimac, but notwithstanding the $100,000 cash haul he won on the TV game show, Brent Sonnek-Schmelz intends to put his focus less on the 19th Century and wholly on the here and now.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "It\u2019s difficult for American history buffs not to get excited about a candidate who nails a Civil War Who Wants to be a Millionaire question about the Monitor and Merrimac, but notwithstanding\u2026", "title": "CD6 Republican Brent Sonnek-Schmelz: The PolitickerNJ Interview", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2016/03/cd6-republican-brent-sonnek-schmelz-the-politickernj-interview/", "image": {"width": 552, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/brent.jpg", "height": 552}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/brent.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-23 13:23:37", "sailthru.title": "CD6 Republican Brent Sonnek-Schmelz: The PolitickerNJ Interview", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "cd6, frank pallone, brent sonnek-schmelz", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2016-03-23T18:23:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-23T18:23:37+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/max"}, "sailthru.description": "It's difficult for American history buffs not to get excited about a candidate who nails a Civil War Who Wants to be a Millionaire question about the Monitor and Merrimac, but notwithstanding the $100,000 cash haul he won on the TV game show, Brent Sonnek-Schmelz intends to put his focus less on the 19th Century and wholly on the here and now.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/brent.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "CD6, Frank Pallone, Brent Sonnek-Schmelz"}, "article_summary": "The Republican Party can and will make sure we remain the land of opportunity.\n\u201cHillary\u2019s not the greatest candidate on the other side and Pallone\u2019s run for 28 years,\u201d Sonnek-Schmelz added.\n\u201cSome say it\u2019s never a good year, but I think I\u2019m going to be a great candidate.\nSonnek-Schmelz said he believes time in office has something to do with what he perceives as Pallone\u2019s constituent resistance.\n\u201cThere are lots of congresspeople doing a wonderful job over a longer period of time, but too many have been there for too long.\u201dIf elected, the Republican candidate said he would make constituent service his top priority."}
