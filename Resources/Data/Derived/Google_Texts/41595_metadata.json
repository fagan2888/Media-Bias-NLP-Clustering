Hobby Lobby, though far less consequential to ObamaCare, stood in stark contrast to the court\u2019s decision two years earlier to uphold the law\u2019s individual mandate.\n\nThat ruling, a triumph for Obama, had enraged the political right, with feelings of betrayal deepened by the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative, authored the opinion.\n\nThe Roberts court, however, has returned to favor within conservative circles, following the recent decisions. Business groups and congressional Republicans issued a cascade of statements on Monday, praising both the Hobby Lobby ruling and a second opinion chipping away at public union power.\n\nIn the latter case, Harris v. Quinn, the court ruled that certain state workers could not be forced to pay union fees.\n\nThe two rulings came days after the court deemed as unconstitutional a series of appointments President Obama made two years ago to fill vacancies at the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe finding that Obama overstepped in making the recess appointments when the Senate was in session was seen as a direct rebuke to Obama\u2019s exertion of executive authority.\n\nTom Goldstein, an attorney who has argued dozens of cases before the Supreme Court and publishes the SCOTUSblog providing analysis of the high court, called the ruling Obama\u2019s most definitive loss of the term.\n\nBy Goldstein\u2019s tally, the administration participated in 7 of the 9 biggest cases before the Supreme Court and lost all but two.\n\n\u201cThey did take some significant hits,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it really wasn\u2019t their fault.\u201d\n\nThe government, Goldstein said, found itself on the losing end of arguments that any administration would have been compelled to make, including the unsuccessful defense of police authority to search cellphones of people they arrest.\n\nEarlier this term, the court struck down decades-old limits on an individual\u2019s aggregate political contributions over the course of a single election cycle in a case known as the Federal Election Commission v. McCutcheon.\n\nThough Obama administration officials did not impose the campaign finance regulations, the case involved \u201cdefending values and policies that they hold dear,\u201d said Tom Donnelly, counsel for the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center.\n\nDonnelly described the outcome of that case as an \u201cimportant loss\u201d for the administration.\n\nStill, Donnelly and other observers of the court say many of the losses could have been much worse for the administration, had conservatives had their way. In McCutcheon, for instance, Justice Clarence Thomas had sought to do away with campaign contribution limits.\n\nIn the Harris case, organized labor technically lost but averted a ruling that some viewed as a potential \u201ckill shot\u201d for public unions. In Hobby Lobby, the court ruled against Obama but offered the administration an alternative way to accomplish its goal of providing female workers access to free contraception.\n\nDonnelly said the rulings come amid \u201ca lot of boundary testing\u201d on the part of conservative litigants and legal groups.\n\nThe White House pushed back this week against assertions that the term saw the court push the law in a conservative direction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d hesitate to make a broad assessment like that from this podium,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\n\nIndeed, the Obama administration claimed some victories at the court in recent months.\n\nIn April, the court upheld a rule allowing the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate power plant pollution that crosses state lines.\n\nThat case was followed this month with a mixed ruling that found EPA overreach under the Clean Air Act but largely upheld the agency\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCiting a litany of rulings that, though cheered by conservatives, would ultimately do little to impede the administration\u2019s agenda, Marty Lederman, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, said suggestions of a rout this term were greatly exaggerated.\n\n\u201cThe government did as well as it could have, given the docket,\u201d Lederman said. \u201cIn case after case, the government either prevailed or avoided results that would have been seriously damaging.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cThis was a rough year for the administration,\u201d UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said.", "description": "\u201cThis was a rough year for the administration,\u201d UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Benjamin Goad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cThis was a rough year for the administration,\u201d UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said.", "title": "SCOTUS\u2019s shellacking of Obama", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/211133-scotuss-shellacking-of-obama", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack_061914getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-02T14:53:10-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/211133-scotuss-shellacking-of-obama", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cThis was a rough year for the administration,\u201d UCLA law professor Adam Winkler said.", "card": "summary", "title": "SCOTUS\u2019s shellacking of Obama"}, "dcterms.modified": "2014-07-02T14:53-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/211133-scotuss-shellacking-of-obama", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-02T06:01-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Barack Obama, John Roberts,Supreme Court, National Labor Relations Board", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-02T06:01:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-02T14:53:10-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "SCOTUS\u2019s shellacking of Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8e7\"", "article_summary": "But, with some notable exceptions, the White House found itself on the losing end of most of the term\u2019s biggest cases.\nThe White House has had losses in cases involving campaign finance, organized labor and the limits of presidential power, among others.\nIndeed, the Obama administration claimed some victories at the court in recent months.\n\u201cI\u2019d hesitate to make a broad assessment like that from this podium,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\nOn paper, the Obama administration actually fared better in the just-concluded term than it has in the last few years, with the solicitor general prevailing 60 percent of the time, Winkler said."}
