Now he is ending his second term by again responding too late to a huge, looming budget deficit.\n\nHowever, when the history of the O'Malley years is assessed by scholars decades from now, what will stand out is the ease with which Maryland navigated the Great Recession -- the nation's worst economic decline since the 1930s.\n\nThe credit belongs to Martin O'Malley.\n\nHe eventually bit the bullet and did what Democrats hate above all else -- he cut back on government services to the middle and lower classes, especially those who need a helping hand.\n\nHe found ways, though, to temper these hammer blows -- shifting large sums from flush government accounts, borrowing heavily on the bond market, converting cash payments for farmland and Chesapeake Bay preservation into 15-year bonds and raiding the transportation fund.\n\nTurning to taxes\n\nWhen that wasn't enough, O'Malley taxed the wealthy, raised the corporate tax, raised the sales tax, raised the tobacco and alcohol taxes and the gasoline tax.\n\nThese weren't popular moves, but it meant that social services for those without much money or with disabilities still could turn to Annapolis for assistance.\n\nIt still remains a mystery why O'Malley, who had weathered a host of fiscal storms as mayor of Baltimore for eight years, hesitated to recognize the brewing recession as he took office.\n\nLegislative analysts already were predicting a future budget hole of $1.5 billion. Yet O'Malley ignored these forecasts.\n\nInstead, in his first budget he hiked school construction handouts to a record $400 million, froze tuition for state college students by pouring extra funds into those institutions, and stripped the state's Rainy Day fund of $1 billion to paper over Maryland's financial woes.\n\nStorm clouds\n\nEven as O'Malley's initial budget was being passed, though, the state's sales tax collections were declining as were other revenue sources. Loud alarms should have sounded in the governor's office.\n\nWithin months, O'Malley was forced to backtrack. He raised a slew of taxes, cut his initial budget requests and reversed his opposition to casino gambling.\n\nThe state's worsening fiscal reality followed O'Malley throughout his two terms.\n\nBy the end, he was still unwilling to take proactive steps in mid-2014 to prevent what became an 18-month, $1.2 billion fiscal hole created by an agonizingly slow economic recovery and budget reductions coming from Washington.\n\nOnly in the past week did the governor seek $400 million in reductions so he could leave office with his final budget in balance.\n\nYet his last-minute actions did nothing to close the $800 million budget hole he bequeaths to Gov.-elect Larry Hogan Jr.\n\nBig government\n\nO'Malley's budget hold-downs also were never meant to represent a permanent reduction in state government's expanding role in Maryland society.\n\nHe is a strong believer in the good that government can do for people. He wants to deliver more education help, more health care access, more social services for the state's underclass and more aid to the counties and the middle class.\n\nO'Malley's faith in Big Government puts him on the far left of the Democratic Party's spectrum. \"Big things done well make even bigger things possible,\" he said early in his first term. He still feels that way.\n\nThe governor certainly put his ideas into action.\n\nHe expanded health insurance in Maryland well before Washington acted.\n\nHe was quick to crack down on handgun and assault weapons sales in Maryland.\n\nHe fought vigorously to allow gay marriages in Maryland.\n\nHe raised the minimum wage.\n\nHe abolished the death penalty.\n\nAnd he made it easier for children of immigrants to attend local colleges and universities.\n\nGreen governor\n\nHe also won the hearts of environmentalists -- another core group within the Democratic Party.\n\nO'Malley raged against the \"greed\" of utility executives intent on selling Constellation Energy and demanded stiff concessions, including monetary support for wind and other alternative power sources.\n\nHe signed a super-expensive agreement to clean up the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nHe pushed through legislation providing a lucrative subsidy for off-shore wind farms.\n\nHe restricted the use of chicken manure as fertilizer on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\nHe delayed approval of hydraulic fracturing of shale deposits for oil and natural gas drilling in far Western Maryland.\n\nHe promoted an aggressive \"smart growth\" strategy.\n\nLow points\n\nNot all these steps were popular or successful.\n\nThe governor's \"rain tax\" to generate stem excessive stormwater runoff, ran into heated local opposition.\n\nHis failure to keep an eye on the terribly mismanaged Obamacare rollout remains a major black mark.\n\nBut overall, O'Malley leaves Maryland with a record of accomplishments that defines him as a progressive Democrat who largely delivered on his promises, despite governing in extraordinarily difficult economic times.\n\nPolitical powerhouse\n\nAs a politician, Martin O'Malley cobbled together a strong Democratic coalition throughout the state. He dominated political Maryland.\n\nYet he largely disappeared from last year's gubernatorial campaign, refusing to defend his record. That was a huge mistake. Republican Hogan had a field day pummeling O'Malley, who was never there to respond.\n\nHogan's easy victory on Nov. 4 signaled a sharp change in the state Democratic Party's fortunes. The efficient statewide organization O'Malley had created disintegrated.\n\nThe party lost much of its previous support in towns and communities beyond Baltimore City, Montgomery County and Prince George's County. Without O'Malley, Maryland Democrats appear leaderless and in disarray.\n\nOn the national stage\n\nNow it is on to what O'Malley hopes will be much bigger things.\n\nHe's actively exploring a run for president. A pipe dream? Tell that to Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton -- small-state governors who beat the odds.\n\nO'Malley was far from an ideal governor, but he gave Maryland honest, intensely dedicated service. The state is better off than it was when he arrived to take the oath of office in the Senate chambers in 2007.\n\nBest of all, Marylanders of this generation will be able to tell their children and grandchildren that thanks to Martin O'Malley:\n\n\"We beat the Great Recession and lived to tell about it.\"\n\nBarry Rascovar writes a blog, www.politicalmaryland.com.
