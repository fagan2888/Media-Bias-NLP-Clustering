Gov. Jerry Brown signed a $115 billion general fund budget Wednesday, which includes an additional $25 million to the University of California system.

The new budget increases spending on public schools and expands Medi-Cal to undocumented children, among other changes.

The California State University system will receive an additional $97 million to increase enrollment. There will also be $14.3 billion allocated to the K-12 system and community colleges.

Medi-Cal will be given $40 million to cover all low-income undocumented children, which will go into effect May 1, 2016.

Brown called for two special sessions last week to address funding for health care and transportation. The special session on health care will focus on financing the state public health care program, which has been expanded under the Affordable Care Act. The special session on transportation will work on funding repair and maintenance of roads and other infrastructure.

The new budget will take effect on July 1.
