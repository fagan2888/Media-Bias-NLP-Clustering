Wade Spees/Staff\n\nWASHINGTON - Some of America's best cancer hospitals, including the only National Cancer Institute-designated center in South Carolina, are off-limits to many of the people now signing up for coverage under the nation's new health care program.\n\nDoctors and administrators say they're concerned. So are some state insurance regulators.\n\nAn Associated Press survey found examples coast to coast. Seattle Cancer Care Alliance is excluded by five out of eight insurers in Washington's insurance exchange. MD Anderson Cancer Center says it's in less than half of the plans in the Houston area. Memorial Sloan-Kettering is included by two of nine insurers in New York City and has out-of-network agreements with two more.\n\nIn all, only four of 19 nationally recognized comprehensive cancer centers that responded to AP's survey said patients have access through all the insurance companies in their states' exchanges.\n\nIn South Carolina, the Medical University Hospital's Hollings Cancer Center, which was not included in the AP survey, is available only to marketplace customers who pick a Consumer's Choice Health Plan on HealthCare.gov. The center is not considered an in-network provider for exchange plans offered by BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, Blue Choice or Coventry One.\n\nHollings Cancer Center is the only National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated center in South Carolina and serves patients from across the state and patients traveling for treatment from Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and Florida, MUSC spokeswoman Heather Woolwine said.\n\nNot too long ago insurance companies would have been vying to offer access to renowned cancer centers, said Dan Mendelson, CEO of the market research firm Avalere Health. Now the focus is on costs.\n\n\"This is a marked deterioration of access to the premier cancer centers for people who are signing up for these plans,\" Mendelson said.\n\nThose patients may not be able get the most advanced treatment, including clinical trials of new medications.\n\nAnd there's another problem: it's not easy for consumers shopping online in the new insurance markets to tell if top-level institutions are included in a plan. That takes additional digging by the people applying.\n\n\"The challenges of this are going to become evident ... as cancer cases start to arrive,\" said Norman Hubbard, executive vice president of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.\n\nBefore President Barack Obama's health care law, a cancer diagnosis could make you uninsurable. Now, insurers can't turn away people with health problems or charge them more. Lifetime dollar limits on policies, once a financial trap-door for cancer patients, are also banned.\n\nThe new obstacles are more subtle.\n\nTo keep premiums low, insurers have designed narrow networks of hospitals and doctors. The government-subsidized private plans on the exchanges typically offer less choice than Medicare or employer plans.\n\nPatti Embry-Tautenhan, a spokeswoman for BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, said that while MUSC's Hollings Cancer Center is not an in-network provider for its plans offered on the health insurance marketplace, there are still many oncology choices for BlueCross customers.\n\n\"Among the criteria for creating our provider network for the exchange was access to high value and broad geographic coverage to meet the health care needs of our members and we've done that,\" Embry-Tautenhan said.\n\nBy not including a top cancer center, an insurer can cut costs. It may also shield itself from risk, delivering an implicit message to cancer survivors or people with a strong family history of the disease that they should look elsewhere.\n\nFor now, the issue seems to be limited to the new insurance exchanges.\n\nFor example, in South Carolina, BlueCross BlueShield customers with commercial plans, such as policies offered through an employer, still have access to MUSC. But it could become a concern for Americans with job-based coverage, too, if employers turn to narrow networks.\n\nThe AP surveyed 23 institutions around the country that are part of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Two additional institutions that joined this week were not included in the survey.\n\nCancer network members are leading hospitals that combine the latest clinical research and knowledge with a multidisciplinary approach to patient care. They say that patients in their care have better-than-average survival rates. The unique role of cancer centers is recognized under Medicare. Several are exempt from its hospital payment system, instituted to control costs.\n\nAP asked the centers how many insurance companies in their state's exchange included them as a network provider.\n\nOf the 19 that responded, four reported access through all insurers: the Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C., and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville. One caveat: Some insurers did not include these cancer centers on certain low-cost plans.\n\nTwo centers had special circumstances. The best known is St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. Treatment there is free as long as children have a referral.\n\nFor the remaining 13, the gaps were evident.\n\nIn Buffalo, N.Y., Roswell Park Cancer Institute is included by five of seven insurers in its region. But statewide, the picture is much different: Roswell Park is not included by 11 of 16 insurers. Dr. Willie Underwood, associate professor of surgical oncology at the teaching hospital, says that's a problem.\n\n\"Overall, when you look at the Affordable Care Act, it improves access to cancer care,\" said Underwood. \"When it comes down to the exchanges, there are some concerns that we have. That is not being critical, that is being intelligent. There are some things we should talk about ... before they start becoming a problem.\"\n\nMelanie Lapidus, vice president for managed care at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, home to Siteman Cancer Center, said she doesn't think patients realize the exchanges offer a more restrictive kind of private insurance.\n\nLapidus cited Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which includes Siteman in many of its plans outside the Missouri exchange, but none within the exchange.\n\n\"We have had many people say to us, 'I picked Anthem because you guys are always in their products, and I assumed you would be in their exchange products,' \" Lapidus said. \"It's still hard to tell who is in network and who is not.\"\n\nIn a statement, Anthem said its network was based on research involving thousands of consumers and businesses. \"What we learned was that people are willing to make trade-offs in order to have access to affordable health care,\" the company said. \"Our provider networks reflect this.\"\n\nHuntsman Cancer Institute in Salt Lake City is included by five of six Utah insurers, but Mark Zenger, who manages the center's negotiations with insurance companies, said he's concerned about getting left out by Humana, a major carrier.\n\n\"We are worried about the potential to have these Humana exchange members seek treatment and have no other option,\" said Zenger.\n\nHumana spokesman Tom Noland said patients can have access to Huntsman for complex procedures, on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSome state insurance regulators see a problem.\n\n\"I want insurers to be able to innovate and come up with new product designs,\" said Mike Kreidler, insurance commissioner for Washington state. \"At the same time, there is a requirement for regulators like myself to be vigilant to make sure there aren't unreasonable compromises.\"\n\nThe Obama administration says it has notified insurers that their networks will get closer scrutiny for next year in the 36 states served by the federal exchange. Cancer care will be a priority, it says.\n\nPost and Courier reporter Lauren Sausser contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health law has concerns for cancer centers; Hollings at MUSC not available on all exchange plans, South, \r\nSouthAffordable Care Act, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "WASHINGTON - Some of America's best cancer hospitals, including the only National Cancer Institute-designated center in South Carolina, are off-limits to many of the people now signing up for coverage under the nation's new health care program.", "title": "Health law has concerns for cancer centers; Hollings at MUSC not available on all exchange plans", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140321/PC1610/140329864/AR/0/AR-140329864.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140321/PC1610/140329864/AR/0/AR-140329864.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON - Some of America's best cancer hospitals, including the only National Cancer Institute-designated center in South Carolina, are off-limits to many of the people now signing up for coverage under the nation's new health care program.", "title": "Health law has concerns for cancer centers; Hollings at MUSC not available on all exchange plans", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140321/PC1610/140329864/AR/0/AR-140329864.jpg?201403212124", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 140329864}}, "keywords": "Health law has concerns for cancer centers; Hollings at MUSC not available on all exchange plans , South, \r\nSouthAffordable Care Act, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-21T21:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2014-03-21T21:24:00Z"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "WASHINGTON - Some of America's best cancer hospitals, including the only National Cancer Institute-designated center in South Carolina, are off-limits to many of the people now signing up for coverage under the nation's new health care program."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8c4\"", "article_summary": "MD Anderson Cancer Center says it's in less than half of the plans in the Houston area.\n\"The challenges of this are going to become evident ... as cancer cases start to arrive,\" said Norman Hubbard, executive vice president of Seattle Cancer Care Alliance.\nSeattle Cancer Care Alliance is excluded by five out of eight insurers in Washington's insurance exchange.\nBefore President Barack Obama's health care law, a cancer diagnosis could make you uninsurable.\nOf the 19 that responded, four reported access through all insurers: the Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C., and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville."}
