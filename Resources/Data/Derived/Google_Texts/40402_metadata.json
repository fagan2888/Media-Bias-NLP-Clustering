Though I can\u2019t knowledgeably comment on the questions or the analysis, I can comment on the technology that Ms. Reinhardt, Mr. Rogoff and Mr. Piketty chose to do their work: the spreadsheet. This choice can increase the chances of error in complex analysis, but it also can make finding errors by nonexperts easier.\n\nRoughly speaking, one can think of economics analysis as taking one of two forms: It\u2019s either descriptive or multivariate. Descriptive work is simple, which is not a criticism, because it can also be correct and powerful. It\u2019s basically what can be easily illustrated and understood with a chart. Multivariate work can be very complex, though no less powerful to those who can understand it. As the name suggests, it\u2019s an analysis that involves many variables simultaneously. And just because it\u2019s complex, that doesn\u2019t make it right. But there is a right way to do it, and it\u2019s not with a spreadsheet.\n\nThe process of going from original data to the conclusions of a multivariate analysis is not easily conveyed graphically. It is, instead, essentially algorithmic. That is, conclusions are reached by starting with data and then applying a sequence of steps to arrive at answers to questions of interest. These steps can be and should be written down clearly and unambiguously and, for a computer to follow them, they must be. If this sounds like computer programming, it is. Modern, applied social science relies heavily on programming. It should.\n\nBut it can\u2019t with a spreadsheet (like Excel), because a spreadsheet isn\u2019t primarily designed to be used that way. Its strength is that it makes visualization and manipulation of numbers easy to do with little training. It\u2019s sort of a glorified standard calculator \u2014 the kind you undoubtedly have at home and use to balance your checkbook. This is also its weakness, because its simplicity has a cost: spreadsheets hide the details. They don\u2019t make the sequence of steps in any analysis as transparent as they could be. They\u2019re there, but they\u2019re not front-and-center. This makes discerning what they are difficult and invites error.\n\nTry this puzzle: With a standard calculator, I started with the number 6, did some analysis to answer a specific question, and ended up with the number 28 as my result. What sequence of steps did I take to get there? If you think you know what they are, you\u2019re almost certainly wrong. There are an infinity of ways, and a standard calculator doesn\u2019t reveal which one I used. To be sure, the steps exist. But they\u2019re in my head, and you\u2019d have to do more work (like interview me) to discover them. I\u2019m also likely to forget them. This might seem unimportant, because I have the answer: 28. But how do you or I know it is the correct one? The best way to convince ourselves of that is to look at the sequence of steps and check that they make sense. But we can\u2019t do that easily. They\u2019re hidden from view.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA spreadsheet is only slightly better than this at revealing the process of analysis. You can make it out, but barely. You have to really work at it. That not only makes it hard for others to assess what one does to data, it makes it hard for even the creator of that spreadsheet to keep track of what he or she has done and to see and fix errors.\n\nFor complex analysis, what social scientists usually do instead is write analysis steps in a statistical programming language, of which there are many. Such a program is like a recipe, one anyone familiar with the language can read. It says precisely how you go from raw ingredients (the data) to final product (the answer). Moreover, one can annotate such programs with plain-language descriptions of steps, making them even easier to understand and to find and fix errors. Analysis written out this way makes plain what has been done and why. Errors are far easier to find and fix than they would be in a spreadsheet.\n\nBut Mr. Piketty\u2019s work is not complex and multivariate. It\u2019s fairly simple. And for that, a spreadsheet is a reasonable choice. Moreover, because advanced training is not required to examine a spreadsheet, by working in one, and sharing it, Mr. Piketty made it possible for more people to check his work. That\u2019s praiseworthy.\n\nIf the allegations hold up, Mr. Piketty may have made some errors in his spreadsheet. But the choice of that tool is not to blame for them. Were his work more complex, he\u2019d likely have been better off using a statistical programming language. But it isn\u2019t, and a spreadsheet is just fine.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140526102634, "twitter": {"description": "Did the French economist, in using a simple spreadsheet program, use the right tool for the job of analyzing economic inequality over time?", "title": "Thomas Piketty and Spreadsheets", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/upshot/how-spreadsheets-can-confuse.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002901267"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "afrakt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/upshot/how-spreadsheets-can-confuse.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002901267", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/upshot/how-spreadsheets-can-confuse.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "hdl_p": "Thomas Piketty and Spreadsheets", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 26, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Piketty  Thomas,Reinhart  Carmen M,Rogoff  Kenneth S,Economics (Theory and Philosophy)", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Austin Frakt", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Rogoff, Kenneth S", "byl": "By AUSTIN FRAKT", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Did the French economist, in using a simple spreadsheet program, use the right tool for the job of analyzing economic inequality over time?", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "Did the French economist, in using a simple spreadsheet program, use the right tool for the job of analyzing economic inequality over time?", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 26, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-06-02", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Economics (Theory and Philosophy)", "published": "2014-05-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "slug": "26up-spread", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140602191527, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/26/upshot/how-spreadsheets-can-confuse.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "Did the French economist, in using a simple spreadsheet program, use the right tool for the job of analyzing economic inequality over time?", "title": "Thomas Piketty and Spreadsheets"}, "pdate": 20140526, "des": "Economics (Theory and Philosophy)", "articleid": 100000002901267, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Thomas Piketty and Spreadsheets", "col": "Numbers, Numbers", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb034\"", "article_summary": "For complex analysis, what social scientists usually do instead is write analysis steps in a statistical programming language, of which there are many.\nThis choice can increase the chances of error in complex analysis, but it also can make finding errors by nonexperts easier.\nLike Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff before him, Thomas Piketty has had questions raised about his analysis; in his case, his work on wealth inequality.\nIf the allegations hold up, Mr. Piketty may have made some errors in his spreadsheet.\nAnalysis written out this way makes plain what has been done and why."}
