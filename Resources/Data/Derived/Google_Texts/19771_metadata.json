Police say the couple was arguing on the street as the attacker eavesdropped, and started to interfere. The dispute escalated until the 22-year-old suspect pulled out a knife and started slashing, police said.\n\nCopeland, 31, a former member of the New York Knicks, was stabbed in the left elbow and abdomen and his wife, Katrine Saltara, was slashed in the arm and across the breast. The third woman, who was believed to be with the attacker, was slashed in the abdomen. The victims were hospitalized and in stable condition, police said. The suspected attacker was in custody, and a knife was recovered at the scene.\n\nAtlanta Hawks players Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha were arrested on charges of obstructing the crime scene, after police said they blocked officers from trying to start their investigation. The players were in town to play the Brooklyn Nets at the Barclay\u2019s Center on Wednesday night. The team arrived late Tuesday, after beating the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta in a victory that set a single-season franchise record with 58 wins.\n\nGarin Narain, the Hawks vice president of public relations, said in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday morning that the team is investigating the matter.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning,\u201d Narain said. \u201cWe are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time.\u201d\n\nHawks officials did not indicate whether the two would play Wednesday night. They are largely bench players, averaging less than 6 points on a team that has locked up the top playoff seed in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThe Pacers were in town to play the Knicks; Copeland played with the Knicks during the 2012-13 season. Pacers President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird said the team was aware that Copeland had been injured.\n\n\u201cWe are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured.\u201d\n\nCopeland has played infrequently, missing 21 games since Jan. 31. He played collegiately at CU from 2002-06.\n\nThe nightclub had been cited at least 10 times for altercations and four times for noise in 2014, according to a New York Post report. Calls to club went unanswered Wednesday.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jeff Martin in Atlanta and Rick Callahan in Indianapolis contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pacers, former CU forward Chris Copeland, wife stabbed outside NYC nightclub", "title": "Pacers, former CU forward Chris Copeland, wife stabbed outside NYC nightclub", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/08/pacers-former-cu-forward-chris-copeland-wife-stabbed-outside-nyc-nightclub/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150408_095707_chris-copeland.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150408_095707_chris-copeland.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-08T08:03:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:23:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9160\"", "article_summary": "The Pacers were in town to play the Knicks; Copeland played with the Knicks during the 2012-13 season.\nAtlanta Hawks players Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha were arrested on charges of obstructing the crime scene, after police said they blocked officers from trying to start their investigation.\nCopeland, 31, a former member of the New York Knicks, was stabbed in the left elbow and abdomen and his wife, Katrine Saltara, was slashed in the arm and across the breast.\nPacers President of Basketball Operations Larry Bird said the team was aware that Copeland had been injured.\nThe nightclub had been cited at least 10 times for altercations and four times for noise in 2014, according to a New York Post report."}
