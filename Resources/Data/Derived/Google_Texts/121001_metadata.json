Along with nonpartisan, nonprofit group Partnership for a Healthier America, Mrs. Obama said she has realized since beginning her anti-childhood obesity initiative in 2010 that drinking more water is one of the best things that people can do for their health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really that simple,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cDrink just one more glass of water a day and you can make a real difference for your health, your energy and the way you feel. So \u2018drink up\u2019 and see for yourself.\u201d\n\nAnd even though I\u2019ve written before about how water is surpassing soda as the national drink of choice, this campaign is very much needed. For promoting general health, fighting obesity, and creating awareness throughout all age levels, Mrs. Obama\u2019s involvement will have a very positive impact. Federal statistics show that about 40 percent of people drink less than half the typically recommended eight cups of water a day and that about one-fourth of kids below age 19 don\u2019t drink any plain water at all on any given day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michelle Obama moves on to a new health campaign", "title": "FLOTUS wants you to drink more water", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Michelle Obama moves on to a new health campaign", "title": "FLOTUS wants you to drink more water", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/17/the_first_lady_loves_water_newscred/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/Michelle-obama-dancing-gif.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Michelle Obama moves on to a new health campaign", "title": "FLOTUS wants you to drink more water", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/Michelle-obama-dancing-gif.gif", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "MARK LECHEVALLIER", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, BUSINESS2COMMUNITY, Drinking, Health, Michelle Obama, Water", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3f5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: BUSINESS2COMMUNITY, Drinking, Health, Michelle Obama, Water, Sustainability News, Social News, Life News, Politics NewsMichelle Obama, already well-known for her health and exercise advocacy, has been making news by promoting a campaign encouraging people to drink more water.\nFederal statistics show that about 40 percent of people drink less than half the typically recommended eight cups of water a day and that about one-fourth of kids below age 19 don\u2019t drink any plain water at all on any given day.\nSo \u2018drink up\u2019 and see for yourself.\u201dAnd even though I\u2019ve written before about how water is surpassing soda as the national drink of choice, this campaign is very much needed.\n\u201cDrink just one more glass of water a day and you can make a real difference for your health, your energy and the way you feel.\nFor promoting general health, fighting obesity, and creating awareness throughout all age levels, Mrs. Obama\u2019s involvement will have a very positive impact."}
