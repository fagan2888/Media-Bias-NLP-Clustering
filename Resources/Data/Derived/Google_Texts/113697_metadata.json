Walberg has done 20 coffee hours over the past three months. He said Walberg has done coffee hours since his election in 2010, because it creates an informal atmosphere during which he can listen to people\u2019s\u2019 priorities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good way to stay in touch with the folks he rep\u00adresents, that\u2019s a big priority for him, so we\u2019re always meeting people,\u201d Kotman said.\n\nRep. Walberg shared the suc\u00adcesses he\u2019s had since last year\u2019s meeting in the U.S. House of Rep\u00adre\u00adsen\u00adtatives, including the passage of the Skills Act and the reau\u00adtho\u00adrization of the Highway Trust fund.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear much good news, and even in the pres\u00adi\u00addential race, it\u2019s pretty ugly out there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you know that the U.S. House of Rep\u00adre\u00adsen\u00adtatives passed 300 pieces of leg\u00adis\u00adlature, and the Senate passed 20 of those back, you get the idea that there is a lot going on, there is a lot of bipartisanship.\u201d\n\nRep. Walberg dis\u00adcussed his success increasing skill-based edu\u00adcation in Michigan to fill man\u00adu\u00adfac\u00adturing, engi\u00adneering, and agri\u00adcultural jobs. Last year, he passed a Skills Act, or WIOA, which he said trans\u00adferred a great amount of authority and money back to states and local com\u00admu\u00adnities to train people in the skills for real jobs, instead of using federal workforce training programs.\n\nHe also dis\u00adcussed his success in reau\u00adtho\u00adrizing the Highway Trust Fund bill, which was passed a month and a half ago, which he said puts money for fixing roads, bridges, and potholes back into the hands of the people.\n\n\u201cFor many years in Michigan, we\u2019ve com\u00adplained about being a donor state,\u201d he said. \u201cSending a buck in, getting less than a buck back. As of now, with the Highway Trust fund bill in place and acting, it\u2019s now a buck seven on a dollar we get back to Michigan.\u201d\n\nNow, people need to wonder whether road com\u00admissions will spend the money dollars appro\u00adpriately, Rep. Walberg said those dollars and the authority to use them can be used in a greater way at the state and local level.\n\n\u201cAgain, devolving some of those mandates out of existence and putting them back into the power of the states,\u201d he said.\n\nOther questions involved edu\u00adcating students with special needs, the increase in health care expenses after the Affordable Care Act and Hillsdale\u2019s drug and rehab problems.\n\nLocal res\u00adidents voiced concerns about illegal immigration\u2019s effects on voting patterns, the job market, and whether U.S. citizens would have to pay for it. Gerald, a coffee hour attendee who requested leaving out his last name, ref\u00aderenced the decision Detroit\u2019s mayor Mike Duggan made to request 5,000 refugees be relocated to the Blet area of Detroit.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s worse than where they came from,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, how long do you think they\u2019re going to stay there? About a week, and then they\u2019re going to be in Dearborn. Now, who gave him per\u00admission? They got a lot of problems in Detroit. And they can\u2019t solve them, and there they go getting 5,000 more problems, and we have to pay for them. Now that\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nGerald also pre\u00addicted the immi\u00adgrants would vote to secede the Southwest \u2014 including regions of Southern Cal\u00adi\u00adfornia and Texas \u2014 back to Mexico in the next 50 years.\n\nJohn McCleur, a Vietnam veteran from 1964 \u2013 68, is a deeply religious man who prays every day for the United States, and for Michigan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been praying for three things here: awakening, revival, and unity with the body of Christ,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been beginning to see it hap\u00adpening in the states.\u201d\n\nPrior to the event, locals filed into Jilly Beans saying \u201cHi, how are ya\u201d and ordering plain coffee. They filled the general seating area of couches, chairs and tables, leaving standing room only. The crowd\u00adedness and warmth of the coffee shop lent itself toward banter, laughter, and per\u00adsonable atten\u00adtiveness to questions.\n\nThe locals who attended did not meet Gerald\u2019s expec\u00adtations, which he shared before the meeting.\n\n\u201cI thought it\u2019d be a bunch of local bureaucrats,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a political thing you know. I\u2019m hoping for Donald Trump, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be there. He\u2019s busy over there in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nWalberg geared his speech toward showing that there are pos\u00aditives in gov\u00adernment, not just neg\u00adatives, and related it toward Michigan issues.\n\nReferring to Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh\u2019s silence in their talk shows on positive gains in gov\u00adernment, Walberg said: \u201cIf they can keep you angry, it builds their ratings up. Bad news sells better than good news.\u201d\n\nWalberg finished the hour addressing attendees\u2019 questions about local issues, answering each question in-depth.\n\n\u201cThis is his district, and he wants to get to know his people,\u201d Jilly Beans barista and Hillsdale College senior Mag\u00addalena Olson said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Hillsdale Collegian", "description": "U.S. Congressman Tim Walberg (R-Mich.) continued his streak of three-month streak of participating in local coffee hours when he met with locals at Jilly Beans Coffee House for an hour Tuesday morning, speaking about issues he\u2019s working on in Congress and answering questions.\r\n\r\nAccording to his", "title": "Tim Walberg shares coffee and conversation with constituents", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.hillsdalecollegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/walberg.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-07T07:14:12-04:00", "url": "http://www.hillsdalecollegian.com/2016/04/tim-walberg-shares-coffee-and-conversation-with-constituents/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-07T09:01:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-07T07:14:12-04:00"}, "description": "Tim Walberg shares coffee and conversation with constituents", "viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "noodp, noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85a0\"", "article_summary": "According to his com\u00admu\u00adni\u00adcations director Dan Kotman, Rep.
