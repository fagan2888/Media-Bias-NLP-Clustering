The unparalleled transparency will create an opportunity for hospitals to identify payments that were left off conflict-of-interest forms, resolve discrepancies and formulate responses to questions about the impact on medical decision making of physician arrangements with manufacturers.\n\n\u201cThis can be a rich database for compliance people,\u201d said Bret Bissey, who is senior vice president of compliance services at MediTract. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge opportunity to bolster conflict-of-interest policies and procedures and to educate physicians who haven\u2019t been totally transparent about disclosures that\u2026will be on the Sunshine database.\u201d\n\nThe Physician Payments Sunshine Act (Sec. 6002 of the Affordable Care Act) requires manufacturers of drugs, devices and biologics to report to CMS certain payments and other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d (e.g., travel, grants) to physicians and teaching hospitals. Ownership and investment interests held by physicians or family members are reportable, as is interest income. As a result, manufacturers must report payments that physicians receive from a device company when, for example, they develop part of a device. CMS is required to make the payment information available in a public, searchable online database.\n\n\u201cYou want someone looking at that data from the hospital\u2019s perspective\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s the compliance officer, internal audit or medical staff office, Bissey said May 27 at a Health Care Compliance Association webinar. \u201cRelationships can present potential risks.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Sunshine Act, which CMS now calls the \u201copen payments program,\u201d payments to physicians and teaching hospitals must be reported if they are $10 or more, or if they are less than $10 but add up to $100 annually, said Jennifer Shimek, a senior manager at EY, who also spoke at the webinar. The final rule was published on Feb. 8, 2013, and data collection began Aug. 1. The first submission from the manufacturers, covering Aug. 1 through Dec. 31, 2013, was due to CMS on March 31, 2014, she said. Data submission ends June 30, 2014, and CMS confirmed to RMC the database will be online by Sept. 30, with reporting annually thereafter.\n\nManufacturers will report payments to \u201ccovered recipients,\u201d who include doctors of medicine and osteopathy; dentists and dental surgeons; podiatrists; optometrists; and chiropractors, unless they are bona fide employees (i.e., they get their paycheck from the manufacturer). Fellows are covered recipients but residents aren\u2019t, Bissey and Shimek said. CMS will decide on a case-by-case basis whether physicians are covered recipients when they are paid to be a medical director or board member of a device or drug manufacturer, according to Shimek. Also excluded from reporting are nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, other allied health professionals and pharmacists. Payments to \u201ccovered teaching hospitals\u201d also must be reported (i.e., hospitals receiving graduate medical education payments, indirect medical education payments and psychiatric hospital IME money).\n\nLots of Payments Must Be Reported\n\nThere is a long list of reportable payments \u2014 cash, consulting fees, food, travel, entertainment, honoraria, gifts, education, royalties, licenses and charitable contributions, among others. Some things are exempt, however. Drug and device manufacturers can feed physicians at a conference, but the food and drink must be \u201creadily available to everyone and not directed at one individual,\u201d Shimek said. Educational materials don\u2019t have to be reported as long as they\u2019re used for the benefit of patients. The expense of an anatomic model, such as a human skeletal set, doesn\u2019t have to be reported to CMS because it benefits the patient and is used during the visit, she said. The same goes for product samples given to patients.\n\nThe Sunshine Act is specific about the information that must be reported (see box, p. 5). For example, for ownership and investment interests, manufacturers must disclose the physician\u2019s name, address, specialty, national provider identifier, state licensing number, the value and terms of the ownership, what they are receiving, what percentage they own and any family members involved. This includes space, rental or facility fees at a teaching hospital, Bissey said.\n\nSixty days before the Sunshine database is turned on, physicians can dispute the accuracy of the manufacturers\u2019 payment information. CMS will pass along the complaint but will remain neutral in the matter. Manufacturers may change the data; if not, the disputed data will be put on the database as is, with a note about the physician\u2019s objection. To dispute payment data, physicians have to register with CMS\u2019s \u201cEnterprise Portal,\u201d Bissey and Shimek said.\n\nTeaching hospitals will have another avenue, which has not yet been announced, to dispute manufacturer payment reporting.\n\nThe new transparency provided by the public database opens compliance and enforcement doors for everyone, said Bissey and Shimek. The database could provide a trail leading to allegations of Stark and kickback violations. \u201cThe government will have access to information that historically was hard to obtain or compile without an investigation or audit,\u201d Shimek said.\n\nThere\u2019s also the matter of reputational harm, since the press may mine the database and publish stories on payments to local hospitals and physicians, and patients may access data on their physicians\u2019 relationships with manufacturers. \u201cAs that information gets into the marketplace, it has the potential to cause reputational harm. The hospital CEO will want to make sure their hospital is not the subject of a story regarding a relationship that was previously not disclosed,\u201d Bissey said. \u201cThe worst case scenario is you get an unpleasant surprise by the release of this information\u2026and there could be a claim that medical judgment and decision making has been compromised because of the relationship.\u201d\n\nHe says there could be risk to the hospital if a full disclosure is not made inside the hospital so it can be vetted through the conflict-of-interest policies. If that doesn\u2019t happen, \u201cthe release of this information would be a surprise and could lead to claims of a potential cover-up of important relationships. This type of scenario could present risk to a hospital.\u201d\n\nWhat Steps Should Hospitals Take?\n\nHere are suggestions from Bissey and Shimek as hospitals adapt to the Sunshine Act:\n\nSign up for CMS updates on the open payments program at http://tinyurl.com/mdd6sam. Encourage covered recipients to do the same.\n\nUrge covered recipients to document manufacturer payments they receive so they can be compared to the database and accurately reported on conflict-of-interest forms. \u201cDon\u2019t be passive on this. I know we are all really busy, but a decision should be made in hospitals, medical schools and physician practices on who will review this information,\u201d Bissey said.\n\nDevelop or improve conflict-of-interest policies that crosswalk to Sunshine data, Bissey said. \u201cIf there are discrepancies, deal with it,\u201d he said, but in a \u201cnon-Draconian way.\u201d He recommends \u201cgetting in front of the medical staff now\u201d with some Sunshine Act education. As physicians get more comfortable reporting their manufacturer payments, hospitals can better manage potential conflicts. Maybe the hospital will determine there is no problem or maybe physicians will have to divest ownership. Or perhaps an abuse is flagrant and the physician will face disciplinary action. Sometimes it\u2019s relative; if a physician didn\u2019t report the large pizza that a drug sales rep bought for her practice, \u201cit\u2019s not as important as [not disclosing] a trip to an exotic location and receiving a huge honorarium from a company that does significant business with the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nMake Sunshine Act education part of privileging and credentialing. That way, incoming physicians know their payments will soon become public and should match what they report on conflict-of-interest forms, according to Bissey.\n\n\u00a9 2014 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
