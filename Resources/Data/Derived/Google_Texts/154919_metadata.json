The legislation has all the makings of a great environmental battle, pitting the big soap industry against the well-being of the Great Lakes.\n\nExcept that\u2019s not quite what happened. In what the Associated Press is calling an \u201codd twist,\u201d it seems the industry went quietly. Instead of complaining that the switch will be time-consuming and expensive, as they have in the past, representatives conceded to the deal early on.
