Pet Brands Worldwise and Quaker Pet Unite

J.M. Smucker, Whistle Labs and Fronteac have also made pet-related acquisitions recently

Pet brands Worldwise and Quaker Pet Group (QPG) are merging.

Worldwise makes pet bedding, cat scratchers, cat toys and other accessories under the Petlinks, SmartyKat, TrustyPup and Kathy Ireland Loved Ones brands. QPG makes Sherpa, goDog and Hear Doggy branded dog toys and pet carriers.

The companies say the merger will allow them to acquire more brands in the fragmented pet products space.

Worldwise is backed by New York private equity firm Mistral Equity Partners, which focuses on consumer products. In March, the firm sold Country Pure Foods, a foodservice juice manufacturer, to Silver Springs Citrus Inc.

Pet brands have attracted dealmaker attention over the past few years. J.M. Smucker Co. agreed to buy Meow Mix and Milk-Bone owner Big Heart Pet Brands for about $3.2 billion in February. Before that, in January, Whistle Labs Inc. bought Tagg, which makes a GPS tracker for pets. In July, Frontenac Co. recapitalized pet products company Cloud Star.
