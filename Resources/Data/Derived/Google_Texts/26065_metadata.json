Mayor Roque runs a transparent government.\u201d\n\nRoque also said he knew nothing about a visit to Town Hall by the feds, who were unsuccessful earlier this year in prosecuting the mayor on computer hacking charges.\n\n\u201cThey are always welcome to come in and stop by, and I\u2019ll even give them a cup of coffee,\u201d said Roque, whose son was convicted of a similar charge and will be sentenced next month.\n\nHudson County Freeholder Jose Munoz, a perennial Roque foe, said he does not believe there is an FBI agent under every bush, but that he does believe that where there is smoke there is fire.\n\n\u201cThe Roque administration is an embarrassment to all West New York residents,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cHopefully one day this lighting rod will be removed and administrative competence and trust will be returned.\u201d\n\nFBI spokeswoman Barbara Woodruff said yesterday afternoon that the FBI does \u201cnot comment on the existence or nonexistence of any investigation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hudson-county,west-new-york", "title": "West New York commissioner confirms FBI visitors to Town Hall doing probe", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"West New York commissioner confirms FBI visitors to Town Hall doing probe\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/12/west_new_york_commissioner_con.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/hudson_voices_impact/photo/10722657-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11878597\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-24T08:02:45Z\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"hudson-county\",\"west-new-york\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/hudson_voices_impact/photo/10722657-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "http://twitter/jerseyjournal", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "FBI agents were in West New York Town Hall last week conducting an investigation, a town commissioner confirmed."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, December 24, 2013, 10:09 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/hudson_voices_impact/photo/wnytownhalljpg-2b4d5db0db0265e2.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mconte\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1860104\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "FBI agents were in West New York Town Hall last week conducting an investigation, a town commissioner confirmed.", "title": "West New York commissioner confirms FBI visitors to Town Hall doing probe", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/12/west_new_york_commissioner_con.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, December 24, 2013,  9:48 AM", "article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "FBI agents were in West New York Town Hall last week conducting an investigation, a town commissioner confirmed."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1f5\"", "article_summary": "FBI agents were in West New York Town Hall last week conducting an investigation, a town commissioner confirmed.\nPablo Fonseca, a spokesman for West New York Mayor Felix Roque, said that \u201cwe have no knowledge of an FBI visit, but the city is open to any requests.\n\u201cThe Roque administration is an embarrassment to all West New York residents,\u201d Munoz said.\nMayor Roque runs a transparent government.\u201dRoque also said he knew nothing about a visit to Town Hall by the feds, who were unsuccessful earlier this year in prosecuting the mayor on computer hacking charges.\n\u201cAll I know is they were conducting an investigation,\u201d Commissioner FiorD\u2019Aliza Frias said, adding that she believes the investigation is in a preliminary stage."}
