It\u2019s not easy getting a straight answer in Exeter. Leanne Bowden, a mother of three on her way home on the school run, looks puzzled by the inquiry. \u201cWell, I\u2019m done with procreating,\u201d she says. \u201cOh, the Scots! I thought you meant statutory maternity pay \u2013 SMP.\u201d\n\nWhatever Westminster election strategists say about the Scottish National party \u201cthreat\u201d being a game-changer in this election campaign, there was little evidence of that among undecided voters in this marginal west country seat. Most people want to talk about the NHS, jobs and low wages, with immigration and housing close behind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just gone back to work after the kids. I\u2019m having to do shift work on low pay and juggling childcare with my husband \u2013 it\u2019s really difficult,\u201d says Bowden. \u201cI\u2019m interested in affordable childcare and better pay, not deals with the SNP. I\u2019m not really interested in what David Cameron says any more \u2013 he\u2019s so pompous. I didn\u2019t vote last time and I wasn\u2019t going to this time, but Ed Miliband has grown on me. He appeared a bit snooty in the beginning but he\u2019s getting a lot better.\u201d\n\nA few streets away in the St Thomas area of the city, Paul Anderson stops his vacuuming. He\u2019s an undecided, though \u201cprobably Labour\u201d.\n\n\u201cLabour working with the SNP wouldn\u2019t worry me at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t got a problem with it and I don\u2019t know why anyone has. You can see it\u2019s the Tories trying to damage Labour, and that\u2019s what politicians are good at, creating animosity. I\u2019m quite fond of the Scots myself.\u201d\n\nNeighbour Karen Roast, 59, is equally dismissive. \u201cI can\u2019t stand that woman Nicola Sturgeon, but I don\u2019t have to vote for her, do I? It\u2019s just tactics. I can imagine maybe older people might fall for it, but I\u2019m not thinking about it.\u201d\n\nThough Tory elder statesmen, such as Sir Malcolm Rifkind and Lord Tebbit, have voiced disquiet at the strategy, Cameron is gambling on ramping up the fear factor over SNP influence in the next parliament. Both Labour and the Conservatives believe it\u2019s working, despite reports from candidates fighting marginal seats that negative campaigning is putting voters off.\n\nExeter, a red island amid the blue-and-yellow political map of the south-west of England, is one of only four Labour constituencies in the region, with the Tories holding 36 and the Liberal Democrats 15. The west country is as close to a heartland as the Lib Dems have in the UK, but Nick Clegg\u2019s party is predicted to suffer heavy losses here. It has left the Conservatives worried that Lib Dems who have lost faith could transfer their votes to Labour. With Ukip already eating away at a lot of Tory grassroots support in the deprived rural and coastal communities of Cornwall and Devon, the hope is that the spectre of Labour forced into coalition by a domineering SNP will bring wandering votes firmly back to the Conservatives.\n\nFour years in the 1960s aside, Exeter had traditionally been a Tory stronghold until Labour\u2019s Ben Bradshaw won in 1997. He has held the seat since but with a sliding majority that in 2010 was just 5%. The polls show a straight race here between Labour and the Conservatives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being quite honest in saying I\u2019m not hearing a lot about the SNP-Labour thing on the doorsteps or in the hustings. It feels like a lot of sound and fury,\u201d says Bradshaw. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s shifting votes.\u201d\n\nAt the annual general meeting of the Devon branch of the National Pensioners Convention, Bradshaw is taking questions from a politically mixed audience of 30 about PFI, Europe, nuclear weapons, the Hunting Act, police commissioners and the NHS. After an hour, the Scottish question is raised. \u201cWould Ed Miliband be strong enough to stand against Nicola Sturgeon?\u201d asks Jean Hadley, a former Lib Dem city councillor.\n\n\u201cThe Labour party would have no truck with the SNP,\u201d replies Bradshaw, pointing out that the SNP \u201care our mortal enemy in Scotland\u201d.\n\nAt Exeter Castle, the Festival of South-west Food and Drink is in full swing, with mulled cider and \u201cposh sausages\u201d on offer. Devon-born Toby Burgess and his friends are students at Exeter University and Tory voters. \u201cI think Cameron has really nailed it with this. Alex Salmond is a nasty piece of work and Labour can\u2019t be held to account by a bunch of Nats. It\u2019s a break-up of Britain they want.\u201d\n\nHis friend Charlotte Haning points out that Salmond is no longer the leader of the SNP. \u201cI like Nicola Sturgeon,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m voting Conservative and I think they will win, but I\u2019d like to see David Cameron working with her. She might perhaps persuade him to look at Scotland and tuition fees.\u201d\n\nDom Morris is the Conservative candidate for Exeter. In a social media Q&A on Friday, he said the notion of a Labour-SNP alliance \u201cdestroying\u201d the country was a bit extreme, but added: \u201cI genuinely believe the prospect of a Labour-SNP coalition is concerning. Putting Trident on the table and risking our independent deterrent is not an acceptable political bargaining chip.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, numerous press reports make it clear that the SNP wants to hold Ed Miliband to ransom to negotiate a chipping away of Scotland from the union \u2013 which the Scottish people voted against in a democratic referendum.\n\n\u201cAn unstable, chaotic alliance between Labour and the SNP would severely damage our economy, irrevocably setting back our recovery.\u201d He added that he believed the people of Exeter and Devon would lose out. \u201cThey\u2019d only see taxing and borrowing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe spending would happen north of the border.\u201d\n\nAs the floating voters of Exeter find themselves hotly pursued, Samantha Sedgebear, a mother of three who uses a disability chair, is still undecided: \u201cI was Ukip but they haven\u2019t been very impressive, so I\u2019m open to whoever wants me.\u201d She laughs. \u201cIt worries me that we\u2019re going to be buggered come the results, no matter what. I don\u2019t suppose being Scottish changes that.\u201d\n\nThis article was amended on 29 April 2015 to remove a paragraph which mistakenly asserted that former Lib Dem councillor Jean Hadley was considering voting Labour at the election.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "Exeter is a key target for the Tories but their efforts to raise the spectre of Labour in cahoots with the Scottish nationalists seem to be finding little favour", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Tracy McVeigh", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Exeter is a key target for the Tories but their efforts to raise the spectre of Labour in cahoots with the Scottish nationalists seem to be finding little favour", "title": "So after the scare tactics, do English voters really see the SNP as a threat?", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/26/english-voters-snp-threat-exeter", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/4/25/1429975901691/Cathedral-Close-Exeter-009.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=6c7b1132e809c14ac3273ac30855de23", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://politics/2015/apr/26/english-voters-snp-threat-exeter?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/apr/26/english-voters-snp-threat-exeter", "iphone": "gnmguardian://politics/2015/apr/26/english-voters-snp-threat-exeter?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/4/25/1429975901691/Cathedral-Close-Exeter-009.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://politics/2015/apr/26/english-voters-snp-threat-exeter?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "General election 2015,Conservatives,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish National party (SNP),Politics,UK news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-04-25T23:05:08.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tracymcveigh", "section": "Politics", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T15:34:38.000Z", "tag": "General election 2015,Conservatives,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish National party (SNP),Politics,UK news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/4/25/1429975901691/Cathedral-Close-Exeter-009.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=ac454613d6e9d3c804ec4577bb496146", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "General election 2015,Conservatives,Nicola Sturgeon,Scottish National party (SNP),Politics,UK news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb03\"", "article_summary": "Devon-born Toby Burgess and his friends are students at Exeter University and Tory voters.\nSo what does the English voter really think about the SNP?\nI\u2019m having to do shift work on low pay and juggling childcare with my husband \u2013 it\u2019s really difficult,\u201d says Bowden.\n\u201cThe Labour party would have no truck with the SNP,\u201d replies Bradshaw, pointing out that the SNP \u201care our mortal enemy in Scotland\u201d.\nI\u2019m not really interested in what David Cameron says any more \u2013 he\u2019s so pompous."}
