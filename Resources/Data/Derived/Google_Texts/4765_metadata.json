In fact, we\u2019re looking at significant accumulations over most of the mountains.\u201d\n\nSaturday morning, the Weather Service issued a hazardous weather outlook for parts of northeast and north central Colorado due to an arctic air mass.\n\nIn the metro area, the NWS online forecast shows a consistent chance of snow through Wednesday. While an inch at most is expected this weekend, Barjenbruch said several additional inches may be possible between Monday night and Tuesday night.\n\nIn the meantime, Denverites will have to stay bundled up as temperatures remain well below freezing.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re way below normal,\u201d Barjenbruch said of recent temperatures. \u201cThe normal high for today is 50, and so far today we have reached a high of 21 after a morning low of zero. We\u2019re a good 20 to 30 degrees below normal across the area.\u201d\n\nTemperatures are expected to rise slightly by Monday, with an expected high of 39 degrees, but will return to the low 20s by Tuesday and the teens by Wednesday.\n\n\u201cAfter that, I think it\u2019s what everyone in Denver will be looking forward to: a warmer and drier regime setting up as we head into later in the week,\u201d Barjenbruch said.\n\nAnna Gauldin: 303-954-1666, agauldin@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wintry weather to continue in Colorado with heavy snow in mountains", "title": "Wintry weather to continue in Colorado with heavy snow in mountains", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/28/wintry-weather-to-continue-in-colorado-with-heavy-snow-in-mountains/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150223__20150224_A4_CX24WX1p2.jpg", "height": 488}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150223__20150224_A4_CX24WX1p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T15:26:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:35:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b09\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhile Denver will see only light snow, it looks like the southwest and the San Juan Mountains will see several rounds of snow.\n\u201cThe normal high for today is 50, and so far today we have reached a high of 21 after a morning low of zero.\nWhile an inch at most is expected this weekend, Barjenbruch said several additional inches may be possible between Monday night and Tuesday night.\nColoradans can expect this \u201cunsettled, wintry weather\u201d to continue at least through Wednesday, the National Weather Service said Saturday, with several snowstorms moving across the state over the coming days.\n\u201cWe\u2019re way below normal,\u201d Barjenbruch said of recent temperatures."}
