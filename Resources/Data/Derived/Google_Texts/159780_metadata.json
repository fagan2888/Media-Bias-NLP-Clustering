However, room for improvement exists.\n\nUsing drug data to compare whether various patients pools are more or less risky is likely to have strong pharma and insurer support.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nKnowing what drugs patients are taking could help insurers better assess the health status of their enrollees and the level of risk they are taking on, the white paper notes. At the same time, CMS worries that plans might be tempted to choose more pricey drugs in order to raise their risk level and get more money.\n\nConsulting firm Avalere Health also published a study supporting the use of prescription data in risk adjustments, according to Morning Consult.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies can no longer deny people coverage based on preexisting medical conditions. To even the playing field, risk-adjustment shifts funds from plans that have healthier-than-average enrollees to those with a sicker member pool.\n\nThe program appears to be working \u2014 transferring $4.6 billion from plans with healthier enrollees to those with sicklier ones, CMS said in a blog.\n\nCMS met with stakeholders Thursday to discuss the white paper. Among its findings: Some plans in ACA exchanges are offering plans tailored to specific patients needs, such as diabetes management.\n\nSome modifications to the risk-adjustment methodology for the 2017 plan year have been made, CMS said. These include use of more current data, updates to medical and prescription drug trends, and including preventive services in risk calculations. The agency also made risk-adjustment data reports available to plans earlier in this month to aid in setting 2017 rates.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nCMS Blog: The Marketplace Risk Adjustment Program: Promoting Access, Quality, and Choice for Consumers\n\nCMS: March 31, 2016, HHS-Operated Risk Adjustment Methodology Meeting: Discussion Paper\n\nMorning Consult: In Rare Turn, Competing Health Groups Agree on Drugs, Risk\n\nHealth Affairs Blog: What Risk Adjustment Does\u2014Perspective of a Health Insurance Actuary Who Relies On", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/c3/27/c32709748e638076309913dbd9ba8c9a.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-policy-reg", "news_keywords": "Payer,Policy & Regulation,Policy & Reg", "category": "News Post", "title": "Drug data in ACA risk pools: A wonky topic insurers, pharma & gov can agree on", "pub_date": "apr 01, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-01T22:44:26", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, April 01, 2016, 10:44 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-03-20T22:44:26", "teaser": "<p>Following the release of CMS white paper, insurers and pharma show&nbsp;support for using&nbsp;drug data to compare whether various patients pools&#39; risk assessment.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2016-04-01", "sailthru.description": "Following the release of CMS white paper, insurers and pharma show\u00a0support for using\u00a0drug data to compare whether various patients pools' risk assessment.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "Following the release of CMS white paper, insurers and pharma show\u00a0support for using\u00a0drug data to compare whether various patients pools' risk assessment.", "title": "Drug data in ACA risk pools: A wonky topic insurers, pharma & gov can agree on", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/drug-data-in-aca-risk-pools-a-wonky-topic-insurers-pharma-gov-can-agree/416662/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Fotolia_52964771_Subscription_Monthly_M_vKaWiVi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/78/bb/78bbcaa6e2f82b4164839a5075e9d393.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Dive Brief:CMS is weighing inclusion of prescription drug data in determining a health plans risk adjustment.\nIn a recent white paper, CMS said the ACA-mandated risk adjustment program has mostly met expectations to date.\nThe agency also made risk-adjustment data reports available to plans earlier in this month to aid in setting 2017 rates.\nConsulting firm Avalere Health also published a study supporting the use of prescription data in risk adjustments, according to Morning Consult.\nRecommended ReadingCMS Blog: The Marketplace Risk Adjustment Program: Promoting Access, Quality, and Choice for ConsumersCMS: March 31, 2016, HHS-Operated Risk Adjustment Methodology Meeting: Discussion PaperMorning Consult: In Rare Turn, Competing Health Groups Agree on Drugs, RiskHealth Affairs Blog: What Risk Adjustment Does\u2014Perspective of a Health Insurance Actuary Who Relies On"}
