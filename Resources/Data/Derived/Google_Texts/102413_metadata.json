The law, colloquially known as Obamacare, ties some Medicare funding to employee vaccination rates in hospitals and other healthcare settings.\n\nDuncan, Watson and Mercurius say they are deeply opposed to mandatory injections and that they are wary of the flu vaccine, which has been shown to carry serious side effects in very rare cases, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe women say they have no contact with clients, and they argue that because the flu vaccine varies widely in its effectiveness from year to year, unmasked employees who receive the shot are equally at risk of spreading the virus.\n\nThough they would prefer to keep their jobs, they say, they have characterized their decision as a principled stand against an employer's intrusion into private lives.\n\n\"You have to stand for what you believe in,\" said Duncan, 30, of Howell. \"We just think this is not right.\"\n\nRELATED: They said no to company-mandated flu shot and now fear firing. Here's why.\n\nLutheran Social Ministries employs about 630 people statewide at its various facilities, including two nursing homes, a day treatment center for the homeless, an immigration center and shelters for battered women and at-risk children.\n\nDuncan, Watson and Mercurius are among 32 people who work in the Burlington Township headquarters. While few clients come to the office building, about half of the employees regularly visit the agency's other facilities, raising concerns about cross-contamination, the agency's president, Colleen Frankenfield, told NJ Advance Media earlier this month.\n\nFrankenfield has declined to comment about specific employees.\n\nDuncan, a billing specialist, said the surgical masks are not a reasonable alternative to the flu shot because they are ostracizing and impractical.\n\n\"Some of the people I speak to on the phone are like 100 years old,\" she said. \"They're not going to be able to hear me. It will prevent me from doing my job.\"\n\nThe vaccine-or-mask policies have become increasingly contentious. In some states, groups representing nurses have filed suit over the mandates, saying they should not be forced to accept the vaccine or wear a mask when they're not in contact with patients.\n\nThe CDC recommends the vaccine for all health care workers, as do most doctors' groups and the New Jersey Department of Health.\n\nMark Mueller may be reached at mmueller@njadvancemedia.com.
