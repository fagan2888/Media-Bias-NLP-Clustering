Listen to Chad every Saturday during The Chris Salcedo Show on TheBlaze Radio and visit his web site .\n\nThis post is the continuation of a weekly Constitution Revolution series for TheBlaze.com and TheBlaze Radio\u2019s Chris Salcedo Show. To see last week\u2019s lesson, click here.\n\n\u2013\n\nOver the years, quite a few people have asked me why I generally don\u2019t write about or comment on new Supreme Court decisions very often. There\u2019s actually a very good reason for that. You see, I write about and teach the Constitution. Unfortunately, Supreme Court decisions rarely have anything at all to do with what the Constitution actually says.\n\nSo you\u2019ll have to forgive me for not going out of my way to read through endless pages of tortured logic that are completely unrelated to the topic I\u2019m passionate about. This week\u2019s King v. Burwell decision is a perfect example of that; the actions that the Court took in order to save Obamacare from itself are found nowhere in the Constitution.\n\nThe actions that the Court took to save Obamacare are found nowhere in the Constitution. Share:\n\nIt\u2019s time to talk about Article 1, Section 7. That works out perfectly for discussing King v. Burwell because Article 1, Section 7 is the part of the Constitution that gives us the process for creating laws in this country.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s important to point out that there is one\u2014and only one\u2014Constitutional method for creating or changing laws in this country and it\u2019s the one we find in Article 1, Section 7. It\u2019s also the method that you probably learned about in school or by watching School House Rocks. Here\u2019s how it goes:\n\nA bill must be passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nOnce a bill has passed both houses of Congress, the president can either sign it into law or veto it and send it back to Congress.\n\nIf the bill is vetoed, Congress can over-ride the president\u2019s veto and enact it into law with a 2/3 vote.\n\nIf you look carefully at that process you might notice something important: The Supreme Court isn\u2019t mentioned anywhere. That tells us that the Supreme Court has absolutely no role to play in creating or amending our laws. None. Zero. Zip.\n\nThe justices simply have the power to judge laws as they were enacted.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at what happened in King v. Burwell.\n\nThe statute in this case was extremely and unmistakably clear. It says subsidies for Obamacare are only available through an \u201cExchange established by the State.\u201d\n\nOne of the architects of this law, Jon Gruber, has made it very obvious that this phrase was intended to mean exactly what it says.\n\nGruber has also emphasized that it was designed this way deliberately in hopes that it would pressure states to create their own exchanges.\n\nIn other words, this law was intentionally designed so that anyone who signed up for Obamacare through the exchange created by the federal government wouldn\u2019t be eligible for a subsidy.\n\nMuch to Gruber\u2019s surprise, most of the states didn\u2019t cave to federal bullying and refused to create their own exchanges. Because of that, over 6 million people who enrolled in Obamacare signed up through the federal exchange and shouldn\u2019t be eligible for subsidies. If those people ended up having to pay the full price, it would have created havoc in the insurance market.\n\nBut because applying this law as it was written would have some unpleasant consequences, the Supreme Court decided that this law does not mean what it clearly says\u2014and what Congress intended it to mean. Instead, six of the nine justices on the Supreme Court have taken it upon themselves to re-write Obamacare in order to make its effects slightly less disastrous.\n\nIt\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve re-read Article 1, Section 7 several times today and I still can\u2019t find the part where SCOTUS is granted the power to re-write laws that were poorly written.\n\nIt isn\u2019t the Court\u2019s job to save Congress from itself. Share:\n\nThat\u2019s because it isn\u2019t the Court\u2019s job to save Congress from itself. If our politicians pass a boneheaded law that will have terrible effects on this country, it\u2019s not the Court\u2019s job to clean up the mess. It is the role of Congress to figure out how to fix their own mess or face the consequences at the ballot box.\n\nAntonin Scalia has rightly come out and blasted the majority for this decision, saying that we should now call it SCOTUScare. I tend to disagree with him on that. It would be more accurate to call this program Tyranny-care \u2013 because every aspect of how this law has been passed, implemented, and upheld has been stained with tyranny.\n\nTake a look at a very limited list of examples:\n\nThanks to our friend Gruber, we know with certainty that Congress lied to the American people about what was in this bill because they knew it wouldn\u2019t pass if we knew what was in it. We also know that it was deliberately written using tortured language for the purpose of deceiving us.\n\nAfter this law was enacted, President Barack Obama has consistently and unilaterally changed several of the deadlines, the qualifications, and other aspects of this program. If you look through Article 1, Section 7 again, you\u2019ll see that he doesn\u2019t have the authority to do that.\n\nThe Supreme Court has decided to anoint itself as some sort of glorified super-legislature and re-written this law twice in order to save it.\n\nAll of that should be terrifying because it shows that our government no longer serves the people of this country. Our federal government now imposes what it wants on the American people whether we like it or not.\n\nThe way Obamacare has been handled \u2013 from beginning to end \u2013 proves beyond any doubt that the people who now run our government won\u2019t allow the law, the Constitution, or anything else that gets in their way to stop them from getting what they want. Is that the kind of country you want to live in? The type of country where our politicians have no limit on their power but their own imaginations?\n\nYou might think I\u2019m only upset about this decision because it cements Obamacare more or less permanently into American life. But that\u2019s not the case. Let\u2019s be honest, even if the court had ruled properly and put Congress into a position where it had to consider amending Obamacare, you know that the Republicans would have screwed up that opportunity anyway. So in that sense the impact of this ruling isn\u2019t all that dramatic.\n\nI\u2019m upset about this decision because it shows just how irrelevant the Constitution and the rule of law have become in this country.\n\nEven if you are someone who loves Obamacare, you should still hate this decision. The process of how you enact a policy is every bit as important as what policy is enacted. And the way Obamacare has been manipulated demonstrates that our politicians are no longer restrained by the Constitution in any way.\n\nBy now you might be asking, \u201cIf what the Supreme Court did is so bad, then what\u2019s the solution?\u201d I wish I had that answer for you. In a sane world, this type of blatant disregard for the Constitution and violation of the oath of office by our judges would easily be grounds for impeachment.\n\nBut as you know we don\u2019t live in a sane world. We live in a world where the same Chief Justice who told us in his confirmation hearing his job was to simply calls balls and strikes has now decided to grab a bat and hit a few home runs.\n\nChad Kent is an author and speaker with a unique style that makes the Constitution simple and fun.
