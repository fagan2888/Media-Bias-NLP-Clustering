The retirement industry is planning a national ad campaign on the level of the World War II-era "Rosie the Riveter" ads.

AVENTURA, Fla. – Some of the retirement industry’s biggest players are gathering this week to lay the groundwork for a national public-service campaign aimed at turning more Americans into “super savers” who stash away at least 10 percent of their pay.



“We must change savings behavior, because otherwise, the outcome is unacceptable,” Stig Nybo, president of U.S. retirement strategy for Transamerica Retirement Solutions, said in revealing the plan.



“What is coming down the pike right now is ugly,” he said.



Getting people to save more will be a tall order.

Average defined contribution plan account balances are now at an all-time high of more than $95,000. That’s an increase from $85,600 in 2012. The number of employees participating in DC plans also has increased, rising to 77 percent in 2013 vs. 71 percent in 2012. But those numbers, while trending in the right direction, are skewed by wealthier DC plan participants.
