The massive DHS oversees immigration and border security and will implement the president\u2019s immigration action.\n\nRelated: GOP Plan Could Turn the Tables on Obama\n\nRepublicans say their strategy will signal their outrage over Obama\u2019s executive overreach and give the party time to consider additional action in March, when the GOP will control both chambers of Congress.\n\nThe head of the DHS, Jeh Johnson, and some congressional Democrats warned that Republicans could endanger the country by hamstringing a department with a $61 billion annual operating budget (including mandatory spending) and 240,000 employees. DHS was created after 9/11 specifically to protect the U.S. from terror attacks.\n\nYesterday, Johnson warned that imposition of a CR would impede efforts to bolster Secret Service operations \u2013 one of the two dozen law enforcement, customs, and border and airport security agencies and divisions that were consolidated in 2002.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t hire more Secret Service agents until I get an appropriations bill passed by this Congress \u2013 and not another CR for a couple of months,\u201d Johnson told the House Homeland Security Committee.\n\nHouse Republicans\u2019 targeting of DHS for more restrictive funding is the latest blow to a mammoth government agency suffering from low morale and buffeted by criticism of wasteful spending and poor accounting practices.\n\nFrom $1.5 billion in cost overruns on its new D.C. headquarters, to $8.7 million a year in unearned employee overtime, the department has frequently been accused by watchdogs for fiscal mismanagement and lax oversight. A recent government audit cited the agency for 68 financial problems. Another survey showed that the unwieldy homeland security department is plagued by what The Washington Post described as longstanding \u201cdebilitating morale problems\u201d that have worsened during the Obama administration.\n\nRelated: Secret Service Head Resigns After Multiple Lapses of President\u2019s Security\n\nJohnson, the chief author of Obama\u2019s executive order, had been summoned by the GOP-dominated committee for a tongue-lashing over the executive order two weeks ago. Earlier in the day, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) denounced the president\u2019s order as \u201ca serious breach of our Constitution \u2013 it\u2019s a serious threat to our system of government.\u201d\n\nJohnson, however, also warned lawmakers about putting the department on a strict fiscal diet just when it needed to launch key hiring and training initiatives. Those include further tightening of border security and addressing major Secret Service security breaches, including one that allowed a fence jumper to make it to the doorway of the White House\u2019s Green Room before he was tackled.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some homeland security priorities that need to be funded now,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nHe stressed the need for more funding to underwrite the cost of enhanced border security, but indicated he can\u2019t do it if his spending levels are frozen at last year\u2019s levels.\n\nRelated: Republican Boehner Tries to Avoid Spending Fight on immigration\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and declare we have a secure border,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do better.\u201d\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for House Appropriations Committee Chair Hal Rogers (R-KY), who has embraced the approach, disputed Johnson\u2019s claim the CR would cause major security problems.\n\n\u201cWe do not agree with his assertion,\u201d said Jennifer Hing, the House committee\u2019s communications director. \u201cA CR simply continues funding levels as they currently exist. The Department of Homeland Security has existing authority to transfer funds around to various accounts should the need arise.\u201d\n\nBy law, Congress must pass a dozen annual appropriations bills to keep the government running and then send them to the president for signature. Yet with Congress crippled by partisan gridlock, lawmakers have regularly turned to continuing resolutions \u2013 short-term stopgap spending measures \u2013 to keep some or all government agencies operating.\n\nOnly four times since fiscal year 1977 has Congress approved all regular appropriations bills in time for the start of the new fiscal year. In all other cases, Congress had to pass at least one continuing resolution to keep the government running until action on the regular appropriations bills was completed, the Congressional Research Service reported.\n\nRelated: 68 Ways Homeland Security Has Wasted Your Tax Dollars\n\nA recent study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) concluded that partial-year CRs create great uncertainty for departments and agencies. Unlike annual appropriations bills, CRs don\u2019t establish definite funding levels even for the months they cover. Instead, it\u2019s the final appropriations legislation that controls total spending for all 12 months of the fiscal year \u2013 whatever the amount is.\n\n\u201cIf an agency has been operating at last year\u2019s level under initial CRs but the final appropriations legislation makes a cut, the agency will have to absorb that cut in whatever time remains in the year,\u201d wrote David Reich of the CBPP. That may delay announcements of procurements and grant competitions, he added, as well as reduce the time for reviewing contract proposals and grant applications.\n\nAn analysis by the Senate Appropriations Committee of the potential impact of a CR on defense, for example, shows these possibilities:\n\nReadiness: Operation and Maintenance programs that fund military readiness would be cut by billions.\n\nIsraeli Cooperative Programs: Iron Dome anti-missile funding would remain at FY 2014 levels, which is millions less than the defense bill.\n\nCompetitive Space Launch: A CR would take millions away.\n\nCVN 73 USS George Washington: There would be no funding to modernize the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier.\n\nMajor Modernization Programs: Without an omnibus, the KC-46A Tanker program would have no production funding and would break the contract at the fault of the U.S. government, adding hundreds of millions to the program\u2019s cost.\n\nThe adverse impact of the threatened CR on Homeland Security operations overall could be substantial, especially if Congress keeps the department on short-term extensions the rest of the fiscal year.\n\nThe GOP spending strategy likely will be approved by the full House next week and then sent to the Democratic-controlled Senate for action.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "House Republicans, seeking to retaliate against President Obama\u2019s controversial immigration executive order, are planning to keep the federal department responsible for implementing the order on a very short budgetary leash through early next year.
