The morning stars are Jupiter and Mercury. The evening stars are Mars, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus and Venus.\n\nThose born on this date are under the sign of Scorpio. They include British explorer Capt.

They would arrive two weeks later.\n\nIn 1874, the first cartoon depicting the elephant as the symbol of the Republican Party was printed in Harper's Weekly.\n\nIn 1916, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson was re-elected and Republican Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIn 1917, the Bolshevik revolution began in Russia. Because it took place under the old czarist calendar, it is known as the October Revolution.\n\nIn 1918, the global influenza epidemic arrives in Western Samoa, killing roughly 20% of the population in the final two months of the year.\n\nIn 1919, on the second anniversary of the Russian Revolution, the first Palmer Raid results in the roundup of more than 10,000 suspected communists and anarchists across twenty-three U.S. cities.\n\nIn 1929, New York City's Museum of Modern Art opens to the public.\n\nIn 1940, only four months after its completion, the Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington state, the third longest suspension bridge in the world at the time, collapsed. No one was injured.\n\nIn 1944, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was re-elected to a fourth term during World War II. (Roosevelt, the only U.S. president to serve more than two terms, died the following April and was succeeded by Harry S. Truman.)\n\nIn 1972, Republican Richard Nixon was re-elected as president of the United States, defeating Democrat George McGovern. The following year, Congress would override Nixon's veto of the War Powers Resolution, which limits the president's ability to wage war without congressional approval.\n\nIn 1983, a bomb exploded in the U.S. Capitol, causing heavy damage just outside the Senate chamber. There were no injuries.\n\nIn 1989, \"Night Stalker\" Richard Ramirez, who terrorized Los Angeles, was formally sentenced to die in the gas chamber for 13 killings. (Ramirez died of lymphoma in prison June 7, 2013.)\n\nIn 1991, basketball star Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson disclosed he was HIV-positive and announced he was retiring from the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIn 2000, in one of the closest U.S. presidential elections, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore wound up in almost a dead heat. (Bush was eventually declared the winner following turmoil over Florida results that ultimately involved the U.S. Supreme Court.)\n\nIn 2008, authorities said about 90 people, mostly students, were killed when a church-run school collapsed on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince in Haiti.\n\nIn 2009, the House of Representatives passed the Affordable Care for American Act (colloquially known as Obamacare) on a 220-21 vote. President Obama would sign it into law five months later.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S.Food and Drug Administration said companies that produce food would be required to gradually phase out trans fats, a major contributor to heart disease. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said getting artery-clogging trans fats -- used to increase shelf life and improve taste and texture -- out of the food supply could potentially prevent 20,000 heart attacks and thousands of deaths each year.\n\nA thought for the day: \"When the rich wage war it's the poor who die.\" -- Jean-Paul Sartre", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Nov. 7, 1917, the Bolshevik revolution began in Russia.
