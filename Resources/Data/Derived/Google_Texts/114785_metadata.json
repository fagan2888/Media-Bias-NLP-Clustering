Oklahoma will play Clemson in the Orange Bowl on New Year's Eve. (AP Photo/Gaston De Cardenas)\n\nClemson\u2019s offense includes first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference players at every position group in the bunch, led by a Heisman Trophy finalist at quarterback.\n\nOklahoma\u2019s defense is not impressed.\n\nThe Sooners allow an average of 350.7 yards per game, which is 31st nationally but a miniscule number by Big 12 standards. Three of Oklahoma\u2019s conference opponents average more than 560 yards per game, and three others are in the 400s, so the league champion Sooners (11-1) feel perfectly battle-tested as the fourth seed facing No. 1 Clemson (13-0) in Thursday\u2019s College Football Playoff national semifinal at the Orange Bowl.\n\n\u201cI mean, we play in the Big 12. It\u2019s hard to say they\u2019re the best offense we\u2019ve seen, with Baylor, TCU, (Oklahoma State,)\u201d junior cornerback Zack Sanchez said during media interviews Sunday. \u201cThey\u2019re juggarnauts, man. You look up and down: it\u2019s the way they spread you out, the way they attack you \u2014 it\u2019s difficult week in and week out to limit those big plays and keep scores under 30. There\u2019s not another conference that puts up the offensive numbers this conference does.\n\n\u201cTo hold opponents the way we did this year speaks a lot about our defense. It\u2019s a good challenge for us, so when we get into these bowl games, we\u2019ve seen the explosive offenses and athletic guys. It\u2019s nothing new to us.\u201d\n\nSanchez and defensive end Charles Tapper, both first-team All-Big 12 selections, likened Clemson\u2019s style to Tennessee. The schemes might be similar, led by the Vols\u2019 Josh Dobbs and the Tigers\u2019 All-American quarterback Deshaun Watson, but Clemson is No. 11 in total offense while Tennessee is No. 48. Oklahoma won, 31-24, in double overtime at Tennessee on Sept. 12.\n\n\u201cWe really looked back at that game because we know they\u2019re going to take some things from what Dobbs did to us,\u201d Tapper said. \u201cWe\u2019re going against another great duo with Watson and the running back from Clemson (Wayne Gallman). We know they\u2019re trying to try to pound us inside. But we know if we fly around like we\u2019ve been doing all year, we should stop the zone read.\u201d\n\nAn element the Sooners have not had to deal with: a productive tight end. Oklahoma\u2019s own freshman, Mark Andrews, has 17 catches for 286 yards for six scores; no other Big 12 tight end is over 200 yards or two touchdowns.\n\n\u201cOver in their conference, they don\u2019t really play against a tight end that runs routes,\u201d said Clemson TE Jordan Leggett, a Mackey Award finalist with 34 catches for 442 yards and seven TDs. \u201cIt\u2019s a really basic gameplan going in. We\u2019re going to be able to do what we want when we want. I know our offensive coordinators are going to find all their tendencies, and we\u2019ll be able to pick them apart.\u201d\n\nClemson handed Oklahoma one of its worst bowl defeats in program history last Dec. 29, a 40-6 result in the Russell Athletic Bowl further north in Orlando. That was with Watson shelved with ACL reconstructive surgery, but the Sooners remember facing receivers Artavis Scott, Charone Peake and Germone Hopper.\n\n\u201cObviously, they didn\u2019t have their quarterback, so the gameplan will be a little different this year,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to see them before and figure out their tendencies. Those guys have some good receivers over there, but we\u2019ve got some pretty (darn) good DBs too.\u201d\n\nPeake\u2019s counter: \u201cThey have every reason to be confident. They\u2019re very athletic. They do a good job with the ball in the air. They go up and get it just like the receivers. We\u2019re going to have to help in the run game and be technicians with our routes.\u201d\n\nSanchez went on to compare Watson to another All-American candidate quarterback, TCU\u2019s Trevone Boykin. Boykin was injured in Oklahoma\u2019s 30-29 win Nov. 21, but faced the Sooners last season.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen an athlete like Trevone,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cMaybe Deshaun will be different, but in my career, Trevone is hands-down the best quarterback we\u2019ve seen in that area of creating plays and extending plays. If he\u2019s one-of-a-kind, Deshaun probably brings some of the same challenges, but it\u2019s definitely nothing we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d\n\nOf the negative reputation Big 12 defenses are saddled with, Sanchez said, \u201cYeah, of course you hear it. It is what it is. People will say what they want. We\u2019ll just show up and play the game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Oklahoma defense feels battle-tested by Big 12, undaunted by Clemson, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Charles Tapper,Charone Peake,Clemson-Oklahoma,Jordan Leggett,Orange Bowl,Zack Sanchez", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Clemson\u2019s offense includes first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference players at every position group in the bunch, led by a Heisman Trophy finalist at quarterback.", "title": "Oklahoma defense feels battle-tested by Big 12, undaunted by Clemson", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151227/151229484/oklahoma-defense-feels-battle-tested-by-big-12-undaunted-by-clemson", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151227/PC20/151229484/AR/0/AR-151229484.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151227/PC20/151229484/AR/0/AR-151229484.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Clemson\u2019s offense includes first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference players at every position group in the bunch, led by a Heisman Trophy finalist at quarterback.", "title": "Oklahoma defense feels battle-tested by Big 12, undaunted by Clemson", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151227/PC20/151229484/AR/0/AR-151229484.jpg?201512271903", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151229484}}, "keywords": "Oklahoma defense feels battle-tested by Big 12, undaunted by Clemson , Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Charles Tapper,Charone Peake,Clemson-Oklahoma,Jordan Leggett,Orange Bowl,Zack Sanchez", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-27T18:55:54Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-27T19:03:00Z", "author": "Aaron Brenner"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. \u2014 Clemson\u2019s offense includes first-team All-Atlantic Coast Conference players at every position group in the bunch, led by a Heisman Trophy finalist at quarterback."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a33\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s a good challenge for us, so when we get into these bowl games, we\u2019ve seen the explosive offenses and athletic guys.\nThe Sooners allow an average of 350.7 yards per game, which is 31st nationally but a miniscule number by Big 12 standards.\n\u201cMaybe Deshaun will be different, but in my career, Trevone is hands-down the best quarterback we\u2019ve seen in that area of creating plays and extending plays.\nIt\u2019s hard to say they\u2019re the best offense we\u2019ve seen, with Baylor, TCU, (Oklahoma State,)\u201d junior cornerback Zack Sanchez said during media interviews Sunday.\nOklahoma cornerback Zach Sanchez speaks to the media at a press conference in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Sunday, Dec. 27, 2015."}
