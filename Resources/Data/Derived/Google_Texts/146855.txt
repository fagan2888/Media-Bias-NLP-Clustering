In true Philadelphia fashion, a personal injury lawyer began soliciting clients Wednesday over the fatal Amtrak derailment that happened in the city less than 24 hours earlier.

Dean Weitzman, managing partner of the Philadelphia firm Silvers, Langsam & Weitzman, P.C., who also goes by the name “My Philly Lawyer,” sent out a press release Wednesday afternoon touting his availability “to provide representation for victims and injured persons in last night’s Amtrak derailment in North Philadelphia.”

The death toll from the crash stood at seven, with some passengers still unaccounted for, when the release went out.

Philadelphia magazine headlined its story about Mr. Weitzman’s action, “Shameless Philly TV Lawyer Shills Self to Amtrak Crash Victims.”

“Well, that didn’t take long,” the magazine commented.

The press release said, “MyPhillyLawyer aggressively and successfully represents people injured in all kinds of accidents, including trains and other commercial common carriers. If you or a loved one was a passenger on that train, call MyPhillyLawyer for a free consultation.”

Investigators say the train derailed while hurtling at more than 100 mph around a curve with a 50 mph speed limit.
