He has an amazing passion for the work that he does and spends long hours designing his classroom interactions.\n\nWhat do you believe the biggest issue you plan to address as a school board member?\n\nOne of the most important roles of a school board member is to ensure that all sides of an issue are heard and considered, requiring that all stakeholders have a voice at the table. Engaging the community is a very important part of this process. Information needs to be disseminated in ways that ensure it makes into the hand of those whom it is impacting. Increased community engagement allows for stronger partnerships with local individuals, businesses, organizations and municipalities.\n\nHow are you planning to handle the enrollment pressures and issues that arrive from overcrowded schools?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI believe that any current facility planning needs to be forward thinking to handle not just today's overcrowding, but to accommodate future growth. Additionally, designs for facilities today need to be such that expansions can be made in efficient, cost effective ways to make the most of district resources with the least amount of disruption to learning.\n\nHow will you address the funding issues the district has faced?\n\nWhile taxpayer funding continues to be a large part of the district funding model, we need to be seeking more creative ways of generating revenue. This includes seeking out and fostering mutually beneficial partnerships with entities that align with the districts educational values. Further, we need to continually engage the Legislature to ensure that public school funding is made a priority in this state.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28940133/jamey-lockley-adams-12-school-board-district-no", "sailthru.author": "Camera staff", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28940133:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-11T17:06:08-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Jamey Lockley", "title": "Jamey Lockley: Adams 12 School Board District No. 2", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28940133/jamey-lockley-adams-12-school-board-district-no", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1008/20151008__11DCXBLOCw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Election", "modificationDate": "2015-10-11T17:06:18-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-08T11:01:54-0600", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "byline": "Camera staff", "pubDate": "2015-10-11T17:06:51-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-11T17:06:08-0600", "sailthru.title": "Jamey Lockley: Adams 12 School Board District No. 2", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1008/20151008__11DCXBLOCw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Jamey Lockley", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28940133/jamey-lockley-adams-12-school-board-district-no", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Jamey Lockley", "title": "Jamey Lockley: Adams 12 School Board District No. 2"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1008/20151008__11DCXBLOCw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "How long a resident in Adams 12 School District?\nFurther, we need to continually engage the Legislature to ensure that public school funding is made a priority in this state.\nWhile taxpayer funding continues to be a large part of the district funding model, we need to be seeking more creative ways of generating revenue.\nWhat do you believe the biggest issue you plan to address as a school board member?\nInformation needs to be disseminated in ways that ensure it makes into the hand of those whom it is impacting."}
