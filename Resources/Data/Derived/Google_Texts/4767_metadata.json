You replied affirmatively, adding, \u201cAbsolutely! I proposed it in my budget.\u201d Yet, contrary to claims you stand against the Common Core standards, you are effectively entrenching those standards in Wisconsin via Common Core-aligned, high-stakes assessments. For months, you have justified taking no definitive action against Common Core, insisting that local school districts have the power to decide for themselves what standards they will use. However, in a statement to the press on January 17th of this year, you demonstrated clear understanding that Common Core-aligned assessments effectively coerce school districts into retaining the standards.\n\n\u201cEven though Scott Walker is proposing defunding of SBAC in his budget, the new Badger Exam will be Common Core aligned,\u201d Horn told Breitbart News at the end of June. \u201cSo even though the governor talks about local control over standards, districts do not really have the ability to choose their own standards because they will be held accountable to a Common Core aligned assessment.\u201d\n\nIn response to a request for comment from Breitbart News, Walker\u2019s press secretary sent the following statement regarding the open letter:\n\nGovernor Walker wants high standards for our schools and students and believes those standards should be set by school board members, educators, and parents at the local level. The Governor\u2019s budget proposal will set Wisconsin-based standards and assessments, and it ensures no school district in the state is required to use the Common Core standards. This gives local school districts the flexibility to choose the test that best meets the needs of their students.\n\nThe letter\u2019s signers, however, say, \u201cWe\u2019re tired of excuses and half-truths. We\u2019re tired of misleading and hollow rhetoric that repeatedly amounts to nothing more than political loopholes and broken promises.\u201d\n\nThe groups represented would like to see Walker prevent the wholesale collection and sharing of personal student data, ban the Common Core initiative and all assessments aligned to it, propose a plan for Wisconsin to create its own standards and assessments, and reduce the role of the state in both finances and oversight of education so that local school districts can \u201ctruly be masters of their own affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are waiting and watching, Governor\u2026and with your ambitions for higher political office on full display, so is the rest of the nation,\u201d the leaders state.\n\nAmong the groups represented as signers of the letter are the Eagle Forum of Wisconsin & Concerned Citizens of Iowa County, Eagle Forum of Southeast Wisconsin, Libertarian Party of Milwaukee County, Libertarian Party of Dane County, Republican Party of Kenosha County, Tea Party Patriots, Fox Valley Conservative Forum, Young Americans for Liberty, FreedomProject Education, Badass Teachers Association, Wisconsin 9/12 Project, and Protect Your Child\u2019s Future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "58 Wisconsin Grassroots Leaders Warn Scott Walker: \u2018No More Games on Common Core\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "58 Wisconsin Grassroots Leaders Warn Scott Walker: \u2018No More Games on Common Core\u2019", "title": "58 Wisconsin Grassroots Leaders Warn Scott Walker: \u2018No More Games on Common Core\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 639, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/ap_scott-walker_ap-photo2-e1434640746581.jpg", "height": 479}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/07/58-wisconsin-grassroots-leaders-warn-scott-walker-no-more-games-on-common-core/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "58 Wisconsin Grassroots Leaders Warn Scott Walker: \u2018No More Games on Common Core\u2019", "title": "58 Wisconsin Grassroots Leaders Warn Scott Walker: \u2018No More Games on Common Core\u2019 - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/ap_scott-walker_ap-photo2-e1434640746581.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Common Core, Common Core rebrand, Common Core repeal, Common Core tests, Gov.
