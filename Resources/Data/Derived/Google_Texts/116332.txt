* Kirsten Gillibrand is the latest Democratic senator to announce her support for the Iran nuclear deal. This is a really big get for the deal’s proponents: Gillibrand is from New York, and this sets up an interesting situation for the other Senator from that state, Chuck Schumer, whose vote is being watched on all sides.

The pool of undecided Senate Dems continues to shrink, and the math continues to get tougher and tougher for the agreement’s opponents, who are pouring tens of millions of dollars into this battle with little to show for it thus far. — gs

* If you’re looking for a dead horse to beat, Mitch McConnell is your guy:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday said that language repealing ObamaCare is the most likely choice for a budget reconciliation package expected in the next year. The tactic allows Senate Republicans to pass legislation with a simple majority instead of 60 votes. “The use of reconciliation is in active discussion by the Senate and the House,” he told reporters at a press conference touting the Senate’s accomplishments of 2015. “We are looking at ways in which we would deploy budget reconciliation in a way that [President Obama] might not agree with us but that’s still important to us,” he said. “And the biggest candidate for that, not surprising to you, would be to try to repeal as much of ObamaCare as is reconcilable.”

“As much of ObamaCare as is reconcilable” will end up meaning “keeping all the stuff people like, but eliminating the provisions that pay for it.”

* Paul LePage of Maine, America’s grumpiest governor, just got more reason to be grumpy:

The Maine state Supreme Court said Thursday that the 65 pieces of legislation that Gov. Paul LePage (R) missed the deadline to veto should be considered laws. The justices sided with state lawmakers who refused to take up the vetoes in mid-July because the typical 10 day period the governor has to act on legislation had lapsed. LePage argued that lawmakers had taken a type of adjournment that prevented him from returning the vetoes, and under the state constitution he was allowed to wait until legislators reconvened for more than three days to send back the bills. Statehouse leaders of both parties, as well as most legal experts, had disagreed with the governor’s interpretation of the constitution.

I predict he will grow red in the face, and call some people names.
