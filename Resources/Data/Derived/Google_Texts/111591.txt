A group of students in Meridian is taking on a project that's designed to help people, not only during the holidays, but also throughout the rest of the year. The fundraiser is called, "Empty Bowls, Empty Hearts." It's an international grassroots effort to raise awareness about hunger during the holidays. However, art students at Meridian High are taking this mission a step further by sponsoring a fundraiser that will help throughout the year.

"Last year was the first year that we did this, says Alexus Graham, who is president of the National Arts Honors Society at Meridian High. "One of the things that the money went toward last year was to create an after-school snack program to feed homeless kids. So, we're just hoping to continue that program this year, and help that program go a lot further than it did last year."

Here's how the fundraiser works: for a $10 donation people who attend will get a bowl of soup or chili, plus a dessert and drink that's been provided by local restaurants.

"Cameron's Deli, Kems, Weidmann's, Cane's, McAllisters, they all donated," says Graham.

However that's not all, for that $10 donation participants will also get to choose one of 200 handcrafted bowls to take home. All of the bowls have been made by art students at Meridian High.

"We have a lot of different types of bowls," says MHS Senior Renuka Srivastava, who is the project manager for the fundraiser. "Some (bowls) are paper mache, pottery, and others are made out of magazines and a lot of them run out fast."

Tickets for the dinner can be purchased in advance, or on the day of the event at the door.

The Empty Bowls, Empty Hearts Dinner will be held from 5:30 PM until 7 PM on Monday, December 7th inside the cafeteria at Meridian High School. The dinner will be followed by a Christmas Extravaganza Concert that will be presented by the MHS Concert Choir. That concert will be held inside the school's auditorium.
