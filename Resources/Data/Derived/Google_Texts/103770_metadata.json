Although abortion is a common legal procedure that the vast majority of women do not regret undergoing, 282 abortion restrictions have been enacted in the United States since Obama's second year in office in 2010. These attacks have hardly abated over time: 51 restrictions were passed in the first half of 2015, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Abortion clinics are closing across the country at an unprecedented pace, according to a Bloomberg report, and state-level legislation \u2014 such as the implementation of waiting periods and mandatory ultrasounds \u2014 put undue burdens on many women seeking to exercise their right.\n\nAlthough Planned Parenthood \u2014 one of the United States' most iconic resources for reproductive services, as well as general health care \u2014 has faced backlash for years, it faced numerous particularly invective attacks over the past year. The Senate and specific states attempted to eliminate its funding. It faced false allegations made in a series of sting videos that ensued in the perpetuation of misconceptions about its work, and facilities in states across the country endured attacks both political and violent.\n\nPlenty of women made their disappointment at Obama's failure to address these issues known on Twitter.\n\nMood. Obama didn't mention ANYTHING about abortion, contraception, or anything reproductive rights related. #SOTU pic.twitter.com/IvwpteeXp0\n\nI really like this president but man i got a uterus some people want ahold of and so do eleventy others let's talk about it\n\nreproductive rights? bueller? #SOTU\n\nObama cares about women & girls and it shows in his examples. Sad he stops short of embracing our full humanity and reproductive justice.\n\nTo be sure, in his eight years as president, Obama has supported women's reproductive rights both rhetorically and in terms of policy. Obama notably defended women's \"reproductive freedom\" during the 2014 March for Life, included a provision for free birth control in the Affordable Care Act and just last Friday vetoed legislation passed by Congress that attempted to eliminate the Affordable Care Act's provision of reimbursements for care received at Planned Parenthood, for example.\n\nThis State of the Union address not only reached a huge audience, but set the tone of Obama's legacy as well as his plan to address other issues in his last year as president. Leaving out the recent attacks on reproductive rights, and how he will continue to address them, seems like an unsettling oversight.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "It's a pretty glaring omission.", "language": "en", "title": "Why Obama's Omission of Abortion at the State of the Union Matters", "og": {"site_name": "Mic", "description": "It's a pretty glaring omission.", "title": "Why Obama's Omission of Abortion at the State of the Union Matters", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/132475/why-obama-s-omission-of-abortion-at-the-state-of-the-union-matters", "image": "http://thumbs.mic.com/NWRkZWUyYzFkMSMvNDN5dzZCOURJMjF2TkZkTmZNM1NpSjNoRi1zPS83NXgxNjk6Mjk5M3gxNjYwLzEyMDB4NjMwL2ZpbHRlcnM6cXVhbGl0eSg4NSkvaHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tL3BvbGljeW1pYy1pbWFnZXMvbDBnZm82bHV6ZHFvMDlvMmZ0dnh0NjFnY2R1aHNuNTRpZDF5dWt3dXZldGZuenJycm90Z2xmdWdwd2x6ZWZ1ZS5qcGc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"user_id": 139909832, "description": "It's a pretty glaring omission.", "title": "Why Obama's Omission of Abortion at the State of the Union Matters", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/132475/why-obama-s-omission-of-abortion-at-the-state-of-the-union-matters", "image": "https://thumbs.mic.com/YTA3MDJkMjEwYiMvVEJyZ2g1aGpzNnNpQ1FLRzBaTGlPTlpPaFZNPS83NXgxNjk6Mjk5M3gxNjYwLzEyMDB4NjMwL2ZpbHRlcnM6cXVhbGl0eSg3MCkvaHR0cDovL3MzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20vcG9saWN5bWljLWltYWdlcy9sMGdmbzZsdXpkcW8wOW8yZnR2eHQ2MWdjZHVoc241NGlkMXl1a3d1dmV0Zm56cnJyb3RnbGZ1Z3B3bHplZnVlLmpwZw==.jpg", "creator": "juliezeilinger", "site": "@MicNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mic", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"pubDate": "2016-01-13T19:48:28.000Z", "isBlacklisted": "false", "modDate": "2016-01-13T19:48:42.000Z", "keywords": "state of the union, Barack Obama, Reproductive Rights, Identities", "type": "evergreen", "id": 132475}, "fb": {"admins": "23342,215337,1410801,675670245,13000939,616963,1479330109,1267070071", "app_id": 141861192518680}, "msapplication-task": "name=Mic on LinkedIn;action-uri=http://www.linkedin.com/company/policymic;icon-uri=http://linkedin.com/favicon.ico", "original-image": "https://media3.mic.com/MzA0MzVhMzRmMCMvSEc0bVJ5dUlXcTI4bnFSZ0o2QTJHOFJabUN3PS83NXgxNjk6Mjk5M3gxNjYwLzE5MTB4MTAwMC9maWx0ZXJzOnF1YWxpdHkoODUpL2h0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9wb2xpY3ltaWMtaW1hZ2VzL2wwZ2ZvNmx1emRxbzA5bzJmdHZ4dDYxZ2NkdWhzbjU0aWQxeXVrd3V2ZXRmbnpycnJvdGdsZnVncHdsemVmdWUuanBn.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MicMedia", "published_time": "2016-01-13T19:48:28.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T19:48:42.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "identifier-URL": "http://mic.com/articles/74689/the-8-most-dysfunctional-families-in-tv-history"}, "article_summary": "To be sure, in his eight years as president, Obama has supported women's reproductive rights both rhetorically and in terms of policy.\nReproductive rights are a pertinent, even dire, issue for millions of Americans.\nLeaving out the recent attacks on reproductive rights, and how he will continue to address them, seems like an unsettling oversight.\nObama didn't mention ANYTHING about abortion, contraception, or anything reproductive rights related.\nAlthough abortion is a common legal procedure that the vast majority of women do not regret undergoing, 282 abortion restrictions have been enacted in the United States since Obama's second year in office in 2010."}
