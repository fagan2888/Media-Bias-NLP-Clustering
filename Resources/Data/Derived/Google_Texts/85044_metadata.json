(Photo: Mary Altaffer/AP/DAPD)\n\nHere in Manhattan the other day, you couldn\u2019t miss it \u2014 the big bold headline across the front page of the tabloid New York Post, screaming one of those sick, slick lies that are a trademark of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s right-wing media empire. There was Uncle Sam, brandishing a revolver and wearing a burglar\u2019s mask. \u201cUNCLE SCAM,\u201d the headline shouted. \u201cUS robs bank of $13 billion.\u201d\n\nSay what? Pure whitewash, and Murdoch\u2019s minions know it. That $13 billion dollars is the settlement JPMorgan Chase, the country\u2019s biggest bank, is negotiating with the government to settle its own rip-off of American homeowners and investors \u2014 those shady practices that five years ago helped trigger the financial meltdown, including manipulating mortgages and sending millions of Americans into bankruptcy or foreclosure. If anybody\u2019s been robbed it\u2019s not JPMorgan Chase, which can absorb the loss and probably take a tax write-off for at least part of it. No, it\u2019s the American public. In addition to financial heartache we still have been denied the satisfaction of seeing jail time for any of the banksters who put our feet in cement and pushed us off the cliff.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only scandal JPMorgan Chase is juggling. A $6 billion settlement with institutional investors is in the works and criminal charges may still be filed in California. The bank is under investigation on so many fronts it\u2019s hard to keep them sorted out \u2013 everything from deceptive sales in its credit card unit to Bernie Madoff\u2019s Ponzi scheme to the criminal manipulation of energy markets and bribing Chinese officials by offering jobs to their kids.\n\nNor is JPMorgan Chase the only culprit under scrutiny. Bank of America was found guilty just this week of civil fraud, and a gaggle of other banks is being investigated by the government for mortgage fraud. No wonder the camp followers at Fox News, The Wall Street Journal, CNBC and other cheerleaders have ganged up to whitewash the banks. If justice is somehow served, this could be the biggest egg yet across the smug face of unfettered, unchecked, unaccountable capitalism.\n\nOne face in particular: Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. One of Murdoch\u2019s Fox Business News hosts, Charlie Gasparino, claims the Feds are on a witch hunt against Dimon for criticizing President Obama, whose administration, we are told, \u201cis brutally determined and efficient when it comes to squashing those who oppose their policies.\u201d But hold on: Dimon is a Democrat, said to be Obama\u2019s favorite banker, with so much entree he\u2019s been doing his own negotiating with the attorney general of the United States.\n\nBut that\u2019s crony capitalism for you, bipartisan to a fault. Rupert Murdoch has been defending Dimon in his media for a long time. Last spring, when it looked like there might be a stockholders revolt against Dimon, Murdoch was one of many bigwigs who rushed to his defense. He tweeted that JPMorgan would be \u201cup a creek\u201d without Dimon. \u201cOne of the smartest, toughest guys around,\u201d Murdoch insisted. Whether Murdoch\u2019s exaltation had an effect or not, Dimon was handily reelected.\n\nOver the last few days, The Wall Street Journal, both Bible and supplicant of high finance as well as one of Murdoch\u2019s more reputable publications \u2014 at least in its reporting \u2014 echoed the \u201cUNCLE SCAM\u201d indignation of the more lowbrow Post. The government just wants \u201cto appease their left-wing populist allies,\u201d its editorial writers raged, with a \u201cpolitical shakedown and wealth-redistribution scheme.\u201d Perhaps, the paper suggested, the White House will distribute some of the JPMorgan Chase penalty to consumers and advocacy groups and \u201chave the checks arrive in swing congressional districts right before the 2014 election.\u201d We can hear the closet Bolsheviks panting for their handouts now and getting ready to use their phony ID\u2019s to stuff the box on Election Day with multiple illegal ballots.\n\nSuch fantasies are all part of the Murdoch News Corp. pattern, an unending flow of falsehood and phony populism that in reality serves only the wealthy elite. Fox News is its ministry of misinformation, the fake jewel of the News Corp. crown, a 24/7 purveyor of flimflam and the occasional selective truth. Look at the pounding they\u2019ve given Obama\u2019s healthcare reform right from the very start, whether the non-existent death panels or claims that it would cause the highest tax increase in history.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the startup of Obamacare has been plagued by its website nightmare and other problems, Fox News consistently has failed to mention Republican roadblocks that prevented the program from getting proper funding or the fact that so many states ruled by Republican governors and legislatures \u2014 more than 30 \u2014 have deliberately failed to set up the insurance marketplaces critical to making the new system work. Just the other day, Eric Stern at Salon.com fact-checked a segment on Sean Hannity\u2019s show. \u201cAverage Americans are feeling the pain of Obamacare and the healthcare overhaul train wreck,\u201d Hannity declared, \u201cand six of them are here tonight to tell us their stories.\u201d\n\nEric Stern tracked down each of the Hannity Six and found that while their questions about health reform may have been valid, the answers they received from Hannity or had decided for themselves were not. \u201cI don\u2019t doubt that these six individuals believe that Obamacare is a disaster,\u201d Stern reported. \u201cBut none of them had even visited the insurance exchange.\u201d\n\nAnd there you have the problem: ideology and self-interest trump the facts or even caring about the facts, whether it\u2019s banking, Obamacare or global warming. Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists say that climate change is happening and that humans have made it so, but only four in ten Americans realize it\u2019s true. According to a new study in the journal Public Understanding of Science, written by a team that includes Yale University\u2019s Anthony Leiserowitz, the more that people listen to conservative media like Fox News or Limbaugh, the less sure they are that global warming is real. And even worse, the less they trust science.\n\nSuch ignorance will kill democracy as surely as the big money that funds and encourages the media outlets, parties and individuals who spew the lies and hate. The ground is all too fertile for those who will only believe whatever best fits their resentment or particular brand of paranoia. It is, as an old song lyric goes, \u201cthe self-deception that believes the lie.\u201d The truth will set us free; the lie will make prisoners of us all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fawning coverage of crony capitalists by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. does America a disservice.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "The fawning coverage of crony capitalists by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. does America a disservice.", "title": "The Lies That Will Kill America | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP110715138365_crop.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2015-03-05T15:16:05-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2013/10/25/the-lies-that-will-kill-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The fawning coverage of crony capitalists by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. does America a disservice.", "creator": "@BillMoyersHQ", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP110715138365_crop.jpg", "title": "The Lies That Will Kill America | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2013-10-25T13:50:46-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-05T15:16:05-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20131025, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd022d\"", "article_summary": "If anybody\u2019s been robbed it\u2019s not JPMorgan Chase, which can absorb the loss and probably take a tax write-off for at least part of it.\nSuch ignorance will kill democracy as surely as the big money that funds and encourages the media outlets, parties and individuals who spew the lies and hate.\nLast spring, when it looked like there might be a stockholders revolt against Dimon, Murdoch was one of many bigwigs who rushed to his defense.\nThis isn\u2019t the only scandal JPMorgan Chase is juggling.\nNor is JPMorgan Chase the only culprit under scrutiny."}
