For details about the festival, visit www.loveland.org/CornRoastEntertainment/index.php\n\nOfficials with the Old-Fashioned Corn Roast Festival are again pleased the event will coincide with the USA Pro Challenge.\n\nWhile visitors are in town to watch the race sweep down First Street and Fifth Street through the heart of Loveland, they can stop at the festival on Fourth Street for all the corn, music and artisan wares they could desire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMindy McCloughan, president and CEO of the Loveland Chamber of Commerce, and Cindy Mackin with the city of Loveland, have worked closely to make the event happen in conjunction with the race.\n\n\"This mirrors what we did two years ago,\" McCloughan said on Thursday. \"Because so much work was put into it the first year, it's like a well-oiled machine this year.\"\n\nEverything will take place on Fourth Street as it has for the last two years.\n\nEvents for the Corn Roast will kick off Friday with an introduction of the parade marshals Phil and Janice Farley at 5 p.m. The corn-shucking contest will follow at 5:30 p.m. with over 35 teams ready to shuck corn as fast as they can for the win. All that corn will be boiled and roasted for public consumption and sold that day and all the next day. The Retro Eighties Tribute Band will perform at 8-10 p.m. that night.\n\nThe parade will start at 8:30 a.m. Saturday, an hour earlier than it did last year, to account for the racers coming through Loveland at around noon.\n\nMcCloughan said that 100 floats are registered for the parade, and they had to turn teams away for both the corn-shucking contest and parade because there was so much interest. The parade theme will again be Tour de Corn, as it was two years ago when the USA Pro Challenge first came through.\n\n\"Early on we made sure to engage with Mindy and her planning to make sure we had programming downtown with one thing after another,\" said Cindy Mackin with Visit Loveland, a tourism branch of the city of Loveland.\n\nMackin said the city hired a band, Soul School, to start performing right after the parade finished, around 10:30 a.m. so that something festive was going on even before the USA Pro Challenge men's and women's cyclists come through.\n\nThe cyclists are scheduled to leave The Ranch at 11:30-11:45 a.m. and will be downtown around noon and a little after.\n\nSoul School will break as the cyclists come through and will pick up again after until around 1:30 p.m.\n\n\"So people can come spend the whole day with the entertainment and the Corn Roast events and the local stores,\" Mackin said. \"I want people to come and stay and visit Loveland; shop, eat and play.\"\n\nShe said the city is excited to work with Mindy because the events compliment each other well.\n\n\"Hopefully those that stay downtown will be eating in restaurants, shopping, enjoying the nightlife,\" McCloughan added.\n\nSaturday's events will include visits from the Corn Roast mascot, Sweetie, as well as a kids' zone, beer garden and food.\n\nChildren's activities will include bounce houses, water balls, high ropes course, pony rides and petting zoo.\n\nFood vendors will be stationed by the parking lot across from Aims Community College at Fourth Street and Railroad Avenue. The corn cooker and selling area will be by the Sports Station.\n\nPayments will be on a token system, which can be purchased at three token booths. Participating restaurants will even allow tokens to be used in their businesses for several days after the festival.\n\nMcCloughan said they estimate 15,000 to 20,000 people visited the Corn Roast in 2014 and 30,000 were there the year before. They ordered 20,000 ears of corn this year instead of the 15,000 ears of last year.\n\nAround 200 volunteers will be on hand to assist throughout the weekend.\n\n\"This year and last year we asked our valentines stamping volunteers to help us bag tokens,\" McCloughan said. \"It takes so many booths on the ground to pull off an event of this magnitude. Come bring your whole family and be prepared to enjoy a great weekend.\"\n\nShuttle Stop Locations\n\nTwo shuttle buses will run every hour from 5 to 9:55 p.m. Friday and 7:30 a.m. to 7:25 p.m. Saturday.\n\nShuttles will stop at:\n\n\u2022 Corn Roast Festival, Fifth Street and Cleveland Avenue at 10 minutes after the hour.\n\n\u2022 Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology, 815 14th St. SW at 20 minutes after the hour.\n\n\u2022 Orchard's Shopping Center, 261 E. 29th St. on the hour.\n\nDrop off at:\n\n\u2022 Corn Roast Festival, Fifth Street and Cleveland Avenue at 35 minutes after the hour.
