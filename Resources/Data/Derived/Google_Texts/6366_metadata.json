For decades, the company has been delivering close to a thousand frozen food items seen\n\non store shelves and restaurants, everything from french fries to pizzas and certain deli meats.\n\nIt is also widely known as a distributor of ice cream\u2013popular brands like Roselani, Breyers and Ben and Jerry.\n\nBut the company told KHON2 about delays in cargo containers from the West Coast, sometimes for three days.\n\n\u201cActually, the last couple of weeks we\u2019ve seen delays and that\u2019s been affecting our timing when it comes to shipping to the outer islands,\u201d said Michael Sakamoto Jr., the company\u2019s general manager.\n\nThe company tries to keep its inventories stocked with items to head off any shortage should the dock dispute linger, but Sakamoto says it cannot keep certain items in storage for too long, like bacon and deli meats that have a short shelf life.\n\n\u201cIf we bring in too much of that product, what\u2019s going to happen is it would get \u2018out of code\u2019 or expire,\u201d Sakamoto explained.\n\nServco Home and Commercial Products, better known as Servco Appliance, has also seen delays in container cargo arrivals at its Mapunapuna showroom.\n\nPresident Craig Washofsky said the delays have been for a day or two and while that doesn\u2019t have too much of an impact on the American-made products, Washofsky cannot say the same for microwaves and other appliances made in Asia, which are delivered first to the mainland West Coast before they make their way to Hawaii.\n\n\u201cSome of that stuff has been delayed a little bit longer,\u201d said Washofsky, \u201cso we\u2019ve seen spottier availability of inventory of that kind of product\u2026 We\u2019re like everybody else in Hawaii. We\u2019re at the mercy of what shippers are able to do.\u201d\n\nKHON2 also contacted Dean Foods, the Texas-based company that owns Meadow Gold milk.\n\nSpokesman Jamaison Schuler said in a statement, \u201cAt this time, we have enough milk to supply our customers.\u201d But Schuler added that \u201cwe share the concern of others that Hawaii residents could be impacted by an extended labor dispute, resulting in shortages of nutritional produce and dairy products, especially fresh milk. That is why Meadow Gold continues to develop local supply relationships.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Companies have been dealing with delays in cargo shipments that could affect Hawaii's supply of perishable meats, appliances and dairy.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.khon", "og": {"site_name": "KHON2", "description": "Companies have been dealing with delays in cargo shipments that could affect Hawaii\u2019s supply of perishable meats, appliances and dairy.", "title": "Appliances, meat, dairy could fall short as dock dispute continues", "url": "http://khon2.com/2015/02/10/appliances-meat-dairy-could-fall-short-as-dock-dispute-continues/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/ice-cream-warehouse.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Companies have been dealing with delays in cargo shipments that could affect Hawaii\u2019s supply of perishable meats, appliances and dairy.", "creator": "@khonnews", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkhon.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/ice-cream-warehouse.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Appliances, meat, dairy could fall short as dock dispute continues", "site": "khonnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Working for Hawaii - Hawaii News, Weather, and Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411526747", "fb": {"pages": 66874361378}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "KHON2", "google-site-verification": "F8HhCy2NOcu_QvRKzZJGqFMMgASTuCT3_KKw72WqXWw", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/khon2news", "published_time": "2015-02-11T04:25:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-11T04:26:55+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khon2.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b26093ebd87004d2709601aeb29b2013?s=16"}, "article_summary": "Servco Home and Commercial Products, better known as Servco Appliance, has also seen delays in container cargo arrivals at its Mapunapuna showroom.\nWhile the dispute continues, companies in Hawaii have been dealing with delays in cargo shipments.\nNegotiations resume Wednesday in the labor dispute involving docks on the mainland West Coast.\nBut the company told KHON2 about delays in cargo containers from the West Coast, sometimes for three days.\n\u201cActually, the last couple of weeks we\u2019ve seen delays and that\u2019s been affecting our timing when it comes to shipping to the outer islands,\u201d said Michael Sakamoto Jr., the company\u2019s general manager."}
