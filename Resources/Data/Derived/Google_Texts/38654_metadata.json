As he got madder, his face got redder.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Mike. He\u2019s like that at dinner,\u201d Kramer said Friday from Milwaukee. \u201cThe more we put Ditka out front, the more he made comments and the more he believed in the project.\u201d\n\nWhen four NFL players (Patrick Willis, Jason Worilds, Chris Borland and Jake Locker) with plenty of football left in them shockingly retired recently, my mind went back to that 2007 news conference in Miami.\n\nBorland, a terrific tackling linebacker, retired after his rookie season with the San Francisco 49ers because, after extensive self-research, he determined concussions and their long-term effects aren\u2019t worth money, fame and even the joy of playing the game.\n\nThe linebacker Borland replaced last season was Patrick Willis, who might have cost himself a bronze bust in Canton\u2019s Hall of Fame by retiring at age 30 because of chronic feet and toe pain.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I pay attention to guys when they\u2019re finished playing, walking around like they\u2019ve got no hips and they can\u2019t play with their kids,\u201d Willis said at his farewell news conference. \u201cThey can barely walk. People see that and they feel sorry. But they don\u2019t realize it\u2019s because he played a few extra years.\u201d\n\nThe perils of playing football had been largely ignored until Ditka, Kramer and several stars from the 1960s and 1970s stepped forward in Miami and started educating people on the enormous price paid for playing a violent game.\n\nAt the same Miami presser, Joe DeLamielleure, the former \u201cElectric Company\u201d guard for the Buffalo Bills and O.J. Simpson, bluntly blamed former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and players union boss Gene Upshaw for doing nothing to help former players.\n\nIt got so entertainingly contentious, Upshaw later threatened to break DeLamielleure\u2019s neck. But there would be a greater good.\n\nKramer\u2019s group counted coverage from 155 newspapers (including The Denver Post) and dozens of radio and TV stations. The league and union have long stopped treating needy former players like pests and swatting them away. Both the league and the union have set up programs that have funneled millions toward former players.\n\nAnd current players, even the young ones, better understand they are not indestructible.\n\nThe league has made the game safer by outlawing hits to the head, leading with the helmet and almost all hits to the quarterback.\n\n\u201cQuarterbacks are part of the mafia now: They\u2019re untouchable,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThe game has changed but there\u2019s always going to be a certain element of violence in the game because when you want a power position, you put your weight forward. You don\u2019t have any power standing straight up. You have power when you lean into something or bend into it to make contact. That brings the head down. That\u2019s the nature of the game so there is always going to be a certain amount of violence there.\u201d\n\nSoon after that news conference in Miami, Ditka took control of the Gridiron Greats and still runs it. Smith helps head up PAST (Pain Alternate Solutions and Treatments), a retired athletes medical resource group based in Clifton, N.J. Kramer, 79, lives in Boise, Idaho, and has a busier speaking schedule than he\u2019s had in years.\n\nTheir work will never be done. But never will such work ever be as effective as their introductory news conference eight years ago in Miami.\n\n\u201cWe had a fallback plan there that morning,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cDitka says, \u2018Jerry, if this doesn\u2019t work let\u2019s get all the guys who are disabled or have dementia or have physical problems, and get them in their wheelchairs and their crutches and we\u2019ll march them around the stadium at next year\u2019s Super Bowl.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have to do that thank god. It was a wonderful kickoff for us. It worked.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis @denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Klis: NFL players are walking away from the game while they still can", "title": "Klis: NFL players are walking away from the game while they still can", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/21/klis-nfl-players-are-walking-away-from-the-game-while-they-still-can/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150317_110235_Borland.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150317_110235_Borland.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T21:10:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T23:43:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadac\"", "article_summary": "Simpson, bluntly blamed former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue and players union boss Gene Upshaw for doing nothing to help former players.\nIt was Feb. 2, 2007, three days before Peyton Manning won his only Super Bowl title and the first day the public was made acutely aware of the plight of former football players.\nThe league and union have long stopped treating needy former players like pests and swatting them away.\nKramer\u2019s group counted coverage from 155 newspapers (including The Denver Post) and dozens of radio and TV stations.\nBoth the league and the union have set up programs that have funneled millions toward former players."}
