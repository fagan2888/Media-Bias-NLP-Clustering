Premiums on health plans offered through the federal and state Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) insurance marketplaces rose 8 percent last year, according to a report put out by the Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday.

That means the average policyholder’s premium rose from $356 a month to $386 a month. But after the subsidies that are available to 85 percent of buyers were taken into account, the average policyholder’s monthly bill increased less than 4 percent, from $102 to $106.
