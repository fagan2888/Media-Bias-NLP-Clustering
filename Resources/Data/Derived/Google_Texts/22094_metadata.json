This year, the service put the price tag at $58.2 billion between fiscal 2016 and 2026, a 76 percent increase.\n\nRelated: Air Force Gets Wrong Price Tag for New, Budget-Busting Bomber\n\nThe service has since said the actual cost should have been $41.7 billion all along. Beyond that, officials aren\u2019t sweating how such an error occurred in what is estimated to be a $55 billion, multi-decade program.\n\n\u201cThere has been no change in the costing factors over the last two years \u2026 it was a mistake. It was a regrettable mistake,\u201d Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said during a Pentagon press briefing.\n\n\u201cIt occurred in part because of human error and in part because of process error, meaning a couple of people got the figures wrong and the process of coordination was not fully carried out in this case,\u201d she said, adding the method involves \u201cother people\u201d looking at the numbers to provide a \u201ccheck and balance.\u201d\n\nJames said leaders have counseled those involved, \u201ctightened up\u201d the process, corrected the price tag with Congress and double-checked all the other figures contained in the reports.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is there has been no change in those cost figures,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: The Pentagon\u2019s Next-Generation Budget Busting Bomber\n\nAir Force chief of staff Gen. Mark Welsh also downplayed the blunder.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised by the number when we saw it as well once it had been pointed out to us that it looked like the number had grown because we\u2019ve been using the same number, it has not changed,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nDon\u2019t expect Capitol Hill lawmakers to take the Air Force explanation at face value, especially given the service\u2019s poor track record developing other pricey weapons programs, like the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nRelated: The $1 Trillion Question for the F-35: Is the U.S. Buying an Inferior Plane?\n\nEarlier Monday, Rep. Jackie Speier (CA) sent a letter to James demanding to know how the multi-billion dollar mix-up happened.\n\n\u201cThis sudden 76 percent increase in estimated cost is alarming, because it raises questions about the management of a crucial program that lacks transparency, on which we cannot afford serious cost overruns, development errors, and reduced production numbers that would deprive the United States of one of its core military capabilities,\u201d Speier, the ranking member on the House Armed Services Oversight and Investigations subpanel, wrote.\n\nSpeier, who has been critical of the program in the past, said the Pentagon \u201chas promised that the LRS-B would be produced at a fixed price of $500 million per plane, but these reports suggest we should be concerned about the reliability of that promise.\u201d\n\nThe Air Force estimates it would cost $55 billion to build as many as 100 new bombers to replace aging B-52 and B-2 fleets.\n\nJames said the botched figure has not and will not impact how the service projects executes its costs projections.\n\nShe declined to comment if the contract award for the new bomber would be given out in October, several months after a previous June or July deadline.\n\nThe award will be given \u201csoon,\u201d according to James.\n\nNorthrop Grumman and a Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture are competing to build the new stealth bomber.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Air Force leaders on Monday brushed off concerns that the service got the projected 10-years cost of its next-generation by the tune of more than $27 billion.", "title": "Air Force Brushes Off $27 Billion Accounting Error", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/25/Air-Forces-Brushes-27-Billion-Accounting-Error", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/BoeingNewBomber.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/25/Air-Forces-Brushes-27-Billion-Accounting-Error", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/BoeingNewBomber.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Air Force leaders on Monday brushed off concerns that the service got the projected 10-years cost of its next-generation by the tune of more than $27 billion.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9502\"", "article_summary": "It was a regrettable mistake,\u201d Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said during a Pentagon press briefing.\nRelated: Air Force Gets Wrong Price Tag for New, Budget-Busting BomberThe service has since said the actual cost should have been $41.7 billion all along.\nAir Force leaders on Monday shrugged off concerns that the service got the projected 10-years cost of its next-generation bomber wrong to the tune of more than $27 billion.\nThis year, the service put the price tag at $58.2 billion between fiscal 2016 and 2026, a 76 percent increase.\nLast year, the Air Force told Congress the estimated cost for developing the Long-Range Strike Bomber from fiscal years 2015 to 2024 would be $33.1 billion."}
