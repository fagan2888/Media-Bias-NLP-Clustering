The state legislature has a handful of elected officials from the \u201cProgressive Party,\u201d a political party further to the Left ideologically than even the most liberal Democrats. In Congress, Vermont sends an avowed Socialist and one of the most liberal Democrats to the Senate. And, of course, Vermont is well-known for having elected Howard Dean, a laughably-liberal governor-turned-presidential candidate.\n\nSo when Vermont went even further than Obamacare and enacted a single-payer system for health insurance, liberals nation-wide looked to that state as a beacon of hope for socialized medicine.\n\nWriting in The Atlantic in December 2013, Sean McElwee notes:\n\nGovernor Peter Shumlin signed a revolutionary single-payer plan, Green Mountain Healthcare\u2014the culmination of decades of work by progressive politicians in the state\u2014into law in May 2011. The new system aims to guarantee universal insurance coverage, improve benefits for those who are currently underinsured, include universal dental care and vision care, and increase the Medicaid reimbursement rate to doctors in order to avoid cost-shifting. In some ways, the system resembles the ACA, but the the most consequential difference is that Vermont\u2019s law will end employer-provided insurance. \u201cGod didn\u2019t create the fact that employers are responsible for healthcare for their employees,\u201d says Bernie Sanders, the state\u2019s stalwart socialist senator.\n\nBarely a year later, the state has scrapped its single-payer plan. Forbes published a list of six reasons why the Vermont plan failed, including a massive 160% tax hike that would have to have been implemented to cover the costs. Even in liberal Vermont, there\u2019s a boiling point when it comes to people\u2019s pocketbooks.\n\nPOLITICO dug into the details:\n\n\u201cIt is not the right time for Vermont\u201d to pass a single-payer system, [Democrat Governor] Shumlin acknowledged in a public statement ending his signature initiative. He concluded the 11.5 percent payroll assessments on businesses and sliding premiums up to 9.5 percent of individuals\u2019 income \u201cmight hurt our economy.\u201d Vermont\u2019s outcome is a \u201csmall speed bump,\u201d said New York Assembly member Richard Gottfried, who\u2019s been pushing single-payer bills for more than 20 years. But opponents says it\u2019s the end of the road. \u201cIf cobalt blue Vermont couldn\u2019t find a way to make single-payer happen, then it\u2019s very unlikely that any other state will,\u201d said Jack Mozloom, spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business. \u201cThere will never be a good time for a massive tax increase on employers and consumers in Vermont, so they should abandon that silly idea now and get serious,\u201d Mozloom added.\n\nSupporters of the single-payer system offered up plenty of excuses as to why the Vermont plan ultimately failed: it wasn\u2019t truly single-payer; it was tied too closely to the governor\u2019s political persona; it\u2019s state-based, rather than a national framework; there were too many exemptions.\n\nAccording to POLITICO\u2019s account, the Vermont failure hasn\u2019t stopped pro-single-payer politicians in nearby New York from attempting to implement a similar plan. And in Hawaii \u2014 a state as liberal as Vermont \u2014 it seems progress has stalled on a single-payer plan.\n\nAccording to Gallup, support for the idea that the federal government should be responsible for Americans\u2019 health care has been on the decline since 2007 \u2014 before Obamacare became a topic of national discussion. If the federal government can\u2019t subsidize the cost of health insurance, state budgets certainly won\u2019t be able to handle the costs.\n\nConservatives should work to advance market-based policies that bring the cost of healthcare down while empowering individuals to select policies that cater to their individual needs, rather than a federal (or even state-run) system that forces people into one-size-fits-all plans that really seem to fit no one at all and cost too much to implement.\n\nEven in ultra-liberal Vermont, residents and elected officials are rejecting the practical implementation of big government liberal policies.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Big Government,Liberalism,ObamaCare,Peter Shumlin,Single-Payer Healthcare,Vermont,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "Vermont Single-PayerBill O&#8217;Reilly sent Jesse Watters to Vermont over the summer to see just how liberal the Green Mountain State is.
