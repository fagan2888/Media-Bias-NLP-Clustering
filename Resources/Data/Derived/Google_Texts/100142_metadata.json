However, even though the legislation passed three years ago, that's still a tight deadline: More than four in 10 people aren\u2019t even sure that Obamacare is law.\n\n\"Really, we\u2019re starting from negative in trying to get people enrolled in health care. We\u2019re starting from less than zero,\" says Ben Stein, co-founder of Mobile Commons (and not that Ben Stein). Stein\u2019s company is fighting ignorance about Obamacare with a technology many people use every day: the text message.\n\nThe demographic groups that will benefit the most from the ACA were young people, minorities, underserved communities\u2014the ones who text the most.\n\nMobile Commons\u2019 product is essentially a library of tested text messages, called Enroll, along with a software platform for sending them that\u2019s already been used by the Obama campaign and the nonprofit Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The customers for \"Enroll America \" are organizations that want to get people insured, including insurance companies, nonprofits, and the exchanges themselves.\n\nThe idea came to Stein this spring, when he came across some striking data. \"I started looking at the population who is going to benefit the most from the Affordable Care Act,\" says Stein. The demographic groups he pinpointed were young people, minorities, and underserved communities. \"I said, \u2018I\u2019ve seen these graphs before,'\" says Stein. They were the populations most likely to use text messages.\n\nBut the advantage of the medium isn\u2019t just familiarity. It\u2019s also simple enough to allow for easy automated responses, a back-and-forth that would become overwhelming if you used email. (Consider: Have you ever written back to a campaign email from \"Barack Obama\"?)\n\nEditor's Note Everyone loves texting. This project uses texts to get farmers in India more money for their crops.\n\nBut will it work? Stein points to studies showing that text message reminders helped patients remember to take their HIV medication, quit smoking, and find the nearest flu shot. But he admits that educating people about insurance will take more than just nudging.\n\n\"Insurance is incredibly complicated, and there\u2019s no way to explain everything and really get someone to their optimal plan via text messaging,\" says Stein. He sees text messages, instead, as a tool to provide basic facts\u2014the law exists, if you don\u2019t buy insurance you\u2019ll pay a fine, these are the documents you\u2019ll need to buy it, etc.\u2014and lighten the load for the small army that will be doing outreach and fielding questions come October.\n\nIn the end, like the health care exchanges themselves, we won\u2019t really know if it\u2019s working after October 1st. \"We need to actually be testing what\u2019s working,\" says Stein. \"This is something that\u2019s never been done.\"", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Making Obamacare Work, Using Simple Text Messages", "image": "http://c.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/09/3016543-poster-1280-whitehouse2.jpg", "description": "What's the best way to explain to people how to use and benefit from the new law?
