Based on the snippets of data released, we know from XOMA that patients with a milder form of the disease tended to sway the results toward the placebo while those with more severe pain appeared to respond better and may still be worth researching once XOMA's subset analysis is complete. Gevokizumab is also being studied in a number of other indications, including a number of ophthalmic diseases.\n\nNow what: Gevokuzimab is XOMA's crown jewel, with 11 separate indications currently being tested if you lump in it and partner Servier's clinical studies involving the drug, so today's shortfall certainly stings. The good news is that the data demonstrated favorability toward gevokizumab in more severe cases, so it may not be a total loss in EOA, but it certainly throws a shred of doubt over a number of its other purported indications. We should of course remember that different diseases can behave markedly different to the same experimental therapy, so XOMA's pipeline could also be perfectly fine with today's downside move potentially overblown. As an investor I'd suggest keeping your eyes peeled for fresh data on gevokizumab in its other 10 indications. If all continues to progress well, especially in its ophthalmic disease targets, then XOMA should be just fine.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:56", "description": "XOMA shares tumble after it announces a pipeline update regarding its lead experimental drug, gevokizumab.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_single-control_50", "author": "Sean Williams", "promo": "XOMA shares tumble after it announces a pipeline update regarding its lead experimental drug, gevokizumab.", "twitter": {"title": "Why XOMA Corp.
