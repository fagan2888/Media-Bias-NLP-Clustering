By law, the Hawaii Health Connector is not required to respond to open-records requests. And though it does hold public meetings, posting minutes online, it\u2019s unclear whether that\u2019s a legal requirement or a mere courtesy the exchange has extended of its own volition.\n\n#ad#\u201cThere\u2019s huge accountability problems,\u201d says Gina Mangieri, a reporter with Hawaii\u2019s KHON2. \u201cSo far, my experience has been that the Connector was transparent with what they wanted to share and often standoffish with what they didn\u2019t \u2014 everything from financial data to the truth behind the technical glitches,\u201d she continues. \u201cEven just getting the first wave of sign-up numbers was like pulling teeth.\u201d\n\nMangieri tells National Review Online that when she submitted records requests to the exchange, they refused to provide her with information. And when she appealed to the state\u2019s Office of Information, \u201cwhich is very progressive, they just throw up their hands: \u2018Sorry, can\u2019t help; wish we could,\u2019\u201d citing Act 205\u2019s restrictions on access to information.\n\nBarbara Kim Stanton, director of AARP in Hawaii and a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act, also expressed concerns about the secrecy shrouding Hawaii\u2019s state exchange. \u201cEnrolling the uninsured is too important for the public to be left in the dark,\u201d she said. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSenator Roz Baker, considered the architect of Hawaii\u2019s Act 205, tells National Review Online, \u201cThe way [sunshine] laws have been interpreted really hamstrings a nimble organization, and with the aggressive timelines that we had in terms of meeting the grant and getting the Connector up, it really would not have worked.\u201d\n\nThe exchange was established as a nonprofit because \u201cpublic-private partnerships are the way of the future,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt gives you the ability to leverage [the private sector]. In my view, government is not the repository of all wisdom, and it cannot do things by itself. It needs to do things with people in the community who can access things that it cannot.#\u2026#We felt that this [structure] gave us the opportunity to craft something that might work in Hawaii.\u201d\n\nThat homage to the private sector is all well and good \u2014 except when you consider that Hawaii\u2019s exchange looks an awful lot like a government agency, minus the accountability.\n\nA more \u201cnimble\u201d exchange is a poor excuse for the lack of transparency, especially in light of how badly Hawaii\u2019s health exchange has functioned, despite the enormous taxpayer cost. Though the exchange is theoretically required to be financially independent down the road, Hawaii alone has already received $205 million from the federal government, and Act 205 explicitly says that \u201cthe State may appropriate [taxpayer-collected] moneys to the Connector.\u201d\n\nEven in its management, the health exchange has close ties with the state government. The governor appoints board members, who are then approved by the Hawaii Senate. Four board members are the heads of Hawaii state departments. A state auditor will review the health exchange\u2019s books each year, and the results are submitted to the insurance commissioner of the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. For at least a decade, the legislature has reserved the right to \u201chave access to, inspect, and make copies of any documents retained\u201d pertaining to the financials of the health exchange.\n\nHawaii can call this a nonprofit, but what\u2019s in a name? The state-based exchanges exist only because of a broader government takeover of one of the most intricate and delicate parts of the economy. Failure was predictable, but Hawaii\u2019s botched rollout is a particularly shameful example of how poorly government was equipped to take on the task it had appropriated. In the absence of a free health-care market, Hawaiians at least deserve answers about this costly failure.\n\n\u2014 Jillian Kay Melchior is a Thomas L.
