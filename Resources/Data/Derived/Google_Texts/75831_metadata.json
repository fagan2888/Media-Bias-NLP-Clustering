The cast from the past seasons, with Ryan Seacrest as host and Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr. as judges, will return for a season-long celebration of the show\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d faded over the past few years, eclipsed in the music competition genre it pioneered by \u201cThe Voice\u201d on NBC. Personnel changes didn\u2019t help, and neither did tinkering with the format, as the show fell victim to what usually kills off most television series - old age. Still, it was a solid performer for a Fox network that struggles in the ratings.\n\nDana Walden, co-chairman and CEO of the Fox Television Group, described it as a \u201cpretty emotional decision\u201d to end \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d\n\nFox and the show\u2019s producers were discussing how the series would continue, but ultimately \u201cwe all arrived at the conclusion that it was time to bring the show to an end,\u201d said Gary Newman, co-chairman and CEO. \u201cBut we wanted to do it in a way that was special and celebratory.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdol\u201d was a quick hit, with fans following contestants who sought the prized \u201cyellow ticket\u201d to Hollywood and a chance at stardom. In the early years, \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d also showed many of the cringe-worthy auditions of contestants with no hope of winning, but has generally resisted those recently.\n\nSimon Cowell, the Brit with a tart tongue and honest assessments, became a star as judge, along with his fellow originals, Paula Abdul and Randy Jackson.\n\nThe big-voiced Clarkson became a major pop star after winning \u201cIdol,\u201d and Underwood is a solid performer on the country charts. Personalities like Adam Lambert and Clay Aiken also became household names after competing on \u201cIdol.\u201d\n\nWalden said there are no specific plans yet, but that several former contestants and judges have already expressed \u201ca lot of enthusiasm\u201d for coming back and celebrating the show\u2019s legacy in its final year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to deliver a really special season next year,\u201d Newman said.\n\nThe series averaged 12.69 million viewers during its initial run in 2002, but exploded quickly thereafter, reaching a peak average of more than 30 million viewers each episode in 2006, according to the Nielsen company. It continued averaging more than 20 million viewers an episode through the 2011 season, when its popularity declined.\n\nIts star at Fox was eclipsed this season by the music-based soap opera \u201cEmpire,\u201d which will launch its second season in the fall. So far this year, \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d is averaging 9.15 million viewers per episode, Nielsen said.\n\nThe show will run in a similar format next season as it has this year, airing Wednesday and Thursday nights starting in January for the beginning stages, then once a week on Thursday for the second part of the season, Fox said.\n\n\u2022 Television writer Lynn Elber in New York contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox is lowering the curtain on \"American Idol,\" ending a series that dominated television throughout the 2000s and made stars of the likes of Simon Cowell, Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Fox is lowering the curtain on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d ending a series that dominated television throughout the 2000s and made stars of the likes of Simon Cowell, Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood.", "title": "Fox calling an end to \u2018American Idol\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/11/fox-calling-an-end-to-american-idol/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/11/b34e68c717e02d15760f6a706700ba89.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/11/b34e68c717e02d15760f6a706700ba89.jpg", "description": "Fox is lowering the curtain on \"American Idol,\" ending a series that dominated television throughout the 2000s and made stars of the likes of Simon Cowell, Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood.", "card": "summary", "title": "Fox calling an end to \u2018American Idol\u2019"}, "Author": "David Bauder", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, American Idol, New York, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAmerican Idol\u201d faded over the past few years, eclipsed in the music competition genre it pioneered by \u201cThe Voice\u201d on NBC.\nThe network announced Monday that \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d will go off the air after its 15th season next spring.\nSo far this year, \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d is averaging 9.15 million viewers per episode, Nielsen said.\nIn the early years, \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d also showed many of the cringe-worthy auditions of contestants with no hope of winning, but has generally resisted those recently.\nNEW YORK \u2014 Fox is lowering the curtain on \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d ending a series that dominated television throughout the 2000s and made stars of the likes of Simon Cowell, Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood."}
