SOUTHWEST FORSYTH â€” The first shovels hit the dirt for two new schools this week as the Forsyth County Board of Education held groundbreaking ceremonies at both sites.

Construction on Brandywine Elementary and DeSana Middle is scheduled to begin once school lets out for summer.

The two campuses are expected to open in August 2016 for the 2016-17 school year.

They will be located between McFarland Parkway, Union Hill Road and Hwy. 9 in southwest Forsyth.
