There are turtles holding up the lampposts in the courtyard and turtles engraved in the stone decor. You can buy turtle coffee mugs at the gift shop. The turtle is said to represent the slow and deliberate pace of justice. This is an institution, the turtle tells us, that moves slowly, deliberately, and removed from the knee-jerk pace of the political branches.\n\nYet moments before they adjourned for their summer recess, the justices proved they can act quite quickly and recklessly when it comes to violating the terms of a controversial opinion they handed down only days earlier. It\u2019s as if the loaner car the court gave us in the Hobby Lobby ruling broke down mere blocks from the shop.\n\nIn Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court ruled that it was a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the religious freedoms of closely-held corporations for the government to require them to provide contraception as part of their employee health care plans. The court didn\u2019t say that the government could never require a company to do something that violated its religious beliefs, but rather that the government had to use the \u201cleast restrictive alternative.\u201d That means that if there is a slightly less burdensome way to implement the law, it needs to be used. To prove that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate was not the \u201cleast restrictive alternative,\u201d the court pointed to a workaround in the law for nonprofits: If there are religious objections to a medical treatment, third parties will provide coverage to the employees.\n\nIt\u2019s the butterfly effect: Any time Wheaton flapped its religious-conscience wings, a woman ends up with an IUD.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYet in an unsigned emergency order granted Thursday evening, the very same court said that this very same workaround it had just praised was also unconstitutional, that this workaround also burdened the religious freedom of religious employers. Overnight, the cure has become the disease. Having explicitly promised that Hobby Lobby would go no further than Hobby Lobby, the court went back on its word, then skipped town for the summer.\n\nThis new case involves Wheaton College, an evangelical Protestant liberal arts college in Illinois. A majority of the court granted Wheaton a temporary injunction allowing it to refuse to comply with the workaround, or \u201caccommodation,\u201d the court had just held up as the answer in Hobby Lobby. Under the ACA, churches have always been categorically exempt from the mandate. The law further allows religious nonprofits that don\u2019t want to offer contraception to submit a short form, known as Form 700, which affirms their religious objection to providing contraception. Form 700 enables the company\u2019s insurers or third-party administrators to cover the birth control instead of the employer. Easy peasy, right? Sign the form and you don\u2019t have to provide the coverage that violates your religious beliefs. In Hobby Lobby, Justice Alito wrote that this solution \u201cachieves all of the government\u2019s aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty.\u201d\n\nA Slate Plus Special Feature: The Breakfast Table Out Loud Slate Plus members can listen to Dahlia Lithwick and Eric Posner consider faux-nanimity on the high court and what\u2019s hinky about Hobby Lobby. Try S+ free for 2 weeks.\n\nWheaton, however, along with many other religious not-for-profits, have long objected to this very workaround. They filed lawsuits claiming that the mere fact of signing a form noting their religious objection to contraception coverage triggered third parties to provide the contraception, which triggered women to have access to morning-after pills and IUDs, which in their view were akin to abortions, and thus violated their religious consciences. Signing the form, they said, was the same as actually providing the contraceptives themselves. It\u2019s the butterfly effect of contraception. Any time Wheaton flaps its religious-conscience wings, a woman somewhere ends up with an IUD, and Wheaton\u2019s religious liberties are violated.\n\nAnd Thursday night a majority of the court agreed. The order is a preliminary injunction. The court will need to decide this and dozens of similar cases in the future. The justices caution that this in no way reflects their views of the future cases. But for our purposes, let it be known that the very workaround the court gave to religious objectors only four days earlier now likely violates their religious liberty as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFor the court to issue an emergency temporary injunction is a truly extraordinary act. Even more extraordinary was that justices filed a 16-page barnstorming dissent. And those dissenters share a highly relevant personal characteristic: a uterus. That\u2019s correct, the three dissenting justices last night were the court\u2019s three women: Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan. In the event that the religious and gender rift at the court was not already painful to behold, the dissent, penned by Sotomayor, is a forceful and unwavering rejection of both the majority\u2019s reasoning and tactics. \u201cI disagree strongly with what the court has done,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201cThose who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word. Not so today. After expressly relying on the availability of the religious-nonprofit accommodation to hold that the contraceptive coverage requirement violates [the Religious Freedom Restoration Act] as applied to closely held for-profit corporations, the Court now, as the dissent in Hobby Lobby feared it might, retreats from that position.\u201d\n\nThe dissenters take issue with several aspects of the majority\u2019s act. First is the professed scope of the Hobby Lobby decision. Try to remember all the way back to Monday, when, writing for the majority, Justice Alito folded up the decision into something he characterized as nearly trivial. Look, it practically fits into his pocket! The decision only applied to family-owned, closely-held corporations, he assured us. The ruling was not going to unsettle a thing. \u201cOur decision in these cases is concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate,\u201d he soothed. Nothing about the holding would undermine an employer\u2019s responsibility to provide vaccines to his employees, or to abide by existing employment and antidiscrimination laws. \u201cOur decision should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer\u2019s religious beliefs,\u201d he wrote. But nowhere in his opinion did Alito tell us how or why there would be no such fallout. It was an assertion; or, in light of what happened next, a nice little act of judicial three-card monte.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy, in his own concurrence to Hobby Lobby, cautioned us not to read too much into the precedent that he had just helped set, insisting that the majority opinion \u201cdoes not have the breadth and sweep ascribed to it by the respectful and powerful dissent.\u201d But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, as she is so often reminded, was not born yesterday. In her Hobby Lobby dissent, she disputed the narrowness of the rule and charged that the court had just waded into a \u201cminefield.\u201d She was right.\n\nIn the hours after the Hobby Lobby ruling came down, the court was already kicking a host of cases back to various lower courts for reconsideration in light of the new rule. Three courts of appeals were told to revisit decisions, including at least one that involved an employer with religious objections to all 20 contraception methods guaranteed under the ACA, and not just the four ruled out in Hobby Lobby. Another is the appeal from an employer whose claims about burdens on his religious liberty started out as religious, but became a libertarian screed. \u201cI don\u2019t care if the federal government is telling me to buy my employees Jack Daniel\u2019s or birth control,\u201d Michael Potter, the head of Eden Foods confessed to MSNBC\u2019s Irin Carmon last fall. \u201cWhat gives them the right to tell me that I have to do that? That\u2019s my issue, that\u2019s what I object to, and that\u2019s the beginning and end of the story.\u201d That \u201creligious\u201d objection will now be taken seriously in the courts, bearing in mind, as Justice Alito cautioned, that \u201c[i]t is not for us to say that their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.\u201d These nearly instantaneous acts by the court quickly made the narrow little Hobby Lobby ruling seem like much, much more. (Meanwhile, at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, real-live detainees are now petitioning the court for the same personhood status as Hobby Lobby so that they too may exercise religious freedom.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe second problem with the court\u2019s emergency injunction in the Wheaton case is about the viability of this workaround. You would be forgiven for having been misled. In his majority opinion in Hobby Lobby, applying the test required under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Alito determined that the problem with the contraception mandate was that it was not the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d means for the government to achieve its goals of allowing women access to contraceptive care. What the majority said in Hobby Lobby was: Given that the administration had already nipped in the mandate a little for religiously-affiliated schools, hospitals, and charities, it was clearly able to nip it the same way for the for-profits who raise the same objections. \u201cHHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cHHS has already established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious objections.\u201d In other words, since the government had already created a legal workaround\u2014the form that affirms the objection\u2014that workaround was the narrowest way to achieve the government goals. If the Little Sisters of the Poor could sign a form that kicked responsibility for insuring contraception to the third-party administrator, Hobby Lobby should be allowed to sign the form as well.\n\nAlthough the opinion nowhere guaranteed that this compromise was not also going to prove to be a religious burden, Alito said it \u201cachieves all of the government\u2019s aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty.\u201d Again, you would be forgiven for reading that to mean, as we briefly did, that the form implicitly did not burden religious liberty, even though the court did not directly decide the question. Or for expecting that the array of challenges pending in the lower courts (122 at last count) by nonprofits claiming that signing the opt-out form violates their religious liberty, might now be resolved in favor of the government. Days later, the respect it afforded religious liberty is not enough. The new unsigned opinion in Wheaton suggests that the fix to Monday\u2019s problem\u2014signing a form\u2014is now a religious burden. At this rate, by next Tuesday the court will have decided that religious objectors can more readily opt out by way of a Bat Signal to HHS. Which said workaround, in turn, will soon be found to offend religious freedom.\n\nJustice Sotomayor, in Thursday\u2019s dissent, identified the fatal flaw of the majority opinion in Hobby Lobby. \u201cLet me be absolutely clear,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI do not doubt that Wheaton genuinely believes that signing the self-certification form is contrary to its religious beliefs. But thinking one\u2019s religious beliefs are substantially burdened\u2014no matter how sincere or genuine that belief may be\u2014does not make it so.\u201d She also pointed out, in case anyone seeks to argue that the extension of the Hobby Lobby arguments to the not-for-profit claims was as \u201cnarrow\u201d as the decision in Hobby Lobby was purported to be: \u201cToday\u2019s injunction thus risks depriving hundreds of Wheaton\u2019s employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage. In addition, because Wheaton is materially indistinguishable from other nonprofits that object to the Government\u2019s accommodation,\u201d she goes on to add, \u201cthe issuance of an injunction in this case will presumably entitle hundreds or thousands of other objectors to the same remedy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "While you were sleeping, Hobby Lobby just got so much worse.", "sailthru.tags": "wheaton college supreme court, contraception supreme court, supreme court hobby lobby, supreme court hobby lobby wheaton, Christian college contraception scotus, contraception ruling supreme court, contraception affordable care act, sneaky ruling scotus", "sailthru.author": "Dahlia Lithwick, Sonja West", "description": "The architecture of the U.S. Supreme Court Building is rife with turtles.
