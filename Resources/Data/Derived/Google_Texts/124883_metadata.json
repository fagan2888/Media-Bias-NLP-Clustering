The bill, sponsored by Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, would provide $622 million to fight the virus \u2013 less than a third of what President Barack Obama asked for three months ago.\n\nA Senate bill, which is already inadequate, plans to invest $1.1 billion, well short of the $1.9 billion the administration and public-health experts believe is necessary.\n\nBecause the House and Senate passed a very different bill, there will now be a conference committee to work out the differences. By some accounts , it may be \u201cwell into the summer, or even longer\u201d before Congress approves a final bill.\n\nI\u2019m sure the virus will do us all a favor and wait while Republicans try to get their act together.\n\nThe alternative approach, of course, was simply approving the package sent to Capitol Hill by the Obama administration \u2013 a package endorsed by the CDC and public-health experts \u2013 but Republicans refused. When the Senate considered the White House plan, it had bipartisan support, but not enough to pass\n\nAt one point yesterday, as the Huffington Post reported , GOP Senate leaders said they\u2019re open to funding the Zika response, but only if Democrats accepted cuts to Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWould the senator modify her request to include my language\u2026 which has the exact same funding levels\u2026 but includes a pay-for using the prevention fund in the Affordable Care Act?\u201d [Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas)] said, referring a part of Obamacare that aims to boost public health through preventive means, but that Republicans often target as a slush fund. [Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.)] objected to Cornyn\u2019s counteroffer, noting that the prevention fund helps keep women and infants healthy \u2013 one of her same goals in pushing emergency Zika funding. \u201cThe agreement that the senator from Texas has just broached means that we\u2019re going to have to fight over cuts \u2013 cuts to women, cuts to families, cuts to critical health care efforts in order to fight the Zika virus,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThat is objectionable.\u201d\n\nWriting in The New Republic, David Dayen had a great piece on the broader story yesterday.\n\nR epublicans like to make the budget deficit a moral question about the hazards of unsustainable debt. But the hazards of hundreds of babies born with birth defects are far more immediate. And that leads you to this bizarre logic that America must allow children to suffer with potential ailments in order to express their values of fiscal responsibility. It\u2019s also a myopic way to look at the deficit. Investing money in public health today means not having to spend more in palliative care tomorrow. Stopping the Zika threat with $2 billion means not spending $3 or $4 billion to care for the deformities that would arise in children if nothing is done.\n\nBut Republicans can\u2019t bring themselves to think this way, even if it\u2019s pennywise and pound foolish. When confronted with a public-health threat, the GOP majority on Capitol Hill instinctively asks, \u201cHow can we avoid meaningful public investment in a solution?\u201d instead of, \u201cHow do we properly address the problem?\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told her colleagues yesterday, \u201cIt is not possible to nickel and dime a health emergency without consequences. As Republicans embrace this irrational anti-spending ideology, this country is put in greater and greater danger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The more serious the public health threat posed by the Zika virus, the less serious congressional Republicans are about addressing it.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congressional-republicans-reject-robust-response-zika-threat", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The more serious the public health threat posed by the Zika virus, the less serious congressional Republicans are about addressing it.", "title": "Congressional Republicans reject robust response to Zika threat", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congressional-republicans-reject-robust-response-zika-threat", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/gettyimages-510813830.jpg?itok=nkxbH73i", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congressional-republicans-reject-robust-response-zika-threat", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/gettyimages-510813830.jpg?itok=i5RwXPGR", "height": 553}, "title": "Congressional Republicans reject robust response to Zika threat", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The more serious the public health threat posed by the Zika virus, the less serious congressional Republicans are about addressing it."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-19T09:24:06-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Congressional Republicans reject robust response to Zika threat", "tags": "elizabeth-warren,house-republicans,john-cornyn,public-health,republicans,senate-republicans,zika-virus,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "05/19/2016 09:24:06 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/congressional-republicans-reject-robust-response-zika-threat"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "The more serious the public health threat posed by the Zika virus, the less serious congressional Republicans are about addressing it.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Republicans, Elizabeth Warren, House Republicans, John Cornyn, public health, Senate Republicans, Zika Virus"}, "article_summary": "The more serious the public health threat posed by the Zika virus, the less serious congressional Republicans are about addressing it.\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a Republican-backed bill Wednesday night to combat the Zika virus that the White House has already threatened to veto as inadequate.\nInvesting money in public health today means not having to spend more in palliative care tomorrow.\nI\u2019m sure the virus will do us all a favor and wait while Republicans try to get their act together.\nBecause the House and Senate passed a very different bill, there will now be a conference committee to work out the differences."}
