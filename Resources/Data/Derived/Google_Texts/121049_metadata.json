Researchers from the University of Wyoming unlocked a beneficial ingredient from chili peppers that could change the obesity epidemic, and presented their findings at the Biophysical Society\u2019s Annual Meeting.\n\n\"Obesity is caused by an imbalance between calorie intake and energy dissipation,\" said the study\u2019s co-author Vivek Krishnan, a graduate student at the University of Wyoming's School of Pharmacy research group Baskilab, in a press release. \"In our bodies, white fat cells store energy and brown fat cells serve as thermogenic machinery to burn stored fat. Eating calorie-rich food and a lack of physical activity cause an imbalance in metabolism that leads to obesity.\u201d\n\nMost people understand that if they combine eating too much food with a sedentary lifestyle, they\u2019ll end up gaining weight. Despite the facts, more than 78.6 million Americans are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers have developed a way to stimulate metabolism without having to cut calories, thanks to chili peppers\u2019 main ingredient capsaicin.\n\nResearchers found just by adding the capsaicin from chili peppers into a mouse\u2019s high-fat diet, it prevented weight gain. Not only did it prevent general weight gain, but the mouse was able to eat an unhealthy diet of high fatty foods. The mice in the study didn\u2019t eat or drink more or less because of the capsaicin additive, just simply plateaued in weight gain.\n\n\"The main goal of our work is to expand the knowledge of the mechanism by which capsaicin antagonizes obesity, as well as to advance the proof of principle of the anti-obesity potential of dietary capsaicin,\" the Baskilab researchers said. The team found capsaicin only needed to make up 0.01 percent of the mice\u2019s diet in order for the weight-gain blocking benefits to kick in, and it\u2019s all because of a protein pathway called transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1).\n\nThey believe this happens because capsaicin turns the bad, unhealthy white fat into fat-burning brown fat through thermogenics, which is the process of creating heat from burning fat. When you exercise, brown fat naturally converts white fat into more brown fat, so researchers may have unlocked a natural edible ingredient that could mimic exercise\u2019s weight maintenance benefits. Capsaicin also has the ability to turn on thermogenesis in the body, and researchers believe it could be the key to managing obesity.\n\n\"Next, we'll focus on our longer-term goal of developing TRPV1 agonists as new drug molecules to prevent and treat obesity,\u201d researchers announced. \u201cWe envision a nanoparticle-based sustained-release formulation of capsaicin, which is currently under development in our laboratory. In turn, this will advance a novel dietary supplement-based approach to prevent and treat one of the life-threatening diseases, obesity and its associated complications \u2014 in humans.\"\n\nRecipes With A Dash Of Anti-Obesity Capsaicin:\n\nStuffed Roasted Bell Peppers: Cut the tops off of four bell peppers and core them. Add cooked brown rice saut\u00e9ed with black beans, chopped onions, and chili peppers or powder. Spoon into bell peppers and cover with top. Place in preheated oven at 425 degrees for 45 minutes. Cucumber Chile Lime Taco Salad: Slice cucumbers into a bowl with chili powder, black peppers, freshly squeezed lime juice and toss. Cook in a separate pan saut\u00e9ed lean ground turkey with diced onions and tomatoes, and a sprinkle of chili powder until turkey is thoroughly browned. Drain meat juices and lay cucumber mix over turkey meat to serve. Grilled Shrimp Linguine with Chili Sauce: Cook linguine or angel hair pasta al dente and set aside. Grill peeled and deveined shrimp in a sauce pan with black pepper and paprika and add pasta portion to the pan. In a mixing bowl blend 2 parts sour cream, 1 part mayo, freshly squeezed lime juice, 1 teaspoon of chipotle chili sauce, and 1 teaspoon of chili powder. Toss sauce over pasta and let cook together for 5 to 8 minutes.\n\nChili pepper breakdown. Photo courtesy of Pinterest\n\nSources: Krishnan V and Thyagarajan B.
