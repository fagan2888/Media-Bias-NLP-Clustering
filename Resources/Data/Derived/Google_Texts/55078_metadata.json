The food was that good! That is why I can tell you that you really need to check out this event next week!\n\nOur friends over at The Point are hosting a $20 sushi tasting at the new American Tobacco Campus hot spot on Tuesday, March 24. For $20, you get two pieces of sashimi roll, two pieces of volcano roll, a small cup of pork ramen, two pieces of chicken karaage and three half pieces of mochi (coffee, green tea, or mango).\n\nOnly a limited number of tickets are being sold for this event so buy your tickets early.\n\nThe fish at Basan is shipped in just about every day - so you are getting quality sashimi and sushi rolls. And the sake isn't too bad either!", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-03-17 14:17:00", "description": "For $20, you will get to sample sushi at one of Durham's hottest new restaurants.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-17 14:17:00", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14518505|asset_type=blogpost"}, "twitter": {"description": "For $20, you will get to sample sushi at one of Durham's hottest new restaurants.", "title": "The Point to host sushi tasting at Basan :: Out and About at WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/the-point-to-host-sushi-tasting-at-basan/14518505/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/entertainment/out_and_about/2015/02/04/14422360/14422360-1426528613-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-17T14:17:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "For $20, you will get to sample sushi at one of Durham's hottest new restaurants.", "title": "The Point to host sushi tasting at Basan :: Out and About at WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/the-point-to-host-sushi-tasting-at-basan/14518505/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/entertainment/out_and_about/2015/02/04/14422360/14422360-1426528613-646x485.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdce9\"", "article_summary": "Our friends over at The Point are hosting a $20 sushi tasting at the new American Tobacco Campus hot spot on Tuesday, March 24.\nThe fish at Basan is shipped in just about every day - so you are getting quality sashimi and sushi rolls.\nYou must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other charactersMore on this BasanRead The Point\u2014 I went to Basan last month and I think I ate my weight in sushi.\nOnly a limited number of tickets are being sold for this event so buy your tickets early.\nFor $20, you get two pieces of sashimi roll, two pieces of volcano roll, a small cup of pork ramen, two pieces of chicken karaage and three half pieces of mochi (coffee, green tea, or mango)."}
