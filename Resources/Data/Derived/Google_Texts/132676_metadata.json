It has been a long time since our first debate, seven months ago in Cleveland. A lot has transpired since then, obviously, including an RNC pledge that all of you signed agreeing to support the party's nominee and not to launch an independent run. Tonight, in 30 seconds, can you definitively say you will support the Republican nominee, even if that nominee is Donald J. Trump?\n\n\n\nSenator Rubio, yes or no?\n\n\n\nRUBIO: I'll support the Republican nominee.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Mr. Trump? Yes or no?\n\n\n\nRUBIO: I'll support Donald if he's the Republican nominee, and let me tell you why. Because the Democrats have two people left in the race. One of them is a socialist. America doesn't want to be a socialist country. If you want to be a socialist country, then move to a socialist country.\n\n\n\nThe other one is under FBI investigation. And not only is she under FBI investigation, she lied to the families of the victims of Benghazi, and anyone who lies to the families of victims who lost their lives in the service of our country can never be the commander- in-chief of the United States.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senator...\n\n\n\nRUBIO: We must defeat Hillary Clinton.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senator Cruz, yes or no, you will support Donald Trump is he's the nominee?\n\n\n\nCRUZ: Yes, because I gave my word that I would. And what I have endeavored to do every day in the Senate is do what I said I would do. You know, just on Tuesday, we saw an overwhelming victory in the state of Texas where I won Texas by 17 percent.\n\n\n\nAnd I will say it was a powerful affirmation that the people who know me best, the people who I campaigned, who made promises that if you elect me, I'll lead the fight against Obamacare, I'll lead the fight against amnesty, I'll lead the fight against our debt, and I will fight for the Bill of Rights and your rights every day, that the people of Texas said you have kept your word, and that's what I'll do as president.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Governor Kasich, yes or no, would you support Donald Trump as the Republican nominee?\n\n\n\nKASICH: Yeah. But -- and I kind of think that, before it's all said and done, I'll be the nominee. But let me also say...\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nBut let me also say, remember...\n\n\n\nBAIER: But your answer is yes?\n\n\n\nKASICH: But I'm the little engine that can. And, yeah, look, when you're in the arena, and we're in the arena. And the people out here watching -- we're in the arena, we're traveling, we're working, we spend time away from our family, when you're in the arena, you enter a special circle. And you want to respect the people that you're in the arena with. So if he ends up as the nominee -- sometimes, he makes it a little bit hard -- but, you know, I will support whoever is the Republican nominee for president.\n\n\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Mr. Trump, I'm going to ask you a version of the same question. As we saw today with Mitt Romney, the #NeverTrump movement is gaining steam. Some people are talking about contributing millions of dollars to try to stop you. Again today, you raised the possibility that you might run as an independent if you feel you're treated unfairly by the Republican Party.\n\n\n\nSo I'm going to phrase the question that the other three people on this stage just got. Can you definitively say tonight that you will definitely support the Republican nominee for president, even if it's not you?\n\n\n\nTRUMP: Even if it's not me?\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nLet me just start off by saying...\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Thirty seconds, sir.\n\n\n\nTRUMP: ... OK -- that I'm very, very proud of -- millions and millions of people have come to the Republican Party over the last little while. They've come to the Republican Party. And by the way, the Democrats are losing people. This is a trend that's taking place. It's the biggest thing happening in politics, and I'm very proud to be a part of it. And I'm going to give them some credit, too, even though they don't deserve it. But the answer is: Yes, I will.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Yes, you will support the nominee of the party? TRUMP: Yes, I will. Yes. I will.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Echoing the iconic moment from the first debate of the cycle, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Donald Trump all agree to definitely support the Republican nominee, no matter who it is.", "title": "All Four Candidates Pledge To Support GOP Nominee", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@rcpvideo", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/03/03/all_four_candidates_pledge_to_support_gop_nominee.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/349689.jpg", "type": "video", "description": "Echoing the iconic moment from the first debate of the cycle, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Donald Trump all agree to definitely support the Republican nominee, no matter who it is.", "title": "All Four Candidates Pledge To Support GOP Nominee"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "All Four Candidates Pledge To Support GOP Nominee", "keywords": "Donald Trump,Election 2016,John Kasich,Marco Rubio,Ted Cruz,"}, "article_summary": "Tonight, in 30 seconds, can you definitively say you will support the Republican nominee, even if that nominee is Donald J.
