Democratic two-term President Barack Obama plays a starring role in the latest statewide television ad from James Comer, as the GOP primary candidate says he will fight back against the president’s federal policies.

While the 2016 presidential race begins to take shape that’s not stopping Republicans in the Kentucky gubernatorial race from targeting the incumbent president who will be leaving office in January of 2017 — just one year into the four year term as Kentucky governor.

Relying on his court fight against the federal Drug Enforcement Agency during the summer of 2014 over hundreds of pounds of hemp seeds Comer says he has a track record of taking on Obama and winning.

The DEA seized of 250 pounds of hemp seeds flown into Louisville from Italy for the states pilot hemp projects something, Comer says was proof of Obama’s Kentucky job killing ways.

“I fought back and won,” he says in the ad.

Lawyers for the Department of Agriculture and thus Comer, the state Agriculture Commissioner, reached a deal with the DEA and Department of Justice which resulted in the DEA issuing a permit to import the agricultural seeds.

In the ad Comer borrows a page from the Mitch McConnell guide to political victory by targeting the Environmental Protection Agency’s “war on coal” and the Affordable Care Act.

“As Governor I’ll fight back against Obama’s federal overreach, whether it’s stopping his war on coal, fighting illegal immigration or saying no to more Obamacare in Kentucky,” he said in the ad.

Comer’s campaign says the ad will replace the two ads that have been running on cable and satellite statewide, and will be broadcast in the Lexington and Bowling Green TV markets. The campaign says this buy is approximately 10 percent larger than previous buy.

Comer faces Louisville investor Matt Bevin, former Louisville Metro Council member Hal Heiner and former state Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott in the May GOP primary.
