He says he will go to Washington to attack President Obama and the Senate leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada.\n\nHow this argument plays out matters. An upset by Ms. Nunn in Georgia, which has been solidly Republican for more than a decade, was long considered just a bonus possibility for her party. Now Democrats hold six or seven vulnerable Senate seats in the Nov. 4 elections, and a loss of six would cost them the majority. They need to win in a couple of Republican-held states. Georgia, where Senator Saxby Chambliss is retiring, is one of the two best options for a Democratic victory.\n\nDemocrats hoped to run against one of Georgia\u2019s House incumbents. Instead, they face a political newcomer, a corporate executive and cousin of a former governor of Georgia, Sonny Perdue.\n\nThis race is surprisingly close because of the state\u2019s changing demographics. As recently as 2004, whites, who vote overwhelmingly Republican, accounted for 71 percent of the electorate. In 2012, they made up a little more than 61 percent. The black vote, almost all Democratic, grew to 30 percent from less than 25 percent, and the small Hispanic vote is increasing. The Atlas Project, a Democratic organization that studies voting patterns, projects that this trend will continue.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDemocrats say they\u2019re competitive in Georgia this year because of two candidates with impressive political pedigrees. Ms. Nunn is the daughter of a much-admired former senator, Sam Nunn. The Democratic nominee for governor is Jason Carter, grandson of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nThis year \u201cis a gift,\u201d said Stacey Abrams, the Democratic leader in the Georgia House of Representatives, who spearheaded the registration of 120,000 new voters and will lead the turnout drive. \u201cThe demographics are not yet sufficient,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we have two strong candidates with strong names.\u201d\n\nThe math is simple. Ms. Nunn needs close to 30 percent of the white vote \u2014 Mr. Obama got about 23 percent in Georgia in 2012 \u2014 and needs black voters to turn out in numbers such that they account for nearly 30 percent of the vote, or slightly less than in the 2012 presidential election. Mr. Perdue needs to get 75 percent of the white vote this year to at least match the share of the electorate that whites represented two years ago, when they counted for slightly over 61 percent.\n\nHe\u2019s running against Washington, the president and the immigration overhaul bill, which he calls amnesty. He also wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMs. Nunn has a tougher tightrope to walk: She needs to appeal to the base by embracing pay equity for women, a higher minimum wage, immigration overhaul, and mend, not end, the Affordable Care Act. Simultaneously, she has taken as a model her father\u2019s record as a fiscal moderate and national-security realist, promising to \u201creach across the aisle\u201d to seek bipartisan accords.\n\nShe has impressive business supporters, like Mitesh Shah, the chief executive of a private equity real estate firm. A lifelong Republican, Mr. Shah says he is bothered by his party\u2019s rightward drift on social issues such as immigration.\n\n\u201cI may not always agree with her, but I think Michelle is different and can make a difference in Washington,\u201d Mr. Shah said.\n\nMr. Perdue has run as a job creator. On Friday, however, a nine-year-old deposition came to light in which he readily acknowledged that as a chief executive he had outsourced jobs.\n\nPolls show a tight race, which includes a libertarian candidate expected to get 3 percent to 4 percent of the vote. If no candidate gets 50 percent of the vote, Georgia law requires a runoff on Jan. 6.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoth camps agree that would be a nightmare, especially if control of the Senate is at stake. Experts predict that $100 million in campaign funds would pour into Georgia during the two-month runoff.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141005130932, "twitter": {"description": "The state race is surprisingly competitive because of the changing demographics, but the party has two candidates with impressive political pedigrees.", "title": "Democrats Hope for an Upset in Georgia", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/us/politics/democrats-hope-for-an-upset-in-georgia.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003158820"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/us/politics/democrats-hope-for-an-upset-in-georgia.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003158820", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/us/politics/democrats-hope-for-an-upset-in-georgia.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Democrats Hope for an Upset in Georgia", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 5, 2014", "edt": "Global", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Midterm Elections (2014),Georgia,Senate,Nunn  Michelle,Democratic Party,Perdue  David A Jr,Republican Party", "news_keywords": "Georgia country,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Albert R.
