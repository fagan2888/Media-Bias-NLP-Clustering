WASHINGTON (WJLA) - Nearly 16 million Americans on Medicare Advantage (MA) plans will pay more for their health insurance in 2015 as a result of Obamacare.

Federal subsidies for MA coverage are being displaced to pay for the Affordable Care Act, resulting $160 billion worth of cuts by 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

"Right before we left on a trip our 2015 book came to our house and it said 'changes,'" said Janet Trimble, a Medicare Advantage enrollee."I always hate when I see the word 'changes.'"

The 2015 changes impact those over 65 with MAs who will either be paying higher premiums or paying premiums for the first time.

Additionally, many MA plans will offer fewer choices of doctors and hospitals for enrollees.

"Medicare advantage plans, most of them are going to be offering options with premiums because of the money that's being taken out of their hands by the Obama administration," American Enterprise Institute Health Care Scholar Joe Antos said.
