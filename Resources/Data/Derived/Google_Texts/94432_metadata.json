The government also reported a smaller than expected decline in overall imports and much higher than expected imports from Hong Kong.\n\nRelated: Is China or the Middle East a Bigger Threat to Stocks?\n\nAnalysts originally greeted the news as very positive and an indication that China might not need to take steps toward further devaluing the yuan against the U.S. dollar.\n\n\u201cThe past couple of months, we\u2019ve seen exports surprise on the upside,\u201d wrote Tim Condon of ING Group. \u201cWorries that something is going on in China behind the scenes, that real compelling economic fundamentals are pushing the yuan weaker, is inconsistent with what we\u2019re seeing on the trade front.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s better-than-forecast trade figures may signal the beginning of a modest improvement as the yuan stabilizes against a weighted basket of currencies,\u201d wrote Ding Schuang of Standard Chartered Bank. \u201cThat could translate into export growth of 5% to 7% and import growth of 1% to 2% this year. Demand may not be a big driver, but China is becoming more competitive with its exchange rate.\n\nGiven the turmoil that the Chinese economy and stock market have been experiencing in recent months, though, some more skeptical observers believe that what we\u2019re seeing in China is thinly-disguised capital flight, as investors try to evade the currency controls put in place by the government to try to stabilize the economy.\n\nRelated: Misreading China Leads to Another Foolish Market Rout\n\nWealthy Chinese and foreign investors with large holdings in mainland China have historically used dubious invoicing practices to get around limits on exchanging yuan for dollars and other foreign currency.\n\nWhen there were limits on bringing foreign currency into China, analysts believed that the practice of over-invoicing for exports was common \u2013 meaning that dollars and other foreign currencies could flow into China in the guise of legitimate commerce.\n\nNow, with the government placing limits on the purchase of foreign currency, there is suspicion that over-invoicing on imports may be allowing some Chinese investors to move money in the other direction. They point to a very surprising 64.5 percent spike in imports from Hong Kong as a possible smoking gun.\n\n\u201cAs both imports and exports to Hong Kong broke with trends in a major way, it suggests the figures are likely driven by capital flight,\" wrote Oliver Barron, head of research in the Beijing offices of brokerage North Square Blue Oak.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Global stock markets reacted positively to trade data coming out of China on Wednesday, despite conspicuous doubts among many economists and analysts about what the numbers actually represent.", "title": "China\u2019s Rosy Trade Numbers May Reflect a Darker Trend", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/China-s-Rosy-Trade-Numbers-May-Reflect-Darker-Trend", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-currency-banks_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/13/China-s-Rosy-Trade-Numbers-May-Reflect-Darker-Trend", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/china-currency-banks_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Global stock markets reacted positively to trade data coming out of China on Wednesday, despite conspicuous doubts among many economists and analysts about what the numbers actually represent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The government also reported a smaller than expected decline in overall imports and much higher than expected imports from Hong Kong.\nThey point to a very surprising 64.5 percent spike in imports from Hong Kong as a possible smoking gun.\n\u201cThe past couple of months, we\u2019ve seen exports surprise on the upside,\u201d wrote Tim Condon of ING Group.\nGlobal stock markets reacted positively to trade data coming out of China on Wednesday, at least for a few hours, despite doubts among many economists and analysts about what the numbers actually represent.\n\u201cThat could translate into export growth of 5% to 7% and import growth of 1% to 2% this year."}
