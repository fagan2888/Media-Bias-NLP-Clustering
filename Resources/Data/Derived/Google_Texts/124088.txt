You may remember a couple weeks ago when we dissected the reasons why Michigan has such high rates of non-religious circumcision. A group has been protesting routine male infant circumcision , so we thought it was a good time to bring the subject up. While no definite conclusions were drawn, it seems like one popular theory is that the Midwest doesn't usually set trends culturally. In fact, we're usually lagging a little behind.A reader sent us another theory via email yesterday afternoon and we thought it was interesting enough to share:"[A medical doctor] believes that it is done so all boys will look the same and they cannot be singled out for genocidal purposes. For example, during WWI in Turkey, all Christian men (Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians) were identified by dropping their pants and then killing them during the Armenian Genocide, since Christians in the Middle East do not circumcise their boys. In Germany, during WWII, Jewish males were identified by a similar process, since only Jews were circumcised and German Christian males were not."
