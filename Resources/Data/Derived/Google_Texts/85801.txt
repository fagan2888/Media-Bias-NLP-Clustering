South Florida residents are signing up for health insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act at some of the highest rates in the nation, according to enrollment data released this week by the federal government.

Of ZIP codes with more than 1,000 residents where insurance plans are available through the ACA exchange, Healthcare.gov, 34 of the 40 with the highest enrollment rates were in Florida, the data shows.

Six of the 40 ZIP codes with the highest enrollment rates in the country were in Broward and Palm Beach counties. Those areas are home to large numbers of non-English speakers who were the focus of outreach efforts by federally funded health insurance "navigators."

The Florida ZIP code with the highest enrollment rate, 33126, is in Miami-Dade County and includes parts of the city of Miami, Fountainblue and Doral. There, 8,919 policies — representing 18.6 percent of the population — were renewed or created between Nov. 15 and Jan. 15, according to the data by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The top 12 highest-enrolling ZIP codes in Florida were all in Miami-Dade County, which had one of the highest rates of people without health insurance in the nation prior to the first ACA enrollments in 2013.

Two ZIP codes in central Broward County had the next-highest enrollment rates. In 13th place was 33068, spanning Tamarac and Margate, where 15.5 percent, or 7,759 of the estimated 50,207 population, was enrolled. Next was 33313, covering parts of Lauderhill, Sunrise, Plantation and Lauderdale Lakes, where 15.2 percent, or 8,651 of the estimated 56,934 population, enrolled.

Three ZIP codes in Palm Beach County saw 12 percent or more of its residents enrolled: 33344, encompassing a section of eastern Delray Beach west of South Dixie Highway; 33403, comprising Lake Park and Palm Beach Gardens; and 33435, which is mostly Boynton Beach.

In Broward and Palm Beach counties, federally funded navigator programs focused on reaching out to non-English-speaking Haitian and Latino residents, program directors in the two counties said.

In the 10 Broward and Palm ZIP codes with the highest enrollment rates, 34 percent of the population was born outside the U.S., according to the U.S. census. Of that non-native population, 35 percent was born in Haiti.

Non-English-speaking residents, including Spanish speakers, are more likely to be uninsured because of language barriers and "not having a solid understanding of the system and available resources," said Andrea Stephenson, executive director of Health Council of Southeast Florida in Palm Beach Gardens. Four of the agency's nine navigators spoke fluent Haitian-Creole and five spoke fluent Spanish in addition to English, Stephenson said.

Lisa Agate, program manager for Broward Regional Health Planning Council, which assists enrollees in Broward County, said the agency participated in numerous health fairs and community center events with navigators who could speak Spanish, Haitian-Creole, French and English.

Agate said her agency focused its efforts on central Broward communities because of the high concentration of uninsured people who were also employed and could afford to pay for health insurance plans at subsidized rates.

The health insurance enrollment period ends Feb. 15. Broward County residents who still want to enroll can find further information at getcoveredamerica.org or healthcare.gov.
