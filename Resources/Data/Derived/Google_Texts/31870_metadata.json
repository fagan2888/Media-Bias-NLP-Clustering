The list further refines its Top 100 Hospitals list the consulting firm released last month.\n\nTruven broke down the systems into three categories, picking five systems for each: Large health systems with more than $1.5 billion in total operating expenses, medium systems with $750 million to $1.5 billion in total operating expenses and small systems with less than $750 million in total operating expenses.\n\nAccording to Truven, the firm analyzed nine metrics to come up with the rankings: mortality, medical complications, patient safety, average length of stay, 30-day mortality rate, 30-day readmission rate, adherence to clinical standards of care, Medicare spend per beneficiary and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems patient survey scores. The firm used data from the 2012 and 2013 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review data and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Hospital Compare datasets.\n\nOn Friday, CMS unveiled its own star rankings for U.S. hospitals on its Hospital Compare site, though those rankings are exclusively based on HCAHPS survey scores. Healthgrades has also released its top hospitals list for 2015, though it has not narrowed down the rankings in a similar \"best of\" list.\n\nClick through this slideshow to see the hospitals Truven chose.\n\nAdvance slide to start gallery.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/slideshow/truven-names-top-15-health-systems-america", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/ohiohealth_2.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "According to Truven, the firm analyzed nine quality metrics to come up with the rankings, which break down by size of the health system.", "title": "Truven names top 15 health systems in America"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/ohiohealth_2.jpg"}, "description": "According to Truven, the firm analyzed nine quality metrics to come up with the rankings, which break down by size of the health system.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Truven names top 15 health systems in America"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The hospital listing blitz continued on Monday, as Truven Analytics unveiled its Top 15 Health Systems of 2015.
