They played a very close-checking game. It\u2019s really good for us to get the win. Hopefully, we can build off that and get some confidence.\u201d\n\nBoston College\u2019s Thatcher Demko made 28 saves, and stopped Pittsburgh Penguins prospect Kasperi Kapanen in the shootout to secure the victory.\n\n\u201cI thought we got better as the game went on,\u201d Demko said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good starting point, and something we can work forward from.\u201d\n\nMikko Rantanen opened the scoring for Finland, and Boston College\u2019s Alex Tuch tied it on a first-period power play. Ville Husso stopped 36 shots for Finland.\n\nIn the other Group A game Friday night at Bell Centre, Canada beat Slovakia 8-0.\n\nRobby Fabbri led Canada with two goals and two assists, Nic Petan added a goal and two assists, Max Domi, Anthony Duclair, Jake Virtanen and Brayden Point each had a goal and an assist, Nick Paul also scored and Zach Fucale made 12 saves.\n\nThe United States will face Germany on Sunday, Slovakia on Monday and finish group play Wednesday night against Canada. The top two teams in each group will advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Group B in Toronto, Russia rallied to beat Denmark 3-2 in a shootout, and Sweden topped the Czech Republic 5-2.\n\nSergei Tolchinski and Nikolai Goldobin scored for Russia in the shootout. Nikolaj Ehlers and Oliver Bjorkstrand staked Denmark to a 2-0 lead in the first period. Goldobin scored in the second, and Maxim Mamin tied it in the third.\n\n\u201cI think we were a little bit surprised by how well they played,\u201d Tolchinski said. \u201cThey have a really good team. They were proud and skilled. We didn\u2019t expect that kind of hockey.\u201d\n\nAdrian Kempe scored twice, and Jens Looke, Jacob de la Rose and Maple Leafs first-round pick William Nylander added goals for Sweden. Jakub Vrana scored twice for the Czech Republic.\n\n\u201cIt was good to get off to a good start in the tournament after two bad exhibition games,\u201d Nylander. \u201cIt\u2019s our first game and we want to go far in the tournament, so we wanted to just play our game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "US beats Finland 2-1 in SO in junior hockey opener", "title": "US beats Finland 2-1 in SO in junior hockey opener", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/26/us-beats-finland-2-1-in-so-in-junior-hockey-opener/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226_055923_us-finland.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226_055923_us-finland.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-26T17:54:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:46:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Jakub Vrana scored twice for the Czech Republic.\nMONTREAL \u2014 Jack Eichel and Chase DeLeo scored in a shootout to help the United States beat defending champion Finland 2-1 on Friday in their round-robin opener in the World Junior Championship.\nWe didn\u2019t expect that kind of hockey.\u201dAdrian Kempe scored twice, and Jens Looke, Jacob de la Rose and Maple Leafs first-round pick William Nylander added goals for Sweden.\nThe United States will face Germany on Sunday, Slovakia on Monday and finish group play Wednesday night against Canada.\nIn the other Group A game Friday night at Bell Centre, Canada beat Slovakia 8-0."}
