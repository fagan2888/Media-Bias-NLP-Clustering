But while the PAC says \u201cwe\u201d will demand refunds from \u201cRINOs\u201d (Republicans In Name Only), a ThinkProgress review campaign finance records finds that almost none of those Congressmen actually received any support from the group \u2014 and its treasurer has indirectly helped elect numerous liberal Democrats.\n\nIn the announcement, PAC Treasurer Dan Backer (a campaign compliance lawyer for Republican candidates and causes) promises to let the 87 Republicans in the House of Representatives who voted for the deal, \u201chear something new\u201d and to \u201chelp conservatives across the country demand refunds from all those RINOs we\u2019ve contributed [sic] for years on the promise of stopping Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOn the group\u2019s rinorefund.com site, users can request a refund for their own donation to any of the 87 \u2014 and can donate to the PAC\u2019s \u201cRINO Refund\u201d effort. Donations, the group says, will go to help share the campaign nationally.\n\nAnd while Backer laments that the \u201conly sound these establishment sell-outs seem to hear is the sound of money from croney capitalist pals,\u201d a review of his own donations finds his own giving has been anything but focused on electing only true conservatives. In addition to a $425 donation to Mitt Romney, Backer gave $250 to the leadership PAC for former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown (R) \u2014 nine months after Brown made it clear that he was not a Tea Partier and dismissed the Tea Party movement\u2019s role in his 2010 special election win.\n\nMost of Backer\u2019s recent donations, however, went to two PACs focused not on conservative causes but on college fraternities and sororities. He gave $2,305 to ZETEPAC, a PAC aimed only at electing Zeta Psi fraternity alumni to political office. The PAC\u2019s recipients have included Democratic California State Senator Alex Padilla and Democratic New York City Councilman Dan Garodnick. He also gave $2,000 to Fraternity & Sorority PAC, a committee which supports candidates \u201cwho support the objectives of fraternity life\u201d \u2014 including Democrats like Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kay Hagan (D-NC), Tim Johnson (D-SD), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), and Robert Menendez (D-NJ) \u2014 all who whom voted for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd while the Tea Party Leadership Fund PAC distributed more than $86,000 to at least 50 candidates since the start of the 2012 campaign, just four of the candidates it actually supported are among the 87 RINOs the group suggests it helped elect. One of those four \u2014 Rep. Steve Daines (R-MT) \u2014 is still listed on the PAC\u2019s list of six recommended candidates. While the PAC talks about how what \u201cwe need now is our money back,\u201d there is very little of them in the \u201cwe.\u201d\n\nSince June of 2012, the Tea Party Leadership Fund PAC has paid more than $74,000 in legal fees to DB Capitol Strategies PLLC, Backer\u2019s consulting firm \u2014 almost as much as it has spent in contributions to candidates. But there is no option on the RINO Refund page for donors to request refunds from Backer and his PAC.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Tea Party Leadership Fund PAC, a political action committee that has raised millions from activists to support \u201cthe election of strong Conservatives nationwide,\u201d launched a new campaign on Friday aimed at punishing Republicans who voted for the October compromise to avoid a debt default.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The Tea Party Leadership Fund PAC, a political action committee that has raised millions from activists to support \u201cthe election of strong Conservatives nationwide,\u201d launched a new campaign on Friday aimed at punishing Republicans who voted for the October compromise to avoid a debt default.", "title": "Why The Tea Party\u2019s RINO Campaign Is Nothing More Than A Gimmick", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2013/11/04/2882451/rino-refund/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RINORefund3x2-e1383580091114.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Tea Party Leadership Fund PAC, a political action committee that has raised millions from activists to support \u201cthe election of strong Conservatives nationwide,\u201d launched a new campaign on Friday aimed at punishing Republicans who voted for the October compromise to avoid a debt default.", "creator": "@jeisrael", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RINORefund3x2-e1383578107426-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why The Tea Party\u2019s RINO Campaign Is Nothing More Than A Gimmick", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RINORefund3x2-e1383580091114.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RINORefund3x2-e1383580091114.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-04T11:27:30+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshisraelinvestigates"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94ad\"", "article_summary": "But there is no option on the RINO Refund page for donors to request refunds from Backer and his PAC.\nPolitics Why The Tea Party\u2019s RINO Campaign Is Nothing More Than A Gimmick CREDIT:The Tea Party Leadership Fund PAC, a political action committee that has raised millions of dollars from activists to support \u201cthe election of strong Conservatives nationwide,\u201d launched a new campaign on Friday aimed at punishing Republicans who voted for the October compromise to avoid a debt default and reopen the federal government.\nHe also gave $2,000 to Fraternity & Sorority PAC, a committee which supports candidates \u201cwho support the objectives of fraternity life\u201d \u2014 including Democrats like Sens.\nOne of those four \u2014 Rep.
