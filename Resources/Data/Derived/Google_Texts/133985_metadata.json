On the other hand, I\u2019m quite critical of newspapers which are published in democratic countries.\u201d\n\nBiard said that the cartoon is not just \u201ca little figure of Mohammed,\u201d but a symbol:\n\nIt\u2019s the symbol of freedom of speech, of freedom of religion, of democracy, and secularism. It is this symbol that these newspapers refuse to publish. This is what they must understand. When they refuse to publish this cartoon, when they blur it out, when they decline to publish it, they blur out democracy, secularism, freedom of religion and they insult their citizenship.\n\nBiard said that Charlie Hebdo\u2019s cartoons defend freedom of religion: \u201cEvery time that we draw a cartoon of Mohammad, every time that we draw a cartoon of a prophet, every time that we draw a cartoon of God, we defend the freedom of religion.\u201d\n\nBiard added that he believes God must remain a private rather than a public figure. He believes religion \u201chas no place in the political arena\u201d and defended \u201csecularism\u201d as the best guarantee of freedom, peace and democracy.\n\nAccording to Biard, once religion \u201cinjects itself into the political debate,\u201d the debate \u201cbecomes totalitarian.\u201d\n\nCharlie Hebdo\u2019s first cover after the attack once again featured a depiction of Mohammed.\n\nSee more of the controversial images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "G\u00e9rard Biard, editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo, criticized news outlets that chose not to republish the French satirical magazine's controversial cartoons.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "G\u00e9rard Biard, editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo, criticized news outlets that chose not to republish the French satirical magazine's controversial cartoons.", "title": "Charlie Hebdo Editor Faults News Outlets for Not Showing Cartoons: 'They Blur Out Democracy'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150118_CharlieHebdo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KTQhmi"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "G\u00e9rard Biard, editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo, criticized news outlets that chose not to republish the French satirical magazine's controversial cartoons.", "title": "Charlie Hebdo Editor Faults News Outlets for Not Showing Cartoons: 'They Blur Out Democracy'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150118_CharlieHebdo.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2015-01-18T12:09:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Charlie Hebdo, Charlie Hebdo Editor-in-Chief, G\u00e9rard Biard, Chuck Todd, Meet The Press, terrorism, France, Paris attack"}, "article_summary": "G\u00e9rard Biard, editor in chief of Charlie Hebdo, criticized news outlets that chose not to republish the French satirical magazine\u2019s controversial cartoons after the terrorist attack that left 12 people dead.\nIt is this symbol that these newspapers refuse to publish.\nWhen they refuse to publish this cartoon, when they blur it out, when they decline to publish it, they blur out democracy, secularism, freedom of religion and they insult their citizenship.\nHe believes religion \u201chas no place in the political arena\u201d and defended \u201csecularism\u201d as the best guarantee of freedom, peace and democracy.\n\u201cWhat is your reaction to our decision and others who have chosen not to show your cover?\u201d Todd asked."}
