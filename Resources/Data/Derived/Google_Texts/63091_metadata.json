And, rest assured, it won\u2019t take more than a minute to read. Trump\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d consists of seven random nostrums that appear to have been hastily cribbed from conservative and libertarian websites by his various flunkies. And it confirms yet again that neither \u201cthe Donald\u201d nor his yes men are willing to do their homework.\n\nIf you have read any serious Obamacare replacement plan, such as Senator Tom Price\u2019s proposal, you will recognize Trump\u2019s solution as the empty blather of a profoundly unserious man. Consider this stroke of genius (number 4 on his list): \u201cAllow individuals to use Health Savings Accounts (HSAs).\u201d Evidently, neither Trump nor his minions realize that individuals are already \u201callowed\u201d to use HSAs. If this part of the plan more closely resembled the sweeping proposal for which Ben Carson was viciously attacked last year, it might be worthy of serious consideration.\n\nNow that Dr. Carson has endorsed Trump, perhaps he can convince the Donald to build a genuine health reform plan around the HSA. That\u2019s unlikely, however. Like Trump\u2019s other proposals, it\u2019s just something to put on the website so he can claim to have an actual plan. Number 5 on his list, for example, reads thus: \u201cRequire price transparency from all healthcare providers, especially doctors and\u2026 hospitals.\u201d As with his HSA proposal, this betrays breathtaking ignorance. Such transparency has already been mandated by Obamacare and it has accomplished nothing.\n\nTransparency isn\u2019t the panacea Trump thinks it is because he makes uninformed assumptions about the health care market. His ignorance is such that, even when one of his borrowed ideas makes sense, he adds some caveat that would hobble its effectiveness. Item 2, for example, calls for removal of legal barriers that prevent the sale of coverage across state lines: \u201cAs long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state.\u201d Trump clearly has no idea that such requirements have been a major driver of our high uninsured rate.\n\nThe only feature of Trump\u2019s plan that escaped the brainless alterations that his platoon of plagiarists have made to otherwise sensible ideas, like selling coverage across state lines, is item number 6: \u201cBlock-grant Medicaid to the states. Nearly every state already offers benefits beyond what is required in the current Medicaid structure. The state governments know their people best and can manage the administration of Medicaid far better without federal overhead.\u201d This is not a new idea, of course, but it\u2019s a good one. How it escaped being mangled by Trump\u2019s minions is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nThis one good idea wasn\u2019t enough, however, to stave off the well-deserved scorn to which Trump\u2019s plan has been subjected by countless health care experts. But few of these wonks discuss the worst problem with Trump\u2019s faux proposal. Ironically, the introduction to his plan points it out: \u201cOn day one of the Trump Administration, we will ask Congress to immediately deliver a full repeal of Obamacare.\u201d The problem is that there will be no Trump administration. If he is the GOP nominee this fall, Hillary Clinton will win and control of the Senate will return to the Democrats.\n\nEven if one adopts the position of the typical Trump supporter who believes we should ignore eight solid months of voter surveys showing the Donald being hammered by Hillary in the general election, just imagine what a presidential debate between Trump and Clinton would look like. Hillary may be dishonest, but she isn\u2019t stupid. If you think Marco Rubio made a fool of the Donald over Obamacare, that was a mere rehearsal for what Hillary would do to him. Indeed, Trump\u2019s incoherent health care proposal will be one of the main weapons she would use to cut him to pieces.\n\nShe will point out that the first item of his health care plan contains the following verbiage: \u201cOur elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.\u201d Then she will remind the audience that shortly before he adopted this position, he told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, \u201cI like the mandate.\u201d She is virtually certain to introduce that topic thus: \u201cDonald Trump was for the individual mandate before he was against it.\u201d The average voter is never going to buy the lame excuse he sold his supporters on that assertion.\n\nAnd if he tries to change the subject to her email scandal, and the related FBI investigation, she\u2019ll pivot to Trump University. To the general electorate, with which Trump is already extremely unpopular, his habit of bilking ordinary Americans out of their life savings will look far worse than Hillary\u2019s sloppy email security. If he is stupid enough raise Bill Clinton\u2019s various indiscretions, she will point out that he routinely brags about similar behavior on his own part. If he accuses her of being a big-government liberal, she\u2019ll merely thank him for his donations to her campaigns.\n\nAll of which comes down to this: Trump\u2019s health care plan is the perfect metaphor for his presidential campaign. It is an incoherent collection of random effusions from an intellectually lazy man who surrounds himself with sycophants, insults the intelligence of the voters, and has no chance of accomplishing its ostensible goal. It is yet another reason to support a serious GOP candidate.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "All of which comes down to this: Trump\u2019s health care plan is the perfect metaphor for his presidential campaign.\nTrump\u2019s \u201cplan\u201d consists of seven random nostrums that appear to have been hastily cribbed from conservative and libertarian websites by his various flunkies.\nShe will point out that the first item of his health care plan contains the following verbiage: \u201cOur elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate.\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s incoherent health care proposal will be one of the main weapons she would use to cut him to pieces.\nThis one good idea wasn\u2019t enough, however, to stave off the well-deserved scorn to which Trump\u2019s plan has been subjected by countless health care experts."}
