Marco Rubio has said he supports expanding tax credits for insurance coverage, creating high-risk pools to cover people with pre-existing conditions, and reforming Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nDr. Ben Carson has called for increasing tax-free Health Savings Accounts to pay for coverage.\n\nBoth Ohio Gov. John Kasich and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie have staked out a middle ground on Obamacare, saying they oppose the law, but agreeing to its Medicaid expansion in their home states.\n\nJeb Bush has outlined a detailed plan that jettisons the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have insurance, new rules requiring large employers to provide health benefits, and new insurance benefit standards \u2014 replacing them with tax credits for people to buy insurance and block grant-like Medicaid grants.\n\nIn most respects, Donald Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders represent polar opposites in the race for the White House. But on one issue \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 they have surprisingly similar takes on how to fix the 2010 healthcare reform law.Both say Obamacare is a failure \u2014 albeit for different reasons \u2014 and have suggested a better option would be to involve the federal government more directly in negotiating costs and services with doctors, hospitals, and providers \u2014 a hallmark of nationalized healthcare systems.By contrast, Ted Cruz, who edged out Trump in this week\u2019s Iowa causes, has said he will repeal \u201cevery word of Obamacare\u201d if elected president, but hasn\u2019t provided details on what he would propose to replace it. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, who narrowly bested Sanders in Iowa, largely backs the Affordable Care Act, with a few minor tweaks.But both Trump and Sanders have staked out clear positions on reforming Obamacare that call for greater federal government involvement in Americans\u2019 healthcare.Sanders has championed the idea of a single-payer system that essentially expands Medicare \u2014 which now covers seniors and disabled Americans \u2014 to everyone. Such a plan is not quite socialized medicine as practiced in Canada and Europe, where citizens\u2019 taxes pay for healthcare provided by doctors, hospitals, and clinics through government contracts. But Sanders\u2019 $1.8 trillion Medicare-for-all plan would give the government a stronger hand in setting standards, regulating, and running the healthcare system.Sanders acknowledges his plan requires new taxes, but would save Americans thousands of dollars a year in healthcare premiums and costs.Trump has opposed Sanders\u2019 proposal, but has said he favors a plan that is more similar to a single-payer program than the proposals espoused by Clinton, Cruz, or any of the other GOP presidential contenders.On ABC\u2019s This Week last Sunday, Trump said he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a system that covers the 33 million uninsured Americans through a new public-private healthcare system.\u201cWe\u2019re going to work with our hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with our doctors. We\u2019ve got to do something.\u201dTrump stressed that the system he envisions \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean single payer.\u201d But he acknowledged the notion might cost him votes among Republican voters who oppose any form of federal mandate on healthcare.\u201cAnd if this means I lose an election, that\u2019s fine, because, frankly, we have to take care of the people in our country. We can\u2019t let them die on the sidewalks of New York or the sidewalks of Iowa or anywhere else,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf somebody has no money and they\u2019re lying in the middle of the street and they\u2019re dying, I\u2019m going to take care of that person.\u201dOn CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes last September, Trump called Obamacare \u201ca disaster\u201d \u2014 citing rising insurance premiums and deductibles \u2014 and said he\u2019d replace it with a government-funded plan that covers all Americans.\u201cEverybody\u2019s got to be covered,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an un-Republican thing for me to say\u2026. I am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not\u2026.\u201cThe government\u2019s going to pay for it. But we\u2019re going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it\u2019s going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.\u201dIf Trump\u2019s plan will fly with conservative or moderate voters remains to be seen. But the latest polls suggest many Americans \u2014 while bitterly divided as a whole over Obamacare\u2019s costs and benefits \u2014 support the idea of covering all Americans, regardless of age or health status.A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that 58 percent back a health plan in which all Americans are able to obtain their insurance through some means \u2014 including an expanded form of Medicare.The downside, of course, is universal insurance coverage would require trillions of dollars in new spending and taxes.This is the chief reason that Cruz and other GOP contenders have stressed their intention to repeal Obamacare:For Cruz, who scored a big victory in Iowa, the focus has remained largely on simply repealing Obamacare; he has not provided many details on what \u2014 if anything \u2014 he would propose to replace the law.In recent weeks, he has upped his attacks on Obamacare and attempted to lump his three of his biggest challengers together, by suggesting they share a similar position on healthcare reform.\u201cDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have the identical position on healthcare,\u201d Cruz said during an appearance last weekend on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, \u201cwhich is they want to put the government in charge of you and your doctors.\u201dWhile that may be a bit of an exaggeration, at least as far as Trump is concerned, some political observers see at least some irony in the way the healthcare debate has developed \u2014 especially the positions taken by Trump and Clinton.Should the two become their parties\u2019 nominees, it would mean Democrats will have rejected for the candidate pushing for a single-payer healthcare system (long supported by liberal activists) while Republicans will have embraced the candidate who has suggested he likes the idea.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "donald, trump, bernie, sanders, ted, cruz, hillary, clinton, obamacare, rubio, christie, kasich, obamacare, healthcare", "pubdate": "2016-02-03T14:49:54", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Donald Trump and Sen.
