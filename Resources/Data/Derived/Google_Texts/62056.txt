The agency responsible for those five Newton runaways is offering more information Friday about how they escaped from its facility. This as police continue to search for the teen girls considered endangered.

Late Wednesday night, law enforcement say Ke'Aira Baker, Jasmine Bell, Adriana Doolin, Stephanie Grounds and Sidney Rhoten-Young ran away from Youthville's Secure Care facility in Newton.

"We're very concerned about the girls. Certainly we never want that kind of thing to happen," said Shelley Duncan, the president and CEO of Ember Hope, a private child welfare organization that oversees Youthville.

She says at this particular group home, staff provide 24/7 care for 10 to 18-year-old girls in the foster care system who have chronic runaway behaviors.

"It is a locked facility," Duncan said. "So we have high fences and all of the doors are locked. And so the staff were not being negligent. There was absolutely no lack of oversight on their part. We typically exceed all of the staffing ratios at all of our facilities. So we were absolutely in compliance with that."

Instead, Duncan says the teens methodically planned their escape, accessing key fobs through "physical means" from the staff who typically carry them.

"We do have cameras that are recording at all times. So we always go back and review what happened," Duncan said. "We'll go back and try to assess what we could have done differently so that we can be prepared in the event this should happen again."

While Youthville has been around since the 1920s, this particular program for at-risk girls began three years ago. Duncan says this is the third time girls have runaway from the Secure Care facility.
