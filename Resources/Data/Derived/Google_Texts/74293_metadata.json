Under the president\u2019s proposal, companies could skip notifying customers whose information has been breached if they conclude that \u201cthere is no reasonable risk of harm or fraud to such individual.\u201d This clause, which experts say could be abused by companies, isn\u2019t present in California law.\n\nSecurity experts like Jonathan Mayer \u2014 a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at Stanford University whose research focuses on technology policy \u2014 are frustrated by the regressive nature of proposed policy changes and aren\u2019t holding out hope for Obama to make any surprise announcements at the summit. \u201cIn an ideal world [Obama would] say we\u2019re not going to preempt good state data breach notification law and we\u2019re not going to immunize private businesses when they share data with the government,\u201d Mayer said in a phone interview. \u201cBut unfortunately that\u2019s probably not what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dObama is expected to discuss tighter data-handling standards and to unveil the administration\u2019s plan to expand efforts to facilitate cybersecurity information sharing between the private sector and Department of Homeland Security. According to The White House website, topics of discussion at the summit will also include finding more secure payment methods, cybersecurity information sharing, international law enforcement cooperation on cybersecurity and new ideas on technical security.Following the recent spurt of high-profile hacks, dealing with cybercrime has become a priority for the Obama administration. In his State of the Union address, Obama called for a more uniform federal cybersecurity law.But security experts are concerned that the implementation of a uniform federal standard may hinder the fight to prevent breaches, by creating less of an information flow, especially in California, which has one of the strongest breach laws in the country.\u201cPresident Obama [has] outlined a proposal that would require companies to inform their customers of a data breach within 30 days of discovering their information has been hacked,\u201d investigative reporter Brian Krebs wrote on his website, KrebsonSecurity.com. \u201cBut depending on what is put in and left out of any implementing legislation, the effort could well lead to more voluminous but less useful disclosure.\u201dAs of 2012, companies and government agencies subject to California law have been required to submit copies of their data breach notices to the Attorney General if the breach involves more than 500 Californians. In one year alone, more than 130 data breaches were reported, and that number of overall breaches has continued to increase.\n\nThe data reported to the Attorney General\u2019s office includes reports from 2011 because some companies were hacked in 2011 but reported it to the state in 2012 when they realized it. It also shows that while malware breaches are still increasing, data breaches due to negligence (thefts or errors) and other types of breaches all declined in 2014.\n\nStill, of the data breaches reported under California law from 2011 through 2014, nearly half were due to either \u201cphysical theft or loss,\u201d defined by the California Attorney General\u2019s Office as \u201cunencrypted data stored on laptop, thumb drive or other device removed from owner\u2019s control\u201d or \u201cerrors,\u201d defined as \u201canything unintentionally done or left undone that exposes data to unauthorized individuals.\u201dThis calls attention to one of the greatest concerns in cybersecurity policy, that most organizations rely on automated systems, such as office computers, which are increasingly vulnerable for surprisingly simple reasons; they have a default password or do not have the basic protections enabled to prevent them from being accessed via the Internet.For example, Cedars-Sinai Health System, a hospital in Los Angeles, reported in 2014 that an employee took a Cedars-Sinai issued laptop home and had it stolen. The laptop contained certain patient information, but the hospital was unable to confirm exactly what information was on the laptop.Organizations responsible for some of our most sensitive information \u2014 such as financial organizations, hospitals and healthcare facilities, and government organizations \u2014 have seen the largest number of breaches, based on the data reported to the State Attorney General.A large number of breaches could be prevented by simple due diligence, such as regular security audits or basic training for employees, Mayer said.\u201cCompanies are tripping over themselves to collect oodles of potentially very sensitive such data from consumers, and yet we still have no basic principles that say what companies can do with that information, how much they can collect, how they can collect it or share it, or how they will protect that information,\u201d Krebs wrote on his website. \u201cOverall, we\u2019re really lacking any sort of basic protections for that information, and consumers are giving it away every day without fully realizing there are basically zero federal standards for what can or should be done,\u201d he added.Homepage image courtesy of Twechie on Flickr via Creative Commons", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Some experts worry that California law requiring reports on breaches will be weakened by President Obama's push for a national standard.", "title": "Obama\u2019s federal cybersecurity law could create less information - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/CircuitBoard_Flickr.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-02T16:20:09+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2015/02/12/obama-federal-cybersecurity-law/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "Stanford University", "published_time": "2015-02-12T23:41:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T16:20:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some experts worry that California law requiring reports on breaches will be weakened by President Obama's push for a national standard.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/CircuitBoard_Flickr.jpg", "title": "Obama\u2019s federal cybersecurity law could create less information - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Companies around the nation are already following state laws that are far stronger than a new federal law that Obama is proposing.\nIn one year alone, more than 130 data breaches were reported, and that number of overall breaches has continued to increase.\nOver the last four years nearly 500 companies have reported data breaches under California\u2019s data breach notification law \u2014 each one affecting a minimum of 500 people and some affecting thousands.\nIt also shows that while malware breaches are still increasing, data breaches due to negligence (thefts or errors) and other types of breaches all declined in 2014.\n\u201cBut unfortunately that\u2019s probably not what\u2019s going to happen.\u201dObama is expected to discuss tighter data-handling standards and to unveil the administration\u2019s plan to expand efforts to facilitate cybersecurity information sharing between the private sector and Department of Homeland Security."}
