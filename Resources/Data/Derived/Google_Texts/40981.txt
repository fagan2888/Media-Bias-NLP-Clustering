Sen. Tom Udall, a New Mexico Democrat who voted against a military strike on Syria in last week’s Foreign Relations Committee hearing, said he doesn’t believe the United States has exhausted political alternatives.

“I’m very disappointed that the administration has given up on the United Nations and on rallying the world,” Mr. Udall said Sunday morning on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “We’re moving much too rapidly down the war path and not trying to find a political solution through the international community.”

Mr. Udall said that even limited missile strikes would be an act of war and that nothing he’s heard in recent days has changed his mind that military action is not the best way forward.

“We all know, first of all, that what he did, Bashar Assad, was a heinous act, it’s despicable, and my heart is broken when I see that video,” he said. “The big question for the Congress right now is what is the most effective way to move forward? I think the American people don’t want to be embroiled in a Middle Eastern civil war.”
