Six of the city of Kettering’s 11 highest-paid employees in 2015 were firefighters who received $197,204 in combined overtime last year, according to an I-Team analysis of city payroll data.

They were among the 105 city employees whose gross wages exceeded $100,000 last year, an increase from 69 in 2014. Much larger Dayton, by comparison, paid 68 employees six figures last year.

An I-Team investigation found the number of employees at 19 area cities, townships and counties making more than $100,000 increased last year, often because of overtime for police officers and firefighters. Read the full investigation here.

“We did have an increase for firefighters in overtime last year,” said city manager Mark Schwieterman in an interview this week.

Schwieterman said the main factor fueling exploding growth in overtime pay for firefighters was staffing changes made to cope with the Affordable Care Act.

Schwieterman said the city got rid of volunteer firefighters in 2015 and had to cut hours to part-time firefighters to comply with federal healthcare mandates that employees on the clock for more than 28 hours a week — even if they’re on standby pay — be provided health insurance.

This means the full-time firefighters had to work more overtime to maintain fire protection.

Of the 105 city employees who made more than $100,000 last year, 34 were in the fire department.

“Unlike a position in an administrative office where you cover with other staff with no overtime, in fire if we have to fill a position, then we have to fill a position and have three people on the truck to meet those minimum standards,” he said.

There were 43 Kettering police department employees among those making more than $100,000 last year, though they didn’t get as much overtime as their fire department counterparts.
