A headline on the front page of The Gazette in Colorado Springs on Saturday warned, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about a trip to Denver.\u201d\n\nHowever, those traveling through the heart of the city Sunday met mostly open roads with little traffic as it appeared motorists heeded CDOT\u2019s warnings about the closure, avoiding the interstate all weekend.\n\nCrews closed the Interstate for two extended periods this weekend, from 10 p.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday and from 10 p.m. Saturday to 5 a.m. Monday.\n\nAbout 100 CDOT and contract workers are demolishing the north half of the U.S. 6 bridge over I-25; repaving both directions of I-25 between Santa Fe Drive and U.S. 6; relocating three storm sewer lines across southbound I-25, and doing other work.\n\nThe new through-lane is part of CDOT\u2019s $4 million \u201cGap Project,\u201d which is designed to lessen congestion on northbound I-25 between Santa Fe and U.S. 6.\n\nThe lanes currently go from four to three and carry 10,000 to 12,000 vehicles an hour in each direction during peak travel periods.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Drivers heed CDOT warnings and keep delays to a minimum on I-25", "title": "Drivers heed CDOT warnings and keep delays to a minimum on I-25", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/10/drivers-heed-cdot-warnings-and-keep-delays-to-a-minimum-on-i-25/", "image": {"width": 423, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140810__trafficp1.jpg", "height": 295}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140810__trafficp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-10T13:06:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:40:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfc3\"", "article_summary": "The new through-lane is part of CDOT\u2019s $4 million \u201cGap Project,\u201d which is designed to lessen congestion on northbound I-25 between Santa Fe and U.S. 6.\nTraffic on Interstate 25 through Denver on Sunday moved smoothly despite a closure where Colorado Department of Transportation workers were building a fourth lane.\nDespite the warnings, worries and roadwork, the delays and headaches never really came.\nElectronic road signs throughout the Front Range warned motorists of the closure, telling them to expect heavy delays.\nAbout 100 CDOT and contract workers are demolishing the north half of the U.S. 6 bridge over I-25; repaving both directions of I-25 between Santa Fe Drive and U.S. 6; relocating three storm sewer lines across southbound I-25, and doing other work."}
