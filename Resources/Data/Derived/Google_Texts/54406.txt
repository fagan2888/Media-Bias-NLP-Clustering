In her dissent of the Supreme Court’s decision today to dismiss a case concerning the death of Israel Leija, Jr., Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized her colleagues for sanctioning a “shoot first, think later approach to policing.”

Leija was shot to death in 2010 during a high-speed police chase on I-27 in Texas. According to NBC News, the chase began after a local officer tried to arrest Leija on an outstanding warrant at a fast food restaurant. During the 18-minute-long chase, Leija twice called police dispatch to warn he was armed and willing to shoot if the chase wasn’t called off.

Police laid spike strips at three spots along the highway in an attempt to disable Leija’s car. Despite orders from a superior to stand by until Leija reached the spike strips, State Trooper Chadrin Mullenix fired 6 shots from an overpass at the speeding car. At least 4 of these shots fatally hit Leija; none hit the car’s engine block.

“[I]t was clearly established under the Fourth Amendment,” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, “that an officer in Mullenix’s position should not have fired the shots.”
