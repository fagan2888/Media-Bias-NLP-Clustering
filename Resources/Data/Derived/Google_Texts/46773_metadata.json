The law, which took effect immediately, makes it illegal to post identifiable nude photos of another person online without their consent and with \u201cthe intent to cause substantial emotional distress or humiliation.\u201d Offenders can be sentenced to up to one year in jail and levied with a $1,000 fine.\n\nLegislators in New York are now looking to follow suit with an even more expansive law. Some activists are pushing for the federal government to create sweeping legislation (which, if state laws stand, may be inevitable anyway given that Internet traffic crosses state lines.)\n\nWhile those advocating for revenge porn laws are trying to rectify a serious social problem that has led to several high-profile cases of young girls committing suicide, the laws unfortunately pose risks of their own.\n\nAs with all laws criminalizing speech, revenge porn laws may violate the First Amendment. Back in June, the Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized California\u2019s bill, saying, \u201cIt also criminalizes victimless instances. And that\u2019s a problem with the First Amendment.\u201d The ACLU initially voiced concern that the law could be used to censor photos with political implications or containing evidence of a crime.\n\nLikewise, Jeff Hermes, Director of the Digital Media Law Project at Harvard, contends that the law is problematic because it doesn\u2019t make exemptions for newsworthy stories. For instance, politicians like former New York Congressman Anthony Weiner (who claimed that someone else maliciously released those famous pics ) could use it to protect themselves from appearing in a compromising situation.\n\nEven beyond the laws' specifics is the fact that \u2013 regardless of how it\u2019s worded \u2013 the law criminalizes images, which cannot be inherently harmful. Society\u2019s reaction to nude photos is what causes victims\u2019 emotional and professional suffering. And since each generation becomes increasingly comfortable with nudity and sexuality, revenge porn laws may soon be another outdated and impossible-to-remove statute on the books.\n\nRevenge porn laws also run the risks characteristic of most criminal statutes: they are inflexible, they could create victims where there are none, they are susceptible to discriminatory police enforcement, and they add more inmates to a country with the highest per capita prison population in the world.\n\nThis is in contrast to civil lawsuits, in which the amount of compensation awarded to plaintiffs is determined on a case-by-case basis, defendants are only brought to trial when victims feel seriously harmed, police have less room to discriminate, and offenders pay out-of-pocket rather than in a jail cell. In fact, numerous victims of revenge porn have successfully sued their exes in civil court.\n\nMost importantly, we can resolve the fundamental problems underlying revenge porn through cultural change that doesn\u2019t involve the risks associated with legal bans. We inadequately shame those who share images of others\u2019 nudity without their consent. We need to be sure to ostracize everyone who even considers posting revenge porn.\n\nPhoto by Texas Wedding Photographer, Matthew T Rader.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "In an attempt to take down the threat of creepy, vengeful exes, California Governor&nbsp;Jerry Brown signed a bill that bans&nbsp;revenge porn&nbsp;into", "title": "Should Government Ban Revenge Porn?", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/10/09/should-government-ban-revenge-porn", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13813287208097.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13813287208097.jpg", "description": "In an attempt to take down the threat of creepy,\nvengeful exes, California Governor&nbsp;Jerry Brown signed a bill\nthat bans&nbsp;revenge\nporn&nbsp;into law&nbsp;on October 1.
