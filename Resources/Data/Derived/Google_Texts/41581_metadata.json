Other bills seek to establish a state agency to help newly arrived immigrants, protect immigrants from unscrupulous employers and extend legal protections to avoid detention and deportation, according to a written summary of the legislation.\n\nDemocrats who control the governor's office and both chambers of the Legislature have said they want to find ways for immigrants to come out of the state's economic shadows. The 10 bills were previously introduced, but they were touted Tuesday by supporters for advancing immigrants' rights.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Bob Huff, R-Diamond Bar, questioned the costs.\n\n\"We understand the burdens facing immigrants who want to go to work and raise their families in safe neighborhoods, and the rationale behind these bills is admirable,\" Huff said. \"But without money from Congress and President Obama, it will be very difficult and costly for California taxpayers to fund all of these bill proposals.\"\n\nCalifornia this year began issuing driver's licenses to immigrants who are in the country illegally, and the Department of Motor Vehicles has already received a half-million applications. California is also one of several states to adopt the Dream Act, which permits college financial aid for top students seeking citizenship.\n\nSen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, is reintroducing SB4, a proposal to open California's Medicaid program to immigrants, as well as extending subsidized health benefits in a new insurance marketplace for those without legal status.\n\nThe proposal, which previously carried a cost as high as $1.3 billion a year, stalled in a legislative committee last cycle without any way to pay for it. Republicans had also criticized the cost of the expansion.\n\nLara said he is trying to reduce costs by seeking a federal waiver so immigrants can purchase private health insurance through the state-run exchange known as Covered California. Under the Affordable Care Act, immigrants in the country illegally are not eligible for assistance.\n\nUnder SB674 by de Leon and Atkins, immigrant victims of crime will have the opportunity to apply for the federal Victim of Crime Visa, known as a U-Visa. De Leon said the bill mandates local law enforcement to certify immigrants who are victims of human trafficking, rape and sexual assault rather than \"subjectively start making immigration policy themselves.\"\n\nAB900 by Assemblyman Marc Levine, D-San Rafael, seeks to align state law with federal immigration rules to maximize the number of immigrant children seeking legal status in response to an unprecedented surge at the border.\n\nJust as gay-rights advocates recently won legislative victories in Indiana and Arkansas to expand legal protections for gays and lesbians, Sacramento Sen. Richard Pan's SB600 would expand civil rights protections to California immigrants.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown last month defended President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration. The Obama administration is trying to spare from deportation millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally. California is one of 14 states plus the District of Columbia that has filed a brief in support of lifting an injunction intended to stall Obama's actions.\n\nIf the injunction is lifted, Obama's executive order will enable hundreds of thousands of low-income immigrants in California to apply for Medi-Cal.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "Democrats who control the governor's office and both chambers of the Legislature have said they want to find ways for immigrants to come out of the state's economic shadows.", "title": "Democrats push to extend health, legal rights to immigrants", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/04/07/50847/democrats-push-to-extend-health-legal-rights-to-im/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/9da22d36035c11b14c1eb86ffe3b9fec/103053-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 689}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
