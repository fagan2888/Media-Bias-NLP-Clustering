We\u2019ve had problems here in Washington, we have problems in New York\u2014potholes exploding, all kinds of issues.\u201d\n\nThe United States needs to invest more in \u201cthe human infrastructure,\u201d too, she said, and that\u2019s where she brought up de Blasio.\n\n\u201cWe need to do more to fit the human needs with both the potential that people have, starting early with pre-K,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m very much a supporter of what Mayor de Blasio did in New York, trying to create pre-K access for every young child in New York, regardless of who that child is and who its parents are.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we also have to do more on affordable housing and more of the amenities, so that families, middle-class families, working families can actually stay in cities and have a place to go,\u201d she continued.\n\nHer final point was about social mobility, or the lack thereof.\n\nCiting the work of Raj Chetty, the Bloomberg professor of economics at Harvard University, she talked about the how some cities have much more social mobility than others.\n\n\"Two cities with similar affluence, Seattle and Atlanta, have markedly different rates of economic mobility,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about race. White and black citizens of a city like Atlanta both have low upward mobility.\u201d\n\nRather, she said, it\u2019s about \u201cwhere the fabric of community is strong,\u201d where there\u2019s a \u201cvibrant middle class,\u201d where there\u2019s cross-class integration, good schools, unions, religious and civic organizations, and a sense of community.\n\n\u201cSo we need to think hard about what we\u2019re going to do now that people are moving back into and staying in cities to make sure that our cities are not just places of economic prosperity and job creation on average, but do it in a way that lifts everybody up to deal with the overriding issues of inequality and lack of mobility,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton will deliver another speech Monday evening at a celebration for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting.\n\nIt may well be her last public appearance before an announcement declaring her entry into the presidential race, which is expected to come early next month.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/03/8564598/clinton-city-growth-pre-k-and-potholes-exploding", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20HillaryClinton_45.png", "type": "article", "title": "Clinton on city growth, pre-K and 'potholes exploding'"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "'So we have to do, what I would hope to see, is kind of a mapping of our cities'"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca52f\"", "article_summary": "Evoking the rhetoric of New York City mayor and former Clinton senatorial campaign staffer Bill de Blasio, the former senator from New York on Monday bemoaned the reality of \u201cinequality\u201d in urban America.\n\u201cI not only represented New York City, I represented Buffalo and Rochester and Syracuse and Albany and Binghamton and a lot of other places that had very different challenges,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSo we have to do, what I would hope to see, is kind of a mapping of our cities,\u201d said Clinton.\n\u201cWe need to do more to fit the human needs with both the potential that people have, starting early with pre-K,\u201d said Clinton.\nClinton will deliver another speech Monday evening at a celebration for the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting."}
