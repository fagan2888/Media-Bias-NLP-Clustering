It\u2019s the perfect place to be when you\u2019re a kid. The problem is, adults on the left seem to have decided they deserve to live in that same magical world, where facts and logic and reason just don\u2019t exist.\n\nLast week I appeared on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d the Fox News Channel powerhouse morning program, to discuss an elementary school in Maine reading a book about a \u201ctransgendered child\u201d to its students in all classes, including kindergarten. Parents were not informed beforehand, and many were furious. I appeared with a psychologist, not to discuss transgenderism, but whether presenting this sort of information to small children, who are without the capacity for conceptual thinking, was appropriate.\n\nThe psychologist and I agreed: This sort of information has no business being taught to small children in the school system, and certainly not without the express approval of their parents.\n\nI expect people to disagree with me on certain issues, including about how adults handle issues of sex and identity, but dignity demands that we leave the 5-year-olds out of it.\n\nDuring the \u201cFox and Friends\u201d segment, host Elisabeth Hasselbeck asked, \u201cAre kids ready to be talking about any relationship in terms of sexuality or gender at the age of five?\u201d The psychologist was adamantly against it on the grounds of the psychological conceptual limitations of children.\n\nIn light of that, I referred to my own childhood to highlight the magical thinking of children:\n\n\u201cThis is really about our projection of our issues as adults onto children, and we have to consider that. Look, when I was a child, I thought I was a cocker spaniel, and there\u2019s a point where we have these fantasies, we think we are Superman, we can fly, we\u2019re the cat. This is childhood \u2026 .\u201d\n\nReverting to their own magical thinking, various gay-establishment bloggers and activists, likely adorned in their \u201cNOH8\u201d gear, apparently appalled at my argument that kids are, well, kids, posted desperate stories with headlines like \u201cTammy Bruce compares transgendered people to dogs!\u201d and \u201cFox News pundit compares being transgender to thinking that you\u2019re a cocker spaniel.\u201d\n\nUh, no. But welcome to the adult world of magical thinking. I was referring to children and how they think. Yet, for the malignant narcissists on the left, everything has to be about them. It\u2019s also a headline that shamelessly misleads their own base into acting like fools.\n\nNever able to address issues like adults, the immediate effort was to absurdly misrepresent what I said, including omitting that we were discussing children, trusting that their gang of NOH8 bullies wouldn\u2019t even bother to watch the actual segment.\n\nIt was easier, and perhaps more dramatic, to condemn a gay woman for something she never said because she committed the crime of challenging an establishment narrative.\n\nI have a tiny feeling none of the liberal and gay and lesbian activists grasped the irony of what they were doing.\n\nThe magical thinking problem on the left isn\u2019t confined to the activist base. We\u2019re seeing the fact of this with the surprising chaos within the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.\n\nOnly magical thinking could compel someone to create her own email server and think it wouldn\u2019t matter to the American people. Only fantasy and disconnection from the real world would make the Clintons believe that questionable financial transactions with foreign governments, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars, wouldn\u2019t be scrutinized and generate questions of bribery and quid-pro-quo activity.\n\nOnly magical thinking would make you believe that the American people would accept lies about a terrorist attack which resulted in the deaths of an American ambassador and three other heroes.\n\nThe human condition itself reminds us all the time that it is, per se, fragile. Our problem is those who are behaving the most like children, relying exclusively on feelings, emotions and fantasy, are in positions of power and influence.\n\nWhile this behavior does not bode well for the Democratic Party or left-wing special-interest groups, conservatives shouldn\u2019t necessarily celebrate. The strength of our system relies on competition and challenge. If half of our political and social structure is melting down because of disconnected magical thinking, our entire system will be the worse off.\n\nLiberals who still understand the value of logic, reason and critical thinking need to step up to save not just their political apparatus, but they must begin to challenge the so-called leadership of their various special constituencies. Without intervention, they will make a mockery of the important social gains of gays and lesbians, all in the name of punishing those who don\u2019t conform and dare to challenge any of their carefully constructed narratives.\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce is a radio talk show host, author and Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We all know that children think magically, and naturally inhabit a world of fantasy and imagination.
