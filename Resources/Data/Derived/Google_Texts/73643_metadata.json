(0700.HK) said Wednesday that its net profit for the first quarter rose 7% from a year earlier, helped by growth in revenue from mobile games and advertising.\n\nStill, the rate of earnings growth marked a significant slowdown compared with the fourth quarter, when net profit jumped 50% year-over-year.\n\nTencent, whose main services are online games and social networks, said its net profit increased to 6.88 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) from 6.46 billion yuan a year earlier. Revenue rose 22% to 22.4 billion from 18.4 billion yuan a year earlier.\n\nOperating profit for the quarter rose 20% to 9.37 billion yuan from 7.79 billion yuan a year earlier.\n\nThe quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations for a profit of 6.45 billion yuan, based on a survey by S&P Capital IQ.\n\nTencent, a dominant player in online games played on personal computers, has been expanding its mobile presence through games it distributes via its popular smartphone messaging apps. Tencent's WeChat messaging app had 549 million monthly active users in March, the company said. Revenue from smartphone games rose 82% from a year earlier to about 4.4 billion yuan in the first quarter, Tencent said.\n\nWhile the business segment consisting mainly of games accounted for 83% of Tencent's revenue in the quarter, analysts and investors are closely watching the company's advertising revenue. They hope this will become another major source of growth in the coming years as Tencent turns WeChat into an advertising platform.\n\nIn the first quarter, Tencent's online advertising revenue more than doubled from a year earlier to 2.72 billion yuan.\n\nWrite to Juro Osawa at juro.osawa@wsj.com\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Tencent Holdings Ltd.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=KYG875721634\n\nAccess Investor Kit for Tencent Holdings Ltd.\n\nVisit http://www.companyspotlight.com/partner?cp_code=P479&isin=US88032Q1094\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "MarketWatch", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tencent-profit-up-7-on-games-ad-sales-growth-2015-05-13", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "Tencent profit up 7% on games, ad sales growth"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "creator": "@MarketWatch", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "Tencent profit up 7% on games, ad sales growth", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-05-13T05:47:00-04:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "MarketWatch", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/tencent-profit-up-7-on-games-ad-sales-growth-2015-05-13", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "A614962F-8D07-490D-BA5E-2016BA8924C6"}, "article_summary": "Operating profit for the quarter rose 20% to 9.37 billion yuan from 7.79 billion yuan a year earlier.\nTencent, whose main services are online games and social networks, said its net profit increased to 6.88 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) from 6.46 billion yuan a year earlier.\nRevenue from smartphone games rose 82% from a year earlier to about 4.4 billion yuan in the first quarter, Tencent said.\nThe quarterly earnings beat analysts' expectations for a profit of 6.45 billion yuan, based on a survey by S&P Capital IQ.\nChinese Internet major Tencent Holdings Ltd.
