This weekend is, perhaps, an ode to the end of Spring, and a running start into the Summer.

As we move from Spring to Summer, take some time to enjoy the weekend, and be a guest at one of several great pow wows that are going on June 6-8.

The Alabama-Coushatta Tribe’s 46th Annual pow wow which is deep in the heart of Livingston, Texas, opens on June 6 at 9:00a.m. This year’s pow wow highlights a Men's Fancy Dance Special in honor of Shaundai Poncho's Graduation hosted by Poncho and Obe Families, and a Men's Grass Dance Special, hosted by the Wildcat Society.

More than 1,500 miles from Livingston, Texas, is the Redhawk Native American Arts Council pow wow in Brooklyn, New York, starting on June 6 as well. A different vibe, a different city, but a fun group of people are expected to fill the streets of BK. The grand entry begins at 1pm on June 7. All are welcome, but remember to bring your own lawn chair.
