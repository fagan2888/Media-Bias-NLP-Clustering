First, a whole bunch of Republicans decided to applaud the Republican National Committee for the \u201csuccess\u201d of its so-called Growth and Opportunity Project. This was the GOP\u2019s election postmortem, which contained a fair amount of real talk that party leaders briefly attempted to heed, then ignored altogether.\n\nThe autopsy called for Republicans to embrace immigration reform; House Republicans have sidelined immigration reform, but advanced legislation to force the Obama administration to deport DREAMers. It called for Republicans to broaden their appeal to minorities, women and LGBT people; House Republicans are sitting on legislation that would protect minority voting rights, raise the minimum wage, and give LGBT people recourse against discriminatory employers.\n\nNewt Gingrich examined this factual record and declared the Growth and Opportunity Project \u201can historic success.\u201d\n\nTomorrow is the first anniversary of the 'autopsy' of the GOP called the Growth and Opportunity Project. It has been an historic success. \u2014 Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) March 17, 2014\n\nSo that was one thing. Taken alone, it wouldn\u2019t be worth mentioning, except maybe for the opportunity to be condescending and self-righteous, which can be very fun. But it happened to coincide with a series of Republican #rebrand face plants that reflect an incoherence between the party\u2019s near- and medium-term goals. The big, elusive goal for the party is to win the presidency again. Become a national party with a more diverse coalition. In absence of an unexpected Democratic meltdown or exogenous economic or geopolitical event, it will require Republicans to make more than merely superficial changes \u2014 and even those have eluded them. They\u2019ll have to move convincingly into a policy niche that Democrats currently occupy, much like the Growth and Opportunity Project advised.\n\nBut that\u2019s way off on the hazy horizon. Right now, the big goal is taking control of the Senate. And their plan for accomplishing that \u2014 don\u2019t let President Obama post any victories, don\u2019t let anything distract from Obamacare, reduce Democratic turnout \u2014 is not compatible with the presidential election strategy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans may win back the Senate.
