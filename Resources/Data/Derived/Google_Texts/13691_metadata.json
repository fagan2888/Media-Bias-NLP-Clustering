Some, in fact, might save money thanks to the generous tax credits the law provides for lower-income families.\n\nIn effect, Walmart is using government anti-poverty programs to subsidize its stinginess and boost its bottom line. And it\u2019s hardly alone.\n\nA study by the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Labor Center found that 52% of the families of fast-food workers are receiving some form of public benefit \u2014 ranging from food stamps to Medicaid. The estimated price tag: $7 billion.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s formerly offered a \u201cMcResource\u201d service that, among other things, helped employees apply for food stamps.\n\nAn analysis by Florida Rep. Alan Grayson found that, in many states, the largest group of Medicaid recipients are Walmart employees \u2014 who draw public benefits averaging $1,000 per worker.\n\nThese numbers prompted Bloomberg View columnist Barry Ritholtz to dub Walmart and McDonald\u2019s \u201cthe two biggest welfare queens in America today.\u201d\n\nWhat enables this behavior are minimum wages that bear zero relation to what it costs to live in the 21st century.\n\nNew York\u2019s current rate of $8 an hour \u2014 even if earned full time, year-round \u2014 equates to less than the poverty level for a family of three. The federal minimum of $7.25 is that much worse.\n\nIt would be one thing if such rates were paid primarily to teenagers in summer jobs. But in today\u2019s economy, more and more adults are trying to support families with jobs in retail, fast food and other fields where keeping compensation as a low as possible has become a business model.\n\nThat being the sad reality, government must treat the minimum wage for what it really is \u2014 the income millions of Americans depend upon to live.\n\nLifting the floor to $10.10 an hour, as President Obama proposes, would be a start toward lifting those Americans out of poverty \u2014 and easing corporate America off the dole.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "Walmart\u2019s steely-cold decision to cut off health benefits for 30,000 part-time employees puts the megaretailer on the cutting edge of an ugly phenomenon in the American economy:\r\n            \r\n         \r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\n         \r\n            \r\n               Major corporations are driving so hard to cut costs for competitive advantage that they\u2019re offering bottom-of-the-barrel pay and benefits \u2014 then relying on taxpayers to pick up the slack.", "title": "Editorial: Rich and on the dole", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-rich-dole-article-1.1973488", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1973487.1413292419!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/earns-wal-mart-stores.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-14T13:18:47", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-rich-dole-article-1.1973488", "parsely-title": "Editorial: Rich and on the dole", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-14T09:18:47-0400", "sailthru.title": "Editorial: Rich and on the dole", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1973487.1413292419!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/earns-wal-mart-stores.jpg", "description": "Walmart\u2019s steely-cold decision to cut off health benefits for 30,000 part-time employees puts the megaretailer on the cutting edge of an ugly phenomenon in the American economy:\r\n            \r\n         \r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\n         \r\n            \r\n               Major corporations are driving so hard to cut costs for competitive advantage that they\u2019re offering bottom-of-the-barrel pay and benefits \u2014 then relying on taxpayers to pick up the slack.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Walmart\u2019s steely-cold decision to cut off health benefits for 30,000 part-time employees puts the megaretailer on the cutting edge of an ugly phenomenon in the American economy:\r\n            \r\n         \r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\n         \r\n            \r\n               Major corporations are driving so hard to cut costs for competitive advantage that they\u2019re offering bottom-of-the-barrel pay and benefits \u2014 then relying on taxpayers to pick up the slack.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Walmart\u2019s steely-cold decision to cut off health benefits for 30,000 part-time employees puts the megaretailer on the cutting edge of an ugly phenomenon in the American economy:\r\n            \r\n         \r\n      \r\n\r\n      \r\n         \r\n            \r\n               Major corporations are driving so hard to cut costs for competitive advantage that they\u2019re offering bottom-of-the-barrel pay and benefits \u2014 then relying on taxpayers to pick up the slack.", "title": "Editorial: Rich and on the dole", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/editorial-rich-dole-article-1.1973488", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1973487.1413292419!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/earns-wal-mart-stores.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1973487.1413292419!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/earns-wal-mart-stores.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f6e\"", "article_summary": "An analysis by Florida Rep.
