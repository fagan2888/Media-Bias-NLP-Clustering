Martin Luther King Jr. yields plenty of images that would surely unsettle the civil rights leader: shuttered storefronts, open-air drug markets and a glut of pawn shops, quickie check-cashing providers and liquor stores.\n\nThe urban decay along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in St. Louis can be found in other major American cities, from Houston and Milwaukee to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a national problem,\u201d said Melvin White, a 46-year-old postal worker in St. Louis and founder of a 3-year-old nonprofit group that is trying to restore King\u2019s legacy on asphalt. \u201cDr. King would be turning over in his grave.\u201d\n\nNearly three decades into the observance of Monday\u2019s federal holiday, the continuing decline of the most visible symbols of King\u2019s work has White and others calling for a renewed commitment to the more than 900 streets nationwide named in the Atlanta native\u2019s honor. The effort centers in St. Louis, where the small nonprofit is working to reclaim MLK roadways as a source of pride and inspiration, not disappointment over a dream derailed.\n\nWhite\u2019s goals are ambitious, his resources admittedly modest. A neighborhood park is planned across the street from the group\u2019s headquarters. An urban agriculture project to encourage residents to eat healthy and grow their own food has preliminary support from nearby Washington University, one of the country\u2019s wealthiest private colleges. Above all, Beloved Streets of America wants to build community from the ashes of what was once a thriving retail corridor when White was a child.\n\nThe template can be found just a mile away. Delmar Boulevard, which saw a similar decline, is now a vibrant retail corridor packed with restaurants, nightclubs, a renovated movie theater and a boutique hotel. The renaissance earned Delmar recognition in 2007 as one of \u201c10 Great Streets in America\u201d by the American Planning Association.\n\nLocally, the stark racial split of the east-west thoroughfare \u2014 largely white and affluent to the south, mostly poor and black to the north \u2014 is referred to as the \u201cDelmar Divide.\u201d Journalist Jonathan Tilove, who wrote a 2003 book based on visits to 650 King streets nationwide, called the King byways \u201cblack America\u2019s Main Street.\u201d\n\n\u201cMap them and you map a nation within a nation, a place where white America seldom goes and black America can be itself,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is a parallel universe with a different center of gravity and distinctive sensibilities. \u2026 There is no other street like it.\u201d\n\nBut while streets named for King undoubtedly resonate widely in the black community, a University of Tennessee geography professor whose research explores the cultural and political significance of such streets said the compromised condition of streets named for King in St. Louis and other cities deserves broader attention.\n\n\u201cIn some ways we racially profile these streets,\u201d said Derek Alderman, author of a 2007 study that found a smaller disparity among MLK-named streets and other \u201cmain streets\u201d than is popularly portrayed. \u201cWe need to move beyond those images and see what concrete lives and realities are living on those streets.\u201d\n\nMore than 50 years after King led his march on Washington, communities large and small still debate whether to rename local streets in his honor. In Harrisonburg, Va., city leaders recently agreed to rename a street for King over protests by some residents. A similar debate continues in High Point, N.C., where a King street proposal first suggested two decades ago remains up in the air.\n\nOther cities have had more success in balancing the desire to commemorate King without superceding local tradition. Alderman singled out Chapel Hill, N.C., which in 2005 renamed a major thoroughfare that abuts the University of North Carolina campus. Street signs that identify Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard also include the name \u201cHistoric Airport Road.\u201d\n\nIn Miami, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard stretches from the predominantly Cuban town of Hialeah through largely black Liberty City and into Little Haiti \u2014 a reflection of both the city\u2019s diverse demographics as well as its lingering segregation.\n\nAlong MLK Boulevard in Hialeah, where U.S. flags fly alongside Cuban ones, MLK Boulevard isn\u2019t known as the street named after a civil rights leader. Rather, it\u2019s simply referred to by its number: \u201cLa Nueve Street,\u201d or 9th Street.\n\nThe sights and sounds of MLK Boulevard change in Liberty City, where many buildings are shuttered and storefront churches can be found on almost every block. In the decades after the civil rights movement, Liberty City has seen two race riots and struggled to escape a cycle of violence and poverty.\n\nAt Miami Edison High School on the border of Liberty City and Little Haiti, 17-year-old Judith Etienne said King would be disappointed in his unfulfilled dream.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Martin Luther King didn\u2019t have this in his dream,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of kids dying of gang violence in this community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "This man wants to clean urban decay from streets named for MLK", "title": "This man wants to clean urban decay from streets named for MLK", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/19/this-man-wants-to-clean-urban-decay-from-streets-named-for-mlk/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140119__p_ecf576c8-4a2f-4e36-987d-53caf2a48b5blsoriginalph.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140119__p_ecf576c8-4a2f-4e36-987d-53caf2a48b5blsoriginalph.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-19T10:08:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T23:02:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc20d\"", "article_summary": "A walk down the 6-mile city street named for the Rev.\nThe urban decay along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in St. Louis can be found in other major American cities, from Houston and Milwaukee to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure Martin Luther King didn\u2019t have this in his dream,\u201d she said.\nAlong MLK Boulevard in Hialeah, where U.S. flags fly alongside Cuban ones, MLK Boulevard isn\u2019t known as the street named after a civil rights leader.\nA similar debate continues in High Point, N.C., where a King street proposal first suggested two decades ago remains up in the air."}
