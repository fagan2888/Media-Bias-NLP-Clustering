Bobby Jindal and open the government health insurance program to more low-income workers was a cornerstone of the Democrat\u2019s campaign. But legal realities have caused Edwards to back off, at least for the time being, while his incoming administration works through a legal glitch raised by the Legislature\u2019s fiscal advisers.\n\nEdwards told reporters Sunday in his first news conference as governor-elect that Medicaid expansion \u201cwill be part of the early initiatives that you see in my administration\u201d \u2014 but not the first thing.\n\nThe communications director for the transition, Mary-Patricia Wray, said, \u201cWe are going to do it as soon as we possibly can. But he\u2019s not going to ignore the concerns of the Legislative Fiscal Office. He\u2019s going to address them.\u201d\n\nMore than a million Louisiana residents already are on Medicaid, which is paid mostly by federal dollars. The $8 billion Medicaid program accounts for about a third of the state\u2019s annual budget.\n\nExpanding the rolls of Medicaid would qualify about 300,000 more Louisiana residents who make too much money to join now but too little to purchase coverage on the open market. Specifically, the coverage would be open to those making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which this year is $32,913 for a family of four.\n\nJindal, who recently suspended his presidential campaign, has repeatedly refused billions of dollars in federal incentives to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls, which is an integral part of Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s signature Affordable Care Act. Jindal, and other Republicans, argued that Medicaid has failed to provide adequate care and that Louisiana\u2019s portion of expansion would cost the state\u2019s taxpayers too much.\n\nThirty other states have agreed to expand their Medicaid rolls.\n\nRepublican legislators batted down multiple attempts over the past few years \u2014 several led by Edwards \u2014 to adopt the expansion over Jindal\u2019s objections.\n\nDuring the legislative session earlier this year, however, lawmakers approved a resolution that circumvented Jindal\u2019s veto pen. The measure was based on hospitals assessing a fee on themselves. The money would go into a fund that would help pay the state\u2019s share of the added cost.\n\nInitially, the federal government would pay 100 percent of the cost, with the state\u2019s share increasing to 3 percent in 2017, then up to 10 percent of the total cost starting in 2020.\n\nBut the resolution\u2019s mechanism doesn\u2019t work as anticipated and doesn\u2019t create the short-term savings projected.\n\nThe Louisiana Hospital Association backed the legislation, House Concurrent Resolution 75. Hospitals treating uninsured people today are paid through another program that requires the state to pay up to 38 percent of the cost.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act also reduces federal funding for such uninsured care because, theoretically, those patients would now be covered under Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe plan outlined in HCR75 includes a guaranteed \u201cbase reimbursement level\u201d for certain Medicaid payments, including uninsured care. But the guaranteed reimbursement level won\u2019t allow uncompensated or free care to be reduced in future years to the degree projected, meaning the savings would not be generated, Fiscal Office chief health care analyst Shawn Hotstream said.\n\nSo, the Legislative Fiscal Office in early November backed off its projections that Medicaid expansion would save state government $52 million in the first year of expansion and between $102 million and $165 million over a five-year period.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the hospital guys intended their resolution to read that way,\u201d former state Medicaid director Don Gregory said. They meant total Medicaid reimbursement would not be reduced below a certain level, not per individual program, such as the one that pays some hospitals for care they provide the uninsured.\n\nThe Louisiana Hospital Association disagrees with Hotstream\u2019s interpretation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem,\u201d LHA President Paul Salles said.\n\nThe legislation intended that the federal money would be used as an offset to the state dollars currently spent on uninsured care, Salles said, adding it would be nonsensical to read it any other way.\n\nSalles said the association is ready to work with the Edwards administration on Medicaid expansion. He sees nothing standing in the way of state implementation.\n\nOnce the Medicaid expansion is applied for, Salles said, the association will develop how the assessment will be levied.\n\nFederal approval could be sought as soon as Edwards is inaugurated, said Gregory, who does health-care analysis for the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, better known as PAR.\n\nThe state would be able to get full federal funding for the expansion dating back to when it applied for it, which would mean a reimbursement of state dollars spent on uninsured care while the request was pending, Gregory said.\n\nFederal approval could take up to six months.\n\nEdwards would have to get the state Department of Health and Hospitals to submit for federal approval amendments to the state\u2019s Medicaid plan. Since it would be a straight expansion of the existing program, approval should come more quickly than if the state were developing a program of its own.\n\nThe health agency would also promulgate rules that would go through the state administrative procedures approval process. Legislators could opt to hold hearings on the expansion and suggest changes, but they could not stop the rules from going into effect.\n\nEven if the Legislature needs to revise its resolution, the \u201cspeedy implementation of Medicaid expansion\u201d should not be delayed, said Jan Moller, director of the Louisiana Budget Project, a Baton Rouge-based research group that analyzes fiscal policies from a low- to middle-income perspective and has long supported expanding the program.\n\n\u201cThe legislative intent from everybody involved is clear \u2014 from the Hospital Association, from the legislators who voted on it,\u201d Moller said. \u201cThe intent of the resolution was to minimize fiscal costs. Why would you want to lock the status quo in place?\u201d\n\nFollow Marsha Shuler on Twitter, @MarshaShulerCNB.
