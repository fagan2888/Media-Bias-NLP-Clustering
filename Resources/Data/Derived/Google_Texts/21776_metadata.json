After his latest monster performance, C.J. Anderson\u2019s text messages nearly matched his rushing total.\n\nHe received 165 texts on his phone Sunday night. He finished with 168 yards on the ground.\n\nHe is the NFL\u2019s new darling, a previously unknown player who suddenly is providing rocket fuel to fantasy league teams everywhere.\n\n\u201cI would tell all the fantasy players, I love what I am doing and having fun. But don\u2019t get mad when certain situations come up and I decide not to get into the end zone and not make that long run because I am trying to win games,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThat\u2019s all that matters. Winning games.\u201d\n\nAnderson has 662 yards from scrimmage over the past four games, more than any NFL player during that span. On Sunday, he became the first running back with 165-yard-plus back-to-back efforts since 2012.\n\n\u201cHe has leverage, makes people miss,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said.\n\nAnderson remains \u201chumble and hungry,\u201d greeting the press no differently than he did when he was buried as a third-stringer.\n\n\u201cI just feel like I belong. The way we prepare as a running back group and approach each week, any of us can have the type day I had,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it was a hot hand. My coaches just trusted me, 18 (Peyton Manning) puts us in the right position and the O-line is doing a (heck) of a job.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThomas continues to improve. Tight end Julius Thomas watched from the sideline for the second consecutive week, his left ankle preventing him from playing. Thomas made progress last week and thought he might return Sunday. With another week of treatment, he remains optimistic about playing against the Buffalo Bills.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be something I have to work through and get after it in the training room. Last week I had a couple of good days and I was really optimistic I would play. But it wasn\u2019t feeling the way I needed it to,\u201d Thomas said Monday. \u201cI am not discouraged. I need to just keep going. I am encouraged.\u201d\n\n***\n\nParty on Barth \u2026 with help? Connor Barth made a stirring debut, tying the franchise record with five field goals. He struggled with kickoffs in what Fox labeled \u201ctricky conditions.\u201d It raised the question of whether Fox would consider adding a kickoff specialist. Brandon McManus, cut last week because of field goal issues, ranked second in the league in touchback percentage at 75 percent (48 of 64).\n\n\u201cI have done it before. Had John Kasay in Carolina and we did it,\u201d Fox said. \u201cYou can consider it. And you can also consider nothing.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
