Sinks were added to the exam rooms, which feature new furniture and updated equipment that in some cases can transmit readings directly to patients' electronic records.\n\n\u201cIt looks great,\u201d Dandapani said. \u201cThis is the way I wanted it to look. \u201cIt no longer looks like we're serving very poor people.\u201d\n\nWith sunny yellow paint on the walls and a modern computer system, the Fourth Avenue offices could be mistaken for any suburban outpatient center.\n\nExpanded services\n\nBut Roberta Woods, 87, of New Kensington said the Community Health Clinic has done more for her than any other medical practice.\n\n\u201cI walked in here and they treated me like a queen,\u201d she said.\n\nIn fact, Woods credits the clinic with helping her get a chariot: She maneuvered the remodeled clinic in a motorized chair.\n\n\u201cThey help me with all my problems,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make me feel good.\u201d\n\nDandapani hopes the clinic will make more people feel good.\n\nOne of the grants she is pursuing would allow the clinic to offer mental health services, something she feels is a need in the community.\n\n\u201cBehavioral health is a subset of medical health,\u201d she said.\n\nThe clinic hired outreach specialist Theresa Maxwell a few months ago to help people navigate services.\n\nThey include checkups, immunizations, lab testing, family planning, dental and gynecological services.\n\nThe 13-member staff includes a family practice doctor, a nurse practitioner, a dentist and a gynecologist.\n\n\u201cWe go beyond what you'd see in a normal outpatient center,\u201d Dandapani said. \u201cThe bar is very high.\u201d\n\nDandapani said the clinic's Federally Qualified Health Center status was renewed on March 1, which guarantees it federal funding for another three years. The clinic's base annual grant through the program is about $760,000, about half of its $1.3 million operating budget.\n\n\u201cWe do miracles with that,\u201d Dandapani said.\n\nGaining federal status, which also grants access to Medicare reimbursements, discounted prescriptions and medical malpractice insurance, saved the clinic in 2009 when it nearly closed amid financial problems.\n\nFive years later, the clinic recently was awarded the patient-centered medical home status, which Dandapani said means they track patients through the health-care system rather than just seeing them for brief, sporadic visits.\n\n\u201cWe turned a corner when Raji came,\u201d said Hall of Dandapani, who joined the clinic four years ago.\n\nMore patients expected\n\nDandapani expects the Community Health Clinic's pool of patients to grow next year when people who currently can't afford insurance are expected to be insured through the state under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nThe clinic offers a sliding fee scale to accommodate people who normally wouldn't be able to afford health care.\n\nAbout 2,500 individuals were served by the clinic last year; there were 5,500 patient visits total.\n\n\u201cWe are in a position to grow,\u201d Dandapani said.\n\nWhile many of the patients live in Arnold, Lower Burrell and New Kensington, Hall said about a third of their patients live in Allegheny County, and the Kiski Valley is a potential growth area.\n\n\u201cWe have no borders,\u201d he said. \u201cWe make sure these folks are taken care of. They're not numbers to us.\u201d\n\nLiz Hayes is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
