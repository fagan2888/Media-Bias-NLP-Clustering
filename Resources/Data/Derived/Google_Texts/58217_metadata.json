(AP) \u2014 The competition on the pitch has yet to start, but the fight over World Cup consumers is already intense \u2014 and no more so than between the athletic companies that are jockeying for their once-every-four-years shot at the ever-growing worldwide soccer market.\n\nThe players, their boots and kits will be on display for billions across the globe over a monthlong window starting next week. Nike wants to make sure fans notice the swoosh. Adidas? Those three stripes. For Puma it\u2019s that leaping cat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the World Cup. It\u2019s do or die. Win or go home,\u201d said adidas merchandise manager Peter Hong, alluding to more than the on-field competition in Brazil.\n\nThe result is going to be an all-out blitz of advertising, social media, personalities and product that goes far beyond simply selling jerseys and cleats.\n\nNike is betting on its stable of stars and a good showing by Brazil. Adidas has the tradition, and they are the official World Cup sponsor through 2030. Puma wants you to remember the boots themselves, putting players on the pitch with different colors on each foot.\n\nNike is the world\u2019s top athletic footwear, apparel and equipment company, but second-ranked adidas has always held tightly to the overall soccer market.\n\nIn recent years Oregon-based Nike has unabashedly challenged its German rival in the sector and hit nearly $2 billion in soccer-related sales last year. Adidas\u2019 sales last year were estimated at about $2.4 billion, but the company is already experiencing a World Cup bump that the company hopes will push it to a record $2.8 billion.\n\nSoccer has always been adidas\u2019 baby: Founder Adi Dassler made the company\u2019s first pair of soccer boots in 1925.\n\nAs World Cup sponsors, adidas has designed the ball for each one of the tournaments since 1970. This year\u2019s multicolored edition is called Brazuca \u2014 which, according to adidas, has already well surpassed sales of the Jabulani ball from the last World Cup by 30 percent.\n\n\u201cThis is where we put our stake in the ground and prove our domination in the market,\u201d said Ernesto Bruce, director of soccer for adidas America.\n\nNike only entered the soccer market in 1994. The company has become increasingly adept at getting its name out there without being an official sponsor. Its latest campaign focuses on stars \u2014 most notably Cristiano Ronaldo \u2014 without ever mentioning the words \u201cWorld Cup.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlthough we\u2019re not a sponsor of the World Cup itself, we connect where it matters \u2014 by partnering with clubs, federations, and elite and everyday players,\u201d said Nike\u2019s Dermott Clearly, global vice president and general manager for soccer. \u201cTen teams at the tournament will wear Nike on the pitch in Brazil, including the hosts, along with hundreds of the players who will wear Nike boots. We\u2019re confident we will stand out on and off pitch better than any other brand.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adidas and Nike jostle for edge at the World Cup", "title": "Adidas and Nike jostle for edge at the World Cup", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Adidas and Nike jostle for edge at the World Cup", "title": "Adidas and Nike jostle for edge at the World Cup", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/adidas_and_nike_jostle_for_edge_at_the_world_cup/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/germany-soccer-wcup-.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adidas and Nike jostle for edge at the World Cup", "title": "Adidas and Nike jostle for edge at the World Cup", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/germany-soccer-wcup-.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anne M.
