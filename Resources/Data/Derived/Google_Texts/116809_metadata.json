The answer from U.S. territories appears to be \u201cno.\u201d Fragmented implementation of the law in the territories has wreaked havoc on their insurance markets, leaving many residents with no options for health coverage \u2014 the opposite of the law\u2019s intent.\n\nIn July, federal officials sent a letter exempting American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands from certain other ACA requirements in an attempt to make the law work. But many stakeholders say the exemptions will not entirely fix the problems that health care reform has caused in the territories, and some say the exemptions could lead to unintended consequences in the states.\n\nIn the letter, officials explained that the exemptions were granted because the definition of a \u201cstate\u201d under the Public Health Service Act does not apply to the territories. A CMS spokesperson said the government is \u201cproviding additional flexibility to the territories in order to implement the law in a way that recognizes their unique situations.\u201d\n\nMuch of ACA No Longer Applies to Territories\n\nThe decision marks a change in the government\u2019s stance. Just a year ago, Gary Cohen \u2014 director of CMS\u2019 Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight \u2014 wrote a letter to Northern Mariana Islands officials, saying, \u201cHowever meritorious your request might be, HHS is not authorized to choose which provisions [of the ACA] \u2026 might apply to the territories.\u201d\n\nNow, territories are exempt from:\n\nEssential health benefits requirements;\n\nGuaranteed availability of coverage;\n\nHaving a single risk insurance pool;\n\nHealth insurance rate review;\n\nImplementing a community rating system; and\n\nThe medical-loss ratio provision.\n\nWhy Territories Sought Exemptions\n\nThe exemptions did not come out of the blue. For years, health officials in the territories warned that the ACA threatened the stability of their health insurance markets because the law\u2019s individual mandate only applies to states. Prior to the exemption, insurers in the territories were required to meet the law\u2019s strict \u2014 and costly \u2014 coverage standards, but unlike their domestic counterparts, they lacked the promise of additional customers incented to buy coverage because of the individual mandate.\n\nAnother complication: Residents in the territories do not qualify for health insurance subsidies.\n\nLast December, John McDonald, director of the Virgin Islands\u2019 banking and insurance department, said, \u201cHHS and the government itself describe health care reform as a three-legged stool where you have the [individual] mandate, the subsidies and the market reforms. Well, what they\u2019ve basically done is left us with a one-legged stool.\u201d\n\nMany insurers left the territories\u2019 insurance markets after the ACA took effect. For example, there were no individual health insurance plans for sale in the Northern Mariana Islands on Jan. 1.\n\nExemptions Don\u2019t Necessarily Fix Problems\n\nAngela Weyne, insurance commissioner in Puerto Rico, told California Healthline that the exemptions are \u201can important change\u201d for the territory. \u201cBefore the announcement, Puerto Rico was confronting particular challenges due to the unique characteristics of its health insurance market worsened by the fragmentation of the legal provisions of the ACA applicable to Puerto Rico,\u201d Weyne said. \u201cPuerto Rico now has several options for its health insurance system.\u201d\n\nHowever, Weyne added that \u201calthough HHS exempts Puerto Rico from certain provisions of the [ACA], all of the provisions that were extended to Puerto Rico through a previous interpretation of the law \u2026 will continue to be in effect through the Health Insurance Code of Puerto Rico (HICPR).\u201d Those provisions already have become law in the territory, but the newly released exemptions still give Puerto Rico \u201cgreater flexibility in certain specific areas to make decisions that are more aligned with our particular circumstances,\u201d she said.\n\nOther territories are putting off giving the green light on the exemptions by choice. Officials in the Virgin Islands have told insurers to continue complying with the ACA\u2019s provisions until the territory can obtain clarification on some of the exemptions. John McDonald, director of the Virgin Islands\u2019 Division of Banking and Insurance, said, \u201cWe just need them to be clearer on some of these issues.\u201d\n\nTerritories Not In the Clear, and Exemption Could Have Unintended Consequences\n\nSome territorial officials had hoped for a different solution. For example, some regulators had advocated for extending the individual mandate and subsidies to the territories instead of issuing exemptions to other portions of the law.\n\nIn addition, some say the exemptions do not fix all of the issues that the territories\u2019 insurance markets face. Weyne said that while the exemptions will help Puerto Rico\u2019s market, officials there still are concerned about the law\u2019s health insurance provider fee, which still applies to the territories. She said, \u201cThough most premium increases in Puerto Rico were being caused by the expansions of the rights and benefits provided by the ACA, the premiums in Puerto Rico have also been significantly impacted by the Health Insurance Providers Fee \u2026 [which] represents a premium increase of up to 2.5% in Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nWeyne added, \u201cMoreover, the [fee] must also be paid by any private insurance company that insures the risks of the government health plan \u2026 further increasing the costs of the [the plan] as well as all Medicare Advantage related programs.\u201d\n\nThe exemptions also could have some unintended consequences. For example, Weyne noted that states could request \u201cthe same flexibility.\u201d One lawmaker already has used the changes as a launching pad to call for ACA exemptions for Alaska. In a release, state Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) argued, \u201cThe administration needs to recognize the unique needs of the territories as well as small population states like Alaska where premiums under the health care law have seen double and triple digits increases for some Alaskans from 2013 to 2014.\u201d\n\nWhere Do the Territories Go From Here?\n\nThe newly granted exemptions do not guarantee that problems with the territories\u2019 insurance markets are over. Officials face other challenges to taking advantage of the changes, such as ACA provisions already being written into local laws.\n\nMoving forward, territorial agencies will have to work with local and federal officials to gain clarity about the exemptions and how they will apply to the territories. And many \u2014 like Puerto Rico \u2014 will be focused on what is now possible, rather than other solutions that have not been enacted. Weyne said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to venture into what may have been a better scenario for us. We have no other option than to look at what positive outcomes for the wellbeing of our citizens can we achieve with the new interpretation of HHS.\u201d\n\nAround the Nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at other stories making news on the road to reform.\n\nRx drug access: John Lechleiter in Forbes outlines a recent study finding that silver plans offered through the ACA\u2019s exchanges are nearly four times more likely than employer-sponsored plans to include a combined deductible for medical and pharmacy coverage, which can reduce access to prescription drugs.\n\nIncreasing mental health care access: Adrianna McIntyre at Vox highlights research finding that the ACA has increased mental health care access for those ages 18 to 25.\n\nACA \u2018survival guide\u2019 for large businesses: John Bennett, the president and CEO of New York\u2019s Capital District Physicians\u2019 Health Plan, offers guidance in Albany Business Journal\u2018s \u201cHealth Care Inc.\u201d for large employers who are selecting employee health plans that comply with the ACA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government has granted U.S. territories several exemptions to the Affordable Care Act, but do the changes go far enough to stabilize their insurance markets?
