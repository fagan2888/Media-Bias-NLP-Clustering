If you are still not tired of Alonzo Mourning trying to sell you health insurance while watching a Miami Heat game, then let Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz have a go at it.

The outspoken Democratic National Committee Chair will be at Broward College's Central Campus in Davie Sunday, urging uninsured folks to sign up for health insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act.

Besides Schultz, experts from the Broward Regional Health Planning Council and Broward Community & Family Health Centers will be on hand to help potential enrollees.

According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Obamacare signups in Florida have totaled 442,087 as of March 1. But, a March 31 open enrollment deadline looms. Those who remain uninsured past the deadline face a 2014 tax penalty of either one percent of their annual household income or $95 per person ($47.50 for children under 18), whichever is higher.

The enrollment event will be from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at BC's Institute for Public Safety, Building 22, 3501 SW Davie Road, Davie, FL 33314. Interested parties should bring their social security cards, ID, W-2s, and details on any current health plans in which they are currently enrolled.
