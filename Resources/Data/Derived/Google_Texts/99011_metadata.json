McCarty, took matters into his own hands recently when he reached agreements with major health insurance providers that would slash the percentage of costs that HIV patients had to come up with.\n\nThe percentage dropped 40 percent for HIV patients insured by Humana under the new agreement, which means they will now only be paying 10 percent of the costs of HIV medications.\n\nEven after slashing the costs for patients, however, Humana insisted that it did not break any laws.\n\nInstead, Humana said that Florida simply has a \u201cunique law\u201d that gives certain protections to HIV/AIDS patients.\n\n\u201cFlorida has a unique law providing insurance-related protections to individuals with HIV/AIDS,\u201d said Thomas T. Noland Jr., senior vice president of Humana. \u201cWe understand the affordability challenges facing those with HIV/AIDS because of the relatively high cost of their specialty medications.\u201d\n\nMcCarty also reached agreements with Cigna and Coventry Health Care.\n\nNow, all health insurance providers in the Federal marketplace may have to follow suit.\n\n\u201cIf an issuer places most or all drugs that treat a specific condition on the highest-cost tiers, that plan design effectively discriminates against, or discourages enrollment by, individuals who have those chronic conditions,\u201d the administration\u2019s letter to insurers said.\n\nSo far the new standards are receiving a warm welcome by health care advocates, including one lobbyist at the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Andrew Sperling.\n\n\u201cWhen a doctor follows recommended treatment guidelines the cost-sharing should not be so burdensome that it discourages patients from adhering to the treatment,\u201d Sperling told the NY Times.\n\nMuch like patients with HIV/AIDS, patients with mental illnesses like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia are also required to pay up to 50 percent of the medication costs, making it extremely hard for the average family to afford.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "The Obama administration is launching an investigation to ensure health insurance companies are not discriminating against people with costly chronic conditions like AIDS, diabetes and mental illnesses, the administration announced on Monday.
