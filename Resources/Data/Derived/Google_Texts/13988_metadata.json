No matter where a person stands on abortion itself, everyone should be able to agree that this type of intentional and illegal deception is wrong and should stop.\u201d\n\nFRC and the Lozier Institute have collaborated on a new website, called Obamacareabortion.com, which monitors the problems with coerced abortion funding. The site explains the Government Accountability Office found \u201c1,036 of Obamacare policies sold in 2014 included abortion on demand.\u201d\n\nGet the book that documents the grounds for bringing an impeachment case against Barack Obama, in \u201cImpeachable Offenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it took many months and a government watchdog report to finally identify the abortion-covering plans for 2014,\u201d the site explains. But, \u201cNow for 2015, the problem continues. Due to a lack of transparency in Obamacare, Americans are again finding it difficult, or even impossible to clearly discern whether the Obamacare plan they are considering includes abortion. This is critical information since individuals purchasing plans that include abortion are required to pay a hidden abortion surcharge. Through the surcharge, a portion of each individual\u2019s insurance premium goes into a fund used to pay abortion on demand.\u201d\n\nRead all about the strategy that has been used successfully to rid communities of abortion, in \u201cAbortion Free: Your Manual to Building a Pro-life America One Community at a Time.\u201d\n\nThe site reveals what information is available about coverages state-to-state but notes the information available on this site is \u201cseverely limited by the Obama administration\u2019s failure to make abortion coverage information easily available.\u201d\n\nThe letter from the organization says: \u201cIf Americans are to be forced off their existing, chosen insurance plans and into the ACA insurance exchanges regulated by your agencies, they should at least be entitled to full disclosure of the contents of the plans on those exchanges and what they are paying for. Unfortunately, the proposed rules do not protect consumers, and in fact may continue to mislead them into enrolling in abortion-including plans and paying for others\u2019 abortions in violation of their conscience.\u201d\n\nIt continues: \u201cWhatever one\u2019s views of abortion, the current exchanges and plans regulated by your agencies do not protect any \u2018right to choose\u2019 abortion coverage. In fact, they leave many Americans without a choice that fits both their health needs and respects their right of conscience. They deceive and compel Americans to pay for others\u2019 elective abortions. This is unconscionable and within your power to correct.\u201d\n\nThe letter says the Obamacare law requires the calculation of the average actuarial value and collection of a \u201cseparate payment\u201d for abortion \u201cfor any plan that includes coverage of abortions which federal taxpayer dollars may not be used (all abortions except those for reasons of rape, incest, or the life of the mother).\u201d\n\nBut the federal agencies have set up rules \u201cto collect only a single payment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese rules have effectively mandated secrecy of abortion coverage and the abortion premium surcharge,\u201d the letter said.\n\n\u201cIndeed, in some states the problem is even more serious. As you are aware, and as the Government Accountability Office has confirmed, in Hawaii, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont, every ACA plan available for purchase via the state\u2019s health insurance exchange includes elective abortion coverage.\n\n\u201cThis regime of secrecy \u2013 especially in those states where there is no choice of a plan without elective abortion coverage \u2013 is particularly offensive because participation is enforced by the ACA\u2019s individual mandate,\u201d it continues.\n\nWhat the groups have found is that \u201ceven for trained professionals who know exactly what information they are trying to find, it is a Herculean, and sometimes fruitless, task\u201d to find out whether policies include abortion coverage.\n\nRemarkably, the letter explains, some people trying to find out whether abortion was covered by their insurance were \u201creferred\u201d to Planned Parenthood.\n\nThat leaves Americans \u201cin the dark \u2013 in no small part because your agencies have forbidden illumination of abortion coverage and the surcharge that accompanies it.\u201d\n\nThe federal government needs to not just be transparent about abortion coverage options, but consumers \u201cshould be permitted to opt out of abortion coverage and payment of the abortion premium surcharge for all plans,\u201d the letter says.\n\nRead all about the strategy that has been used successfully to rid communities of abortion, in \u201cAbortion Free: Your Manual to Building a Pro-life America One Community at a Time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The Obama administration is coercing Americans to pay for abortions through Obamacare and then concealing the payments from the ones who are being billed, charges a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and others in Washington.
