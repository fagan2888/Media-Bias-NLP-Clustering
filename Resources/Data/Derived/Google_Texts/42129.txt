Sioux Falls, SD

With the first day of school on the horizon, Sioux Falls kids and their families gathered at the Washington Pavilion on Saturday for Prairie View Prevention Services' 13th annual Celebrating Families Back to School Fair.

Attending kids received socks and underwear donated from across KELOLAND. Prairie View executive director and fair organizer Darcy Jensen said that the 26 vendors, which ranged from the Boy Scouts to the Banquet, convened at the Pavilion for -quote- "one purpose, and that's to help the kids and the families."

“We usually hold it the first or second week of August, and it's to help people get back to school. We call it our 'one-stop shop.' It helps families get back to school on the right foot. We believe that it's helpful for kids to know that someone in their community cares,” Jensen said.

Jensen estimated that around twelve to fifteen hundred people would attend Saturday. Roughly 20 sponsors made the event happen, including Home Federal and SDN Communication, which both donated to open the Pavilion's Discovery Science Center's doors to all who came.
