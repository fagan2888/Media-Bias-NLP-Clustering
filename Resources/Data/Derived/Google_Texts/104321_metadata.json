That means that since then, and for several months into the future, the Treasury has been and will be relying on what are called \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to pay the government\u2019s obligations.\n\nIt\u2019s a term that has become plainly ridiculous in recent years because the number of debt ceiling crises lawmakers have forced the country into have made such measures, such as delaying required pension fund payments, anything but extraordinary.\n\nWhen Congress comes back next month, there\u2019s a good chance that lawmakers and the White House will face off over federal spending once again, taking the Treasury to the brink of default before finally agreeing on a deal to raise the debt limit.\n\nRelated: As Obamacare Costs Rise, the GOP Has a Real Chance to Reform Healthcare\n\nMany of the arguments that those opposed to any sort of debt limit will marshal focus on the pernicious effects of an escalating national debt on the country\u2019s economy. There\u2019s no doubt that it\u2019s better to have less debt than more, all things being equal. But in a recent paper published by the Brookings Institution, Kemal Dervi\u015f makes the important point that not all debt is created equal.\n\nDervi\u015f, the director of Brookings\u2019 Global Economy and Development program as well as the former minister of economic development for Turkey, points out that it can be misleading to talk about a nation\u2019s debt as though all borrowing is the same. Instead, he argues, countries might be better off looking at their assets and liabilities the way companies do.\n\n\u201cIt is a mistake to focus only on annual budgets, without adequate regard for the long-term balance-sheet implications of how borrowed money is used,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis narrow, short-term focus differs from the approach taken for publicly traded companies, for which the strength of the balance sheet and the economy\u2019s potential are emphasized, alongside annual income statements.\u201d\n\nInvestments in infrastructure and education, for example, have a positive return to the government\u2019s balance sheet because they boost the GDP and tax revenue. However, he notes, recognizing that would require politicians to alter the way they talk about government borrowing.\n\nRelated: Another \u2018Manufactured Crisis?\u2019 McConnell Pressured to Start Budget Talks\n\n\u201cFor a long-term balance-sheet approach to gain traction, politicians will have to drop the ideological biases that are distorting fiscal policy. Proponents of austerity currently use nominal debt figures to scare voters, even in countries with record-low interest rates and large private-sector profits that are not being channeled toward investment.\u201d\n\nDervi\u015f\u2019s arguments are generally aimed at European policymakers, but they are clearly applicable to the U.S., especially given the fact that the Treasury continues to be able to borrow at rates that are historically low.\n\n\u201cIn many countries, one could realistically expect a 4 percent average return on at least one percentage point of GDP worth of incremental investment. If the marginal real interest rate is 1 percent, an increase in public investment would actually reduce future indebtedness.\u201d\n\nThe existing federal debt of the U.S. is substantial, totaling some $18 trillion. Dervis doesn't advocate adding to the debt without considering the cost, but argues that while a reflexive objection to any borrowing at a time when it is possible to lock in low rates for extended periods of time may make political sense, it is difficult to defend from a fiscal point of view.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that persuading the public that some borrowing can actually reduce future debt is a political bank-shot that few politicians have the will or the ability to sell. For the American people, the likelihood of a debt crisis that treats all borrowing as equal is the likeliest outcome when Congress returns in the fall.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When Congress comes back next month, there\u2019s a good chance that lawmakers and the White House will face off over federal spending once again, taking the Treasury to the brink of default before finally agreeing on a deal to raise the debt limit.", "title": "The U.S. Balance Sheet Is a Disaster that Congress Can\u2019t Fix", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/21/US-Balance-Sheet-Disaster-Congress-Can-t-Fix", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01072013_debt_ceiling_capitol_long_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/21/US-Balance-Sheet-Disaster-Congress-Can-t-Fix", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01072013_debt_ceiling_capitol_long_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When Congress comes back next month, there\u2019s a good chance that lawmakers and the White House will face off over federal spending once again, taking the Treasury to the brink of default before finally agreeing on a deal to raise the debt limit.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0f3\"", "article_summary": "For the American people, the likelihood of a debt crisis that treats all borrowing as equal is the likeliest outcome when Congress returns in the fall.\nHowever, he notes, recognizing that would require politicians to alter the way they talk about government borrowing.\nThe unfortunate truth is that persuading the public that some borrowing can actually reduce future debt is a political bank-shot that few politicians have the will or the ability to sell.\nBut in a recent paper published by the Brookings Institution, Kemal Dervi\u015f makes the important point that not all debt is created equal.\nInstead, he argues, countries might be better off looking at their assets and liabilities the way companies do."}
