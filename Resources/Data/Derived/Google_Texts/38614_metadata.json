(AP) - Bills receiver Percy Harvin is at peace with his checkered past, and wants more than anything to put it behind him.\n\nWhatever divisive reputation the talented yet troubled player established during his first six NFL seasons, it\u2019s not something Harvin wants accompanying him to Buffalo, his fourth stop in as many years.\n\n\u201cI know the person I am and the person I\u2019m going to become,\u201d Harvin said Saturday. \u201cI\u2019ve learned from all my lessons. And I\u2019m just going to keep growing as a person, as a teammate, as a son, as a future husband.\u201d\n\nAt 27, Harvin\u2019s looking only forward.\n\nHe hints there might be a wedding engagement in his near future - \u201cIt\u2019s heading that way,\u201d Harvin said, breaking into a smile.\n\nOn the field, Harvin is taking a team-first approach in a bid to dispute the label Sports Illustrated recently applied by referring to him as the NFL\u2019s \u201cmost-hated player in the locker room.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s open to accepting any role the Bills offer: receiving and returning kickoffs. And Harvin will even propose one more: Cornerback.\n\nIt\u2019s a position Harvin took a few snaps at on Friday, when the Bills opened camp.\n\n\u201cI definitely feel like I can run with anybody in the league,\u201d Harvin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got good footwork. Great hips. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to do and always kept in my tool bag.\u201d\n\nCoach Rex Ryan was intrigued enough to give Harvin\u2019s proposal a shot.\n\n\u201cThis is just a \u2018Let\u2019s see what he can do,\u2019\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut obviously, he\u2019s got the physical skillset that you would think he\u2019d probably be pretty good at it.\u201d\n\nVeteran safety Corey Graham was left impressed.\n\n\u201cMan, that\u2019s sweet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shocked me. You never see anybody of that caliber who\u2019s willing to do that. So it means a lot.\u201d\n\nWithout prompting, Graham then took issue with Harvin\u2019s critics.\n\n\u201cEverybody always talks bad about Percy,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it at all. He\u2019s a great team player. And he\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes.\u201d\n\nHarvin is in Buffalo, where he\u2019s running out of second chances during what\u2019s been a mercurial career.\n\nIt began in 2009 when the Vikings\u2019 first-round draft pick was named the NFL\u2019s Offensive Rookie of the Year after scoring eight touchdowns - six receiving and two returning kickoffs.\n\nThe low point came midway through last season. Scuffles with then-Seahawks teammates Doug Baldwin and Golden Tate led Seattle to abruptly trade Harvin to the New York Jets for a conditional draft pick.\n\nIn March, Harvin signed a three-year contract - though only the first season is guaranteed - with Buffalo, where he is reunited with Ryan after the two developed a close bond in New York.\n\nSigning with Buffalo was what Harvin called \u201ca no-brainer.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s on him to re-establish himself after injuries and distractions limited him to just 52 catches for 500 yards and one touchdown and another TD rushing over the past two seasons.\n\n\u201cMe and Rex Ryan, we fell in love with each other,\u201d Harvin had said in April. \u201cWhen I came here, they were excited to have me here. So I don\u2019t look at the past. I only look to the future. And the world has yet to see me really explode like I\u2019m about to.\u201d\n\nHarvin didn\u2019t back down when reminded of those comments Saturday.\n\n\u201cI just know what I\u2019m capable of,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I haven\u2019t done before. I just want to do that consistently and just be a better son, a better brother and just overall a better person.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d Harvin added, \u201cI like the way I\u2019m heading. And I\u2019m going to keep heading in that direction.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Ryan said the Bills are working with the NFL to determine Aaron Kromer\u2019s status after prosecutors in Florida on Friday dropped a battery charge against Buffalo\u2019s offensive line coach for allegedly punching a boy in the face last month. Kromer, who is on paid leave, is expected to rejoin the Bills next week, but faces potential disciplinary action, including a suspension or fine. \u2026 Ryan revealed the Bills are keeping CB Leodis McKelvin off his feet as a result of an undisclosed injury that has the starter on the Active/Non-Football Injury list. McKelvin was spotted sitting in a golf cart watching practice. \u2026 The Bills claimed OT Terren Jones off waivers, a day after being released by Tennessee. He\u2019s listed at 6-foot-7 and 341 pounds, and played one game for the Titans last season.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bills receiver Percy Harvin is at peace with his checkered past, and wants more than anything to put it behind him.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Bills receiver Percy Harvin is at peace with his checkered past, and wants more than anything to put it behind him.", "title": "Percy Harvin eager to establish fresh start with Bills", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/1/percy-harvin-eager-to-establish-fresh-start-with-b/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/01/95bb00d94b31e2227d0f6a706700d482.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/01/95bb00d94b31e2227d0f6a706700d482.jpg", "description": "Bills receiver Percy Harvin is at peace with his checkered past, and wants more than anything to put it behind him.", "card": "summary", "title": "Percy Harvin eager to establish fresh start with Bills"}, "Author": "JOHN WAWROW", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI know the person I am and the person I\u2019m going to become,\u201d Harvin said Saturday.\nPITTSFORD, N.Y.
