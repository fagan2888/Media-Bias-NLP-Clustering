Researchers examined 2009 data from seven sources that included 1,877 CEOs responsible for 2,681 hospitals.\n\nKaren E. Joynt, co-author of the JAMA study and instructor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, said that she and her co-authors were motivated to conduct the study because little information is known about how hospital CEOs are paid.\n\n[See also: CEO compensation is business strategy]\n\n\u201cWe constructed the study by looking at hospitals in different areas, size of the hospital, number of beds, financial metrics, quality metrics, patient satisfaction scores, community benefit, amount given in charity care, levels of technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to see if CEO compensation reflected on any of these factors.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that compensation for CEOs at nonprofit hospitals varies greatly across the country but averages at around $600,000. CEOs paid the least (a median compensation of $117,933) were from small, nonteaching hospitals in rural areas. The highest paid CEOs (with a media compensation of more than $1.6 million) were from larger, urban hospitals that were often teaching hospitals.\n\nHospitals with higher patient satisfaction scores tended to have higher-paid CEOs, according to the study. Advanced technology at the hospital also was associated with substantially higher CEO pay.\n\nThe factors that didn\u2019t seem to have much of an impact on CEO compensation include a hospital\u2019s provision of charity care, financial performance, or performance on various process qualities, mortality or readmission rates, said Joynt.\n\n[See also: Compensation incentive programs for healthcare professionals are ineffective]\n\n\u201cI think what this study shows is that there is room for improvement in the way hospitals think about CEO compensation,\u201d said Joynt. \u201cWe want our healthcare systems to be thinking about value, better patient outcomes. The data showed that CEO compensation didn\u2019t correlate as well with some of the factors we feel it should have.\u201d\n\nJoynt noted that because the study was based on 2009 data, CEO compensation has likely shifted in the last few years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to do a follow-up study to see how this has changed overtime. Have hospitals started to reward their CEOs based on quality outcomes or any of these other factors?\u201d she said. \u201cI think while this could have been a missed opportunity in the past, this is now a chance for us in the future to encourage our hospital leadership to drive toward better quality, efficiency and patient outcomes.\u201d\n\n[See also: Hospital CEO bonuses reward volume ]\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/hospital-size-patient-satisfaction-tied-hospital-ceo-salaries-study-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine examined factors what factors may or may not affect hospital CEO compensation.", "title": "Hospital size, patient satisfaction tied to hospital CEO salaries, study says"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine examined factors what factors may or may not affect hospital CEO compensation.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hospital size, patient satisfaction tied to hospital CEO salaries, study says"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Highest-paid hospital CEOs work at facilities with higher patient satisfaction scores, a new study has found.&#13; The study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, looked at nearly 2,700 nonprofit hospitals nationwide to explore what factors may or may not affect CEO compensation.
