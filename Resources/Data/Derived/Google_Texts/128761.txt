Tribal Week of Action set on South Dakota reservations

To raise awareness about the benefits of health insurance for tribal members, Horizon Healthcare and local navigators for the Affordable Care Act will be holding a Tribal Week of Action next week.

The navigators will be visiting four American Indian reservations to inform people about their health care options. They will be able to explain how health insurance works, the benefits of having it and figure how much it would cost. They are also able to help tribal members go through the enrollment process, which can help people feel confident in their choice to get covered.

The schedule includes:

*Tuesday: 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Golden Buffalo Casino on the Lower Brule Sioux Indian Reservation.

*April 20: 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., Fort Randall Casino on the Yankton Sioux Indian Reservation.

*April 21: 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sinte Gleska University Job Fair on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation.

*April 22: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Lode Star Casino on the Crow Creek Sioux Indian Reservation.
