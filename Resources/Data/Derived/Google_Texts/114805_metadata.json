Huckabee answered \u2014 \u201dAbsolutely. There\u2019s no doubt that the president has done plenty of things worthy of impeachment. Now the fact is we don\u2019t have the Senate, so if you impeached him in the House and it went to trial in the Senate, it would never even get to the Senate floor\u2026.From a governmental standpoint, you\u2019re not going to see it accomplished with this Senate. But I think it\u2019s an important argument to make that there are a number of things this president has done in the overuse of the executive power, his complete ignoring of the law, even his own law.\u201d\n\nWith each day, Republicans are getting bolder. They are starting not even to try to hide their real plan if they win control of the Senate. Boehner\u2019s lawsuit fits the plan of whipping up a high crime that they can use to impeach the president. House Republicans gave Boehner the expanded power to sue the president for anything beyond Obamacare. The Republican rhetoric has gone beyond calling for impeachment to now discussing how they will impeach Obama.\n\nRepublicans like Mike Huckabee are acting like a Republican takeover of the Senate is a done deal, when the reality is that the 2014 election is looking more like a coin flip. There is a very good possibility that Republicans don\u2019t win control of the Senate. If Democrats keep control, there will be no impeachment.\n\nIt is interesting that according to Huckabee, President Obama has done plenty of things worthy of impeachment, but he couldn\u2019t name anything specific outside of tired talking points about Obamacare.\n\nIn the big picture, Republicans view impeachment as their path back to the White House.\n\nThey are hoping to use impeachment to derail the looming freight train that is Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential candidacy. Republicans think that by impeaching Obama they will tarnish Hillary Clinton and open the door for their return to the White House. What is more likely to happen is that the attempted impeachment of Obama would backfire, and sweep Clinton and a Democratic controlled Congress into power.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s comments make it clear that the election this November isn\u2019t just about Congress. What may be at stake is the future of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While on a radio show in Iowa, Mike Huckabee said that President Obama deserves impeachment and that Republicans can impeach him once they have control of the Senate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "While on a radio show in Iowa, Mike Huckabee said that President Obama deserves impeachment and that Republicans can impeach him once they have control of the Senate.", "title": "Mike Huckabee Says President Obama Can Be Impeached Once Republicans Win The Senate", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/08/06/mike-huckabee-president-obama-impeached-republicans-win-senate.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/Obama-frown1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-06T16:01:10+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,huckabee impeach obama,Mike Huckabee,obama impeachment,Steve Deace,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-08-06T15:54:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-06T16:01:10+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "huckabee impeach obama, Mike Huckabee, obama impeachment, Steve Deace"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7b9\"", "article_summary": "While on a radio show in Iowa, Mike Huckabee said that President Obama deserves impeachment and that Republicans can impeach him once they have control of the Senate.\nIt is interesting that according to Huckabee, President Obama has done plenty of things worthy of impeachment, but he couldn\u2019t name anything specific outside of tired talking points about Obamacare.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the president has done plenty of things worthy of impeachment.\nHuckabee was asked by host Steve Deace if the president has done anything worthy of being impeached.\nThe Republican rhetoric has gone beyond calling for impeachment to now discussing how they will impeach Obama."}
