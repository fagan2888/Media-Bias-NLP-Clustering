Greg Evers, R-Crestview, and Greg Steube, R-Sarasota. They argue that the mixture of impetuous youth, alcohol and guns would make a deadly combination on campus.\n\nBut Unified Sportsmen of Florida lobbyist Marion Hammer, a two-term former president of the National Rifle Association, argues that there's no reason a law-abiding gun owner should become a criminal simply by crossing Academic Way. The NRA argument that \"the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is to have a good guy with a gun\" has so far prevailed in pre-session committee hearings.\n\nThree years ago, lawmakers rejected a plan to lift the campus ban. Thrasher, then a powerful state senator, killed it.\n\nbudget calculation (Photo: filmfoto)\n\nBUDGET\n\nThe Constitution says they have to pass one, and they usually go right down to the 60-day deadline \u2013 normally striking a House-Senate compromise on Monday or Tuesday of the session's last week, so the budget can steep for the required 72 hours before final passage.\n\nGov. Rick Scott's \"Keep Florida Working\" budget this year totals $77 billion. It includes $673 million in tax cuts, most noticeably reductions in cellular phone, cable and satellite TV tax cuts. College textbooks would also become tax-exempt under Scott's proposals and the tax on manufacturing machinery and equipment would be eliminated.\n\nScott, who campaigned in 2010 on a promise to eliminate the corporate income tax, would take another bite out of it by raising the basic exemption to $75,000 \u2013 removing about 2,200 businesses from the income tax rolls.\n\nThe governor also proposes to hike per-pupil education spending to a record $7,176. There are no college tuition increases in the budget.\n\nBut there's also a potential hole in it. The Low Income Pool, a program that spread more than $1 billion among hospitals, is set to expire in June and legislators will have to plug the gap. A tax increase is not on the table.\n\nWater (Photo: Ron Chapple)\n\nWATER\n\nThe big winner at the polls last November was not the governor or any Cabinet officer. It was a constitutional amendment mandating about $1 billion a year in state spending for water and land acquisition.\n\nMore than 4.2 million Floridians \u2014 75 percent of the turnout \u2014 approved Amendment 1, requiring one-third of revenue from the real estate documents tax to be spent on conservation. The Legislature now has to implement the amendment, which is how politics enters the equation.\n\nBoth Senate President Andy Gardiner, R-Orlando, and House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island, have made water policy a top priority for the session. The House Appropriations committee has already approved a nearly 100-page bill by Rep. Matt Caldwell, R-Fort Myers, and it could be the first bill taken up this year.\n\nThe proposal (HB 7003) would increase Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam's role in water policy. The Senate, meanwhile, has a plan (SB 918) by Sen. Charlie Dean, R-Inverness. With a billion to spend among stormwater and acquisition projects, the package is sure to land in a joint committee for compromising.\n\nThere is already an advertising campaign in major television markets by Everglades advocates who want the Legislature to use about $350 million in Amendment 1 revenue to buy land from U.S. Sugar under a 2010 contract that expires at the end of this session.\n\nCaduceus (Photo: Comstock)\n\nHEALTH CARE\n\nGov. Scott startled his Republican supporters and angered the Tea Party faction of the GOP two years ago by endorsing Medicaid expansion \u2013 provided the federal government keeps its $50 billion part of the bargain, under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe idea got nowhere in the past two legislative sessions, and House Speaker Crisafulli, has said his chamber is not interested in doing it this year. Democrats and various health lobbyists will continue pushing the issue, but they lack the votes to change the situation.\n\nCannabis doctor to speak at IHMC (Photo: Yuliya Semakova)\n\nMARIJUANA\n\nLegislators last year legalized medical use of \"Charlotte's Web,\" a non-euphoric extract of cannibis \u2014 high in the element that soothes seizures, low in the stuff that gets you high \u2014 but implementing regulations are still tied up in the bureaucracy.\n\nVoters almost passed a constitutional amendment authorizing prescriptions of smokable marijuana to ease the suffering of patients with ALS, cancer, AIDS and some other afflictions. That amendment fell short of the required 60 percent public approval, but its sponsors are gathering petition signatures to put a revised amendment on the 2016 ballot.\n\nThey hope the renewed campaign will put pressure on lawmakers to pass their own medical-marijuana law. Since opponents successfully raised fears that last year's amendment would lead to de-facto pot legalization, proponents hope legislators will enact a reasonably restrictive law to help the seriously ill while not simply legalizing pot.\n\nA total legalization bill has been filed \u2014 simply removing cannabis from the list of controlled substances \u2014 but there is no chance of passage.\n\nStack of money. (Photo: Medioimages/Photodisc)\n\nALIMONY\n\nSen. Kelli Stargel, R-Lakeland, and Rep. Ritch Workman, R-Merritt Island, won passage of a plan two years ago to change Florida's alimony laws, but Gov. Scott vetoed it. He said its retroactive provisions would interfere with alimony decrees many recipients \u2013 mainly divorced women \u2013 depended upon.\n\nThey left the issue alone for the election year but Stargel and another Polk County Republican, Rep. Colleen Burton, are back now with a revised proposal. It would end permanent alimony awards in most cases, allowing judges to decide how much, and how long, alimony payments should be made.\n\nWorkman now chairs the House Rules Committee, a key position for moving legislation to the floor.\n\nFlorida House panel on Tuesday pushed forward a plan aimed at increasing oversight of the state\u2019s troubled prison system (Photo: John Mcallister)\n\nPRISONS\n\nReports of inmate deaths and woeful health care, among other abuses, in Florida prisons have caught the attention of leading legislators this year. Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones \u2013 Gov. Scott's fourth prisons chief in four years \u2013 has logged long hours before House and Senate committees, promising tough disciplinary reforms.\n\nThe Senate has a plan to create a state corrections commission, with power to investigate conditions and violent incidents.\n\nFilling vacancies in the ranks of correctional officers and repairing inadequate facilities will cost a lot of money. Everyone wants to make the prisons safer, for inmates and officers alike \u2014 but if legislators have to choose between spending for tax cuts and education or prison inmates and their health care, it won't be a close vote.\n\nMale croupier turning over card at Blackjack table, close-up (Photo: John Howard)\n\nGAMBLING\n\nThere seems to be an eternal struggle for Florida's vacation image, between the established attractions that spent years \u2013 and millions \u2013 establishing a family-friendly resort reputation, and those who'd like to see some gambling.\n\nFor the past two years, legislators have done studies and heard from lobbyists representing \"destination resorts,\" meaning giant hotel-convention complexes in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area that would feature Las Vegas-style gambling. The Senate has tried, and failed, to come up with an umbrella regulatory plan for all forms of \"gaming\" \u2013 from the lottery to bingo to horse tracks and card rooms.\n\nA big side bet this year is expiration of the 2010 Seminole gaming compact this summer. That deal called for the tribe to pay the state at least $1 billion over five years, for exclusive rights to offer banked card games like blackjack at its casinos.\n\nMajestic Flag of Florida (Photo: CGinspiration)\n\nMISCELLANY\n\nEvery year, legislators give serious discussion to dozens of issues that may or may not affect a lot of people's lives, but generate considerable discussion, concern or amusement.\n\n\u2022Rep. Frank Artiles, R-Miami, wants to prohibit transgender people from using public restrooms \u2013 other than the ones designated the sex they were at birth.\n\n\u2022Rep. Michelle Rehwinkel Vasilinda, D-Tallahassee, is back with her annual bill to repeal capital punishment in Florida.\n\n\u2022Sen. Eleanor Sobel, D-Hollywood, proposed a \"domestic partners\" registry with county clerks of court signing up unmarried couples who live together. A federal judge recently declared Florida's ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, but Sobel's bill (SB 854) would apply to all couples.\n\n\u2022Sens. Garrett Richter, R-Naples, Dorothy Hukill, R-Port Orange, and Rep. Larry Metz, R-Groveland, have proposed bills to regulate use of remote-controlled flying drones.\n\n\u2022Sen. Jeff Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, wants to set statewide standards for insurance requirements and background checks for ride-sharing businesses like Uber and Lyft. Those companies have argued that they are technology firms, not taxi services, but established taxi and limo companies don't want them competing.\n\n\u2022Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, has a bill giving the state all regulation of those services. Brandes' bill would still allow cities some local regulation.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1AsH8Z5", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Here's a look at some of the major issues Florida legislators will debate in the 2015 session.", "og": {"site_name": "Pensacola News Journal", "description": "Here's a look at some of the major issues Florida legislators will debate in the 2015 session.", "title": "Guns, gambling, pot among 2015 legislative issues", "url": "http://www.pnj.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/01/guns-gambling-pot-prisons-among-hot-2015-legislative-issues/24225363/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/pnj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's a look at some of the major issues Florida legislators will debate in the 2015 session.", "title": "Guns, gambling, pot among 2015 legislative issues", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/47fbf4ed51976406f5c4294f0a401137e08c0b68/c=443-0-1788-1345&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Pensacola/2015/03/01/B9316429050Z.1_20150301153016_000_G67A2U12G.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=816200923", "fb": {"app_id": 179056438789435}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "major, legislative, bills, legislators, debate, 2015, session,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb804\"", "article_summary": "Handgun (Photo: Brand X Pictures)Here's a look at some of the major issues Florida legislators will debate in the 2015 session.\nGUNSThe shootings at FSU's Strozier Library last November triggered a new effort to repeal the ban on guns on campus.\nScott's fourth prisons chief in four years \u2013 has logged long hours before House and Senate committees, promising tough disciplinary reforms.\nThey argue that the mixture of impetuous youth, alcohol and guns would make a deadly combination on campus.\nIt was a constitutional amendment mandating about $1 billion a year in state spending for water and land acquisition."}
