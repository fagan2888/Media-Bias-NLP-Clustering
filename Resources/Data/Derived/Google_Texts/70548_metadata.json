He'll make $3 million annually with his base salary bumped up $100,000 each year.\n\nThis will be the 2nd head coaching stint for Muschamp who spent 4 years leading the Florida Gators putting together a record of 28-21. He led the Gators to a 10 win season in 2012 that included a trip to the Sugar Bowl. In addition to Auburn, he's also worked as a defensive coordinator at Texas and LSU.\n\nMuschamp would become the 34th head coach in South Carolina history. He'll succeed Steve Spurrier who resigned in October.\n\nThere are multiple reports that the new coach is already building his staff as well. Among the names being mentioned are Auburn secondary coach Travaris Robinson who would serve as defensive coordinator, Cleveland Browns assistant Kurt Roper who would serve as offensive coordinator and former Byrnes High School coach Bobby Bentley.\n\nThere's no word if Muschamp will keep Shawn Elliott on his staff. Elliott served as interim head coach after Spurrier left and finished the season going 1-5.\n\nThe Rome, Ga., native has coached in two national championship games (2003 and 2009), winning with LSU in 2003, and coached in a pair of BCS bowl games, following the 2008 and 2012 seasons. Muschamp has coached in the SEC Championship Game twice and once in the Big 12 Championship Game, winning all three. In addition, he was a finalist for the 2007 Broyles Award presented annually to the nation\u2019s top assistant coach.\n\n\n\nMuschamp most recently served as the defensive coordinator at Auburn University in 2015, his third stint as an SEC defensive coordinator. He also held that title with Auburn from 2006-07 and at LSU from 2002-04. In his six seasons as an SEC defensive coordinator, Muschamp\u2019s units ranked among the nation\u2019s Top-10 in total defense and in scoring defense five times.\n\n\n\nPrior to taking the reins at Florida, Muschamp served as the defensive coordinator at the University of Texas from 2008-10. Under his guidance, the Longhorn defense ranked No. 1 in the nation with 119 sacks, and ranked in the Top-10 nationally allowing 2.9 yards per rushing attempt (third), 96.7 rushing yards per game (fourth), and 297.4 yards per game (seventh), all Big 12 bests during that span. In 2009, the Longhorns played in the BCS National Championship Game. Under Muschamp\u2019s tutelage at Texas, Brian Orakpo won the 2008 Rotary Lombardi, Bronko Nagurski and Ted Hendricks awards. In the 2009 and 2010 NFL Drafts, Muschamp had a combined eight players drafted, seven in the first four rounds and two first-rounders, Orakpo and Earl Thomas.\n\n\n\nMuschamp served with the NFL\u2019s Miami Dolphins as Assistant Head Coach for Defense in 2005 under Nick Saban.\n\n\n\nMuschamp\u2019s first full-time coaching experience in the SEC came at LSU. He was the Tigers\u2019 linebacker coach for one season before being elevated to defensive coordinator from 2002-04. His 2003 defense helped the Tigers to the national championship by leading the nation both in scoring defense (11.0 points per game) and total defense (252.0 yards per game), while finishing second nationally in pass efficiency defense (89.8) and third in rushing defense (67.0 yards per game).\n\n\n\nIn four of his nine seasons as an FBS defensive coordinator, his teams have allowed less than 100 rushing yards per game and twice led the nation in rushing defense. His 2003 LSU defense led the country by allowing 67 yards per game on the ground, the best mark by an SEC team in the 2000s, while Texas gave up just 73.1 yards on the ground in 2009 to pace the nation.\n\n\n\nThe 1994 Georgia graduate moved immediately into coaching, working as a graduate assistant at Auburn from 1995-96, earning his master\u2019s degree in 1996. He became a secondary coach at West Georgia (1998) and Eastern Kentucky (1999) before moving on to his first defensive coordinator position at Valdosta State for the 2000 season, where he helped the Blazers to a 10-2 record and the Gulf South championship.\n\n\n\nDuring his playing career at Georgia, Muschamp earned his way from walk-on to scholarship player by the spring of his redshirt freshman season and eventually was named co-captain his senior season. He also earned a spot on the SEC Academic Honor Roll in 1993.\n\n\n\nBorn August 3, 1971, Muschamp and his wife, the former Carol Davis, have two sons, Jackson and Whit.\n\n\n\nMUSCHAMP\u2019S COACHING TIMELINE:\n\n1995-96 Auburn (Graduate Assistant)\n\n1998 West Georgia (Defensive Backs)\n\n1999 Eastern Kentucky (Defensive Backs)\n\n2000 Valdosta State (Defensive Coordinator/Defensive Backs)\n\n2001 LSU (Defensive Backs)\n\n2002-04 LSU (Defensive Coordinator/Defensive Backs)\n\n2005 Miami Dolphins (Assistant Head Coach)\n\n2006-07 Auburn (Defensive Coordinator/Linebackers)\n\n2008-10 Texas (Defensive Coordinator/Linebackers)\n\n2011-14 Florida (Head Coach)\n\n2015 Auburn (Defensive Coordinator)\n\n\n\nMUSCHAMP\u2019S HEAD COACHING RECORD\n\n2011 Florida: 7-6, 3-5 SEC; Gator Bowl\n\n2012 Florida: 11-2, 7-1 SEC; Sugar Bowl\n\n2013 Florida: 4-8, 3-5 SEC\n\n2014 Florida: 6-5, 4-4 SEC; Birmingham Bowl*\n\n\n\n*Did not coach", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Official announcement could come Monday", "author": "Kevin Bilodeau", "og": {"url": "http://www.live5news.com/story/30678332/report-south-carolina-to-hire-will-muschamp", "image": "http://wcsc.images.worldnow.com/images/9401142_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Official announcement could come Monday", "title": "South Carolina hires Will Muschamp as Head Football Coach"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 16813752, "title": "South Carolina hires Will Muschamp as Head Football Coach", "image": "http://wcsc.images.worldnow.com/images/9401142_G.jpg", "creator": "@Live5News", "site": "@Live5News", "card": "summary", "description": "Official announcement could come Monday"}, "wnreadableurl": "report-south-carolina-to-hire-will-muschamp", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "WCSC", "fb": {"admins": 644426401, "app_id": 739226082784217}, "date": "2015/12/06", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/live5news"}, "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS31"}, "article_summary": "Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp is the new head coach at South Carolina the school confirmed in a tweet from the football teams official account.\nMuschamp would become the 34th head coach in South Carolina history.\nMuschamp most recently served as the defensive coordinator at Auburn University in 2015, his third stint as an SEC defensive coordinator.\nElliott served as interim head coach after Spurrier left and finished the season going 1-5.\nMuschamp served with the NFL\u2019s Miami Dolphins as Assistant Head Coach for Defense in 2005 under Nick Saban."}
