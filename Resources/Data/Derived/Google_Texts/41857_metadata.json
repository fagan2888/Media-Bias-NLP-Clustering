So have six of her colleagues\u2019 hard drives. A U.S. House committee is investigating.\n\nHard drive shenanigans aren\u2019t just a federal issue.\n\nA Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office internal affairs audit has revealed information on outgoing Sheriff Al Lamberti\u2019s hard drive was lost after his subordinates destroyed it with a hammer. The audit was first reported by the Sun-Sentinel newspaper.\n\nNo motive was given in the report, but public information could have been destroyed. Investigators can\u2019t be sure, but complete backup copies of Lamberti\u2019s hard drive were not located.\n\nThe incident occurred sometime after Lamberti lost his re-election bid to rival Scott Israel in late 2012 and before Israel replaced him. The Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office has 5,800 employees and a $700 million annual budget.\n\nThe report says Lamberti\u2019s executive officer, Sgt. Donald Pritchard, told an employee from Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office technology division, Anthony Petruzzi, to destroy the hard drive, which was said to have contained emails, calendar events and other saved items. Petruzzi had been seen by other Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office employees with Lamberti\u2019s blue Dell computer tower, and he reportedly told a sheriff\u2019s office tech analyst he was supposed to erase it.\n\nIt\u2019s a violation of Florida\u2019s government-transparency laws to destroy public records. State law also requires public officials to deliver records to \u201csuccessor(s) at the expiration of his or her term in office.\u201d\n\nAccording to the First Amendment Foundation, \u201cthe definition for public records is quite broad and includes all materials made or received by an agency in connection with official business.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt this point, all you can do is speculate what was there,\u201d attorney Chris Torres of the Tallahassee-based Casey Torres law firm said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t prove something is missing if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s missing,\u201d said Torres, a former prosecutor with the Florida Office of the Attorney General.\n\nRead More on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The way it\u2019s going, government hard drives might be the next protected class under federal law.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The way it\u2019s going, government hard drives might be the next protected class under federal law.", "title": "IRS Isn't the Only Government Agency to Destroy a Hard Drive", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140709_HardDrives_Watchdog.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1omrXek"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The way it\u2019s going, government hard drives might be the next protected class under federal law.", "title": "IRS Isn't the Only Government Agency to Destroy a Hard Drive", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140709_HardDrives_Watchdog.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach", "published_time": "2014-07-10T09:58:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "IRS, Louis Learner Emails, IRS hard drives, U.S. House oversight committee, Sheriff Al Lamberti, Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc93b\"", "article_summary": "Investigators can\u2019t be sure, but complete backup copies of Lamberti\u2019s hard drive were not located.\nTALLAHASSEE\u2014The way it\u2019s going, government hard drives might be the next protected class under federal law.\nHard drive shenanigans aren\u2019t just a federal issue.\nDonald Pritchard, told an employee from Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office technology division, Anthony Petruzzi, to destroy the hard drive, which was said to have contained emails, calendar events and other saved items.\nA Broward County Sheriff\u2019s Office internal affairs audit has revealed information on outgoing Sheriff Al Lamberti\u2019s hard drive was lost after his subordinates destroyed it with a hammer."}
