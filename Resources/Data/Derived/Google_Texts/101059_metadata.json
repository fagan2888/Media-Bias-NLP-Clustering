But the benefit level has fallen to the point that recipients only get about $1.40 per person per meal, even though food stamps often constitute the entirety of a family\u2019s food budget. Doctors and researchers say that additional cuts on the horizon could increase the incidence of medical problems stemming in part from food insecurity, particularly diabetes and its related conditions.\n\nFor instance, a 2013 study by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts estimated that House Republican proposals to slash food stamps would increase national health costs for diabetes treatment by $15 billion over a decade. Those costs would disproportionately affect Medicaid, since the public insurance program for the poor \u2014 who are considerably more likely to have type 2 diabetes \u2014 covers an outsize portion of diabetes spending.\n\nA separate study published this week in the journal Health Affairs illustrates the effect that food insecurity can have on poor Americans\u2019 health in concrete terms. Researchers found that the number of poor Americans being admitted to the hospital because of hypoglycemia \u2014 a sharp drop in blood sugar that can be a complication for people with type 2 diabetes \u2014 rose by 27 percent in the last week of a month as compared to the first week, since these low-income individuals began to run out of money to spend on food. Wealthier Americans did not experience an analogous spike.\n\n\u201cThese findings suggest that exhaustion of food budgets might be an important driver of health inequities,\u201d concluded the study authors.\n\nThe food stamp cuts could be particularly harmful for low-income diabetics who live in red states refusing Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. Researchers from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) found that uninsured Americans with diabetes are significantly less likely to have a regular source of medical care, to have had a check-up in the past two years, to have access to urgent medical care, and pay almost ten times more out-of-pocket to treat their diabetes than diabetics with Medicaid coverage.\n\nMany of the Republican-led states rejecting the Medicaid expansion have some of the highest rates of diabetes in the country \u2014 and the coming SNAP cuts could mean more of them ending up in the hospital without the means to pay for their treatment.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Although slashing nutritional assistance might yield short-term budgetary savings, doctors warn that will come at the expense of higher health care costs in the future.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Although slashing nutritional assistance might yield short-term budgetary savings, doctors warn that will come at the expense of higher health care costs in the future.", "title": "Doctors Slam Proposed Food Stamp Cuts: \u2018The Dumbest Thing You Can Do Is Cut Nutrition\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/10/3145641/doctors-slam-proposed-food-stamp-cuts/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_child-hunger-hungry-e1389371400761.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although slashing nutritional assistance might yield short-term budgetary savings, doctors warn that will come at the expense of higher health care costs in the future.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_child-hunger-hungry-321x214.jpg", "title": "Doctors Slam Proposed Food Stamp Cuts: \u2018The Dumbest Thing You Can Do Is Cut Nutrition\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_child-hunger-hungry-e1389371400761.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/shutterstock_child-hunger-hungry-e1389371400761.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-10T11:45:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1893\"", "article_summary": "Health Doctors Slam Proposed Food Stamp Cuts: \u2018The Dumbest Thing You Can Do Is Cut Nutrition\u2019 CREDIT: ShutterstockDoctors have a message for congressional lawmakers inching toward a compromise farm bill that would cut food stamps by nine billion dollars: It\u2019s a terrible idea.\nBut the benefit level has fallen to the point that recipients only get about $1.40 per person per meal, even though food stamps often constitute the entirety of a family\u2019s food budget.\nThe food stamp cuts could be particularly harmful for low-income diabetics who live in red states refusing Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\nA separate study published this week in the journal Health Affairs illustrates the effect that food insecurity can have on poor Americans\u2019 health in concrete terms.\n\u201cThese findings suggest that exhaustion of food budgets might be an important driver of health inequities,\u201d concluded the study authors."}
