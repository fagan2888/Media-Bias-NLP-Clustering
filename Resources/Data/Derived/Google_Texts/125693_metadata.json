He had enrolled in the plan through the New York State of Health, the state exchange for purchasing coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nEnrollees need to look at which hospitals are in-network with which plans. Mt Sinai Hospital is out-of-network for Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield on the New York State health exchange. (Fred Mogul//WNYC)\n\n\u201cIt said I was enrolled, so I thought I was enrolled, but I kept waiting and waiting and waiting for my insurance card or to hear something from the company,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople have been complaining for months \u2014 on Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere \u2014 about New York\u2019s state insurance exchange. The problems have been similar to those nationwide: crashing web pages, long wait times on phone lines, customer service representatives who promise to help and then don\u2019t deliver.\n\nBut in recent weeks, most companies in New York appear to be processing enrollments more smoothly, and now complaints are centered almost exclusively on Empire Blue Cross.\n\nIn an email, an Empire Blue Cross spokeswoman said the complaints could be due to an \u201coverwhelming and unanticipated\u201d number of applications, and that the high number of them in New York was because Empire is the state\u2019s biggest player. Neither Empire nor state officials would discuss the underlying technical problems \u2014 or disclose how many people have been affected. Donna Frescatore is the head of the New York State of Health marketplace.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a ballpark number, but I certainly think it\u2019s enough. We\u2019ve heard it enough times to know that it needs immediate action,\u201d Frescatore said, while also acknowledging the problems date back at least to November.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "New York Consumers Frustrated By Insurance Delays", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "New York Consumers Frustrated By Insurance Delays", "title": "New York Consumers Frustrated By Insurance Delays", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/ny/20140114/new-york-consumers-frustrated-by-insurance-delays", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "New York Consumers Frustrated By Insurance Delays", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42d6\"", "article_summary": "Mt Sinai Hospital is out-of-network for Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield on the New York State health exchange.\nPeople have been complaining for months \u2014 on Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere \u2014 about New York\u2019s state insurance exchange.\nHe had enrolled in the plan through the New York State of Health, the state exchange for purchasing coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nto give me some liquids.\u201dBut then he remembered he hadn\u2019t received his insurance card from Empire Blue Cross.\nDonna Frescatore is the head of the New York State of Health marketplace."}
