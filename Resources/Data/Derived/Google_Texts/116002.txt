President Obama firmly believes the United States is better off now than when he took office, even though the American people cannot “feel” it.

During an interview with 60 Minutes’ Steve Kroft, Obama said, “the country is definitely better off than when I came into office.”

“When I came into office, our economy was in crisis,” Obama said.

The president then cited lower unemployment, private sector job growth, and deficit cuts as evidence of his administration’s success. “I can put my record against any leader around the world in terms of digging ourselves out of a terrible, almost unprecedented financial crisis,” Obama said.

When asked if the president thought the American people could feel that economic success, Obama said, “They don’t feel it.”

“The reason they don’t feel it is because incomes and wages are not going up,” he said. Obama suggested raising the minimum wage, rebuilding infrastructure, and investing in American business to continue strengthening the economy.
