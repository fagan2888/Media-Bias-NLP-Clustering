The department's funding has jumped more than 40 percent to about $140 billion this year, compared with fiscal 2009, a boost to help the agency cope with a surge of new veterans returning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n4608381\n\nA new report released by the VA Office of Inspector General Wednesday details a misappropriation of $43.1 million by Veterans Affairs officials.\n\nThe $43.1 million was originally appropriated to the VA Supply Fund in 2011 as part of the Medical Support and Compliance Fund. The Chief Business Office (CBO) than through a series of transactions \u201cparked\u201d the funds at the U.S Government Printing Office (GPO).\n\nThe OIG report states that, \u201c\u2018Parking\u2019 refers to the transfer of funds to a revolving fund through an intra-agency agreement in an attempt to keep the funds available for new work after the period of availability for the funds expires.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of the funds though, $35.2 million, remains unused in the GPO as of July 2014.\n\nThe original $43.1 million was appropriated to the VA Supply Fund by the CBO, was for the use of \u201ctailored handbooks.\u201d These handbooks were supposed to provide veterans with information about VA benefits, though they were never made. In fact, \u201cThe authorizations did not specify the quantity of handbooks to be produced or the dates for delivery.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, \u201cthe tailored handbook account VA maintained at GPO appeared to be fully funded. There was a surplus of funds to cover the costs of the handbooks on veterans\u2019 health care benefits. The handbook account in October 2011 had a balance of over $20.1 million. During the period from November 2011 through July 2014, the account had a net increase of approximately $6.7 million resulting in a balance of approximately $26.8 million.\u201d\n\nOf the $43.1 million, $5.6 million was billed to the Supply Fund as service fees. No services were rendered by the Supply Fund.\n\nThe remaining funds were,\u201dwere deposited in an unrelated account designated for enrollment communications at GPO.\u201d\n\nThe CBO officials at the VA were able to use the funds \u201cparked\u201d at the GPO \u201cat their discretion with no designated purpose.\u201d\n\nThe other $2.3 million spent was not consistent with the intended need of it. \u201cOver a 34-month period from October 2011 through July 2014, CBO only expended approximately $2.3 million of these funds in the enrollment communications account to purchase various materials such as pamphlets, business cards, and Affordable Care Act mailings,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe OIG report does not state any specific consequences for the officials involved.\n\n\u201cWe recommended VA confer with the Office of Human Resources and the VA Office of General Counsel to determine the appropriate administrative action to take, if any, against management for directing the misuse of approximately $43.1 million of FY 2011 appropriated funds.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pfeiffer", "description": "'The CBO officials at the VA were able to use the funds \"parked\" at the GPO,\"at their discretion with no designated purpose'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A new report released by the VA Office of Inspector General Wednesday details a misappropriation of $43.1 million by Veterans Affairs officials.
