The visuals on the screen cut between a woman running with a sledgehammer, police in riot gear giving chase and lines of people marching in unison under a giant video screen of Big Brother praising a \u201cUnification of Thoughts.\u201d\n\nBefore she can be stopped, the runner reaches the screen, spins several times, then hurls her sledge at Big Brother\u2019s face, shattering the image. Then came the voiceover:\n\n\u201cOn January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you\u2019ll see why 1984 won\u2019t be like \u201c1984.\u201d\n\nStanding 14 inches tall and equipped with a 9 inch monitor, an accompanying keyboard and mouse, and a 3.5 inch floppy disk drive, the first Macintosh made its debut on Jan. 24, 1984. The \u201cMac,\u201d as it came to be known, touted itself as an alternative to then-industry juggernaut IBM \u2014 offering a user-friendly interface and a \u201cmodest price\u201d of $2,495.\n\nSteve Jobs, introduced the computer as what he called \u201cthe third industry milestone product,\u201d pumped up the \u201chigh definition, super crisp, bitmap 9-inch black and white screen\u201d saying that people would \u201chave to see this display to believe it. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Times tech reviewer Larry Magid wrote about his first experience turning on the new Mac in the Jan. 29, 1984 edition of the paper:\n\nOnce you\u2019ve set up your machine, you insert the main system disk, turn on the power, and in a minute you are presented with the introductory screen. Apple calls it your \u201cdesk top\u201d. What you see on your screen looks a lot like what you might find on a desk. Instead of just a blinking cursor you see pictures, called icons, that graphically represent the things you can do with the computer. One of them is a picture of a hand, writing on a piece of paper. That represents the MacWrite word processing program. Another shows a hand drawing on paper to represent the MacPaint graphics program. Other options are represented by equally clever icons. Any files that you have created are also graphically depicted on your electronic \u201cdesk top.\u201d\n\nThe Mac, while not outselling IBM, would go on to sell 70,000 units by May 3, 1984. Its successor, the Macintosh 512K, was released in September of that year, followed by a continuing line of new Macs throughout the years, from iMacs to Macbooks to the most recent Mac Pro, due for release in February.", "article_metadata": {"description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNy-7jv0XSc An advertisement, directed by Ridley Scott, aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVII on Jan. 22, 1984.", "pubdate": 20140124, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNy-7jv0XSc An advertisement, directed by Ridley Scott, aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVII on Jan. 22, 1984.", "title": "The Apple Macintosh turns 30", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mac.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-apple-macintosh-turns-30/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNy-7jv0XSc An advertisement, directed by Ridley Scott, aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVII on Jan. 22, 1984.", "title": "The Apple Macintosh turns 30", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Mac.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "technology"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "apple, technology"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ce4\"", "article_summary": "Then came the voiceover:\u201cOn January 24, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh.\nAn advertisement, directed by Ridley Scott, aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVII on Jan. 22, 1984.\nInstead of just a blinking cursor you see pictures, called icons, that graphically represent the things you can do with the computer.\nWhat you see on your screen looks a lot like what you might find on a desk.\nApple calls it your \u201cdesk top\u201d."}
