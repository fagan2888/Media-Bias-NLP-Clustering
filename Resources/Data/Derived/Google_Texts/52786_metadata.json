Her recent promotion is part of efforts by the local police to increase the number of women in the force and in positions of authority. Shortly after she assumed her new job the city appointed a second woman to head another police station.\n\nIn a country where women have traditionally not worked outside the home and face widespread discrimination, the appointments represent a significant step for women\u2019s empowerment.\n\n\u201cThe mindset of people is changing gradually, and now they (have) started to consider women in leading roles. My husband opposed my decision to join the police force 20 years ago,\u201d said the 44-year-old mother of four. But by the time this job rolled around, he had come full circle and encouraged her to go for it. \u201cIt was a big challenge. I was a little bit hesitant to accept it.\u201d\n\nThe station house is in Clifton, a posh area home to the elite of this sprawling metropolis of more than 18 million people. But in a city prone to family feuds, political unrest and jihadist violence \u2014 where 166 officers were killed in the line of duty last year \u2014 it\u2019s by no means an easy assignment. Crimes ranging from petty theft and muggings to terrorism or murder are all part of a day\u2019s work, Ghazala says.\n\nRunning a station is a high-profile job in the Pakistani police, one that requires the officer to constantly interact with the public and fellow officers. It\u2019s also a key path to advancement. Senior police officer Abdul Khaliq Sheikh, said he and others in the top brass hope Ghazala\u2019s appointment leads to more women joining the force.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Woman heads police post in largest Pakistan city", "title": "Woman heads police post in largest Pakistan city", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Woman heads police post in largest Pakistan city", "title": "Woman heads police post in largest Pakistan city", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/15/woman_heads_police_post_in_largest_pakistan_city/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/pakistan-female-cops.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Woman heads police post in largest Pakistan city", "title": "Woman heads police post in largest Pakistan city", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/pakistan-female-cops.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Adil Jawad", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Shortly after she assumed her new job the city appointed a second woman to head another police station.\nSenior police officer Abdul Khaliq Sheikh, said he and others in the top brass hope Ghazala\u2019s appointment leads to more women joining the force.\nBut by the time this job rolled around, he had come full circle and encouraged her to go for it.\nCrimes ranging from petty theft and muggings to terrorism or murder are all part of a day\u2019s work, Ghazala says.\nHer recent promotion is part of efforts by the local police to increase the number of women in the force and in positions of authority."}
