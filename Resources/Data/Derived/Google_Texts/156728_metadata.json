Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) announces the kickoff of his \"Standing Up for Tennessee\" bus tour on July 25 at Sullivan's Restaurant in his hometown of Maryville, alongside his wife, Honey, and state Rep. Art Swann (R). (Tom Sherlin/AP)\n\nOn the first day of July, Sen. Lamar Alexander delivered a moving eulogy at the funeral of his political mentor, Howard H. Baker Jr., the former Senate majority leader and godfather of the Tennessee Republican Party.\n\nBaker, he said, had \u201cmore influence on my life than anyone outside my own family.\u201d\n\nLike Baker, Alexander (R-Tenn.) has had an exemplary career in public service. He was elected to two terms as governor of Tennessee and later served as president of the University of Tennessee and U.S. education secretary. Twice he sought his party\u2019s nomination for president, though, like Baker, he was unsuccessful. In 2002, he won election to the Senate.\n\nThroughout his career, Alexander has embodied Baker\u2019s style of consensus-building politics \u2014 and largely for that reason he is now, at 74, facing tea party opposition in the Aug. 7 Republican primary. But the tea party activists are competing against more than just one sitting senator and a Republican establishment lined up behind him. They are running against Baker\u2019s legacy \u2014 a culture of Republican politics that has married conservative principles with pragmatic attitudes about governing.\n\nFor half a century, Tennessee voters have elected a succession of Republicans to statewide office who are more problem-solvers than ideologues, consensus-seekers rather than rabble-rousers. The current trio \u2014 Alexander, Sen. Bob Corker and Gov. Bill Haslam \u2014 all embody in one way or another the Baker tradition.\n\nView Graphic Election Lab: See our current forecast for every congressional race in 2014\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want big government, but they do want government to work,\u201d said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\nChip Saltsman, a GOP strategist and former Tennessee Republican Party chairman, said of the three, \u201cThere\u2019s not a hard edge to them.\u201d\n\nAlexander\u2019s chief opponent in a crowded field is believed to be state Rep. Joe Carr, who has the support of many tea party groups in Tennessee and radio talk-show host Laura Ingraham, whose advocacy for Dave Brat is credited with helping the conservative Virginia college professor defeat House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a June primary.\n\nCarr, in a telephone interview, said Alexander is insufficiently conservative, wrong for having supported an overhaul of immigration law and far too willing to work with Democrats and even President Obama. He called Baker a \u201cgreat statesman\u201d but said this of Baker and Alexander\u2019s style of politics: \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s suited to the times we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAlexander believes Baker\u2019s approach is as vital today as ever. Every Republican in the Senate, he said, is a conservative. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying, \u2018Who\u2019s the skinniest offensive tackle?\u2019 They\u2019re all over 300 pounds, so what\u2019s the difference?\u201d\n\nHe argued that governing a complex country in difficult times requires developing relationships and finding consensus across party lines. The real conflict inside the Republican Party is not conservatives vs. moderates, he said, but rather \u201cbetween conservatives who think their job is finished when they make a speech and conservatives who want to govern.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to fix the debt, you have to introduce a bill and pass it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to change Obamacare, you have to introduce a bill and get 60 votes in the Senate and persuade this president to sign it, or the next president.\u201d\n\nTea party and grass-roots activists have mounted a series of challenges to Republican senators this year. So far they have lost every one. The closest they came was in neighboring Mississippi, where state Sen. Chris McDaniel almost defeated Sen. Thad Cochran, ultimately losing in a contentious runoff.\n\nCarr hopes lightning will strike in Tennessee, as it did for Brat in Virginia. The current betting is that Alexander will survive his primary. If he does, it will be a tribute not only to the attention he has paid to his home base over many years but also to the particular brand of Republican politics that Tennesseans have prized since Baker was first elected.\n\nTennessee pride\n\nOver many years, Tennessee has produced a striking number of senators from both parties who have achieved national prominence. Many ran for the presidency or were considered presidential material \u2014 Democratic senators such as Al Gore (and before him Estes Kefauver and Albert Gore Sr.) and Republicans such as Fred Thompson and Bill Frist, who rose to majority leader (and, before them, Bill Brock). Past governors have been cut from the same cloth \u2014 Republican Don Sundquist and Democrats Ned McWherter and Phil Bredesen.\n\n\u201cWhat there is [in Tennessee] is a tradition of electing honorable, capable, thoughtful leaders,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who is working for Alexander and Haslam this year. \u201cIt happens in Tennessee in a way that it hasn\u2019t in almost any other state, and it\u2019s been going on for decades.\u201d\n\n(Not every politician has been so honorable. Alexander was sworn in as governor three days early in January 1979, with the help of Democrats, in order to force out the corrupt sitting governor, Democrat Ray Blanton, who was selling pardons.)\n\nCorker, a former mayor of Chattanooga who is in the middle of his second term as senator, said Tennessee voters \u201cexpect their leaders to solve problems\u201d and to be engaged on big issues, no matter which party they are from. \u201cMinus me, we\u2019ve had senators who\u2019ve played a big role in the big issues of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cTennesseans have come to expect that and to value that. That puts us in a different place.\u201d\n\nHaslam, who was mayor of Knoxville before being elected governor in 2010, got a start in politics as an intern in Baker\u2019s Senate office. One of his jobs was to reply to constituents about Baker\u2019s support for the Panama Canal Treaty. The letters, he recalled, ran 100-1 against the treaty. \u201cI was sitting there thinking, \u2018Why in the world is our guy for this?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cIt was actually a great lesson. . . . He honestly thought it was the best thing for the country.\u201d\n\nTennessee has always been a conservative state, and like others in the South it has made the transition from Democratic to Republican dominance. Haslam is the first Republican governor to serve with a Republican-led legislature. But he said voters have had a history of backing problem-solvers for statewide office. \u201cThere\u2019s a practical streak to Tennesseans, and there always has been,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people look and say this style of leadership worked.\u201d\n\nBill Purcell, the Democratic former mayor of Nashville, said, \u201cIn general, it\u2019s been a state that sits in the middle \u2014 in the middle of the South, in the middle of the battles that raged around it \u2014 and tended to think the high middle ground was the place to be.\u201d\n\nAlexander, Corker and Haslam all come from East Tennessee. Carr\u2019s base is around Nashville, in the collar counties where social conservatives have more influence and where the tea party has taken root \u2014 the same kind of counties that gave Cantor such trouble around Richmond. It probably is the region where Alexander\u2019s vote count will be lowest.\n\n\u201cYou probably have more people who would officially identify with the tea party in the collars and who certainly are sympathetic with the emotions than in any other pocket in Tennessee,\u201d said Tom Ingram, who covered Baker\u2019s 1966 campaign as a young reporter for the Nashville Tennessean and has long been Alexander\u2019s top political strategist.\n\n\u2018Practical people\u2019\n\nThere are signs that Tennessee Republicanism, like its cousins elsewhere, is changing. Tennessee\u2019s U.S. House delegation includes several members who are more conservative and less given to compromise than the statewide elected officials. In Nashville, Haslam has sparred with the most conservative faction in the legislature, particularly over Common Core educational standards, but he remains widely popular with voters.\n\nWhat all this portends for the future of Tennessee politics is an open question. Haslam said he believes the tradition established by Baker will endure.\n\n\u201cTennesseans are very practical people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s a very practical . . . state in the way the electorate votes. Number two, it doesn\u2019t hurt to have a road map. People can say: \u2018This is how Bob Corker won a race. This is how Bill Haslam won a race.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRoy Neel, who served as Al Gore\u2019s chief of staff through a series of posts, said there is survey research that suggests tea party legislators are to the right of the Tennessee electorate. He also said the tea party has yet to find the kind of candidate who has prospered in other states.\n\n\u201cUntil we see our version of Ted Cruz challenging statewide, we won\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nNeither Carr nor others challenging Alexander have gained the kind of following that Cruz did in Texas in his 2012 Senate campaign.\n\nCarr, who was joined at a rally last week by Ingraham, has a lengthy bill of particulars against Alexander, but the biggest complaint is the incumbent\u2019s support for the bipartisan immigration bill the Senate approved a year ago \u2014 \u201chis voting for amnesty,\u201d as Carr put it. With the immigration issue flaring amid an influx of children to the U.S.-Mexico border, Alexander is under heavy attack for that vote.\n\nAlexander said he has no regrets about his vote, although he said he would prefer a step-by-step approach. A comprehensive immigration overhaul was \u201cthe only option we had\u201d in the Senate. But he added: \u201cI don\u2019t hear much about immigration in Tennessee. I have more people coming up and thanking me for the vote than I do opposing me for it.\u201d\n\nIn his campaign ads, Alexander\u2019s appeal is pitched directly at the GOP base. His first ad featured footage of him confronting Obama on health care, an easy target in Tennessee. His second talks about his opposition to a \u201cnational school board.\u201d\n\nThe education ad mentions that he worked with President Ronald Reagan to keep Washington\u2019s hands off local schools. It does not mention his tenure at the Education Department or the fact that when asked whether he was on the same page as Haslam, a supporter of Common Core standards, he said he was.\n\nHe will spend the final days of the primary campaign on a 40-stop bus tour of the state.\n\n\u201cPeople who get in trouble in electoral politics usually take someone for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cI think every time you run for election you start from the bottom and work your way back up again. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201d\n\nAlexander said he welcomes tea party supporters into the GOP, \u201cjust as we welcomed the Reagan voters, the Goldwater voters, the Moral Majority and the Perot voters.\u201d But he remains fixed on what Baker taught him.\n\nAsked what he thought about the tea party challenges to Senate incumbents this year, he replied: \u201cI think what\u2019s good about the Republican primary process so far is that we\u2019ve nominated incumbents and new nominees who are capable of appealing to independent voters and capable of governing. We won\u2019t win the majority unless we do that. And if we do win the majority and we don\u2019t show the country that we\u2019re capable of governing, as well as making speeches, why, then, the country won\u2019t trust us with the presidency.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
