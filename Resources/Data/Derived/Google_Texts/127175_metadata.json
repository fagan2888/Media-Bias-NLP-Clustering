The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\u2019s complicated.\n\nMarco Rubio: Reality Check: Rubio on Trump\u2019s diminutive digits\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long into Thursday night\u2019s GOP presidential debate in Detroit that the size of Donald Trump\u2019s hands came under the microscope.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio was asked, after long denouncing the use of personal attacks in the campaign, why he recently changed tactics and chose to make more personal attacks on Trump. Moderator Chris Wallace noted that in recent days, Rubio made very personal attacks, including a jab he made at the size of Trump\u2019s hands during a campaign rally in Virginia on Sunday.\n\nRubio responded to Wallace, saying the focus should be on \u201cthe issues that matter to this country.\u201d But Trump wanted to talk about Rubio\u2019s hand slur: \u201cNobody has ever hit my hands. I have never heard of this,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLook at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands if they are small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there is no problem. I guarantee you.\u201d\n\nTrump seemed to think Rubio\u2019s hand slur was a lightly veiled insult to Trump\u2019s manhood.\n\nSo what did Rubio actually say?\n\nRubio told the Virginia rally: \u201cHe\u2019s always calling me Little Marco. And I\u2019ll admit he\u2019s taller than me, he\u2019s like 6\u2032 2\u2033, which is why I don\u2019t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5\u2032 2\u2033. Have you seen his hands? They\u2019re like this. And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can\u2019t trust them.\u201d\n\nWhile Rubio\u2019s comment wasn\u2019t an explicit reference to Trump\u2019s masculine endowment, it does appear Rubio\u2019s jab at Trump was aimed, well, below the belt.\n\nVerdict: True.\n\nDonald Trump: Reality Check: Trump on Rubio\u2019s worst Senate absentee record\n\nTrump brought up Rubio\u2019s truancy record in the Senate a couple times.\n\n\u201cThis guy has a number one, the number one absentee record in the United States Senate,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe later added, \u201cThe real con artist is Sen. Marco Rubio, who was elected in Florida and who has the worst voting record in the United States Senate. He doesn\u2019t go to vote. He\u2019s absent.\u201d\n\nRubio has missed 224 of 1,512 roll call votes, or 15%, since he has been in the U.S. Senate, according to GovTrack, a leading government transparency website. Compared with a median of 1.7% of missed roll call votes from the lifetime records of current senators, Rubio\u2019s percentage is quite high. Rubio also had the worst voting attendance record of any senator for 2015.\n\nRubio has defended his absences, citing the presidential campaign and saying that voting is only one part of a job that also requires constituent services. His office has previously stated that Rubio is one of the few senators with young children who do not live in Washington, and he spends as much time in Florida with them as possible.\n\nHowever, GovTrack also analyzed how presidential campaigns affect candidates\u2019 voting records and found that Rubio\u2019s missed votes were still the most of current and former senator presidential candidates from the 2016 election cycle \u2014 higher than Sen. Ted Cruz. But it was lower than the missed votes from the 2008 election candidates; both President (and former Sen.) Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain had worse voting attendance records during a comparable time frame.\n\nThe most no-show senator of all time was Sen. Maryon Allen, who served for five months in 1978 after her husband died in office. She missed 43.5% of the roll call votes during that time.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t specify a time frame for his claim, but because Rubio had the No. 1 absentee record last year, we rate Trump\u2019s claim as true.\n\nReality Check: Trump on spending cuts\n\nTrump has said the country can afford his tax cuts, which will add trillions to the nation\u2019s deficit, because he will cut waste, fraud and abuse. Asked on Thursday for specifics, he cited cutting down the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as squeezing better discounts out of drug companies.\n\n\u201cDepartment of Education. We\u2019re cutting Common Core. We\u2019re getting rid of Common Core. We\u2019re bringing education locally. Department of Environmental Protection. We are going to get rid of it in almost every form \u2026 Because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCNNMoney looked at this in January. It found that even if Trump cut the EPA and Education Department entirely, it would save less than 3% of the $3.7 trillion the federal government spent in the past year. The nation spent $90 billion on education and $7 billion on the EPA.\n\nAs for saving hundreds of billions from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies, that would be hard to do since Medicare is estimated to have spent $77 billion on drugs in 2015, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Total spending on drugs, which includes outlays by private insurers, was just under $300 billion in total in 2014, federal National Health Expenditures data.\n\nCan Trump make up for his tax cuts by cutting two federal agencies and negotiating with drug companies? Our verdict: false.\n\nReality Check: Trump on 9/11 hijackers\u2019 wives\n\nTrump was asked whether he still supported targeting the family of terrorists as part of a U.S. counterterrorism strategy. Trump reaffirmed his stance and referenced the families of the terrorists who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks, claiming they had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and saying that this knowledge justified including the families of terrorists on a list of targets.\n\nTrump said: \u201cThe wife knew exactly what was happening. They left two days early with respect to the World Trade Center and they went back to where they went and they watched their husband on television flying into the World Trade Center, flying into the Pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the White House, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane. All right? I have no problem with it.\u201d\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report, the most exhaustive report on the attacks and the 19 hijackers, does not show any evidence to support this claim.\n\nAccording to the report, only two of the hijackers were married, and there is no evidence that either of the wives of the two hijackers had ever traveled to the United States, much less left the U.S. two days before the attacks.\n\n\u201cNone of the 9/11 terrorists could have \u2018sent their wives home\u2019 before the attacks because, as you suggest, none of them brought female companions to the United States,\u201d Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission, told The Washington Post in December.\n\nOne of the hijackers did have a German girlfriend that had visited him in the United States, but her last visit to America was months before the attacks.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission contains no evidence that supports Trump\u2019s claim.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nTed Cruz: Reality Check: Cruz beat Trump five times\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz claimed he has beaten Trump five times during the primaries.\n\nDuring a plea to voters who think \u201cnominating Donald Trump would be a disaster,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cWe have demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat Donald and if you don\u2019t want him to be the nominee, then I ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the Constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.\u201d\n\nA quick look at results in the states that have held primaries or caucuses shows Cruz\u2019s record as having only won four states so far: Iowa, Texas, Oklahoma and Alaska.\n\nBut Cruz said \u201cfive separate times we have beat Donald.\u201d The key word being \u201cbeat\u201d\u2026 so in what states did Cruz do better than Trump?\n\nMinnesota, where Rubio took the most votes. But Cruz came in second ahead of Trump\u2019s third-place finish.\n\nOur verdict on Cruz\u2019s claim he has \u201cbeat Donald\u201d five separate times is true.\n\nReality Check: Cruz on Obamacare as a job-killer\n\nAsked how he would bring back manufacturing jobs to Detroit, Cruz said he would lift regulations. And his No. 1 target is Obamacare.\n\n\u201cAs president, I will repeal Obamacare, the biggest job-killer in America,\u201d he said.\n\nIn fact, Obamacare is not a job-killer, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September.\n\nThe report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn\u2019t qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. Kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.\n\nAn ADP Research Institute study had similar findings. One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers\u2019 hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.\n\nAs to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it\u2019s nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nReality Check: Cruz on Trump hiring immigrants\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s most frequent claims on the campaign trail is that he will do the most for American workers, in part because he has a long record of creating jobs and employing \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of people. On Thursday night, Cruz sought to weaken this claim, saying that many of those who were hired were brought in from overseas, including at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club resort: \u201cDown in Florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers.\u201d\n\nIn August, Reuters analyzed data from the Department of Labor and found that, since 2000, companies owned by Trump had \u201csought to import at least 1,100 foreign workers on temporary visas,\u201d including about 70 \u201cforeign workers\u201d who had recently been requested to serve as cooks, wait staff and cleaners at the Florida resort.\n\nCruz noted that though the resort jobs were in high demand in Palm Beach, few locals have actually been hired: \u201cRoughly 300 applied. Donald hired 17,\u201d he said, referring to federal data published in The New York Times last week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to get help,\u201d Trump has said.\n\nCruz\u2019s accusations about Trump hiring workers from overseas are true.\n\nBut from there, Cruz departed into claims that were more difficult to substantiate: \u201cHis record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens and abusing American workers.\u201d\n\nCNN has previously investigated claims that Trump hired undocumented workers from Poland in the early 1980s, the most specific claim about Trump and undocumented workers that has been made. Trump has denied ever knowing that the workers were undocumented since the hiring was made by a contracting company.\n\nA subsequent legal case regarding Trump\u2019s involvement in withholding wages from the workers was settled out of court. Because of an appeal that was pending at the time, there was never a final verdict on Trump\u2019s knowledge of the workers\u2019 status.\n\nIf Trump has since \u201crepeatedly\u201d hired undocumented workers, that has also not been proved; the thousands of workers his companies have brought to the United States have come through legal channels, frequently on temporary visas.\n\nWe rate Cruz\u2019s second claim as it\u2019s complicated.\n\nReality Check: Cruz on Trump\u2019s donations to Hillary Clinton\n\nTed Cruz questioned how effective Trump will be squaring off against Hillary Clinton in a general election, given his history of donating money to her political campaigns.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect Hillary Clinton as president,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHow can you stand on a debate stage with her and say you don\u2019t think she should be president?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not quite right, according to the Federal Election Commission and the Center for Responsive Politics..\n\nTrump donated one $600 check to Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2007. But Trump also contributed to 2008 GOP nominee Sen. John McCain\u2019s campaign, and gave him more, to boot.\n\nIn response to Cruz, Trump acknowledged donating to Clinton. \u201cI supported Clinton,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI supported many other people, by the way.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the businessman, his family and his companies donated more than $10,000 to Clinton dating back to her days as a New York senator in 2002. It\u2019s also true that Trump has donated lots of money to a broad array of politicians. His FEC profile is a testament to his prolific efforts funding candidates, Democrats and Republicans alike.\n\nAmid all the filings, however, we couldn\u2019t find any records of Trump contributions to Clinton in 2008.\n\nVerdict: False.\n\nMarco Rubio and Donald Trump\n\nReality Check: Rubio and Trump on results\n\nRubio said the following: \u201cThere is no doubt that Donald has done well in these elections, there\u2019s no doubt about that, the numbers are there. The numbers also say, two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a Republican primary or caucus have voted against you, they do not want you to be our nominee.\u201d\n\nBased on CNN\u2019s total of the 15 states that have held primaries or caucuses so far, there have been 9,634,058 votes cast for Republican candidates; 6,268,191 votes went for candidates other than Trump, while the remaining 3,365,867 went to Trump. That figure for candidates other than Trump accounts for 65% of total votes going to a candidate other than Trump, which is pretty close to two-thirds of 100%.\n\nThe numbers he cites are well within the margin of error. For that reason, we rate this as true.\n\nTrump said the following of the most recent CNN/ORC poll of the state of the Republican race: \u201cCNN just came out with a poll, a national poll, where he is at 15 (Rubio) and he\u2019s at 14 (Cruz) and I\u2019m at 49.\u201d Trump was correct in saying the latest CNN poll found him with 49% of likely Republican voters based on the sample of voters across the country. The same poll showed Rubio with 16% of support in the poll, and Cruz had 15% support. Trump was only off by 1% for both Rubio and Cruz, again within the margin of error, so we rate his claim as true.\n\nReality Check: Rubio and Trump on Trump University\n\nRubio has argued that Trump\u2019s namesake school, Trump University, is part of an elaborate con by the businessman. A key data point: its rating from the Better Business Bureau.\n\n\u201cWe have an \u2018A\u2019 from the Better Business Bureau,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s false,\u201d Rubio shot back, claiming it is actually a D-minus.\n\n\u201cIt is right now an \u2018A.\u2019 Once they had the information, it got switched. The only reason it was a \u2018D\u2019 was because we didn\u2019t care, we didn\u2019t give them the information. When they got the information, it became an \u2018A.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTrump pledged to \u201cgive\u201d the information proving that his rating had been elevated.\n\nAs the moderators told him \u2014 and Rubio argued \u2014 the last available rating was indeed a \u2018D-minus.\u2019 The school, now known as the Trump Entrepreneur Institute, currently has no rating: \u201cTHE TRUMP ENTREPRENEUR INITIATIVE IS BELIEVED TO BE OUT OF BUSINESS!\u201d the bureau\u2019s site reads.\n\nMedia reports at the time say that the school did receive a D- in 2010. And Katherine Hutt, a spokesman for the agency, told Politifact \u201cthat the company\u2019s BBB rating has fluctuated between an A+ and a D-.\u201d\n\nAnd the school has long been investigated by state agencies, including a $40 million lawsuit by the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim is that the school has an \u201cA\u201d \u201cright now.\u201d That is not true. It currently has no rating, even if that may indeed be because of the lack of information he provided.\n\nBut Rubio is also incorrect: It is not a D- now, even if it was previously.\n\nWe rate both Trump and Rubio\u2019s claims as false.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\u2019s complicated.", "title": "True or False?
