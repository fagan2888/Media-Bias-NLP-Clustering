The study postulated that the reason for the decline in births was the recession. Nan Marie Astone, one of the report\u2019s authors, said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to think that [the economic decline] wasn\u2019t the reason.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe period in question saw a \u201cdramatic decline in birth rates among unmarried\u201d black and Latino women and a concomitant drop in the number of white married women. Latino women\u2019s births plummeted 26 percent, black women\u2019s 14 percent, and white women\u2019s 11 percent.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cWe calculate that in 2012, women in their twenties had births at a pace that would lead to 948 births per 1,000 women, by far the slowest pace of any generation of young women in U.S. history\u2026 If these low birth rates to women in their twenties continue, the U.S. might eventually face the type of generational imbalance that currently characterizes Japan and some European countries, but it is too early to predict or worry about that eventuality.\u201d\n\nThe Pew Research Center has determined that people between the ages of 18 and 34 will outnumber the group aged 51 to 69 in 2015.\n\nAstone thought there might be a silver lining, though, stating that women in their 20s now might start having children in their 30s, changing the most fertile age group from what is presently aged 25-29 to women in their 30s. Until the 1980s, the most fertile age group had been aged 20-24.\n\nAstone theorized that a smaller baby boom would lead to a decline in the demand for housing, saying, \u201cThe industry that probably would be concerned about this is housing. People tend to buy a house when they have a baby.\u201d\n\nOf course, the study ignores one salient fact.
