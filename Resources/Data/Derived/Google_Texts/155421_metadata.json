He\u2019s leading on traumatic brain injury, doing something about that horrible phenomenon that\u2019s been particularly serious due to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here because I believe in Bill Cassidy,\u201d said McCain. \u201cI believe that among other things, especially here, is that it is literally a national disgrace that we haven\u2019t cared for our veterans.\u201d\n\nMcCain said there are \u201csystemic problems\u201d in the VA health system.\n\n\u201cAnd what does Bill Cassidy bring? He brings a knowledge, expertise, and background that will make him an instant leader in the U.S. Senate and how we have to act to care for our veterans,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Arizona senator and former prisoner of war said Cassidy is needed in the Senate during the age of improvised explosive devices [IEDs].\n\n\u201cThis is the expert on traumatic brain injury,\u201d McCain said. \u201cHe has already sponsored legislation [that] passed. I guarantee you, we\u2019re in the majority and he\u2019s not the 51st vote, he\u2019s the 57th vote, then Mitch McConnell is committed to naming him to be one of the leaders in addressing health care needs of our veterans.\u201d\n\nCassidy touted a three-year extension he secured of a traumatic brain injury pilot program that provides treatment to veterans, and his two-decade career providing care as an associate professor of medicine at Louisiana State University at Earl K. Long Hospital in Baton Rouge.\n\n\u201cAs a doctor in the public hospital system I found that if the patient has the power, the system lines up to serve the patient,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cIf the bureaucrat has the power, then it lines up to serve the bureaucrat.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Sen. McCain did not say regarding that Phoenix VA, where allegedly 50 veterans died because of lack of service, is that the books were cooked so the administrators would still get their bonus even though the veterans did not receive their care,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the patient has the power, the system serves the patient.\u201d\n\nCassidy, who is in a tight race with Sen. Mary Landrieu, also staked out his position against Obamacare, citing a constituent who has had their premiums increase 250 percent. The family is forced to pay for maternity and pediatric dentistry care, even though they are unable to have children.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of health policy is this?\u201d Cassidy asked.\n\n\u201cSen. Landrieu thinks that bureaucrat and politician should control our health care, whether the veteran or one of us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think you should.\u201d\n\nTowards the end of Cassidy\u2019s remarks a small group of Landrieu supporters began to chant in support of the Democrat in an effort to drown out his remarks. The Landrieu supporters have been following the Cassidy campaign on Monday during series of events to honor veterans throughout the state.\n\n\u201cNo class,\u201d a group of veterans mumbled as they left the memorial.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "BATON ROUGE, Louisiana\u2014Senators John McCain (R., Ariz.), David Vitter (R., La.) and dozens of veterans rallied for Republican senate candidate Bill Cassidy at the USS Kidd and Veterans Memorial in B", "title": "Bill Cassidy Campaigns on Veterans Issues", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/bill-cassidy-campaigns-on-veterans-issues/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rep-cassidy-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "BATON ROUGE, Louisiana\u2014Senators John McCain (R., Ariz.), David Vitter (R., La.) and dozens of vete", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rep-cassidy-150x150.jpg", "title": "Bill Cassidy Campaigns on Veterans Issues", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "and dozens of veterans rallied for Republican senate candidate Bill Cassidy at the USS Kidd and Veterans Memorial in Baton Rogue on Monday, arguing that Cassidy is the best candidate to meet the needs of veterans.\n\u201cBill is not just voting the right way on behalf of our veterans, he\u2019s been a leader.\n\u201cAnd what does Bill Cassidy bring?\nThe group said Cassidy\u2019s medical background studying traumatic brain injuries makes him uniquely qualified to address problems within the scandal-plagued Veterans Administration (VA).\nThe Landrieu supporters have been following the Cassidy campaign on Monday during series of events to honor veterans throughout the state."}
