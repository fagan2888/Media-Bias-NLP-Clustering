Members of the Threefoot Preservation Society were hard at work this morning.The volunteers worked on cleaning, repairing and painting parts of the Threefoot building. Two members of the Mississippi department of archives and history stopped by to lend a helping hand as well as discuss the significance of getting a tenant for the building.

"For it to be in this state is just a shame," Aileen de la Torre with the Mississippi Department of Archives and History explains. "These people are fantastic and they have been here working and just trying to keep it up as much as possible until somebody can step in and finish it up,"

Members of the Threefoot preservation society have been working to clean the building since June 2013.
