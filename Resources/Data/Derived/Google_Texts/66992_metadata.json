Alongside it are similar tributes to Rod Langway, the Hall of Famer and face of the franchise in the 1980s, and Alex Ovechkin, the team\u2019s current star.\n\nIt\u2019s unquestioned that Green has done his part to revitalize hockey in Washington, playing at a high level for the better part of his 10 seasons with the Capitals. He was twice a finalist for the Norris Trophy, given to the league\u2019s best all-around defenseman, and experienced a renaissance this season, benefiting from the least time on ice in the previous seven years.\n\nYet like everything else about Green\u2019s tenure with the Capitals, how long that banner remains splayed out over the concrete this summer is anyone\u2019s guess.\n\nAn unrestricted free agent come July, Green\u2019s departure from the only NHL team he has ever known seems all but certain. He had been relegated to a role as a third-pair defenseman before this season and lost his perch on the top power-play unit midway through it, making it unfathomable that the Capitals would come anywhere near matching his $6.25 million salary for a player with his responsibilities.\n\nGreen, though, is aware there are plenty of moving parts when it comes to contract negotiations, and on Friday, as he packed his belongings and left the building, he expressed hope that there would be some way he could return to the team next season.\n\n\u201cI mean, they\u2019ve got their challenges and whatnot with what their vision is for their team and how certain players fit in or they don\u2019t fit in,\u201d Green said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s what they want to make their team the best they possibly can. For myself, I want to be in a position to play on a competitive team and put myself in a position to win a [Stanley] Cup, too.\u201d\n\nFor the Capitals, there\u2019s the matter of the salary cap, which, because of the declining value of the Canadian dollar, is only projected to increase marginally next season. They will need to offer raises to three players \u2014 Marcus Johansson, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Braden Holtby \u2014 that will not come cheap. They also could look to retain centers Jay Beagle and Eric Fehr, whose contracts are also expiring.\n\nBut for Green, there are a multitude of scenarios to ponder, many of which straddle a fine line. He wants to win a championship, acknowledging that in his first 10 seasons, he\u2019s made enough money to want to pursue happiness. He believes he could again be a top-two defenseman, but knows first-year coach Barry Trotz\u2019s system, which knocked his ice time from an average of 25 minutes over the last seven seasons to just 19:06 this last one, was a large factor in his health and success.\n\nHe played in 72 games, his most since 2009-10, and had 45 points off 10 goals and 35 assists. His 53.0 even-strength shot attempt percentage, a rough measure of the Capitals\u2018 puck possession when Green is on the ice, was his highest in four seasons.\n\n\u201cIt was actually a good way that we did it with Mike,\u201d Trotz said. \u201cIt allowed him to be fresher. He played a full season, for the most part. He wasn\u2019t as banged up as he was in the past. We could move him up in terms of minutes when we were down in games, and we did that. I think it just brought freshness to his game.\u201d\n\nPaired with Nate Schmidt, then Jack Hillen, and after the trade deadline, with Tim Gleason, Green was given the go-ahead to creep up into the play more frequently this season under Trotz and defensive assistant Todd Reirden. It accentuated an offensive side of his game that helped him score 31 goals in 2008-09, still the most by a defenseman in the last 20 years.\n\n\u201cI think we knew what each other was going to bring,\u201d Gleason said. \u201cI think we did it on a consistent basis. He\u2019s a hell of a player, especially on the offensive side of things. Sometimes I wish I had a pair of mitts like that guy. He\u2019s confident, he\u2019s patient and he\u2019s obviously a well-rounded player.\u201d\n\nGreen said this season was \u201cprobably one of the most fun\u201d he\u2019s had in Washington, making the potential of a departure sting that much more. While most players prefer to defer to their agents, he said he would like to be active in contract negotiations this summer, perhaps so he could more accurately understand where he fits.\n\n\u201cYou know, 10 years now with the organization, and it\u2019s hard to think [about] the uncertainty of the summer and what might happen,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a little scary at times for myself to think, but anything can happen. But I\u2019ve got to thank Washington for everything up until this point. It\u2019s been quite the journey, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After spending the first 10 years of his career with the Capitals, a variety of factors leave Green realizing that he's almost certain to play next season in a different sweater.", "Author": "Zac Boyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "After spending the first 10 years of his career with the Capitals, a variety of factors leave Green realizing that he\u2019s almost certain to play next season in a different sweater.", "title": "His Capitals departure likely, Mike Green finds upcoming contract talk \u2018a little scary\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/17/his-capitals-departure-likely-mike-green-finds-upc/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/15/Capitals_Hockey.JPEG-0f790.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/15/Capitals_Hockey.JPEG-0f790.jpg", "title": "His Capitals departure likely, Mike Green finds upcoming contract talk", "description": "After spending the first 10 years of his career with the Capitals, a variety of factors leave Green realizing that he's almost certain to play next season in a different sweater.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Michael Green, Washington, Washington Capitals, Barry Trotz"}, "article_summary": "A banner screen-printed with Mike Green\u2019s likeness hangs outside two of the uppermost levels of a parking garage underneath the Washington Capitals\u2018 practice facility.\nHe wants to win a championship, acknowledging that in his first 10 seasons, he\u2019s made enough money to want to pursue happiness.\nAn unrestricted free agent come July, Green\u2019s departure from the only NHL team he has ever known seems all but certain.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a little scary at times for myself to think, but anything can happen.\nYet like everything else about Green\u2019s tenure with the Capitals, how long that banner remains splayed out over the concrete this summer is anyone\u2019s guess."}
