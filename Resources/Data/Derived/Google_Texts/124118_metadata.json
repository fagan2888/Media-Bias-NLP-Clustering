That\u2019s what happens when social media gets involved. According to ESPN, Earnhardt Jr.\u2019s name came up during one of TNT\u2019s Gone Fishing Tweets after the Charlotte Bobcats had been eliminated from the NBA playoffs.\n\nAll it took was for Charles Barkley to mention that he wanted to meet Earnhardt Jr., and that sparked a Tweet from Dale in reply, \u201cHeck, I wanna meet Charles!\u201d as reported by ESPN. As one thing lead to another, it finally culminated into not only Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Charles Barkley meeting, but racing against each other. As reported by I4U News, Barkley and Earnhardt, Jr. met at the GoPro Motorplex in Mooresville, NC for a challenging, yet fun go kart race.\n\nNow, this isn\u2019t your run of the mill go kart track. Barkley and Earnhardt, Jr. picked GoPro Motorplex for a reason. According to GoProMotorplex.com, \u201cThe GoPro Motorplex\u2019s.7-mile sprint track is based on the famous and historic Kartdromo Parma in Italy, which was considered one of the finest, but most challenging karting circuits in the world.\u201d Nothing but the best for Charles and Dale.\n\nAfter meeting Barkley, Yahoo Sports reported Earnhardt Jr.\u2019s reaction. \u201dI was really surprised how nice a guy he was,\u201d Earnhardt Jr. said. \u201dI really expected him (Barkley) to be a competitor. As a player, he was really fiery and aggressive, getting into scuffles. He (Barkley) was super nice. Really has an appreciation for our sport. Just a real nice guy to be around.\u201d\n\nBarkley was just as glad to finally meet Earnhardt, Jr. In fact, according to Yahoo Sports, Barkley told Earnhardt Jr. that he has been a longtime fan of the NASCAR driver, and had been trying to arrange a meeting through NASCAR Hall of Fame driver Dale Jarret.\n\nNo one will know the results of the race until it is aired on NASCAR on TNT\u2019s Summer Series before the June 8 race at Pocono. All we know for sure is based on Dale Earnhardt\u2019s Tweet after the race, as reported by I4U News, \u201cEnjoyed meeting Chuck today. Very Nice Guy. Not a turrible driver either.\u201d\n\nAny guesses on who won the race between Charles Barkley and Dale Earnhardt, Jr.?\n\nPhoto Credit: Fox Sports FoxSports.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who would have ever pictured NASCAR favorite, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. competing on the racetrack against the basketball legend Charles Barkley?
