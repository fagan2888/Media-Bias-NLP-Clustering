Near Zero Percent Without Health Insurance\n\nWhen Massachusetts passed its landmark health coverage law under Gov. Mitt Romney in 2006, no one claimed the state would get to zero, as in 0 percent of residents who are uninsured. But numbers out today suggest Massachusetts is very close.\n\nBetween December 2013 and March of this year, when the federal government was urging people to enroll, the number of Massachusetts residents signed up for health coverage increased by more than 215,000. If that number holds, the percentage of Massachusetts residents who do not have coverage has dropped to less than 1 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that we are getting this close to universal health care access,\u201d said the Rev. Burns Stanfield, president of the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization.\n\nStanfield says a report out last month that found mortality rates dropped in the first four years of expanded coverage, coupled with the insurance numbers, show that \u201cour statewide move to universal access is working, and it\u2019s a powerful witness to the nation.\u201d\n\nYou won\u2019t hear that kind of enthusiasm from the state, at least not on the record yet.\n\n\u201cThese numbers are a sign that we are moving in the right direction, but there is still a lot of uncertainty about what they will ultimately mean to the total level of health insurance coverage in Massachusetts,\u201d said Aron Boros, director of the Center for Health Information and Analysis, the state agency that tallied the latest insurance figures.\n\nUncertainty might be an understatement. One insurance insider says there is chaos behind the scenes. Most of the new enrollees are in a temporary coverage plan because the state, with its failed website, has not been able to figure out if these people qualify for free or subsidized care.\n\nWhat if they don\u2019t qualify for help, asked Lora Pellegrini, president of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, will these new enrollees be willing to pay a premium?\n\n\u201cThe real challenge is going to be to move these folks from the temporary coverage into the permanent coverage where they belong, and then see if we\u2019re able to retain these numbers,\u201d Pellegrini said.\n\nSome state officials expect the numbers to hold. That\u2019s because despite a broken website and tons of confusion about deadlines and eligibility, it looks like more than 200,000 residents who did not have health insurance last year pushed to enroll.\n\nThere are some good explanations for why:\n\nFirst, there was a big federal enrollment campaign that might have caught people\u2019s attention.\n\nSecond, more residents are eligible for free or subsidized help coverage under the new federal insurance law.\n\nAnd third, most of the remaining uninsured in Massachusetts were low income workers who could not afford premiums under their employers plans. They were not allowed to sign up for state subsidized insurance because they had access insurance through work. The federal law lifts that restriction.\n\n\u201cIt is hard not to look at this and say, if it turns out the numbers are actually correct \u2014 that\u2019s a big if \u2014 this is good,\u201d said Gail Wilensky, a senior fellow at Project Hope and former health care adviser to President George H. W. Bush. \u201cIt is urgent that we have confirmation that continued enrollment after the first year can happen and, in fact, in a place like Massachusetts did happen.\u201d\n\nThe state may be dropping even closer to zero than the numbers from CHIA indicate. This analysis is based on 167,000 residents in temporary coverage at the end of March. As of today, there are 217,000 in that plan. It\u2019s not clear how many of these people are newly insured. Private health insurers lost at least 10,000 members during the first quarter of this year.\n\nMassachusetts will continue to have undocumented residents and others who are uninsured. Making sure coverage is affordable is an ongoing challenge. And paying to subsidize insurance for more residents may strain the state budget. But Massachusetts may have become the first the state in the country where nearly everyone can focus more on their health and less on whether they can see a doctor if they are injured or ill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But many new enrollees are in a temporary coverage plan because the state, with its failed website, has not been able to figure out if these people qualify for free or subsidized care.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "But many new enrollees are in a temporary coverage plan because the state, with its failed website, has not been able to figure out if these people qualify for free or subsidized care.", "title": "Latest Look Finds Mass.
