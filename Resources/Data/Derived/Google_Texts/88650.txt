NASA has commanded the highest rating for large agencies for the past four years, according to the survey. The departments of Justice, State and Commerce rounded out the top five.

The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Veterans Affairs ranked last on the list of large agencies.

The ranking of large agencies included those with more than 15,000 employees. When mid-size agencies with more than 1,000 employees are also factored in, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Peace Corps, the Government Accountability Office and the Federal Trade Commission rank highest.

The Federal Communications Commission's satisfaction rating dropped the most from 2014 to 2015 among large and mid-sized agencies. During a pitched battle over net neutrality rules and other contentious proposals, satisfaction dropped 8 points in a year. It is ranked 18th out of 23 mid-sized agencies.

The rankings were based on the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, and weight in range of employee opinions of their "perceptions of work-life balance."
