Republicans Argue Over Who Is Greater Threat\n\nThe story reads in part:\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 With Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz battling for the Republican nomination, two powerful factions of their party are now clashing over the question: Which man is more dangerous? Conservative intellectuals have become convinced that Mr. Trump, with his message of nationalist-infused populism, poses a dire threat to conservatism, and plan to issue a manifesto on Friday to try to stop him. Meanwhile, the cadre of Republican lobbyists, operatives and elected officials based in Washington are much more unnerved by Mr. Cruz, a go-it-alone, hard-right crusader who campaigns against the political establishment and could curtail their influence and access, building his own Republican machine to essentially replace them. The division illuminates much about modern Republicanism and the surprising bedfellows brought about when an emerging political force begins to imperil entrenched power.\n\nGot that? Wait \u2014 there\u2019s more. Like this:\n\nThe Republicans who dominate the right-leaning magazines, journals and political groups can live with Mr. Cruz, believing that his nomination would leave the party divided, but manageably so, extending a longstanding intramural debate over pragmatism versus purity that has been waged since the days of Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller. They say Mr. Trump, on the other hand, poses the most serious peril to the conservative movement since the 1950s-era John Birch Society.\n\nSay again? \u201cThe Republicans who dominate the right-leaning magazines, journals and political groups can live with Mr. Cruz\u2026.\u201d\n\nSpeaking for myself \u2014 I can more than \u201clive with\u201d Ted Cruz. In fact, if Donald Trump wins this nomination, I believe Ted Cruz should be to Trump as George H.W. Bush was to Reagan or Lyndon Johnson was to John F. Kennedy \u2014 the runner-up whose base of support is so big and critical to victory that the second spot on the ticket is a political necessity. I\u2019m a supporter \u2014 and proudly so \u2014 of Donald Trump. And call me crazy, but I believe what the Times describes as a \u201cconservative manifesto\u201d isn\u2019t. And I say this with the greatest of respect to the signers, many of who are friends and are the real deal as conservatives.\n\nBut what is really revealing in this Times piece is how many \u201cconservatives\u201d can\u2019t seem to live with either Trump or Cruz. It causes me all kinds of uncomfortableness to know some of my friends \u2014 and whether I know them or not they are all friends \u2014 have signed on to this manifesto. Which to me says that when the dust settles in this battle of giants, it is more than time for a Trump-Cruz ticket. Why? As unbelievable as it may seem, that New York Times article spells out the answer in as close to black and white as a subject like this will ever get.\n\nThe Times cites this \u201cmanifesto\u201d that is about to materialize from \u201cconservative intellectuals\u201d as saying that Donald Trump \u201cposes a dire threat to conservatism.\u201d\n\nStop right there. Wow. Really? One can only ask: Who exactly has been part of the real \u201cdire threat to conservatism\u201d? Not everybody on that list \u2014 but yes, sadly, some.\n\nOne of the prime movers in this manifesto, according to the Times, is National Review. Which is, yes indeed, questioning Trump\u2019s conservative credentials. Gee. Remember back there in the mists of 2011? When my friends at NR were headlining \u201cRomney\u2019s the One\u201d? That would be the Mitt Romney who was the father of Romneycare \u2014 the Godfather of Obamacare? Among other things this piece by Ramesh Ponnuru said:\n\nWe all know the knocks on Romney. His health-care plan in Massachusetts was Obamacare in one state. He\u2019s a flip-flopper. Inauthentic. His conservative detractors say he\u2019s the establishment/moderate candidate \u2014 or worse.\n\nAnd? Ponnuru then says he had a conversation with a family member and expressed his support for Romney. To which said family member quickly \u2014 and I would suggest perceptively \u2014 replied: \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were a Democrat.\u201d\n\nBingo. Be that as it may, Ponnuru and NR were all out for the decidedly non-conservative Romney, with Ponnuru going out of his way later on to be part of the so-called \u201cReformicons\u201d \u2014 so-called \u201creform conservatives\u201d who, to all appearances, were nothing more than the latest incarnation of what Ronald Reagan once disdained as \u201cfraternal order\u201d Republicans.\n\nI raise this point not out of pleasure. I love National Review \u2014 really. As mentioned, some of my friends are on this list. But as the Times is reporting, the magazine is about to go public with a manifesto that says Donald Trump \u201cposes a dire threat to conservatism\u201d? OK. Got it. Then the obvious question: Where, pray tell, were some (not all, but some) of these manifesto writers when the magazine was pushing an \u201cinauthentic flip-flopper\u201d who was the Godfather of Obamacare? Answer \u2014 just from my personal perspective? They fled the field. Went over the side. Worse, they even falsely portrayed Newt Gingrich as an anti-Reaganite, something I personally knew to be flat out false because \u2014 hello? \u2014 I was there when some of the Gingrich critics were still working their way through junior high school.\n\nLook. Let\u2019s get down to basics here. There in the Times story is this:\n\nPeter Wehner, a longtime conservative writer, said: \u201cHe\u2019s not a conservative, he\u2019s an angry populist. It would be dangerous if the party or movement hands control over to him.\u2019\u2019\n\nDangerous? Let me blunt. Mr. Wehner \u2014 I\u2019m sure a lovely guy \u2014 was part and parcel of the Bush 43 administration which left the GOP in shambles at its departure precisely because the Bush administration was run on \u201cnot a conservative\u201d principles. George W. was and is the loveliest of guys. In the aftermath of 9/11 Bush will eventually be recalled as a great president. But alas Bush and his White House staff were enticed by the anti-conservative siren songs that if only conservatives were somehow more \u201ccompassionate\u201d \u2014 meaning spending more money on Big Government like liberals \u2014 all would be well. It was, not to wax Trumpian in bluntness, BS.\n\nEx-Bush 43 aide Matt Latimer wrote of writing a speech for George W. to deliver to CPAC \u2014 the Conservative Political Action Conference \u2014 in Latimer\u2019s book Speech-less: Tales of a White House Survivor. The account goes this way:\n\nI started that speech by talking about the origins of CPAC and the conservative movement. I was in the Oval Office one day and the President said to me, \u201cWhat\u2019s all this movement stuff you have in here?\u201d I said, \u201cWell, Mr. President, it\u2019s the whole Buckley/Goldwater/Reagan tradition.\u201d He said, \u201cTake all that stuff out. I mean, that movement\u2019s over. I know it\u2019s arrogant for me to say, but I redefined the Republican Party.\u201d What he meant was that when he talked about compassionate conservatism in 2000, a lot of conservatives like me thought that\u2019s just a nice gimmick that sounds nice to people. But, he actually meant it. It didn\u2019t mean he was a bad person and it didn\u2019t even necessarily mean he was a bad President in a lot of respects. But, he wasn\u2019t a traditional conservative and people need to know that.\n\nGot that? There is President Bush 43 himself saying of the Buckley/Goldwater/Reagan tradition per his speechwriter: \u201c\u2026that movement\u2019s over. I know it\u2019s arrogant for me to say, but I redefined the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nAnd so he did. And it was an unmitigated disaster for the Republican Party and the entire conservative movement.\n\nIt is no surprise ex-Bush 43 aides like Peter Wehner, Karl Rove, and Michael Gerson (all of them vehement Trump critics) are well out there playing up in their own non-subtle fashion that \u201cthe whole Buckley/Goldwater/Reagan tradition\u201d is dead as a doornail.\n\nBut no matter how these Bushies try to re-arrange history, the very hard fact is that the result of the Bush political doctrine for the GOP that these guys had a hand in fashioning was politically an unmitigated disaster. Just as Ronald Reagan had said when he pegged this nonsense as \u201cfraternal order\u201d Republicanism. The Bushes father and son, good and decent people both, came close to wrecking the Republican Party. Utterly eviscerating it. Bush 41 bequeathed America Bill and Hillary Clinton. Bush 43 \u2014 advised by the likes of Mr. Wehner, Michael Gerson, and Karl Rove \u2014 bequeathed America Barack Obama. Way to go. And these people think Donald Trump would be a disaster for the GOP? Really? Oh please.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it, the Times draws in Bob Dole, a wonderful American hero turned GOP Establishment icon \u2014 who lost, in the finest of GOP Establishment styles, a perfectly winnable presidential election by doing the moderate \u201cme-too\u201d dance. Dole, in fact, is a Jeb Bush supporter, but of course.\n\nLast night there was, yes indeed, NR\u2019s Rich Romney \u2014 oops, sorry, that would be Rich Lowry \u2014 professing his love for limited government. Like, apparently, Romneycare-cum-Obamacare?\n\nOh please. Please, please, please.\n\nThe destruction of conservatism?\n\nLet\u2019s see what emerges here from this \u201cmanifesto\u201d to be issued by what the Times describes as \u201cconservative intellectuals.\u201d But make no mistake. When something like this emerges from the adjunct of Romney headquarters? More than a grain of salt should be at hand.\n\nIt\u2019s time to start moving forward. To a Trump-Cruz ticket.\n\nDoubtless\u2026 and respectfully\u2026 to be continued.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And call me crazy, but I believe what the Times describes as a \u201cconservative manifesto\u201d isn\u2019t.\nThey say Mr. Trump, on the other hand, poses the most serious peril to the conservative movement since the 1950s-era John Birch Society.\nIn fact, if Donald Trump wins this nomination, I believe Ted Cruz should be to Trump as George H.W.\nEx-Bush 43 aide Matt Latimer wrote of writing a speech for George W. to deliver to CPAC \u2014 the Conservative Political Action Conference \u2014 in Latimer\u2019s book Speech-less: Tales of a White House Survivor.\nBut what is really revealing in this Times piece is how many \u201cconservatives\u201d can\u2019t seem to live with either Trump or Cruz."}
