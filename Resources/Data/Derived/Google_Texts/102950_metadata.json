We're just plain rude!\n\nTime to realize that our sandy beaches, amazing scenery and incredible nightlife can only car us so far.\n\nAt least when it comes to our mobile manners.\n\nA new survey shows that Florida residents are among the worst when it comes to crossing boundaries of decency while using our smartphones.\n\nBank of America's survey shows that one-third of Floridians, a hearty 33%, admit to texting while eating meals with others.\n\n31% of us fess up to checking our mobile phones while in mid-conversation with others. Admit it, that's not nice.\n\nAnother 25% say that they multi-task on their mobile phones during meetings, which, to be honest, isn't that bad. Seriously, some meetings are just so droll!\n\nYou want more stats?\n\nHow about the fact that 55% of Floridians check their phones at least once an hour, and 41% say they will never fully disconnect from their mobile phones.\n\nAnd it doesn't end during our conscious, waking hours. The survey shows that nearly one-quarter of us have fallen asleep with our smartphones in our hand.\n\nWe could go on and on, but let's face it, you've probably already moved on from... hold, please... got to go, need to Snapchat a funny cat picture to a friend, and this article is so five minutes ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 by Graham Media Group.
