I can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Scarborough railed against the black community for exalting Michael Brown as \u201cthe face of black oppression.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many great people to embrace as heroes in the black community that deciding you\u2019re going to embrace a guy who knocked over a convenience store, and then, according to grand jury testimony, acted in ways that would get my children shot \u2026 that\u2019s your hero? That\u2019s the reason you want to burn down black businesses?\u201d he asked.\n\nMr. Scarborough also lashed out at some of his show\u2019s guests for agreeing with him privately but refusing to express their views on air, Business Insider reported.\n\n\u201cYou know what pisses me off too is I have people around this set all the time. They let me say what I say on set and they sit and stare at me, slack-jawed,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid to say anything on the air, even though they know it\u2019s BS. People [are] saying one thing when the camera\u2019s on and then saying something completely different when the camera gets turned off, because they\u2019re somehow afraid they\u2019ll be called racist if they tell the truth.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "MSNBC host Joe Scarborough blasted the network for what he called \"BS\" coverage of the turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting death of Michael Brown and a grand jury's decision not to indict the officer who killed him.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "MSNBC host Joe Scarborough blasted the network for what he called \u201cBS\u201d coverage of the turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting death of Michael Brown and a grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the officer who killed him.", "title": "Joe Scarborough, MSNBC host, blasts network for \u2018BS\u2019 Ferguson narrative", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/1/joe-scarborough-msnbc-host-blasts-network-for-bs-f/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/01/joe-scarborough.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/01/joe-scarborough.jpg", "description": "MSNBC host Joe Scarborough blasted the network for what he called \"BS\" coverage of the turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting death of Michael Brown and a grand jury's decision n", "card": "summary", "title": "Joe Scarborough, MSNBC host, blasts network for \u2018BS\u2019 Fergu"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Joe Scarborough, Michael Brown"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI have sat here quietly and listened to BS being spewed all over this network and all over other networks.\nThey let me say what I say on set and they sit and stare at me, slack-jawed,\u201d he said.\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough blasted the network for what he called \u201cBS\u201d coverage of the turmoil in Ferguson, Missouri, following the police shooting death of Michael Brown and a grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict the officer who killed him.\n\u201cThey\u2019re afraid to say anything on the air, even though they know it\u2019s BS.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this Ram thing, this was the final straw for me,\u201d the former Republican congressman said Monday on \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Business Insider reported."}
