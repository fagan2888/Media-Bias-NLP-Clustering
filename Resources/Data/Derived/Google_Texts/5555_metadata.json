Koskinen also said IRS leadership is \u201cconsulting with the leadership of the NTEU\u201d \u2014 referring to the National Treasury Employees Union, meaning the cuts in some way could affect employees.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt we will have to take some difficult steps,\u201d he said.\n\nUnion president Colleen M. Kelley said in a statement that NTEU \u201cwill be doing everything we can to prevent these draconian cuts from resulting in hardship to frontline employees who provide vital services to taxpayers.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have made it a priority to gut the IRS\u2019s budget following the tea party targeting scandal \u2014 and they intend to continue doing so next year. The approved $10.9 billion budget is $1.5 billion below what the IRS requested and $900 million below 2010 levels.\n\nThe cuts come as the IRS portfolio expands to include implementing the Affordable Care Act and another new international reporting law that\u2019s expected to confuse taxpayers.\n\nKoskinen, who was brought in after the tea party ruckus to turn the agency around, has warned the cuts are crushing the IRS and that taxpayer services are suffering.\n\nHe said in the email that their budget is now akin to what it was in 1998, when Congress had to reorganize the agency because it was in such disarray.\n\nAccording to his letter, employee travel will also be scaled back further, including his trips to visit and meet with IRS employees around the country \u2014 something he\u2019d done since taking charge of the agency.\n\nHe also specifically mentioned pay raises in the email as an \u201cadditional\u201d cost on the IRS, though he did not say anything about future cuts to pay.\n\n\u201cIn addition, we must absorb additional costs of $250 million this year to cover the government-wide pay raise of one percent and additional benefit costs,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe IRS is expected to announce more effects of the cuts in the coming days and weeks.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The cuts will reduce collections from tax cheats by at least $2 billion.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The cuts will reduce collections from tax cheats by at least $2 billion.", "title": "IRS to freeze hiring, cut enforcement", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/irs-budget-cuts-113651.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/17/141217_john_koskinen_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Congress,Taxes,Budget Cuts,IRS", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rachael.bade.9"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "POLITICO Pro IRS to freeze hiring, cut enforcementThe IRS will freeze hiring and stop overtime as a result of the budget cuts just passed by Congress, according to an email obtained by POLITICO.\nThe approved $10.9 billion budget is $1.5 billion below what the IRS requested and $900 million below 2010 levels.\nKoskinen also said IRS leadership is \u201cconsulting with the leadership of the NTEU\u201d \u2014 referring to the National Treasury Employees Union, meaning the cuts in some way could affect employees.\n\u201cWe will stop overtime except in critical situations.\u201dBut there\u2019s potentially more to come, as IRS leadership decides what else to cut over the next nine months of the fiscal 2015 budget, he warned.\nThe IRS is expected to announce more effects of the cuts in the coming days and weeks."}
