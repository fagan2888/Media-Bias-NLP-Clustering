California has more immigrants than any other state. At least one in four Californians â" more than 10 million people â" were born in another country.

And theyâre a diverse bunch: Some immigrants, like my parents, are naturalized U.S. citizens. Others are green card holders. Some live here illegally. In addition, there are many thousands of people who have temporary status here on work or student visas.

Lots of you have asked how the Affordable Care Act affects immigrants. How Iâd love to hand you a one-size-fits-all response! But this is Obamacare, after all, and the law treats categories of immigrants differently.

Q: What types of immigration status will be covered under Obamacare?

A: Letâs start with one important little detail: All naturalized citizens and legal immigrants must have health insurance as of Jan. 1 or pay a tax penalty. (That is, unless they fit into a category of people who are exempt, including those who cannot find âaffordableâ coverage, as defined by the law.)

The insurance requirement isnât as ironclad for people with temporary visas. Some will have to abide and some wonât. (Thanks, Obamacare!) If youâre not sure where you fall, check with an immigration attorney.

Whether youâre eligible for zero, some, or all Obamacare programs depends on your legal status:

â" Naturalized U.S. citizens are eligible for all Obamacare benefits, including the expansion of Californiaâs Medicaid program for low-income residents, which is called Medi-Cal.

They also can receive tax credits for plans purchased through the stateâs health insurance exchange, Covered California (as long as they meet the income guidelines and other qualifications).

â" Lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders); people with temporary work and student visas (such as H-1B, J and F visas); refugees and asylees; Cuban/Haitian entrants; and others can all buy from the exchange and apply for tax credits.

People in most of those categories also will be eligible for expanded Medi-Cal if their incomes qualify. Some states â" but not California â" require a five-year waiting period before allowing certain immigrants to enroll.

â" People who are here illegally cannot participate in any of these programs, but can receive emergency or prenatal treatment, as they do now. They also donât have to comply with the Obamacare requirement.

Q: Iâm a legal immigrant who has been in the U.S. for less than two years. I already have private health insurance from my country (Mexico), which covers me internationally. I can't afford to get another health plan. Am I obliged to buy another health plan here? Will I have to pay the penalty if I donât?

A: Remember that important little detail I mentioned above, Laura? If youâre a legal immigrant you have to have health insurance starting Jan. 1.

Does health insurance from another country qualify? Probably not. Coverage from a foreign insurer does not meet the Obamacare requirement unless the insurer has received approval from the federal government, says Jenny Rejeske, health policy analyst for the National Immigration Law Center.
