The Bay County Sheriff’s Office in conjunction with the US Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force apprehended a wanted fugitive at midnight Friday night when it was learned he intended to come from Georgia to Bay County to rape and beat a woman he was communicating with by phone.

Jamie Ferrer, 50, was wanted on warrants for Failure to Appear (FTA) on charges of Grand Theft and Dealing in Stolen Property. He was also wanted by the Jackson County Sheriff's Office for FTA on charges of Resisting Arrest with Violence, Battery of LEO, Possession of Marijuana and FTA on five counts of Possession of Controlled Substance, and Possession of Marijuana more than 20 Grams. Ferrer was also wanted by the Harris County, Georgia Sheriff’s Office for False Imprisonment of a Minor and two counts of Obstruction of Justice.

After information was developed that Ferrer had threatened a woman in Bay County and threatened to “pick her up” and rape and beat her, the Marshall’s Task Force and BCSO deputies waited to confront him when he arrived at his intended victim’s home.

When he realized law enforcement was waiting for him, Ferrer intentionally rammed a BCSO vehicle nearly head on and was able to flee. His vehicle was “spiked” on Hudson Road but did not immediately stop; leading a pursuit southbound on Highway 231, during which time Ferrer’s vehicle lost both front tires and caught fire. The pursuit ended at Highway 231 and 15th Street in Panama City.

Ferrer fled on foot. A K9 Officer and his K9 dog were able to track Ferrer, who resisted the K9 dog, getting bitten on the head as a result. Ferrer was treated at a local hospital and then booked on charges of Aggravated fleeing and Eluding Law Enforcement Officer (LEO), Aggravated Battery on a LEO with Motor Vehicles, Driving with License Suspended or Revoked, Resisting Officer without Violence, Possession of Marijuana less than 20 grams, and a felony warrant out of Bay County.
