LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) - Organizers of a New Mexico State University lecture series named after longtime professor and playwright Mark Medoff say some big names will appear in its inaugural year.

Coordinator Ross Marks tells the Las Cruces Sun-News (http://bit.ly/1xz1FQb) that organizers are discussing dates for actors Kevin Costner and Neil Patrick Harris to be lecturers.

Costner starred in the 2008 movie, “Swing Vote,” which was primarily filmed in New Mexico.

Harris, who is slated to host the Academy Awards in February, is an Albuquerque native.

Screenwriter and producer Aaron Sorkin, who created TV’s “The Newsroom” and penned “The Social Network,” will start the series off in the fall.

Medoff won the Tony Award for Best Play in 1980 for “Children of a Lesser God” and helped establish NMSU’s Creative Media Institute.
