The administration official who battled the press during ObamaCare's troubled rollout is resigning her position to seek other opportunities, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced Monday.

Julie Bataille, the lead CMS spokeswoman, became known last fall as the main voice on press calls where journalists grilled the administration daily about problems and repairs at HealthCare.gov.

She handled a broad portfolio of issues for the agency in addition to the Affordable Care Act, including open enrollment in Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP.

CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner shared the news of Bataille's departure with colleagues in a notice that was later forwarded to journalists.

The agency did not announce her next move, and a CMS spokesman said Bataille has no plans at this time.

"We will miss Julie’s energy and enthusiasm, her standards of excellence, and her commitment to ensuring that, through CMS' programs, millions of Americans are now enjoying the peace of mind that comes with affordable health insurance," Tavenner wrote.

Bataille is just the latest communications official to leave the team that handled press for ObamaCare's rollout. Spokeswomen Joanne Peters and Emma Sandoe left the department in April and May, respectively.

CMS communications official Richard Olague also announced Monday that he would depart the agency for a position in the Health Resources and Services Administration.
