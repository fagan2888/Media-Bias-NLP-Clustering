However, families and health insurance brokers started contacting NewsChannel 5 late last week saying they were being denied a \"special enrollment\" period.\n\n\"It would be Florida Healthy Kids that would be filing a lawsuit,\" said Wendy Link, Chair of the board for Florida Healthy Kids.\n\nShe says she hopes it doesn't come to litigation but families are upset and making sure Healthy Kids knows it.\n\n\"We've received some letters from families saying you all are heartless,\" says Link.\n\nPart of the problem is the lack of warning.\n\n\"You we're kind of blind sided by this?\" Asked NewsChannel 5's Jared Werksma. \"Absolutely, 100% blindsided,\"\n\nsays Deanna Kirkpatrick, Mother of two.\n\n\"$299 per month?\" asked Werksma. \"Yes!\" says Link, \"Just for my nine-year-old.\"\n\nKirkpatrick says she reached out to her families insurance broker, Terri Kamen, for help.\n\n\"My phone still rings of the hook and people are calling to say I don't know what to do,\u201d says Kamen.\n\nThis, despite the fact that Florida Healthy Kids says it\u2019s $299 a month premium for one child on the \u201cPlus,\u201d plan is still competative with all other providers.\n\n\u201cThey are not even close,\u201d says Kamen, who continues:\n\n\u201cIf you have a Palm Beach County zip code, there are 88 policies available specifically in the FFM, the Federally Facilitated Market Place. You can cover children under the age of 18 for under $100 dollars (a month).\u201d\n\nBut many Florida Healthy Kids families are being told by insurance reps, a premium increase alone doesn't qualify for special enrollment, meaning they'll need to swallow the hefty premiums until open enrollment in January, which Kirkpatrick says may not be an option.\n\n\u201cHe would probably have to go uncovered until open enrollment,\u201d says Kirkpatrick referring to her nine-year-old son.\n\n\u201cBut you say that shouldn't be the case?\u201d Werksma asked Link. \u201cThey're not just having an increase in premium they're plan ends,\u201d said Link.\n\nKamen also says the federal statute is clear.\n\n\u201cIt's not the same product,\u201d said Link. \u201cSo you think that the exchange should be letting these people in?\u201d Asked Werksma. \u201cThat's right,\u201d Link replied.\n\nBut some brokers and families tell us agents with Healthcare.gov are giving more than a simple \"no\" as an answer.\n\nSome families tell NewsChannel 5 they're actually getting a scripted response from agents at Healthcare.gov, saying that this is as a result of Florida not going along with the Affordable Care Act and not expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe have heard that people have been saying that.\u201d Said Link. Who Continued: \u201cThe problem is, it doesn't make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think the federal government is making this political?\u201d Asked Werksma.\n\n\u201cIt certainly shouldn't be political. You\u2019re talking about people's children and their health, there's nothing that's political about that,\u201d said Link.\n\nNewsChannel 5 has reached out to Healthcare.gov and the Department of Health and Human Services for comment but we have yet to get a response.\n\nThe Florida Healthy Kids Corporation says it is \"Cautiously optimistic\" that this is a misunderstanding. Counsel for the board says they should be able to decide by Tuesday August 25 whether or not to move forward with litigation.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "Last week families hit with an insurance premium hike were assured by\u00a0Florida Healthy Kids they could enroll in the federal exchange or private insurance if they found better rates.
