Norma Pacheco (2nd L) and Rosa Gonzalez (C) speak with Sunshine agent Gisselle Rubio in the background as they also sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. As insurance agents with Sunshine continue to help people purchase and understand the policies offered under the act, President Barack Obama today in Washington announced that Americans who have had their health insurance plans canceled because of provisions in the act can keep those plans for another year. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nHaving watched their party descend into chaos over the government shutdown, Republicans aren\u2019t likely to let the fiscal negotiations upstage Obamacare\u2019s problems again. And that could be good news for the Congressional leaders who are struggling to put together a budget agreement by mid-December.\n\nRepublicans have seen a huge reversal in political fortune since the government reopened and Obamacare\u2019s problems have taken center stage. \u201cIt would argue against not having another shutdown: have Democrats keep shooting themselves in the foot and the president keep giving disastrous press conferences,\u201d says Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former Bush health official.\n\nPro-shutdown conservatives who successfully convinced the GOP to go to war over the budget are now happy to get out of the way and let Obamacare\u2019s rocky rollout be Topic A. \u201dLooking ahead, the nation is in a state of flux as the health care law continues to implode. How that plays out over the next several weeks and through the holidays will go a long way in determining what actions will be taken in 2014,\u201d said Dan Holler, a spokeman for Heritage Action, an outside pressure group at the heart of the GOP shutdown push.\n\nAnd right now, there\u2019s nothing that they would prefer to focus on. \u201cAll indications are that the only things Republicans want to talk about is repealing the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the second-ranking Democrat in the budget negotiations.\n\nCongressional leaders have already set exceedingly low expectations for a budget deal to avoid more gridlock and legislative failure. While not all Republicans are crazy about sequestration, most seem willing to live with it, and more have openly embraced the status quo as a conservative victory.\n\nBeating Democrats up on the Affordable Care Act, House conservatives may not feel the need to extract ten pounds of blood and flesh over the budget. \u201cSeparate from all of the spending negotiations, we should be working on repeal. It\u2019s the right thing do, regardless if you have a spending bill coming up or debt limit bill coming up. I don\u2019t think you need to attach the issues together,\u201d Rep. Justin Amash told Buzzfeed.\n\nClick here to read more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "MSNBC - Having watched their party descend into chaos over the government shutdown, Republicans aren\u2019t likely to let the fiscal negotiations upstage Obamacare\u2019s problems again...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "theGrio", "description": "MSNBC - Having watched their party descend into chaos over the government shutdown, Republicans aren\u2019t likely to let the fiscal negotiations upstage Obamacare\u2019s problems again...", "title": "The silver lining of the Obamacare\u00a0meltdown", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 4882, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obamacare-sign-up.jpg?fit=4882%2C2746", "height": 2746}, "url": "http://thegrio.com/2013/11/18/the-silver-lining-of-the-obamacare-meltdown/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1699887390250781, "pages": 75928194876}, "google-site-verification": "nGSqmdocNPXRMLRT9q_QAemkqyzj9W5Vd4tzA7hsksg", "keywords": "politics, budget, congress, democrats, government shutdown, health care reform, obamacare, republicans", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Republicans", "published_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-18T20:37:23+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaed4\"", "article_summary": "\u201dLooking ahead, the nation is in a state of flux as the health care law continues to implode.\nBeating Democrats up on the Affordable Care Act, House conservatives may not feel the need to extract ten pounds of blood and flesh over the budget.\nNorma Pacheco (2nd L) and Rosa Gonzalez (C) speak with Sunshine agent Gisselle Rubio in the background as they also sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Having watched their party descend into chaos over the government shutdown, Republicans aren\u2019t likely to let the fiscal negotiations upstage Obamacare\u2019s problems again.\n\u201cAll indications are that the only things Republicans want to talk about is repealing the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Rep.
