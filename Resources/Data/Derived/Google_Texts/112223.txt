The U.S. Supreme Court could release its decision in the King v. Burwell case any day, deciding whether some 412,000 Georgians will lose tax credits that go toward their health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act.

Families USA, which falls on the pro-Obamacare side of the spectrum, has broken down the Georgia numbers by congressional district – which you can see here:

The Seventh District held by U.S. Rep. Rob Woodall, R-Lawrenceville, leads the state in the number of recipients who would be affected.

The Sixth District of Rep. Tom Price, R-Roswell, also cracks the top five of Georgia’s 14 districts. Price, a physician, has an alternative to the ACA that he’s pushed for six years – but it has yet to get a vote. That could change, depending on what Supreme Court justices say this month.
