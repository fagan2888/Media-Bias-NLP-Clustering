Happy birthday to me! I'm 55. I think this post just about sums things up.

Yesterday the Cardinals ruined my pre-birthday festivities. I hope the Irish are a little more accommodating today.

UPDATE: Oh, and happy birthday to Jim Henley and Grover Norquist and Amy Carter too. And especially to Michael Steele, who is also 55 today.
