Jay Nixon gave his annual State of the State address in the Capitol today, presenting his annual budget and laying out a broad agenda calling for more education funding, Medicaid expansion, anti-discrimination protections for LGBT Missourians, and tax credit reforms.\n\nNixon touted his own agenda, taking no time to mention Missouri\u2019s shrinking unemployment and 44,000 additional jobs in the last year. Nixon also spent time defending his veto of last year\u2019s tax cut legislation and reiterating his support for lower taxes.\n\n\u201cMissouri employers will save $70 million this year alone because we cut the corporate franchise tax,\u201d Nixon said during his speech. \u201cBut here\u2019s what I won\u2019t do: I will not support anything that takes money out of our classrooms.\u201d\n\nWhile Nixon voiced his support for reforming the state\u2019s tax credit programs and new campaign finance restrictions, he didn\u2019t offer a specific course of action on either front.\n\nNixon also voiced his strong support for Medicaid expansion while attempting to distance the issue from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe all know there are problems with Obamacare, and Washington\u2019s implementation of it has been abysmal,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cBut rejecting Medicaid won\u2019t fix any of those things. It won\u2019t keep Missourians from having to pay federal taxes or exempt our businesses from new requirements under the law.\u201d\n\nNixon also defended the state\u2019s education establishment and instructed lawmakers not to \u201ctear down our teachers.\u201d While calling for a \u201cfix\u201d to the current school transportation law, Nixon didn\u2019t mention a specific solution.\n\nNoticeably missing from Nixon\u2019s agenda was any mention of Right-to-Work legislation, which he has in the past threatened to veto and which some Republican leadership have promised will be a priority this year.\n\nRepublicans hammered Nixon\u2019s address in their official response, delivered by House Speaker Tim Jones, R-Eureka. Republicans said Nixon had created his own consensus revenue estimate in order to fund his own projects.\n\n\u201cThis budget accounts for nearly $1 billion in new funding,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis budget is about $310 million more than the estimates agreed on by the House and Senate for the budget, as well as the University of Missouri experts who weighed in.\u201d\n\nJones accused Nixon of \u201csmoke and mirror\u201d budget games, reiterating that Republicans in the House supported an increase in K-12 funding in 2013, and chiding Nixon on withholding funds and treating the budget like a \u201cslush fund.\u201d\n\nBudget Chairman Rick Stream, R-Kirkwood, said Nixon chose a revenue estimate outside of the one determined by non-partisan House and Senate staff.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to hold the line on those numbers, we are determined not to spend more than we take in,\u201d Stream said.\n\n[divider style=\u201dtiny\u201d][/divider]\n\nReactions to Gov. Nixon\u2019s address:\n\n\u201cI am shocked [Gov. Nixon] never mentioned our highways or freedom to work. He seemed to be more interested in handing out money to his allies. I would love to have a leader in this state that helps all the citisens and no just his friends.\u201d\n\n\u2013Rocky Miller, R-Osage Beach\n\n\u201cThe Governor\u2019s commitment to improving funding for education is exactly what our state needs. For years many in the capitol have talked a big game about education, and it is good to see a powerful person putting all their might behind helping our public schools.\u201d\n\n\u2013Michael Butler, D-St. Louis City\n\n\u201cI agree with the focus on increased education funding, but you can\u2019t pay for $800 million in new spending by simply cutting 80 government jobs. His budget is not realistic, even if well intentioned.\u201d\n\n\u2013Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad the Governor addressed the education needs of our state. As he said it\u2019s about time we put children first. No more politics, Let\u2019s just fund the education formula like we all promised to during our campaigns.\u201d\n\n\u2013Vicki Englund, D-St. Louis City\n\n\u201cIn a world of infinite revenue, I think the Governor knocked it out of the park. I just wish this was the world we lived in.\u201d\n\n-Caleb Jones, R-California\n\n\u201cOut of all of Governor Nixon\u2019s addresses this was the best one, hands down. This is the direction we need to go. At the end of the day the people of Missouri and those elected to office will do the right thing.\u201d\n\n-Jeremy LaFaver, D-Kansas City\n\n\u201cThe Governor created a consensus revenue estimate 40 percent higher than everyone else so he was able to promise increases to every department in the state. My colleagues and I are done with partisan gestures and looking to provide real solutions, not empty promises. Let\u2019s be the tip of the spear, not the rear guard.\u201d\n\n\u2013Elijah Haahr, R-Springfield\n\n\u201cGovernor Nixon showed leadership with strong budget priorities by tripling funding for early childhood education. Education is the greatest economic development tool available.\u201d\n\n\u2013Sen. Jason Holsman, D-Kansas City\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely disappointed in the Governor\u2019s immediate position on tax reform and I\u2019m very curious to see his [consensus revenue estimate].\u201d\n\n\u2013Casey Guernsey, R-Bethany\n\n\u201cI was elated to know that the Governor is ready to put more money into the foundation formula.\u201d\n\n-Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis City\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised there wasn\u2019t more bipartisan support. Some of the stuff was deserving of a standing ovation. Medicaid, Medicaid probably helps rural areas more than the urban core.\u201d\n\n-Rep. Clem Smith, D-St. Louis\n\n\u201cNo states are spending our money. It\u2019s money borrowed on the backs of future generations.\u201d\n\n-Rep. Tim Remole R-Moberly\n\n\u201cI felt like I needed to look for a leprechaun to look for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Apparently, Governor Nixon has forgotten the importance of a balanced budget.\u201d\n\n-Rep. Mike Kelley Rep R-Carthage\n\n\u201cIn 2005, with a Republican Governor and Republican Senate, we passed the Foundation Formula. We\u2019re just now funding it nine years later.\u201d\n\n-Rep. Jacob Hummel, D-St. Louis\n\n\u201cOne of the better state of the state addresses I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s unfortunate the Republicans didn\u2019t consider it the same way.\u201d\n\n-Rep. Tommie Pierson, D-Florissant\n\n\u201cI think we need to take a look at the whole picture on what we\u2019re doing on tax policy. I think reform is long over due in some areas.\u201d\n\n-Sen. Bob Dixon, R-Springfield\n\n\u201cHe was talking about high tech jobs. We established the career tech board to help create high tech jobs. He has yet to appoint a member to that board.\u201d\n\n-Sen. Brian Muntzlinger, R-Lewis County\n\n\u201cI was just happy the governor committed to fully fund education. Your children are your future.\u201d\n\n-Rep. Elaine Gannon, R-De Soto\n\n\u201cThe general assembly has struggled with fair and balanced tax credit reform policy,\u201d\n\n-Rep, Bart Korman, R-Chesterfield\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Christmas in January. He proposes this budget and we\u2019re the ones who look like the bad guys when we need to cut it.\u201d\n\n-Rep.
