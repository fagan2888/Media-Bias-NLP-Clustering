When: 9 a.m. Tuesday Where: Third floor hearing room in the Boulder County Courthouse, 1325 Pearl St., Boulder Information about Boulder County's Creek Recovery and Restoration Program: bit.ly/1JqRJiN\n\nBoulder County commissioners on Tuesday morning will consider having the county act as the official \"local sponsor\" of a federal agency's stream-restoration grants program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service has been allocated $47 million for awarding grants to help fund flood recovery projects in Colorado.\n\nBoulder County officials stated in a news release there are 29 stream-restoration projects in the county, with an estimated total cost of $35.8 million.\n\nThe Colorado Water Conservation Board will administer the federal agency's Emergency Watershed Protection grants program. Before any of those projects can move forward toward implementation, though, a local sponsor must be named, Boulder County officials said. That sponsor will be responsible for overseeing the grant-funded projects and provide a local match amounting to 12.5 percent of the total project costs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoulder County is considering local sponsorship of 12 projects, which would have a total estimated cost of $18.3 million, the county staff said.\n\nEight of those projects are associated with road reconstruction adjacent to James Creek, Fourmile Creek, Fourmile Canyon Creek and Gold Run. The other four are on county parks and open space properties on or adjacent to the St. Vrain River or Left Hand Creek.\n\nTuesday's meeting will include a public hearing and a Boulder County Creek Recovery and Restoration Program staff's presentation about that program and the potential projects.\n\nJohn Fryar: 303-684-5211, jfryar@times-call.com or twitter.com/jfryartc", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29421211/boulder-county-eyes-sponsorship-federal-stream-restoration-grants", "modificationDate": "2016-01-24T11:25:07-0700", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar \n \n  Staff Writer", "description": "Boulder County commissioners on Tuesday morning will consider having the county act as the official  \"local sponsor\" of a federal agency's stream-restoration grants program.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29421211:view"}, "startDate": "2016-01-24T13:15:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29421211/boulder-county-eyes-sponsorship-federal-stream-restoration-grants", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "Boulder County commissioners on Tuesday morning will consider having the county act as the official  \"local sponsor\" of a federal agency's stream-restoration grants program.", "title": "Boulder County eyes sponsorship of federal stream restoration grants program"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Boulder County commissioners on Tuesday morning will consider having the county act as the official  \"local sponsor\" of a federal agency's stream-restoration grants program.", "title": "Boulder County eyes sponsorship of federal stream restoration grants program", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29421211/boulder-county-eyes-sponsorship-federal-stream-restoration-grants", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-24T13:15:00-0700", "endDate": "2026-01-22T19:29:51-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder County eyes sponsorship of federal stream restoration grants program", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John FryarStaff", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2016-01-22T19:38:39-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Tuesday's meeting will include a public hearing and a Boulder County Creek Recovery and Restoration Program staff's presentation about that program and the potential projects.\nWhen: 9 a.m. Tuesday Where: Third floor hearing room in the Boulder County Courthouse, 1325 Pearl St., Boulder Information about Boulder County's Creek Recovery and Restoration Program: bit.ly/1JqRJiNBoulder County commissioners on Tuesday morning will consider having the county act as the official \"local sponsor\" of a federal agency's stream-restoration grants program.\nBefore any of those projects can move forward toward implementation, though, a local sponsor must be named, Boulder County officials said.\nBoulder County officials stated in a news release there are 29 stream-restoration projects in the county, with an estimated total cost of $35.8 million.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service has been allocated $47 million for awarding grants to help fund flood recovery projects in Colorado."}
