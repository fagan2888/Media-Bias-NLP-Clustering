For years, incumbent Democrat Mary Landrieu, who faces a tough, expected-to-win GOP opponent in Bill Cassidy, had fooled voters into thinking she was a moderate on the issue of abortion - until now.\n\nBenjamin Clapper, executive director of Louisiana Right to Life, a nonpartisan 501(c)(4) organization, told Townhall how Landrieu is misleading voters on her abortion record ahead of next month's runoff election.\n\n\u201cMary Landrieu and throughout all her time through 1996 as a Louisiana senator, has masked ways that she has voted in DC when she speaks to people, especially on the life issues,\" Clapper said. \"Right now, if she ever talks about the issue of abortion, she focuses on votes she made in 1998, a long time ago. She also talks about her support for adoption and she omits a decade of her voting record in support of abortion and the abortion industry.\"\n\nReality, however, paints a quite starker picture.\n\n\u201cIf you look at her record, it\u2019s gotten worse since 2008,\" Clapper explains. \"There were times before 2008 that she voted with the pro-life side, on occasion. But since 2008, it\u2019s been clear that she stands with President Obama and his abortion agenda.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Landrieu has a zero percent pro-life voting record, according to Louisiana Right to Life's records.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based on the fact that there are 16 votes the National Right to Life has scored since 2008 and she\u2019s 0 for 16 on all of them.\"\n\nThat's why Clapper and his pro-life colleagues are determined to ensure that Louisiana voters know where their candidates stand on life.\n\n\"Anything that is done in the state to reach voters and tell them the truth about her voting record, is critical because we find even now, there\u2019s so many people in the state that are confused about her voting record on the issue of abortion. So, whether it\u2019s been door-to-door efforts, whether it\u2019s been through the mail, or radio, all of those things have been important to open people\u2019s eyes to how she stands.\u201d\n\nThe pro-life group has distributed about 220,000 grassroots pieces of candidate comparison material to people across the state, both in a lot of different churches and a lot of different groups, according to Clapper.\n\nA couple other entities are involved in the pro-life battle in the Bayou, including the Women Speak Out PAC, a partner of the Susan B. Anthony List. That group, says Clapper, has knocked on about 150,000 doors since May, telling people about Landrieu\u2019s support of taxpayer-funded abortion and her 100 percent pro-abortion voting record since reelection.\n\nFinally, the National Right to Life Victory Fund has performed much needed research and exposed voters to Landrieu's abortion agenda. Specifically, they\u2019ve been focused on doing billboards, mail and radio ads. One place in particular in which the group is focusing its efforts, is Vermilion Parish, which is south of Lafayette. Abbeville is the name of the city there and has a very high Catholic population, Clapper explained. He laid out how their strategy there has gradually, yet successfully, developed.\n\n\"Abbeville is a place that has voted with Mary Landrieu in past elections, oftentimes because of the connection of the oil and gas industry, but it did not go for Mary Landrieu on November 4. We have talked to people on the ground who say that they believe part of the movement has been the disgust with Senator Landrieu\u2019s support of abortion. We have billboards there and radio ads running in that area, we had our mobile trailer that\u2019s gone through that area often. So, we really think that the issue of abortion in the pro-life community has played a strong role in this election.\n\n\"Mary Landrieu\u2019s extreme pro-abortion record is far, far away from the values of the people of Louisiana.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not kidding. Louisiana has been voted the most pro-life state in the nation for the past five years by Americans United for Life.\n\nIf anything, Landrieu's extreme pro-abortion record obliterates those lofty claims that she\u2019s a \"moderate.\"\n\n\u201cShe continually claims that she\u2019s in the middle and even the Wednesday before November 4, she had an ad in the Lafayette advertiser, which was defending her position on abortion and it was all somewhat factual in the way that she presented it,\" explained Clapper. \"What was not factual about it was the tons of information that she left out about her voting record. So, she\u2019s tried to go to those areas that would be pro-life and say, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not really that bad on this issue.\u2019 In the past, they might have bought it, they\u2019re not really buying it this time.\u201d\n\nThis time, Clapper and his fellow pro-life warriors foresee Landrieu's 18-year reign and shadowy pro-abortion legacy coming to an end. This is assuming that those who voted for former GOP candidate Col. Rob Maness, who dropped out of the running after Nov. 4, will be voting for Cassidy. But this isn't guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to all come down to the turnout on December 6. By and large, those voters who voted for Col. Maness are pro-life and so we believe they need to be reminded where the candidates stand on abortion and make sure they realize how important it is for the pro-life cause that they get out and vote on December 6.\u201d\n\nStay tuned for more coverage from here in the Bayou State as I attend a rally tonight in Kenner headlined by Sen.
