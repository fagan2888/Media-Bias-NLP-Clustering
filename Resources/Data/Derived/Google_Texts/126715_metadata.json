He keeps racking up victories, and now has been named winner of the Lie of the Year award.\n\nOops, so sorry. Being No. 1 isn\u2019t always a good thing.\n\nThen again, the sponsor of the award, PolitiFact, understated the president\u2019s great skill at bending the arc of truth. The fact-checkers called Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cif you like your health-care plan, you can keep it\u201d the biggest whopper of 2013, and 59 percent of its mostly liberal readers agreed.\n\nBut hold on, that\u2019s discrimination. Think of all the other known ObamaCare lies that got overlooked.\n\nHis promise that you can keep your doctor \u2014 that wasn\u2019t true. Nor was it true that, if you get your insurance at work, nothing will change. As for the \u201caffordable\u201d part of the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans already discovered the privilege of enrolling will cost them more money, not less.\n\nThe world knows there\u2019s no truth behind Obama\u2019s claim that the federal Web site is like shopping on Amazon. Nor, after the White House\u2019s vaunted \u201ctech surge,\u201d is the Web site functioning with \u201cprivate-sector velocity and effectiveness.\u201d\n\nThe White House lies go on and on \u2014 they haven\u2019t stopped yet, because Jay Carney\u2019s lips still are moving \u2014 but even a comprehensive list wouldn\u2019t do justice to Obama\u2019s singular achievement. Remember, he\u2019s said these things repeatedly for years, so you\u2019d need multiplication tables to get a real total.\n\nEven that wouldn\u2019t tell the whole story. The sin isn\u2019t just the sum of his various false claims. ObamaCare itself is the Big Lie. The whole thing is false.\n\nLook at this way: It now appears that not a single major promise made about the law will turn out to be credible. When it comes to delivering the product as sold, there\u2019s no there there.\n\nIn private business, that\u2019s called fraud. When the government does it, it\u2019s for your own good. Bernie Madoff would be a free man if he had gone to Washington instead of Wall Street.\n\nEven liberals who swooned over the law are coming to realize that its promise to provide universal coverage was false. Projections say that, despite ObamaCare, tens of millions of Americans will remain without health insurance.\n\nYoung people also are running away because many are realizing the law was designed to transfer wealth from them to older, sicker people. The high premiums they\u2019ll pay aim to fund reduced costs for their parents\u2019 generation.\n\nAnd get this: Thanks to the tsunami of cancellations in the individual market, some 5 million people will have lost their private insurance by Dec. 31. The vast bulk are not expected to find replacement coverage by the new year, meaning the first real impact of ObamaCare will be to take away health care for millions of people.\n\nIf that\u2019s victory, what would defeat look like?\n\nBack in 1996, then-Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey called fellow Democrat Bill Clinton an \u201cuncommonly good liar.\u201d\n\nSo true, but in hindsight, Clinton looks like an amateur. Although he later insisted he \u201cdid not have sexual relations with that woman,\u201d nobody believed him. He survived because enough people liked him anyway and believed that sex, even with an intern in the Oval Office, was a private matter.\n\nObama, on the other hand, has perpetrated a lie that is clearly a public matter. It is also of enormous consequence, one that could eventually hit most families in America one way or another.\n\nThe biggest changes almost certainly will be permanent, with price increases and different coverage and deductibles unlikely ever to be rolled back. State taxpayers will be stuck with the increased tab for Medicaid after federal subsidies end. And generations to come will pay the federal costs, which will \u2014 bet on it \u2014 soar past current estimates.\n\nAll things considered, then, the impacts of ObamaCare are gigantic and here to stay, while none of the major promises will be kept. And so calling it the Lie of the Year would be insufficient.\n\nIt\u2019s the Lie of Forever.\n\nChristie caught in GWB jam\n\nIf you\u2019re one of the unfortunate masses stuck in city gridlock this week because of \u201cemergency repairs\u201d that shut two lanes on the George Washington Bridge, you got a taste of why New Jersey Democrats are tearing at Gov. Christie. They charge that his Port Authority loyalists caused miles of traffic tie-ups around Fort Lee in September as political retaliation.\n\nChristie denied the charge, but he\u2019s also made light of it and said the resignation of two top PA aides was unrelated to the lane closures.\n\nThat\u2019s not very persuasive. It\u2019s pretty clear the aides lied when they said the lanes were closed for a traffic study. In fact, Patrick Foye, the bi-state agency\u2019s executive director, said there was no study.\n\nNaturally, Dems are eager to tarnish Christie, a likely GOP presidential candidate, but he\u2019s giving them ammunition. The unannounced closures cost commuters and businesses enormous time and money, and look like a raw abuse of power. Those are the sorts of things Christie usually rails against, yet he\u2019s not very bothered by this one.\n\nAbsent a better answer, his inartful dodges should be held against him.\n\nBy the way, why did the Port Authority pick this busy week, including rush hour, to shut down two lanes on the GW, causing backups throughout Manhattan and The Bronx? Is New York also being punished for something?\n\nDe Blasio transition a tale of dithering heights\n\nPsst \u2014 has anybody seen Bill de Blasio? If you do, remind him he\u2019s supposed to be forming a government.\n\nUnless he changes his mind, Dollar Bill will be sworn in two weeks from today and give his inauguration speech. After that, City Hall is his, ready or not. So far, he\u2019s not.\n\nTo judge by his pokey pace, he\u2019s either planning to run the government with just the five people he\u2019s named so far, including Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, or keep scores of top Bloomberg people around. The only other decision he has made is to move his family from Brooklyn to Gracie Mansion, and even that was slow.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are scratching their heads,\u201d one Bloomberg insider said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re supposed to leave on Jan. 1, or stay around for awhile.\u201d\n\nSome of a new mayor\u2019s personnel choices can wait, but others reflect the heart of his priorities. A chancellor, a budget director, an emergency chief, more deputy mayors, a fire commissioner, housing and health commissioners, a top lawyer, a planning director \u2014 they are big jobs that are key to carrying out a mayor\u2019s agenda and delivering basic services.\n\nOn second thought, given de Blasio\u2019s agenda, he should take his time. The change he\u2019s promising can wait.\n\nNever would be good.\n\nCity is off the wall\n\nA headline said the city is planning to open a \u201chigh school with no walls.\u201d\n\nWell, that\u2019s one way to cut costs.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Congratulations to President Obama.
