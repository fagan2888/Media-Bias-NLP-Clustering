Dear Mr. President Barack Obama,

Hi, my name is Joanna and I am writing to you from your country, America. It has come to my attention that some communities of people in America do not believe in certain things that are facts. Crazy? Yes, so much crazy. I have watched you and your friend, Mr. Vice President Joe Biden, on television trying to reason with these people in ways that show you still respect them as Humans and as American Citizens. I think maybe that is the wrong approach, because they are clearly not getting the picture, and now even that Ted Cruz guy thinks he could be the president — which is almost kind of adorable, like how a dog thinks it can catch its own tail, except that he is also, terrifyingly, a United States senator.

Anyway, I have taken it upon myself, as a concerned citizen, to suggest some policies that you could implement to help people who don’t believe in science realize the error of their ways.

Thank you,

Joanna, a taxpayer
