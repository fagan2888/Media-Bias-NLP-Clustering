Hutchinson, KS---For the second time, Niceville is home to the JUCO men's basketball national champs.

The Northwest Florida Raiders won the 2015 NJCAA National Title Saturday night, defeating South Plains (TX) 83-80 in overtime.

Benji Bell scored a game-high 28 points, while Jalen Jackson, who scored the go-ahead bucket in extra time, added 19. Brandon Austin had 15.

The championship is the first for the school since the 1994-95 season, back when the school was named Okaloosa-Walton College.

The Raiders made their third appearance in the NJCAA Finals in the last four years, their first time being led in the championship by Steve DeMeo. The 2014-15 season ii his second year on the job.

An early first half lead was washed away by an 18-0 run by South Plains towards the end of the first twenty minutes of action. NWF charged back and went into the locker rooms at the break ahead 37-36 thanks to a Keith Charleston layup before time expired.

Northwest Florida kept that lead early on in the second half, thanks to a hot streak by Bell, yet the Texans regained control and lead with under a minute to go in regulation. With 33 seconds left in the finals, Xavier Moon hit a three from the right corner to tie the contest at 71.

A Bell steal gave the Raiders a chance to win it in 40 minutes, yet Treshaad Williams lay in rimmed in-and-out, sending the game to overtime.

There, SPC again ran ahead, and again, NWF answered. Jalen Jackson tied the game at 79 before laying in a finger roll with 44 seconds remaining for the lead.

Jarin Hilson hit a pair of free-throws with 27 seconds left to give NWF a three point cushion, then defended South Plains' last-second shot to tie, forcing a miss, and guaranteeing this Raiders team a spot in school history.

Austin was named Tournament MVP, while Bell and Jackson were added to the All-Tournament team.

The squad will ship out of Hutchinson at 8 AM Sunday and plans to return to Niceville at 2 AM Monday morning.
