The wave of pro-life victories in the 2014 election helped set the stage for this first-of-its-kind legislation, which would protect unborn children from the brutality of dismemberment abortion.\n\n\u201cDismemberment abortion kills a baby by tearing her apart limb from limb,\u201d said National Right to Life Director of State Legislation Mary Spaulding Balch, J.D. \u201cBefore the first trimester ends, the unborn child has a beating heart, brain waves, and every organ system in place. Dismemberment abortions occur after the baby has reached these milestones.\u201d\n\nSponsored by state Sen. Garrett Love (R-Montezuma), the Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act is the top state legislative priority for National Right to Life\u2019s affiliate, Kansans for Life (KFL). In announcing the bill at a press conference in Topeka, KFL Legislative Director Kathy Ostrowski observed, \u201cWith the discussion about, and passage of this bill, the public will see that dismemberment abortions brutally \u2013 and unacceptably \u2013 rip apart small human beings who have all of their internal organs and who have perfectly formed fingers and toes.\u201d\n\nD&E dismemberment abortions are as brutal as the partial-birth abortion method, which is now illegal in the United States.\n\nIn his dissent to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2000 Stenberg v. Carhart decision, Justice Kennedy observed that in D&E dismemberment abortions, \u201cThe fetus, in many cases, dies just as a human adult or child would: It bleeds to death as it is torn limb from limb. The fetus can be alive at the beginning of the dismemberment process and can survive for a time while its limbs are being torn off.\u201d Justice Kennedy added in the Court\u2019s 2007 opinion, Gonzales v. Carhart, which upheld the ban on partial-birth abortion, that D&E abortions are \u201claden with the power to devalue human life\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen abortion textbooks describe in cold, explicit detail exactly how to kill a human being by ripping off arms and legs piece by piece, civilized members of society have no choice but to stand up and demand a change,\u201d added Spaulding Balch. \u201cWhen you think it can\u2019t be uglier, the abortion industry continues to shock with violent methods of abortion.\u201d\n\nA medical illustration of a D&E dismemberment abortion is available here.\n\nBackground materials on the bill are available on the National Right to Life website. Included in the background materials is the testimony of Anthony Levatino, M.D., before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice in May 2013, in which he described in great detail the D&E dismemberment abortions he once performed.\n\nRIGHT-TO-LIFE EFFORTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL\n\nPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\n\nThe right-to-life movement\u2019s top congressional priority for the new 114th Congress is the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill is based on NRLC-originated model legislation that has been enacted in 10 states. It would generally protect unborn children from abortion beginning at 20 weeks fetal age (the start of the sixth month), based on their capacity by that point, if not earlier, to experience excruciating pain during the abortion process.\n\nThe legislation passed the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, by a vote of 228-196, but did not receive a vote in the Senate during 2013-2014. It was reintroduced in the House of Representatives as H.R. 36 on January 6, 2015, by Reps. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) and Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), and the House Republican leadership has indicated that the House will take up the bill on January 22 (the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade).\n\nCompanion legislation will soon be reintroduced in the Senate by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). The new Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has vowed that the Senate will take up the bill at some point during the Congress.\n\n\u201cIn the new Congress, every member of the House and Senate will go on record on whether to permit the continued killing of pain-capable unborn children,\u201d said National Right to Life Federal Legislative Director Douglas Johnson.\n\nIn a nationwide poll of 1,623 registered voters in November 2014, The Quinnipiac University Poll found that 60% would support a law such as the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act prohibiting abortion after 20 weeks, while only 33% opposed such legislation. Women voters split 59-35% in support of such a law, while independent voters supported it by 56-36%.\n\nSome of the extensive evidence that unborn children have the capacity to experience pain, at least by 20 weeks fetal age, is available on the NRLC website at www.nrlc.org/abortion/fetalpain and also here: www.doctorsonfetalpain.com.\n\nNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\n\nAt the time Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, an array of long-established laws, including the Hyde Amendment, had created a nearly uniform policy that federal programs did not pay for abortion or subsidize health plans that included coverage of abortion, with narrow exceptions. Regrettably, provisions of the 2010 Obamacare health law ruptured that longstanding policy. Among other objectionable provisions, the Obamacare law authorized massive federal subsidies to assist many millions of Americans to purchase private health plans that will cover abortion on demand.\n\nThe No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) and Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), would codify the principles of the Hyde Amendment on a permanent government-wide basis, with respect both to longstanding federal health programs (Medicaid, SCHIP, FEHB, etc.) and to new programs created by the Obamacare law. For example, under the bill, exchange-participating health plans that cover elective abortion would not be eligible for federal subsidies.\n\nFurther information about federal funding of abortion is available on the National Right to Life website here.\n\nNational Right to Life experts, including President Carol Tobias, Director of State Legislation Mary Spaulding Balch, J.D., and Federal Legislative Director Douglas Johnson are available to provide further information and commentary on the Right to Life Movement\u2019s 2015 legislative agenda.

Recognized as the flagship of the pro-life movement, NRLC works through legislation and education to protect innocent human life from abortion, infanticide, assisted suicide and euthanasia.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/2013-nrlc-logo.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd246\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBefore the first trimester ends, the unborn child has a beating heart, brain waves, and every organ system in place.\n\u201cWhen you think it can\u2019t be uglier, the abortion industry continues to shock with violent methods of abortion.\u201dA medical illustration of a D&E dismemberment abortion is available here.\n\u201cDismemberment abortion kills a baby by tearing her apart limb from limb,\u201d said National Right to Life Director of State Legislation Mary Spaulding Balch, J.D.\nRIGHT-TO-LIFE EFFORTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVELPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection ActThe right-to-life movement\u2019s top congressional priority for the new 114th Congress is the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.\nFurther information about federal funding of abortion is available on the National Right to Life website here."}
