TORONTO — Toronto general manager Masai Ujiri used an expletive Saturday talking about Washington forward Paul Pierce when addressing fans before the Raptors playoff opener.

“People want me to say something about Paul Pierce but, we don’t give a [expletive] about ‘it’,” Ujiri told a cheering crowd outside the Air Canada Centre in an area dubbed “Jurassic Park.”

Ujiri was referring to the Wizards veteran who earlier this week told ESPN he wasn’t worried about the Raptors because “I don’t feel they have the ‘it’ that makes you worried.”

NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who attended Saturday’s game in Toronto, told TSN that Ujiri’s comments were “not appropriate.”

Last year, Ujiri was fined $25,000 by the NBA for ending a speech with an expletive before the team’s postseason opener against the Brooklyn Nets.
