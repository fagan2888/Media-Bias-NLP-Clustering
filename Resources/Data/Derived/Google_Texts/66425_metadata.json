Both men are addicted to heroin. But they haven\u2019t used the drug since they finished a residential treatment program a week or so earlier.\n\n\u201cThis happens a lot, there\u2019s the two of us sitting together,\u201d says Jeremy Wurzburg, a thin, pale 21-year-old who became addicted to heroin two years ago.\n\n\u201cWe both,\u201d Wurzburg pauses, \u201cwe\u2019re not sure whether we\u2019re going to use or not and someone makes like a half joke: \u2018We could just go out and drink right now\u2019 or something and the other one\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s do that, sounds good.\u2019 And then it\u2019s off.\u201d\n\nThat moment, for Wurzburg, could lead right back to his drug of choice, heroin. Most recovery programs, he says, don\u2019t \u2014 and maybe can\u2019t \u2014 prepare patients in early recovery to fight that urge alone.\n\n\u201cOnce I got out of treatment into the real world, it was a big shock,\u201d Wurzburg says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy not to use while you\u2019re in rehab. It\u2019s not put in front of you or anything. But then once I got out into the real world, it\u2019s like, I had the knowledge of what to do, but I didn\u2019t have the, those skills yet, or the tools to say \u2018no.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf patients addicted to heroin who stop, 40 to 60 percent relapse within the first year. For many it happens soon after finishing a recovery program.\n\n\u2018Custom-Tailored\u2019 Recovery Help\n\nThe next time Wurzburg walked out of a treatment facility, he stepped into a new young adult recovery program. It\u2019s a one-year pilot project at Gosnold, which runs a network of addiction treatment services on Cape Cod.\n\nWurzburg agreed to live in a sober house, attend daily 12-step group meetings and get individual counseling. Participants can download a smartphone app that has a panic button, a list of addiction services and GPS tracking if patients want their coaches to know when they are near common heroin sale and use sites. There are group trips to ski, hike and listen to the symphony. Perhaps most importantly, Wurzburg has help daily, sometimes hourly, from a recovery coach.\n\n\n\n\u201c[We show patients] how to manage their emotions, how to fill out job applications, how to go to meetings, how to take care of themselves, how to go back to school,\u201d says Wurzburg\u2019s coach, Kristoph Pydynkowski, who calls himself a \u201ccheerleader, beacon of hope.\u201d\n\nPydynkowski himself has been off heroin for seven years.\n\n\u201cOur job is to replace the old positive feeling about getting high with a new positive trigger point for recovery.\u201d \u2013 Coach Kristoph Pydynkowski\n\nHe ticks off the list of things he and Wurzburg do together. There are the visits with Wurzburg\u2019s parents. Pydynkowski helps Wurzburg manage his mom\u2019s to do list: find a doctor, get your car inspected. Pydynkowski flew to Los Angeles with Wurzburg for a reunion with Wurzburg\u2019s twin brother. The two men meet often at 6:15 a.m. for coffee before a 12-step meeting. They go fishing, hiking and kayaking; Wurzburg loves the outdoors.\n\n\u201cOur job,\u201d Pydynkowski says, \u201cis to replace the old positive feeling about getting high with a new positive trigger point for recovery.\u201d He glances at Wurzburg and smiles. \u201cThere is life after drugs.\u201d\n\nPydynkowski helps the 10 patients he manages create and follow a weekly recovery treatment plan.\n\n\u201cThis is really hands on,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really custom-tailored for the patient and their needs at the time.\u201d\n\nGosnold director Ray Tamasi says this aggressive approach is paying off. Tamasi compared the medical records of 54 18- to 28-year-olds one year before, and one year into, the pilot program. There was an 83 percent reduction in admissions to rehabilitation facilities for the one-year-in group. Emergency room admissions went from 16 to one. There were no new legal offenses.\n\nSeveral foundations (Tamasi did not want to name them) funded the Gosnold program at a cost of $310,000. Tamasi says the program saved 37 percent because fewer people spent time in rehab.\n\n\u201cThink about the cost benefit,\u201d Tamasi says. \u201cIf at 19, you\u2019re cycling in and out of treatment, but there\u2019s an alternative \u2014 going back to school and living life.\u201d\n\nHe looks across a desk at Wurzburg and 19-year-old Brittany Pimental, who is also in the program.\n\n\u201cThis makes sense economically, and it makes sense simply from the value we place on the human life,\u201d Tamasi says.\n\nAnd it may make more sense than just increasing the number of beds in recovery facilities, he says, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t just keep people in beds all the time. They have to come out at some point.\u201d\n\nPimental, a small woman with long dark hair, had one relapse before joining the young adult recovery program. \u201cI thought I could do it [recovery] on my own,\u201d she says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nPimental, who is from Falmouth, is trying to create a drug-free life in the same town where she had a network of friends and a boyfriend who used heroin. Pydynkowski, she says, really helps. He stops by her sober house. She sees him at the gym. He\u2019s in touch with Pimental\u2019s mother.\n\nTreat It Like A Chronic Disease\n\nRecommendations out this week from a task force on opiate abuse include more peer support and home-based counseling. Health insurers and state Medicaid leaders say they will look at funding for recovery coaches, but there is no plan to do so right now.\n\nAcross the country, there\u2019s growing interest in using recovery coaches to help heroin users stop, says Robert Lubran, director of the division of pharmacologic therapies at the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. At least one state, New York, is paying for coaches to help treat addiction through its Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cThis is an evolving field,\u201d Lubran says. \u201c[We are] learning more and more about the best ways to treat addiction and certainly the use of peer counselors, or peer coaches, has become more and more widespread.\u201d\n\nThe use of coaches is built on the idea that addiction is a disease patients will deal for life.\n\n\u201cWe [in the substance abuse community] certainly see addiction to a whole set of substances as a chronic condition,\u201d Lubran says. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing body of evidence that it is not an acute condition, so much as a long standing chronic disorder that requires lengthy treatment.\u201d\n\nBut that may not be true for all patients.\n\n\u201cOnly about 30 percent continue to have problems for years and years,\u201d says Dr. Richard Saitz, chair and professor of community health sciences and medicine at the Boston University School of Public Health. The other 70 percent will have one episode, \u201cwhich may last for a few years, and then they\u2019ll be in recovery,\u201d says Saitz.\n\n\u201cMen and women with a strong family history for substance abuse are at higher risk for the chronic form of this disease,\u201d Saitz says. For these patients, he says it\u2019s important to call addiction a chronic disease so that it will be treated by primary doctors in a general medical setting, not just in rehabilitation facilities.\n\n\u201cWe should be looking at [addiction] just like other conditions that we manage,\u201d he says.\n\nThese days, when doctors and nurses are often on a budget, and urged to keep patients healthy to save money, they have a financial incentive to consider addiction along with everything that affects a patient\u2019s health.\n\nPydynowski is teaching his patients, Wurzburg and Pimental, to treat addiction as they would hypertension or diabetes.\n\n\u201c[It\u2019s like] taking insulin, watching my diet, getting my blood work drawn, going to different appointments, walking on the treadmill, making sure I\u2019m taking care of myself,\u201d Pydynkowski says. \u201cThis is the same thing.\u201d\n\nWurzburg is managing his recovery one day at a time and making headway. He\u2019s applying for jobs at gardening centers and planning to go back to college.\n\n\u201c[My focus now is on] learning life skills and feeling like a productive member of society,\u201d Wurzburg says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get clean to just live in a sober house, use food stamps and welfare. I want to feel like a productive member of society.\u201d\n\nWurzburg tugs at his fingers and shifts in his chair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to keep doing a little better than I did yesterday,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Of heroin addicts who stop using, 40 to 60 percent relapse within the first year.
