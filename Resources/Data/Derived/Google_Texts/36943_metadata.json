But there are occasions when a specific date is written into the bill. This year, we passed several bills that will take effect January 1, 2016. These impact everything from restaurant menus to tax brackets.\n\nThis week, we would like to take the time to inform you of the changes that will be taking place and how they may impact you and your family in 2016.\n\nWe passed legislation ensuring that all healthcare plans provided under the Affordable Care Act in Arkansas must provide the minimum benefits for pediatric oral health. These benefits go into effect at the beginning of the year.\n\nAnother change we made you may notice at your grocery story or restaurant menu. Act 1191 requires that catfish that is not from the United States be labeled \u201cimported.\u201d The catfish industry in Arkansas is the third largest in the nation. The legislation also requires that a distinction be made in packaging if it includes catfish or catfish-like products.\n\nWe made a few changes impacting driver\u2019s licenses. For starters, driver\u2019s licenses issued after January 1, 2016 will not expire for 8 years. Until now drivers have had to renew every 4 years.\n\nAnd for those who have had their driver\u2019s license suspended as a result of outstanding reinstatement fees, we passed legislation that created a program to lighten the financial burden of getting back behind the wheel. Act 1193 states that if an individual has paid all court costs and fees associated with the suspension and completed a specialty court program such as drug court, then the driver\u2019s license can be reinstated for a one-time fee of $100.\n\nAct 934 requires that beginning next year, physicians cannot perform an abortion on a minor unless she obtains notarized consent from one of her parents or legal guardian.\n\nCome tax time, you may also see the impact of our recent tax cuts. The income tax will be reduced by for those making between $21,000 and $75,000. The reduction became effective at the beginning of 2015 so you will notice the change in this year\u2019s tax filings. Those making above $75,000 will see the reduction next year.\n\nAnd farmers and ranchers will receive an income tax exemption for payment from an agricultural disaster program.\n\nThere are several other pieces of miscellaneous legislation which will also go into effect at the beginning of the year. The ones described will have the broadest reaching impact on our state.\n\nWe look forward to continued progress for your family and for our state in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Magnolia Reporter - Magnolia, Arkansas News", "description": "Weekly column written for members of the Arkansas House of Representatives:", "title": "Arkansas House: New laws impact taxes, drivers licenses, abortions", "url": "http://www.magnoliareporter.com/news_and_business/opinion/article_dde6ca0e-9b12-11e5-9090-b3ba5b19ab1b.html", "image": {"width": 930, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magnoliareporter.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/8b/78b44e52-9b14-11e5-81ea-af3de558d850/56627c2f7e056.image.jpg?resize=930%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Weekly column written for members of the Arkansas House of Representatives:", "fb": {"app_id": 240142449451687}, "keywords": "arkansas house,december 6 2015,opinion", "google-site-verification": "j8e2txelFw-OcuofxHXFP4WKr7__yaGYzMY55hOw3yk", "news_keywords": "arkansas house,december 6 2015,opinion"}, "article_summary": "We passed legislation ensuring that all healthcare plans provided under the Affordable Care Act in Arkansas must provide the minimum benefits for pediatric oral health.\nThere are several other pieces of miscellaneous legislation which will also go into effect at the beginning of the year.\nThe legislation also requires that a distinction be made in packaging if it includes catfish or catfish-like products.\nAct 1191 requires that catfish that is not from the United States be labeled \u201cimported.\u201d The catfish industry in Arkansas is the third largest in the nation.\nFor starters, driver\u2019s licenses issued after January 1, 2016 will not expire for 8 years."}
