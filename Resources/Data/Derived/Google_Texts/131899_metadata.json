(Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nIf Washington is merely a government town, no one told the venture capital community.\n\nInvestors have funneled sizeable sums of cash over the past several months into a string of local companies that hail from a broad swath of industries, including education technology, retail software, digital media and restaurants.\n\nIndividually, these small but growing companies don\u2019t pack much economic punch. But taken together, they are a positive sign that the regional economy is starting to diversify beyond the federal government and its many contractors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little unfair to paint the region as overly focused on contracting and defense,\u201d said John Backus, managing partner at Reston-based investment firm New Atlantic Ventures. \u201cThat\u2019s a brush we get painted with mostly from people outside the region.\u201d\n\nStill, there\u2019s no doubt that the federal government has long been the buttress of Washington\u2019s economy, providing thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in contracts. As the government begins to retrench, however, economists believe the local job market could see an influx of talented technologists. They have to work somewhere, and young companies offer one possibility.\n\nSweetgreen co-founders Nicolas Jammet, Nathaniel Ru and Jonathan Neman at the restaurant\u2019s headquarters in 2013. (Jeffrey MacMillan)\n\nHigh-tech workforce\n\nIf a new growth engine is to start revving, a recent spate of deals might suggest where the spark will originate.\n\nLanham-based Optoro, which develops software for retailers to process and sell the merchandise customers return, raised $50 million in December from investors that include Silicon Valley\u2019s Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.\n\nThat same week, District-based TrackMaven announced a $14 million haul led by Chevy Chase-based New Enterprise Associates. Founded two years ago, the company\u2019s software allows major consumer companies to monitor their online marketing efforts.\n\n\u201cThose clearly are building off of the technology-intensive workforce that we have, which one could say was attracted here because of federal contracting opportunities and are now available because those federal contracting opportunities are shrinking,\u201d said Stephen Fuller, director of the Center for Regional Analysis.\n\nThe growth of the federal government in recent decades has been a major boon for the local economy. Defense and civilian agencies provide thousands of jobs throughout Maryland, Virginia and the District, not to mention the myriad institutions whose budgets are supported through federal grants or appropriations.\n\nFrom 1983 to 2010, the total value of federal contracts performed in the region increased from $7 billion to $83.1 billion, according to George Mason University\u2019s Center for Regional Analysis. That has propelled some area contractors into the region\u2019s largest publicly traded companies, among them Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman.\n\nBut the Center for Regional Analysis also found that federal contracting activity decreased by $13.5 billion, or 16 percent, between 2010 and 2013. Just as greater Washington disproportionately benefits from the government\u2019s growth, it disproportionately suffers during periods of decline.\n\nJim Bankoff, chairman and chief executive of Vox Media. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nThe next hot sectors\n\nMany in the region\u2019s entrepreneurial community say the government\u2019s weighty presence will influence the region\u2019s next big industries. Those that are heavily regulated by the federal government, for example, are deepening their roots in Washington.\n\nInvestors and entrepreneurs regularly name health care, education and green technology as hot sectors in Washington for that very reason.\n\nPrivia Health offers a banner example. In late September, the Arlington-based health-care company raised $400 million to expand the network of physicians who join its medical group. The company uses software to connect patients with doctors when they are not in the office.\n\nThe company now plans to add doctors in Texas, Florida, Georgia and New York. The driver of that growth? The Affordable Care Act, which changes how doctors provide care and get paid for it, chief executive Jeff Butler said.\n\nReston-based Echo360, which provides hundreds of colleges with software to enhance student performance, added $18 million to its coffers in November. The company has raised $67 million to date, and counts 115 employees, including 70 in Northern Virginia.\n\nThat same month, Arlington-based cybersecurity firm Endgame collected $30 million. The company is now pushing into the private sector after getting its start as, you guessed it, a government contractor. It\u2019s a path other companies are following as well.\n\n\u201cIt does show that the Washington economy is adaptable. What we need to do is build more business-to-business activity instead of business-to-government,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nFor Backus, the investor at New Atlantic Ventures, one of the most important characteristics of all these deals is their size. Investors pour larger sums of money into later-stage companies, and those are the ventures most likely to hire employees and ultimately go public or become an acquisition target.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff going on at the seed level. Most of those companies never break through and make it to the big time,\u201d Backus said. \u201cThese are all later-stage rounds in companies that already got some traction and scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe later stage means these are real businesses,\u201d he added.\n\nBut even real businesses sometimes fail to reach their full potential. The barriers that stand between young companies, including those with well-heeled investors, and the kind of sustained success needed to make an economic impact are numerous and often unpredictable. After all, it wasn\u2019t that long ago when the online deals site LivingSocial appeared ready to make the leap. The D.C. company has since retrenched.\n\nCenter for media and hospitality\n\nVox Media grabbed headlines in early December when the online media company raised $46.5 million from investors. The deal valued the District-based company, which operates SB Nation, the Verge and Vox.com, among other Web properties, at roughly $380 million.\n\nAt first blush, Vox Media seems like the kind of company that should be located in a city like New York or San Francisco. But Washington has long been home to a constellation of media companies.\n\nAside from The Washington Post, of course, Gannett, Albritton Communications, National Geographic and Discovery Communications employ thousands of people locally. Indeed, Vox Media chief executive Jim Bankoff served as executive vice president of programming and products at AOL back when the Internet pioneer was headquartered in Dulles.\n\nAnd media is just one of Washington\u2019s industries whose economic impact often stands in the shadows of the federal government. Hospitality \u2014 think Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide and Host Hotels and Resorts \u2014 is another example.\n\nIn November, Sweetgreen pulled in $18.5 million from investors as the salad chain expands to the West Coast. There aren\u2019t many national restaurant chains based in the Washington region, but Sweetgreen was founded by three Georgetown University graduates who opened the first location close to campus.\n\n\u201cWashington has always attracted the 25- to 35-year-old group as an interesting place where people come here and become seasoned. That used to be the pattern. Today, there is just a lot of young people here, and a lot of them have decided they can do it better themselves,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nThat means they\u2019re creating their own companies that could attract the next wave of investments \u2014 and ultimately become the region\u2019s big players. And the number of fledgling start-ups in the region is only poised to grow as area universities pour more resources into fostering young entrepreneurs and more incubator spaces, such as 1776, Disruption Corp. and Refraction, open their doors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of high-quality companies out there that are raising money and the fact that they\u2019re in different industries is a good leading indicator for the region,\u201d Backus said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A string of recent investments in firms from a wide range of industries point to an evolution of the local economy.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/stevenoverly", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A string of recent investments in firms from a wide range of industries point to an evolution of the local economy.", "title": "Is there more to Washington\u2019s economy than the government?
