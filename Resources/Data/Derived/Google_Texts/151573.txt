There’s no one quite like Grimes, and the budding alternative pop star wrote another chapter in her unique DIY-meets-mainstream story Friday afternoon at Governors Ball. “This is a really special show for me because I’m gonna try out some new shit,” Grimes (real name Claire Boucher) proudly announced taking the stage, introducing a set that included a sampling of her forthcoming 2014 album and a closing track originally written for Rihanna.
