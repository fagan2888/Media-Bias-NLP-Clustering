At Highland, students have become park rangers in charge of forest management and pizza parlor employees mastering the art of making change. The building even owns 20 fog machines to set the scene.\n\nShein did, however, have one hesitation.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Highland definitely is not a slice of Bend. It\u2019s fairly homogeneous, economically speaking,\u201d Shein said. \u201cThrough fifth grade, we\u2019re concerned about them being in a bubble, but we\u2019ll make sure to do the extra things to get them beyond that.\u201d\n\nHighland has the lowest poverty rate among elementary schools in the district, and overall, the three-school magnet program is significantly less disadvantaged than the district at large. All three magnets \u2014 Highland, Amity Creek and Westside Village \u2014 are also disproportionately filled with students from the city\u2019s west side.\n\nPrincipals, school board members and district administrators point to many reasons why the magnet population fails to represent the district, but there are ideas to push the schools toward serving a more diverse range of students.\n\nSchool choice\n\nSuperintendent Ron Wilkinson said offering parents a choice of where to send their kids to school is \u201ca top priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot everyone learns the same, not everyone goes from A to B and A to Z the same way,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cKids learn differently, and some kids really do need a different environment.\u201d\n\nTo this end, the district makes it easy for students to transfer to any of its neighborhood schools. Many of the neighborhood schools have a special focus, such as technology at Juniper and art at Elk Meadow. There is also a Spanish language immersion program for a small group of students at Bear Creek.\n\nThe three magnet schools, however, stand apart for the manner in which students are admitted and the degree to which their specialized approach is apparent throughout the school day.\n\nAmity Creek, which was the district\u2019s smallest elementary school by enrollment at the start of the year, emphasizes interactions across ages and with parents, who are invited to join the school for a student-led assembly each morning. At Westside Village, which enrolls students from kindergarten through eighth grade, there\u2019s a similar emphasis on mixing ages, with the older kids often leading the younger. The school also bases its work around a schoolwide theme that students are able to explore as they wish.\n\n\u201cI think our model promotes self-advocacy, high levels of self-esteem and a sense of family,\u201d said Westside Village Principal Wendy Winchel.\n\nHow students are admitted to the magnets depends on where they live and where their siblings go to school. All of the three magnets has a \u201cwalking zone\u201d around them, which grants any family living within it automatic acceptance. Because the three magnets are grouped closely together on the city\u2019s west side, these boundaries overlap in some spots, giving certain families the opportunity to send their kid to one of two magnet schools and their neighborhood school.\n\nFor a student outside of the attendance zone, admission is left up to a lottery. However, if a student\u2019s older sibling attends or is a graduate, they are generally admitted automatically.\n\nCurrently, the three magnet schools are dominated by students from the district\u2019s four west-side elementary schools, especially High Lakes and Miller, which make up more than half of the student population at Highland.\n\nThe magnets\u2019 students are also wealthier than the district at large, reflecting the fact that the student populations at High Lakes and Miller are the two least disadvantaged neighborhood elementary schools in the district, as measured by the rate of students receiving free and reduced lunches.\n\nOverall, just more than 50 percent of the district\u2019s elementary-aged students qualify for free and reduced lunch. At the magnets, the rate is about 30 percent; at Highland it is about 9 percent. In total, only 36 students from the district\u2019s four most disadvantaged schools attend the three magnets, compared to 511 from the four west-side elementary schools.\n\nShein, who is the president of the Highland Parent-Teacher Organization, estimated that \u201c99 percent\u201d of parents don\u2019t even realize the school has a volunteer to help low-income families.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the perception that there isn\u2019t a need for someone like that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the downfall of the school.\u201d\n\nWalking zones\n\nDrafting the walking zones, Wilkinson said, was \u201ca mix of art and science.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy design and board policy, there\u2019s not equitable access to the magnets, because of the zones, which were made to address a revolt taking place from parents on the west side of town,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cThere was a huge interest in making sure people who live right across from the school could attend.\u201d\n\nThe zones, which overlap with the Miller and High Lakes attendance areas, are intended to only account for 20 percent of each magnet\u2019s population, a target Wilkinson estimated the district is hitting. At its greatest distance, the zone stretches about 11\u20444 miles from Westside Village, though typically the outer reaches are just under a mile from each building.\n\nRon Paradis, who was a school board member from 1999 to 2005, said the policy was implemented to \u201cgive people living next door some form of a preference.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the policy, as it\u2019s interpreted today, takes that idea way further than it should have,\u201d Paradis said. \u201cBecause the schools are so close, some families can get their kids into almost any of them, and I think that hurts access for those left to the lottery. I would also question how many of the kids who do go there and are within the walking zones truly walk.\u201d\n\nAmity Creek Principal Carol Hammett said, \u201cif we were able to change any policy, it would be the zone around the school.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the demographics around Amity, you have to have a pretty high income to own the condos, townhomes and houses down by Drake Park,\u201d she said. \u201cWe as a faculty believe the zone should be lifted to increase diversity.\u201d\n\nHighland Principal Paul Dean said he sympathizes with those who pushed for the zones.\n\n\u201cIf I put myself in the shoes of a parent who lives within walking distance, and I thought about road congestion or the environmental impact, I think I would want to be able to send my kid to the closest school,\u201d he said.\n\nSchool board member Peggy Kinkade says the zones \u201cseem bigger than I would have drawn them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t in the room doing it, so it\u2019s easy to say that now,\u201d she added. \u201cI still support the notion of a walking zone, of them being accessible to people right there, but I understand how they may limit access across the district. It\u2019s tricky to balance that.\u201d\n\nMaking things worse, Kinkade said, is the fact that the three magnets are so close together.\n\n\u201cThe district unintentionally created a monster there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe placement of the magnets was forced, in part, by rapid population growth on the west side. The three magnet programs were originally co-located within other schools, as Bear Creek\u2019s immersion program is today. To help with crowding, new schools were built on the west side, while the older, smaller buildings were left to the magnets, which also absorbed students crowded out of their neighborhood schools.\n\n\u201cThe three of them located so close to each other has been problematic, because it does tend to draw a lot of students from a smaller geographical area,\u201d Wilkinson said. \u201cUnfortunately, once they\u2019re located, it\u2019s hard to relocate them. We\u2019ve considered relocating, but there\u2019s been a lot of issues, including whether or not we have the capacity to take that on.\u201d\n\nWilkinson, however, said he thinks the sibling policy limits access even further than the walking zones, as younger brothers and sisters of current magnet school children nearly fill up new kindergarten classes before they are even open to the lottery.\n\n\u201cTake Amity, where over 50 percent of all the new slots are taken up by siblings; that really has a big impact,\u201d Wilkison said.\n\nNonetheless, the three magnet principals said they generally support the sibling policy, as it helps develop a sense of community between the parents and schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important for us to build those ties with the families, some of them we have with us for nine years or more, and that\u2019s just been critical to developing our program,\u201d said Westside Village Principal Winchel.\n\nA long ride\n\nOnly two students attend Westside Village from the La Pine area, a number that has been falling, Winchel believes, because of the price of gas.\n\n\u201cWe have buses, but they can sometimes take 90 minutes,\u201d Winchel noted. \u201cIt\u2019s super hard for some families, and I think we\u2019ve lost some awesome families because they couldn\u2019t afford the gas and didn\u2019t want to put their kids on the bus for such a long ride.\u201d\n\nThe district has two routes that stretch more than an hour taking kids from across Bend to the magnet schools. Neither of the routes, however, serves the La Pine area.\n\nWilkinson said the lack of convenient busing \u201cis a great limitation\u201d and something he hopes to address, though he said the cost of getting a quick route from every corner of the district to the magnets would be prohibitive.\n\n\u201cI think we could absolutely be doing more in terms of transportation,\u201d said board co-chairman Nori Juba. \u201cI believe we\u2019re offering fair access in that everyone can put their name in the lottery, but if you don\u2019t have the means to get there, is that really fair?\u201d\n\nJuba noted wealthier families may have a greater ability to drive their kids, but he also said those families are also more likely to be aware of their options and engaged in their child\u2019s education.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to say eastside families are not concerned, but I think to be involved, you need to be able to have the time and means,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s also the fact that if you live on the west side you may hear about these options from other parents. It\u2019s part of the social networks over there in a way it\u2019s likely not on the east side.\u201d\n\nThe district doesn\u2019t do anything specific for low-income families to make sure they know about the magnets, according to Director of Communication and Safety Julianne Repman. However, Repman noted information about the magnets is available in Spanish and distributed in all of the district\u2019s schools.\n\nThe principals at Amity Creek and Westside Village said they do outreach at day cares, including Head Start, but Highland\u2019s principal said his school relies on the district\u2019s efforts to get the word out.\n\nSchool board co-chairwoman Cheri Helt said she doesn\u2019t think the district should have targeted advertising for low-income families.\n\n\u201cI think we should try to accommodate all children\u2019s needs, but that we shouldn\u2019t target based on (socioeconomic status),\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is about marketing, and I don\u2019t think the issue is whether or not everyone today has the same access. I think the question is, \u2018Do we have enough supply to meet our demand for choice options?\u2019 And I think we could do more.\u201d\n\nJuba said he would like the district to study if east-side parents are as familiar with the magnets as those on the west side.\n\n\u201cI think it should be our goal to make sure parents are equally aware,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should definitely make an effort to create more diverse schools, I think that benefits all the students. We don\u2019t do it by busing kids, but we do do it by getting the word out and making sure we match the kids to the right school. I think I\u2019m the most adamant board member supporting diversity, and I think the others are a little scared of the idea of forcing diversity, which sounds like making kids go where they don\u2019t want to go. But if we did a better job explaining what the magnet schools do, I think they would draw a more diverse population.\u201d\n\nKinkade said she thinks \u201cthere\u2019s certainly a perception, and likely a reality, that there\u2019s an awful lot of choice for certain kids that limits access for others.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we need to not be afraid to look at transportation,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have to make a choice about how we allocate resources and how much we\u2019re willing to give to transportation. I\u2019m open to the conversation and hope we can do what needs to be done.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-633-2160, tleeds@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Growing up, Jane Shein learned her coursework through role-playing, a component of the \u201cstoryline method\u201d of education. \u201cI can still remember things I did in fourth grade, and I\u2019m 37,\u201d Shein said. \u201cI really, really want that for my kids.\u201d Through Bend-La Pine\u2019s three-school magnet program, which is open to all district students through a lottery, Shein was able to do just that, enrolling her oldest at Highland Elementary, which employs the storytelling method.
