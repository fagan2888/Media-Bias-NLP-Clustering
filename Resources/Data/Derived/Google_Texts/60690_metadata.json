(It was more than 84% in 2000.)\n\n\u201cHow can job openings stand at 14-year highs, but the labor force participation rate for prime age people hover around levels not seen since 1984?\u201d asks Patrick Tyrrell of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Daily Signal.\n\nHow indeed. And what\u2019s keeping able bodied people out of the labor force when so many jobs are going begging?\n\nTyrrell turns to University of Chicago economics professor Casey Mulligan for answers. Mulligan posits that the root cause was an attempt by Congress to help people displaced by the recession. Democrats who controlled Congress at the time made several changes to anti-poverty subsidies, adding things like mortgage assistance programs, the benefits of which are phased out as income rises. ObamaCare provides still another one, by offering insurance subsidies that also phase out.\n\nWhile these programs might help those in need over the short term, they add to what is already a steep effective marginal tax rate for those in the phase-out range.\n\nMulligan figures the top rate for these families eligible for various federal aid programs went from 40% to 48% in the immediate aftermath of the recession. In other words, for every extra dollar someone eligible for various aid programs makes, they lose 48% from taxes and benefit reductions.\n\n\u201cHelping people is valuable but not free,\u201d Mulligan says. \u201cThe more you help low-income people, the more low-income people you\u2019ll have. The more you help unemployed people, the more unemployed people you\u2019ll have.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, politicians always seem to ignore such adverse secondary effects in their zeal to \u201cdo something.\u201d\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since the end of the recession in June 2009, the number of job openings in the private sector has steadily climbed \u2014 just as one would expect to happen as", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Since the end of the recession in June 2009, the number of job openings in the private sector has steadily climbed \u2014 just as one would expect to happen as the economy recovered.
