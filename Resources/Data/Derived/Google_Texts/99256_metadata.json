Blumenthal urges UnitedHealth Group CEO to reassess leaving ACA exchanges\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote a letter to UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley asking the insurer to reconsider departing from the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges, according to the Hartford Courant.\n\nNearly a month ago, UnitedHealth said it might exit the marketplace as early as 2017 due to a $650 million expected loss from its 55,000 customers served through the exchanges. \"We cannot sustain these losses,\" said Mr. Hemsley said in a statement, according to the report.\n\nBut Sen. Blumenthal called the potential decision \"shortsighted.\" \"This insurer has ... an ethical duty to stay with the marketplace while it stabilizes and achieves even more enrollees in the very near future,\" Sen. Blumenthal wrote in the letter.\n\nIn the letter, Sen. Blumenthal cited other insurers \u2014 such as Anthem \u2014 that remain optimistic about the exchanges and have no plans to drop out. He also said the difficulties UnitedHealth faces \u2014 including customers enrolling for a policy to cover a planned expense and then dropping out \u2014 can be conquered over time, according to the report.\n\nUnitedHealthcare spokeswoman Maria Gordon Shydlo spoke out about the issue in an email. \"United Healthcare has a longstanding public commitment to helping Americans gain access to quality care on a sustainable basis,\" Ms. Shydlo said. \"We will continue to offer our exchange plans in 2016 and will begin evaluating our plans for 2017 on a market-by-market basis in early 2016.\"\n\nMore articles on payer issues:\n\nPPOs fade from ACA exchanges: 6 things to know\n\nHealthSpan to dissolve medical group, close 11 facilities\n\nHHS partners with pharmacies for ACA enrollment events\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
