That\u2019s not just a bowl game on TV \u2014 it\u2019s a playoff game! Playoffs! Playoffs!\n\nBowl season is a rough ride. Six-win teams playing in an empty stadium on a Tuesday night on national television? But then, for every dud like one of those, there\u2019s the crazy finish we saw in the Popeyes Bahamas Bowl, in which Central Michigan combined the Kordell Stewart Hail Mary and the Cal-Stanford band-is-on-the-field play. Incidentally, there aren\u2019t any Popeyes in the Bahamas, they reported, but that fact, too, sums up the ridiculousness of bowl games and names, as well as the reality that the business of college football is business.\n\nThe three-game playoffs, though, are just awesome because they\u2019re simple and easy to follow. And because they\u2019re marquee matchups that shoo aside questions of who earned what. The college football playoffs are a neat, sweet Craftsman home in Wash Park \u2014 and the rest of the college football bowl games are the spray-painted graffiti on that home\u2019s front door.\n\nBut we watch it all because it\u2019s on. OK \u2014 you watch it all because it\u2019s on; I did my best to avoid the Zaxby\u2019s Heart of Dallas Bowl and the Raycom Media Camellia Bowl, but the point is that Americans love football and football is hypnotic and thus you could air the 1987 Poinsettia Bowl and it would get more viewers than a first-round game of the NHL playoffs.\n\nThere\u2019s so much to love about college football, and there\u2019s so much to hate about college football. And we accept it all and conveniently compartmentalize any negatives, such as an unbalanced, unfair system or the occasional criminal being lauded as a hero, because did you see that play?\n\nI\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s all just fun, this colorful world of college football. These bright uniforms in colors you didn\u2019t know existed, or helmets that look like a disco ball. And we equally adore the traditionally simple uniforms and styles, be it the numbers on the Alabama helmets or the Notre Dame gold dome. We bask ourselves in the traditions of the schools \u2014 there\u2019s really nothing like it in sports, be it the bands and bulldogs and ghosts and groves and tailgates and trash talk. And the names! Weston Steelhammer (Air Force), Cassanova McKinzy (Auburn), Lion King Conway (Eastern Michigan) and Scooby Wright III (Arizona) are members of my all-name team.\n\nBowl season gives you the rare opportunity for your Pac-12 college to play your buddy\u2019s SEC college. Bowl season inspires you to Google the names of sideline reporters and companies you didn\u2019t know were companies. Bowl season (and this will sound cheesy) gives college athletes a rare experience. Yes, the idea of being a \u201cbowl team\u201d is diluted because there are 39 bowl games. But you know what, most of these kids work unfathomably hard at being a college football player, so it\u2019s cool that they get rewarded with a trip to a new city and all the pomp and circumstance and gift bags that come with being in a bowl game.\n\nBowl season is imperfect, but so is college football, and you\u2019ll watch anyway, right? If anything, you\u2019ll watch the playoffs, because it feels like they created them just for you.\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hochman: College Football Playoff bowls over predecessor", "title": "Hochman: College Football Playoff bowls over predecessor", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/01/hochman-college-football-playoff-bowls-over-predecessor/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150101__20150102_B1_SP02FBCSUGARARTp1-1.jpg", "height": 527}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150101__20150102_B1_SP02FBCSUGARARTp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-01T21:12:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:01:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd355b\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s so much to love about college football, and there\u2019s so much to hate about college football.\nThe college football playoffs are a neat, sweet Craftsman home in Wash Park \u2014 and the rest of the college football bowl games are the spray-painted graffiti on that home\u2019s front door.\nThe traditionally messy sport of college football, exemplified by the suffocating smorgasbord of bowl games in December, now has a simplified playoff system.\nBowl season is imperfect, but so is college football, and you\u2019ll watch anyway, right?\nI\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s all just fun, this colorful world of college football."}
