Well, 20 percent of which price?\u201d asked Glenn Melnick, a professor who holds a Blue Cross of California endowed chair at the University of Southern California. \u201cSome hospitals will charge 20 percent of what Blue Cross Blue Shield will pay; others will play games.\u201d\n\nCharges for chest pain, for instance, rose 10 percent to an average of $18,505 in 2012, from $16,815 in 2011. Average hospital charges for digestive disorders climbed 8.5 percent to nearly $22,000, from $20,278 in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 2012, hospitals charged more for every one of 98 common ailments that could be compared to the previous year. For all but seven, the increase in charges exceeded the nation\u2019s 2 percent inflation rate for that year, according to The Times\u2019s analysis.\n\nExperts say the increase in the price of some of the most common procedures may be offsetting rising technology or drug costs, declines in the number of patients being admitted to hospitals and a leveling out of reimbursements from Medicare. Between 2011 and 2012, Medicare increased payment rates by only 1 percent for most inpatient stays.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140602125423, "twitter": {"description":
