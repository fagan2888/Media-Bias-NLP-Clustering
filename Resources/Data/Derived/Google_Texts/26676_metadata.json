Here are two examples from the report.\n\nPrice transparency. As the industry continues to adopt price transparency tools, payers can look to analytics to help them \"create an illustrative picture for explaining the costs of care and benefits of treatment plans for consumers.\" Often, As the industry continues to adopt price transparency tools, payers can look to analytics to help them \"create an illustrative picture for explaining the costs of care and benefits of treatment plans for consumers.\" Often, consumers don't understand the value of their healthcare nor do they know the real costs of treatment . By using analytics, payers can create an easy-to-understand discussion of value to help explain benefits to consumers that will, in turn, enable better decision-making.\n\nProvider collaboration.
