Former U.S. President Bill Clinton will travel to Mercer County this Friday, May 13, to stump for Hillary Clinton. He will hold a public event in Ewing and another event in Passaic County.

The former president will be holding the “get out the vote” event at 3:30 p.m. at the Brower Student Center at the College of New Jersey, Hillary Clinton’s campaign announced Thursday night. Doors open at 2:30 p.m.

Clinton won New Jersey in both general elections when he was a presidential candidate.

According to the Clinton campaign, he will lay out his wife’s plans for raising wages.

The Clinton campaign is gearing up for the New Jersey primary, which is Tuesday, June 7.

Chelsea Clinton visited Princeton last month to raise money for her mother’s campaign. The cost to attend a private reception with her at the event was $2,500 per person.
