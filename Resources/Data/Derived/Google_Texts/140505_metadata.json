Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely drives me crazy,\u201d Press said regarding Sunday\u2019s protest activities. \u201cThe dumbest ones there are the idiots who were protesting \u2026 they call them \u2018vets.\u2019 I wonder how many were really veterans. I don\u2019t care if they were veterans, they don\u2019t know what they hell they were doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they were organized by Heritage Action \u2014 so that\u2019s Jim DeMint. They were organized by Americans for Prosperity \u2014 that\u2019s the Koch Brothers. These people, again, don\u2019t know what the hell they\u2019re doing, don\u2019t know what they\u2019re saying, don\u2019t realize they\u2019re being used by these right-wing organizations,\u201d Press continued, \u201cand they\u2019re being used by them to argue against something that\u2019s in their own best interest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dumb can they be?\u201d he asked, expressing shock that the marchers actually support Cruz:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they realize that the guy that they were cheering yesterday, Ted Cruz, is the guy behind the shutdown? \u2026 Doesn\u2019t everybody know that? Not those idiots. He\u2019s the guy that came up with this idea that has proven to be a colossal failure. That the way to destroy and kill and get rid of Obamacare \u2014 the Affordable Care Act \u2014 is to shut down the government. That was his idea adopted by the House Republicans, and it\u2019s a total failure. Total failure.\u201d\n\nPress concluded by suggesting how the marchers should have responded to Cruz: \u201cThey should have been hanging him in effigy at the memorial. They should have been booing him.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s audio of Press\u2019 commentary:\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Left-wing radio host Bill Press on Monday ripped participants in this weekend's \"Million Vet March,\" along with their Republican leaders, particularly Texas Sen.
