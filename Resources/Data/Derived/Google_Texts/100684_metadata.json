This is the rock star as elegant dandy, stylish in tails, draped in an accent of gold jewelry, a trim white beard. It\u2019s an advertisement for the good life, if not living right.\n\nCrazy, isn\u2019t it? Because the Fleetwood on the cover has a wicked gleam in his eye, as he peers out from under a rakish hat, hair down around his shoulders. This is the Fleetwood of the mid-t0-late \u201970s, the drummer whose band was re-energized by the arrival of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, who recorded 1975\u2019s \u201cFleetwood Mac\u201d with \u201cwhite powder peeling off the walls of every room\u201d in the studio.\n\nBut the madness was only beginning: The relationships of Buckingham and Nicks, along with John and Christine McVie, were unraveling amidst angst, affairs and mountains of cocaine. \u201cRumours\u201d chronicled the dissolution of it all, selling tens of millions of albums worldwide. They were among the biggest bands in the world, and they lived every moment of it to the extreme. \u201cThe drugs of course were plentiful,\u201d Fleetwood writes, \u201cand we partook of the finest Peruvian flake quite a bit, both to numb the pain and to find the energy to persevere.\u201d\n\nEven grander extravagance followed, and I don\u2019t just mean \u201cTusk.\u201d Their contracts required fleets of limos to be available on demand. Nicks and McVie wanted their hotel rooms freshly painted in specific colors before they arrived; Nicks also required a white piano. Cocaine was measured out to the entire touring party after the show \u2014 \u201ceveryone who lined up got their packet\u201d \u2014 at a specific announced time in each city. \u201cIt was fabulously expensive, wonderful and sometimes depraved,\u201d he admits.\n\nThe hits, of course, have fueled presidential campaigns and never gone away. Even the albums you think you know are studded with gems. The albums get discovered and rediscovered and continue to influence new generations. (Note to anyone in high school, or ahem, later than that, who I made of fun for loving them, from behind the righteousness of my Smiths shirt: Sorry about that!) And the five-piece band from those iconic albums is now back together and touring into next year \u2014 Fleetwood calls it a \u201cvictory lap\u201d in the book, so you might check it out while you can \u2014 but he also reveals that the band is working on new material.\n\nAll of this, of course, is the stuff of great rock memoir, and \u201cPlay On\u201d doesn\u2019t hold back on the stories behind the songs or the dramas on the road and in the studio. Fleetwood is also deeply reflective on the relationships he sacrificed to the band, whether as a father, a husband or a son. We talked last week in New York. There was only 20 minutes and he gives long answers. The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nYou have had a very outgoing, friendly persona in this band, and yet you also reveal yourself here to really have been a difficult person to live with, to have been married to \u2014 it\u2019s a revealing, intimate book, but perhaps the person who comes off the harshest is usually you.\n\nI think it\u2019s fairly evident that I\u2019ve discovered I like to be liked. If I had to fall down on a weakness, I\u2019d prefer that to be one of them. But you can go too far the other way, which became evident working on the book. There were times where I caused problems by not speaking enough and just thinking like some child that everything is always going to be okay. After some quiet reflection, that felt like unbelievable naivet\u00e9.\n\nHow important \u2014 and difficult \u2014 is it to put all these relationships straight? The band seems to be back in a place where people are friendly and functioning and happy, reunited with Christine again, but you also go back through your personal relationships and marriages, which were difficult and affected by drugs and drinking. You took the rock lifestyle seriously, you loved it, and picked the road over family. Perhaps you found a family of sorts on the road, but when faced with actual family choices, you usually chose yourself.\n\nYes. It\u2019s really good to hear that people are going straight to the reveal \u2014 I wanted to take responsibility, and not get too heavy, and, \u201cOh, I\u2019m the worst person in the world, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d and all this stuff. But I wanted to be open and that it\u2019s OK to run yourself down a bit, because you need to own certain things. If it feels really personal, well, that\u2019s really, really, really what I wanted to do.\n\nThe word you often use in the book is the \u201clifestyle.\u201d And there are times when you\u2019re selfish, maybe even cruel, all in the service of that lifestyle.\n\nIt was hard to do, but it was OK. That\u2019s going into a whole other\u2026 that could be a bit of stepping up on a podium or something, but I\u2019m quite changed from about four years ago. I went back and I started drinking again, and my relationship with my now ex, Lynn, we were unhappy. There was no relationship going on with her or myself, we just weren\u2019t developing as people, and I look at some of that in terms of slipping into my old drinking habits \u2014 not by any means back to where I used to be when I was in my 20s or something, but it wasn\u2019t cool, and I wasn\u2019t able to listen. And that\u2019s painful.\n\nWinston Churchill\u2019s line over the years was always something like \u201cI\u2019ve gotten more out of the gin that the gin has gotten from me.\u201d Christopher Hitchens always echoed that as well.\n\nOh, yeah. Yes, yes, yes.\n\nSo if one was to substitute cocaine for gin, or wine \u2014 do you feel you\u2019ve gotten more out of the drugs and the drink than it took from you? I don\u2019t mean to romanticize it, but you all made some landmark albums under some sustained influences. But there were personal consequences as well.\n\nNo, I understand. But it\u2019s part of, God knows, this band\u2019s legacy. And majorly with me. Stevie\u2019s been very outspoken about her journey, and you know, I think a lot of that is always romanticized \u2026 especially because we were really quite naive and we were very overly open about probably too much. In retrospect, that\u2019s okay, because I think people really identify with the vulnerability, with the realness. None of this stuff is fabricated, but having said that, by being an open, slightly naive book, I think we did pay the penalty of being aggrandizing \u2014 and the war stories became completely untrue, the proportions of the depravity and God knows what.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. I would say that, having prefaced that, I\u2019m damn lucky I never killed anyone when I was driving or any other thing. Emotionally and socially, in terms of relationships with family, those are real not good marks. Lots of love, but that lifestyle definitely took a toll. Again, I\u2019m not sitting around whipping myself, you know, with fish hooks and stuff about it, because you\u2019ve just got to move on and take responsibility.\n\nHow about the music?\n\nThe music and the fun, I\u2019m loath to say, I don\u2019t think was impaired at all for a while by our lifestyle. The whole of \u201cRumours\u201d \u2014 I doubt there was one track that I ever played on that I wasn\u2019t high. It sounds OK to me.\n\nCould it have been done otherwise?\n\nI\u2019m sure it could have, you know, but it wasn\u2019t. And that\u2019s the age-old fascination of looking back. I still enjoy my wine. But I stopped drinking for 14 years, and then I went back and started, you know, drinking too much. Now I drink moderately and I think, I think, we have that all in line. I truly believe that. I\u2019m also very leery about it, because the great thing is now, you can\u2019t go on living like that. You won\u2019t be alive. I\u2019m enjoying being fit. And being able to play and be conversive with my 13-year-old, nearly 13-year-old daughters, and not have to turn around 10 years later, and say, I\u2019m sorry I read you so many fairy tales drunk that you couldn\u2019t understand me. You know, it\u2019s not cool.\n\nSo there\u2019s a bit of both, and I\u2019m not hedging answering you, but we\u2019ve already gone into something that\u2019s romanticized; it\u2019s something that actually turned really shitty. So you\u2019re reining yourself in, and yet here I am, doing what we originally did by being, I think, completely open and frank, and as we were back in the day. And you pay some form of a price maybe for doing that. Now, it\u2019s A-OK, because we have a much better perspective, or certainly I feel that I do.\n\nI think it\u2019s reining yourself in. There is definitely some romance to the war stories, you know \u2014 it\u2019s literally like war stories, where you go, \u201cWell, I know the guy was a hero.\u201d The hero eventually says under his breath, \u201cWell, yeah, I did do pretty good, and I did haul three people on my back actually \u2014 but they think I hauled 40 on my back now. And I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWell, one thing that\u2019s true with all these war stories is that you held people together. What people forget sometimes when talking about mythological rock and roll stories is that there are very real people and very real human emotions attached. One of the essential roles you play, time and again in this book, is to hold the band together, hold people together, when they were fractured or emotionally drained and perhaps not in the right mind to do the kind of work that had to be done.\n\nWell\u2026 I think there were moments \u2014 they\u2019re not too many \u2014 and I haven\u2019t ended up like Scrooge, where you mutter, \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d and you wake up in a cold sweat in the middle of the night and go, \u201cI should have let the whole thing just go, and no one would have had all this trouble.\u201d So I\u2019m OK with that. I really am OK with it. In a humorous moment or two, I go, \u201cWow, I never looked at it like that. Maybe that wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s interesting \u2014 you mean you have thought that you might have saved people some pain if you had simply cared less about keeping the band together? There\u2019s a story in here about seeing a devastated Lindsey Buckingham in the studio, morose and distraught, and you laid it out to him: \u201cAs a musician, you\u2019re either in a band or you\u2019re not, and he needed to decide which he wanted to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "EXCLUSIVE: Fleetwood Mac drummer tells Salon new \"Rumours\" stories, reflects on Stevie Nicks affair, shares regrets", "author": "David Daley", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Fleetwood Mac drummer tells Salon new \"Rumours\" stories, reflects on Stevie Nicks affair, shares regrets", "title": "Mick Fleetwood on \u201cRumours\u201d-era excess: \u201cI\u2019m damn lucky I never killed anyone!\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/08/mick_fleetwood_on_rumours_era_excess_im_damn_lucky_i_never_killed_anyone/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/mick_fleetwood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "EXCLUSIVE: Fleetwood Mac drummer tells Salon new \"Rumours\" stories, reflects on Stevie Nicks affair, shares regrets", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/mick_fleetwood.jpg", "title": "Mick Fleetwood on \u201cRumours\u201d-era excess: \u201cI\u2019m damn lucky I never killed anyone!\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Mick Fleetwood on \u201cRumours\u201d-era excess: \u201cI\u2019m damn lucky I never killed anyone!\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fletwood, Music, Peter Green, stevie nicks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17eb\"", "article_summary": "If it feels really personal, well, that\u2019s really, really, really what I wanted to do.\nI would say that, having prefaced that, I\u2019m damn lucky I never killed anyone when I was driving or any other thing.\nFleetwood is also deeply reflective on the relationships he sacrificed to the band, whether as a father, a husband or a son.\nTopics: Books, Editor's Picks, Fleetwood Mac, Lindsey Buckingham, Mick Fletwood, Music, Peter Green, stevie nicks, Entertainment NewsThe Mick Fleetwood pictured on the back of his new memoir, \u201cPlay On: Now, Then and Fleetwood Mac,\u201d looks fabulously content.\nNow I drink moderately and I think, I think, we have that all in line."}
