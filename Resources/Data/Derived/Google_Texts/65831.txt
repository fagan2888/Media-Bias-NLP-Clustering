Funny or Die, which has enlisted President Obama to guest on Zach Galifianakis’ “Between Two Ferns” and Jack Black to skewer gay marriage opponents in “Prop 8: The Musical,” is opening a Washington, D.C., office.

Brad Jenkins, who has been the White House’s liaison and director of engagement to the creative community, will be managing director and executive producer of Funny or Die D.C. and based at the 1776 Campus in downtown Washington. Jenkins will work on creating content, as well as providing consulting services to clients on reaching the public via social media and, presumably, through comedy.

Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to Obama, said in a statement that Jenkins “served as a key link to creative executives, artists, advocacy leaders, and more.” Mike Farah, president of production at Funny or Die, said that Jenkins was “the perfect person to lead our D.C. office because he understands how we work and how we can make a difference.”

Funny or Die, which was launched in 2007, has had particular success with satirical videos that weigh in on political issues. The “Between Two Ferns” segment was credited with generating an uptick in signups to the Affordable Care Act. One of the first political videos was one in which Paris Hilton responded to a John McCain ad that criticized Obama for being a Hilton-like celebrity candidate.

Other videos have touched on Wall Street reform and equal pay for women.
