ARLINGTON, Texas — Tony Romo threw three touchdowns passes — two to Terrance Williams — and DeMarco Murray ran for a pair of scores in another 100-yard game and the Dallas Cowboys beat the New Orleans Saints 38-17 on Sunday night.

The Cowboys kept Drew Brees and the Saints scoreless in the first half after giving up an NFL-record 40 first downs in a 49-17 blowout loss in New Orleans last year.

Brees led two scoring drives early in the fourth quarter to cut a 31-3 deficit in half before the Cowboys regained control.

Dallas reached 3-1 for the first time under coach Jason Garrett after also starting 2-1 the three previous seasons. The Cowboys are tied with Philadelphia for the NFC East lead.

The Saints (1-3) couldn’t sustain the momentum from their win against Minnesota and lost to the Cowboys in Texas for the first time since 1991.
