ECU is 2 and 0 on the season after defeating Florida Atlantic University at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium Thursday night 31-13.

East Carolina officially opened its 2013 Conference USA schedule with Florida Atlantic at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium.

The game was billed as a "Blackout" as players will wear special black uniforms and fans are also encouraged to wear black.

ECU extended its C-USA home winning streak to six straight games and pushed its record to 2-0 for the first time since 2010 after opening the new campaign with a 52-38 victory over Old Dominion last week.

The matchup also represented the second contest of a season-opening three-game homestand for the PIrates, who will follow by meeting ACC member Virginia Tech on September 14th.

Thursday's game was the first ever meeting between ECU and FAU.

The game was televised nationally on the new Fox Sports 1.
