One veteran chart-watcher sees a major bearish signal building in the Dow Industrials, but isn’t quite ready to pull the trigger on a longer-term call to sell stocks.

Steve Nison, the founder and president of Candlecharts.com and the person widely-known for introducing the Japanese candlestick charting method to Western chartists, sees a so-called “bearish engulfing” pattern emerging in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That would be a sign that the long-term rally is in trouble and a sustained sell-off is in the cards. But the blue-chip index needs to fall more than three hundred points from current levels before he takes that warning to heart, he says.

The Dow opened August at 15503.85, above the July 31 closing price of 15499.54. It closed August at 14810.31, or below where it opened July at 14911.60. In other words, August’s open-close range completely engulfed July’s range, in the opposite direction. This implies selling pressure has overwhelmed buying pressure, and bears are now in charge, technicians say.

When this pattern appears at the extreme of a recent range, like it did in August — the July close was the highest-ever on a monthly basis — chart watchers believe it warns that the previous uptrend may have ended. And since this pattern appeared on the long-term monthly charts, it suggests the subsequent decline is likely to be longer-term in nature.

“We have a bearish pattern on the month, but it emerged just above a key support area,” Mr. Nison said. “Because this is such a strong, long-term uptrend, I would wait for more bearish confirmation.”

The Dow is in the middle of 4 1/2-year rising channel. The bottom of the channel is the uptrend line starting at the March 2009 low of 6469.95, that currently extends to just below 13400.

Mr. Nison sees “major support” for the Dow around the 14450 to 14550 level, which stopped previous pullbacks in late April and late June. Therefore, a weekly close below 14450 is needed before the bearish outlook defined by the monthly reversal pattern is confirmed, Mr. Nison said.

That represents a decline of at least 383 points, or 2.6%, from current levels. The Dow closed Monday up 23 points at 14833.

In addition, the 200-day moving average, which many technicians see as a guide to the long-term trend, comes in at 14446 on Tuesday, and has been rising recently by about 10 points per session. The last time the Dow traded below the 200-day moving average was Dec. 31.

If support at 14450 to 14550 gives way, Mr. Nison targets a drop to the 13400-to-13500 level before the market stabilizes. A drop to 13400 would represent a 14% decline from the Dow’s all-time closing high of 15658.36 on Aug. 2. The rule of thumb among technicians is that a decline of 10% to up to 20% is a “correction,” while a selloff of 20% or more is a “bear market.”

One caveat to the Dow’s bearish engulfing is that the reversal signal didn’t appear in other benchmark indexes. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite, the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks and the Dow Jones Transportation Average all opened August above their respective July closes, but didn’t end the month below the July open. Basically, bears hurt the bulls in those indexes, but failed to engulf them.

But before bulls write off a pattern because it only appeared in the Dow, another widely-known technical guru, Ralph Acampora, said recently: “Never fight Papa Dow.”
