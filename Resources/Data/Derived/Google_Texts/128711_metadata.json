(Photo: Photo courtesy of Jim Stotler.)\n\nAfter a several year absence, Boy Scouts of America will be returning to the city of New Brunswick. Youth organizations and nonprofits go through tough cycles and the Central New Jersey Council was struggling,\u201d said Grant Van Eck, senior district executive of Boy Scouts of America. \u201cThe city\u2019s scouting program slowly faded away.\u201d\n\nToday, there are three Boy Scout troops in the city: Troops 1212 and 135 for boys aged 11-17 and a Cub Scout Pack for boys aged 6-10. All three have an approximate number of 25 boys each.\n\n\u201cThanks to St. Peter\u2019s Hospital, through Garrick Stoldt, we met with religious leaders who were interested in starting troops. Monsignor Joseph Kerrigan of Holy Family Parish started Pack and Troop 1212. Deacon Sinclair Bishop of the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens started Troop 135.\u201d\n\nThe future plans for the Scouts is to \u201cmeet regularly and follow the advancement program of scouting, (including) over 130 merit badges where boys learn with an adult mentor about hobbies, sports, crafts, science, trades, business, citizenship and future careers.\u201d Van Eck also mentioned the Liberty Jamboree next Oct. 2-5 at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, where Scouts will help build a home, shoot bow and arrows, and zip line among other activities.\n\n\u201cFor over a century, the Boy Scouts of America has helped build the future leaders of this country by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. The BSA believes \u2014 and, through over a century of experience, knows \u2014 that helping youth is a key to building a more conscientious, responsible and productive society.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit www.ppbsa.org or contact Van Eck at grant.vaneck@scouting.org.\n\nAndrew Sutton is an editorial intern for the Courier News, Home News Tribune and MyCentralJersey.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1zT4PuX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Three Boy Scout troops return to the city of New Brunswick after a several year absence", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Three Boy Scout troops return to the city of New Brunswick after a several year absence", "title": "Three boy scouts troops return to the city of New Brunswick", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/middlesex-county/2014/12/04/three-boy-scouts-troops-return-city-new-brunswick/19839491/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Three Boy Scout troops return to the city of New Brunswick after a several year absence", "title": "Three boy scouts troops return to the city of New Brunswick", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce54f0ad34a7036fed4f30e5c18f68148ba19b1d/c=170-0-550-380&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2014/12/03/B9315340811Z.1_20141203131211_000_G8M9A0H2V.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "After a several year absence, Boy Scouts of America will be returning to the city of New Brunswick.\nTroops 1212 and 135, as well as a cub scout troop, return to New Brunswick after a several year absence.\n\u201cThe city\u2019s scouting program slowly faded away.\u201dToday, there are three Boy Scout troops in the city: Troops 1212 and 135 for boys aged 11-17 and a Cub Scout Pack for boys aged 6-10.\nYouth organizations and nonprofits go through tough cycles and the Central New Jersey Council was struggling,\u201d said Grant Van Eck, senior district executive of Boy Scouts of America.\n\u201cFor over a century, the Boy Scouts of America has helped build the future leaders of this country by combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun."}
