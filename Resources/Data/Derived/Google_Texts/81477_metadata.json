So why would anyone buy abortion insurance? Who plans for such a thing?\n\nYet, this is exactly what Michigan's legislature is requiring women to do. Using a rare procedural tactic, the state's legislature is forcing \u2013 without the signature of the governor, conservative Republican Rick Snyder \u2013 women to obtain \"abortion insurance\" even before they get pregnant. The idea is so extreme that even Snyder opposes it. And it flies in the face of perhaps the most important part of the Affordable Care Act, that which prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage due to \"pre-existing conditions.\"\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nIt's similar to policies some people have had prior to the passage of the ACA, policies that, for example, demanded people buy special cancer insurance just in case they get the serious illness. Who thinks he or she will get cancer? But if you do, and you don't have the coverage to pay for the very expensive treatment, you're dead. Maybe literally.\n\nWhat makes the Michigan law so hateful and misogynist is that it has little to do with actual cost; abortions don't cost as much as chemotherapy and tumor-removal surgery. It's about shaming women, insisting that they brand themselves with a big scarlet A on themselves to show they think they may be just the sort of irresponsible whores who might need abortion access at some point. Good girls, apparently, don't have to pay, since they won't be having sex.\n\nAnd what about cases of rape or incest? It shouldn't matter, since the decision to have an abortion ought not be based on whether the female in question is a victim or sexually active. But women and girls \u2013 some of whom might be too poor to pay for an abortion or too scared to come forward after an assault \u2013 will have to pony up for an abortion or pay in advance.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nThis raises some interesting issues for the defense, should a female report a rape or incest to police. So, Miss Slutsmith, you purchased abortion insurance. Should we not infer that you were planning to get pregnant \u2013 and could not possibly have been raped or abused by a male relative?\n\nBut then again, the law doesn't address men's sexual health. It doesn't insist that men pay in advance, for example, for treatment for sexually transmitted diseases or for Viagra. They get to have sex without consequence, unlike the women. They don't have to give up their privacy and undergo the humiliation of paying extra to deal with erectile dysfunction or gonorrhea. But for the women \u2013 shame! The word is appropriate here. But it ought to be directed at the Michigan legislature.\n\nRead Jamie Chandler: Megyn Kelly Insisting Santa Is White Is Everything That's Wrong With Today's GOP\n\nRead Brad Bannon: The Wacko Right Comes After Paul Ryan and Ted Cruz", "article_metadata": {"zone": "susan-milligan/blogentries", "keyword": "sexual assault", "title": "Shame On Michigan's Legislature for Passing Abortion Insurance Bill", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2013/12/13/shame-on-michigans-legislature-for-passing-abortion-insurance-bill", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "type": "article", "description": "Michigan is putting a hateful misogynist law on the books.", "title": "Michigan's Shameful 'Rape Insurance' Plan"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Michigan is putting a hateful misogynist law on the books.", "card": "summary", "title": "Shame On Michigan's Legislature for Passing Abortion Insurance Bill"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Dec. 13, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": ", column,abortion, blogs, thomas jefferson street,Susan Milligan,susan milligan,Milligan, Susan,sexual assault ,health care,Michigan,Susan Milligan,abortion,Michigan,health care,sexual assault", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Michigan is putting a hateful misogynist law on the books."}, "article_summary": "So why would anyone buy abortion insurance?\nUsing a rare procedural tactic, the state's legislature is forcing \u2013 without the signature of the governor, conservative Republican Rick Snyder \u2013 women to obtain \"abortion insurance\" even before they get pregnant.\nSo, Miss Slutsmith, you purchased abortion insurance.\nYet, this is exactly what Michigan's legislature is requiring women to do.\nBut if you do, and you don't have the coverage to pay for the very expensive treatment, you're dead."}
