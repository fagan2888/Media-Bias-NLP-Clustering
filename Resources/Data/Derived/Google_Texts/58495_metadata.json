Mark Pryor of \u201ctoeing the line\u201d for President Obama and the Democratic Party, claiming Pryor voted with them 90 percent of the time. But the party unity figure is wrong (it\u2019s actually 80 percent), and the presidential support figure, although accurate, shows Pryor voted against Obama more than any other Senate Democrat.\n\nCotton goes on to say in the ad that he\u2019ll \u201cstand up to President Obama and my own party when I have to.\u201d We cannot predict the future, but when it came to toeing the party line in the House, Cotton\u2019s voting was actually more reliably Republican than Pryor\u2019s was reliably Democratic. According to CQ Weekly, Cotton voted in accordance with his party 97 percent of the time last year.\n\nWith polls showing the two Arkansas candidates locked in a tight battle that could help decide which party controls the Senate, Cotton and his allies are trying to tie Pryor to Obama, whose approval ratings are very low in the state. American Crossroads also recently cited the 90 percent figure in an ad in which a student at a spelling bee is asked to spell Pryor and responds, \u201cO-B-A-M-A.\u201d \u201cClose enough,\u201d the judges say.\n\nIn the Cotton campaign ad, Cotton says Washington culture dictates senators do \u201cexactly what their political party wants, even when it\u2019s wrong.\u201d As an example, Cotton cites Pryor\u2019s support for the Affordable Care Act, which passed entirely along party lines.\n\nCotton: They call it toeing the line. In Washington, that\u2019s how they do business. Senators are expected to do exactly what their political party wants, even when it\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s what Sen. Pryor did on Obamacare. And it passed by just one vote, his vote. Sen. Pryor votes with his party and Obama 90 percent of the time. I\u2019m Tom Cotton. I approve this message. I\u2019ll stand up to President Obama, and my own party when I have to. That\u2019s the only way to make things right.\n\nThe ad cites a Feb. 3 CQ Weekly article for the claim that Pryor \u201cvotes with his party and Obama 90 percent of the time.\u201d Voting with the party and voting with Obama are actually two separate statistics kept by CQ Weekly.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with Pryor\u2019s votes with Obama. CQ analyzes senators\u2019 share of roll call votes on which Obama took a clear position. CQ found Pryor opposed Obama\u2019s position 10.3 percent of the time last year. In other words, the 90 percent figure is accurate with regard to Pryor\u2019s votes with the president. But whether one considers that \u201ctoeing the line\u201d is a matter of opinion.\n\nThe article cited in the ad notes that among Senate Democrats up for reelection in the fall, Pryor \u201cbroke with the president most often, opposing him in 10 percent of all 2013 votes where the administration stated a preferred outcome.\u201d In fact, the data show that Pryor voted against Obama\u2019s wishes more than any other Senate Democrat.\n\nPryor\u2019s 90 percent support is the lowest it has been since Obama has been president. In 2012, Pryor voted with Obama 91 percent of the time; 95 percent in 2011; 92 percent in 2010; and 95 percent in 2009.\n\nLast year, Pryor opposed the president on gun regulations, immigration issues, loosening restrictions of transfers from Gitmo and one judicial nominee.\n\nIn April 2013, Pryor opposed several gun control measures pushed by Obama in the wake of the Newtown school shooting: amendments to beef up background checks; to ban assault weapons; and to ban large capacity ammunition feeding devices. All three measures were rejected.\n\nIn June, Pryor voted for an amendment to the comprehensive immigration plan that would have required the completion of hundreds of miles of reinforced, double-layered fencing as a prerequisite for provisional and ultimately permanent legal status for immigrants in the country illegally. It failed 39-54. Pryor also voted for an amendment proposed by Republican Sen. David Vitter that would have required the implementation of a biometric border check-in and check-out system before anyone could be granted temporary legal status. It failed 36-58.\n\nIn November, Pryor voted against provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act that would \u201cloosen restrictions on transferring detainees out of Guantanamo Bay, and help Obama toward his goal of closing the facility.\u201d\n\nIn December, Pryor became one of just five Democrats to oppose one of Obama\u2019s judicial nominees when he joined Republicans and two other Senate Democrats in opposing the confirmation of Cornelia \u201cNina\u201d Pillard to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Republicans raised concerns about Pillard\u2019s views on abortion rights and the Constitution.\n\nThat\u2019s Pryor\u2019s record on voting with the president. As we noted earlier, CQ Weekly also calculates a \u201cparty unity\u201d score. To arrive at that, CQ analyzes votes in the House or Senate that split the parties \u2014 where a majority of Democrats opposed a majority of Republicans. CQ found that Pryor bucked the party unity votes nearly 20 percent of the time last year, second among Senate Democrats only to Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\n\nAs for Cotton, who serves in the House, his party unity score last year had him voting 97 percent with his party and 3 percent against. In other words, Cotton voted much more reliably in line with his party than Pryor did in line with his.\n\nVoters can make of that what they will, but in an ad that knocks Pryor for toeing the party line, it should be noted that Pryor bucked the president more than any other Senate Democrat last year; that he bucked his party more than any other Senate Democrat save for one; and that Cotton voted along with his own party much more faithfully last year than Pryor did.\n\n\u2014 Robert Farley and Carolyn Fante", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1f1\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
