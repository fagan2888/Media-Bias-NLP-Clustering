This homeless bodybuilder lives on the street with his two dogs, panhandles for money, and still has the physique of a Greek god. At 50 years old, Sayagh hammers out pushups, hanging leg raises with makeshift ab straps, and resistance band exercises on his little corner of a street in France, much to the amazement of passersby.\n\n\u201cBodybuilders are futurists, they dare everything. It\u2019s a world that I like. I love them,\u201d Sayagh told the director of this 6-minute documentary, Julien Goudichaud. \u201cIt\u2019s better to run and be able to do whatever you want than be amorphous. Especially in 50.\u201d\n\nIt would appear that a portion of Sayagh\u2019s panhandling money goes to various workout supplements, including casein and whey protein, pure creatine powder, and vitamins. Sayagh explained that in preparation for the \u201cLe Grand Prix Des Pyrenees\u201d bodybuilding competition, he ate vegetables five to six days out of the week and cut down on water to push out whatever water was left in his body. Although weightlifting seems to be the focus of Sayagh\u2019s life, he still has aspirations outside of bodybuilding.\n\n\u201cI have grandchildren, I don\u2019t want them to think that their grandfather is an a**hole,\u201d Sayagh added. \u201cI want them to be proud of me, that\u2019s all I want. And I have a son that I love.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "homeless, bodybuilder, jacques, sayagh, works, out, all, day, long, street", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "This homeless bodybuilder, Jacques Sayagh, is 50 years old with a flawless physique.", "title": "How Can A Homeless Bodybuilder Stay So Ripped?
