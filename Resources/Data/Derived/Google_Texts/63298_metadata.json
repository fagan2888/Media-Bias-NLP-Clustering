(AP) \u2014 For decades, Barbara Saks of Colorado Springs kept mum over Bletchley Park, the fabled home of the British code breakers credited with shaving years from World War II.\n\nBut her vow of secrecy didn\u2019t apply at the Christmas Day premier of a film that recounts the once top-secret story \u2014 especially when it hit a false note.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t wear uniforms at Bletchley \u2014 we wore civvies,\u201d went one of her whispered corrections from the back row at Kimball\u2019s Theater, where Saks, 97, joined a sold-out crowd at a matinee showing of \u201cThe Imitation Game,\u201d which tells the story of Alan Turing, the Cambridge mathematician who managed to decrypt German communications.\n\nBy cracking the code of the Germans\u2019 Enigma decryption machine, Turing and his team are credited with shortening the war by two years and saving millions of lives.\n\nUnbeknownst to many fellow moviegoers, Saks served as what she called \u201ca very small cog\u201d in the operation that sent decrypted messages up the chain of command.\n\nA native of London, she joined the Royal Air Force in April 1940, though she wasn\u2019t assigned to Bletchley until 1943, well after Turing and his team had solved the riddle \u2014 not that Saks could have known that.\n\nAt Bletchley, each worker was assigned a discrete task and ordered to keep silent about it.\n\nSaks served as a translator in Hut 3, Block D, and spent her days transforming strings of numbers into letters. She didn\u2019t know why; she only knew it was critically important.\n\nAfter finishing each message, Saks and her colleagues placed their translated documents in a wire basket, rang a bell and sat back down at their desks. \u201cA few minutes later, the door would open 4 to 5 inches and a hand reached in and picked up the message and whisked it away \u2014 to where we never knew and never asked.\u201d\n\nShe now knows that her work went straight to her nation\u2019s top war planners \u2014 among them Winston Churchill. \u201cWe were a small cog, but a very important cog,\u201d she said.\n\nLike other workers at Bletchley, Saks signed an oath to stay silent, and she kept it until the 1974 publication of F. W. Winterbotham\u2019s \u201cThe Ultra Secret,\u201d which detailed the British code-breaking operation.\n\nSaks moved to the United States after the war with her American G.I. husband and settled in Colorado Springs in 2006 to be closer to family.\n\nShe accompanied a Gazette reporter to the premier screening wearing two British war medals and a Bletchley Park pin on her lapel.\n\nInside a storage pouch in her walker were books of history, a magazine for Bletchley Park alumni and photographs of Saks in uniform \u2014 when she \u201cwas young and beautiful.\u201d\n\nDuring the two-hour screening, Saks pointed out historical inaccuracies and chimed in with additional context throughout, fleshing out the film\u2019s events with her vivid memories.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Neville Chamberlain,\u201d she said as an off-screen voice announced Britain\u2019s declaration of war. \u201cI listened to that broadcast on the radio.\u201d\n\nShe turned down offers of popcorn and instead opted for Hall\u2019s cough drops stored in her purse.\n\nSaks reserved her praise for star Benedict Cumberbatch and wondered aloud if he could be related to Joan Cumberbatch, a woman who served with Saks \u2014 then known as Barbara Brown \u2014 during an earlier assignment at a British fighter station.\n\n\u201cShe was called Cumbers, and I was called Brownie,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a tie?\u201d\n\nMoviegoers who recognized Saks from veterans events in Colorado Springs came to pay their respects \u2014 one woman called her a \u201ctreasure\u201d \u2014 and she was asked to pose for photographs after the movie with theater owners, Kimball and Sabrina Bayles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so cool,\u201d Gene Geary of Colorado Springs said after being told of Saks\u2019 role at Bletchley. \u201cIt brings a reality to the film\u2026when you have a participant sitting next to you.\u201d\n\nLike a starlet with an adoring audience, Saks chatted with well-wishers outside the theater until her son, Alex Saks of Colorado Springs, announced it was time to leave for a family Christmas celebration.\n\n\u201cOh, I have so many tales to tell you,\u201d she told people around her, while flashing a smile. \u201cIt will have to be another time, I suppose.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: The Gazette, http://www.gazette.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "WWII code breaker offers \u201cImitation Game\u201d context", "title": "WWII code breaker offers \u201cImitation Game\u201d context", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/26/wwii-code-breaker-offers-imitation-game-context/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-26T10:40:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-26T10:40:15+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf0c8\"", "article_summary": "Saks served as a translator in Hut 3, Block D, and spent her days transforming strings of numbers into letters.\nhusband and settled in Colorado Springs in 2006 to be closer to family.\nShe accompanied a Gazette reporter to the premier screening wearing two British war medals and a Bletchley Park pin on her lapel.\nUnbeknownst to many fellow moviegoers, Saks served as what she called \u201ca very small cog\u201d in the operation that sent decrypted messages up the chain of command.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so cool,\u201d Gene Geary of Colorado Springs said after being told of Saks\u2019 role at Bletchley."}
