Businessman David Perdue is leading the pack, but Handel is in a scrum with Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., for second.\n\nOn Conger, Santorum praised him as a \"passionate leader in the Oregon House fighting for the unborn, health care reform, tax cuts and increasing educational opportunities for children.\"\n\nConger is lagging behind neurosurgeon Monica Wehby by 21 points, according to one poll.\n\nOn Wednesday, Santorum plunged into the contested Iowa GOP primary backing long-shot college professor Sam Clovis.\n\nSantorum was inclined to stay out of the first-in-the-nation caucus state foray, but said he felt compelled to align himself with Clovis \"because so-called conservative groups in Washington, D.C., have tried to anoint a candidate.\"\n\n[ALSO: Republican 2016ers Look to Pass the Hillary Clinton Test]\n\nSantorum never mentioned her name but he's likely referring to state Sen. Joni Ernst, who has won the backing of the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Chamber of Commerce and potential 2016 rival, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.\n\n\"Unfortunately, these same groups either don't know the real record, or they are trying to mislead Iowa conservatives about who is the best conservative in this race. Simply put, a voting record that supports tax increases and not showing up for the job the people entrusted you to do are not conservative principles,\" Santorum said, taking a shot at Ernst, who has sprung ahead of the field in recent polling.\n\nClovis trails Ernst by 21 points, according to the most recent public survey.\n\nJohn Brabender, Santorum's chief strategist for his 2012 bid, described Santorum's endorsement process as thorough and unique for someone considering a presidential bid.\n\n\"The other candidates do it in a way that says, what's in it for themselves. Rick does it and says, 'what's in the best interest for the conservative movement?'\" Brabender says. \"I think there's other people who work backwards and say, 'who's most likely to win and can we endorse?' I don't think he does it that way.\"\n\nSantorum usually also requires a detailed conversation before lending his support, as he did with Handel, according to Brabender.\n\n[MORE: The Next Faces of the Republican Party]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Rick Santorum's Endorsement Surge", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Rick Santorum is the most active endorser of all the potential 2016-ers, just don't expect a check.", "title": "Rick Santorum's Endorsement Surge", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/05/15/rick-santorums-endorsement-surge", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/74/93/a5ace70645cb82ac55fa67f8ada7/140515-santorum-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Rick Santorum is the most active endorser of all the potential 2016-ers, just don't expect a check.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rick Santorum's Endorsement Surge"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "May 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,2016 presidential election,Santorum, Rick,Pulse,The Run 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Rick Santorum is the most active endorser of all the potential 2016-ers, just don't expect a check."}, "article_summary": "John Brabender, Santorum's chief strategist for his 2012 bid, described Santorum's endorsement process as thorough and unique for someone considering a presidential bid.\nSantorum usually also requires a detailed conversation before lending his support, as he did with Handel, according to Brabender.\nHandel is fighting to finish among the top two vote-getters this coming Tuesday to advance to a likely July runoff.\n\"She is a committed conservative who has an undisputed record of fighting for anti-abortion causes,\" Santorum said of Handel in a statement.\nRick does it and says, 'what's in the best interest for the conservative movement?'\""}
