Did we rank something too high? Too low? Miss something completely? Let us know in the comments section below, or join the discussion on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nHonorable mention: Bachus announces final term (will be big in 2014); Alabama delegation splits (House, Senate) over Ryan-Murray budget deal; 60 Plus Association launches Alabama chapter and begins going after AARP; Court upholds Alabama\u2019s new legislative district lines; Alabama passes \u201cthe strongest Second Amendment protections in the country\u201d; Alabama Tea Party leader gives emotional testimony before congress; ALGOP tries to remove College Republicans chairwoman for comments about gay marriage; Alabama plays host to potential 2016 presidential candidates (Walker, Carson, Huckabee, Jindal); Alabama\u2019s unemployment rate hits 5 year low\n\n10. Byrne\u2019s return\n\nFormer state senator, two-year college system chancellor and gubernatorial candidate Bradley Byrne launched Reform Alabama, a non-profit public policy organization, shortly after the 2010 election cycle ended. That led many political observers to surmise that Byrne was angling to challenge Gov. Bentley in 2014. But after an attempt to make Bentley\u2019s Amendment 1 a wedge issue failed to gain traction, it looked like Byrne\u2019s time in the public eye was coming to an end.\n\n\n\nThen Rep. Jo Bonner decided to take a job with the University of Alabama System , opening the door for Byrne to get back in the game by running for Congress in Alabama\u2019s First Congressional District.\n\nByrne led the race from wire to wire. He finished at the top of a 9-candidate GOP primary. He then outlasted conservative bomb thrower Dean Young in the runoff before making quick work of Democrat Burton LeFlore in the general.\n\nByrne will be sworn into office at the beginning of the second session of the 113th Congress on January 7, 2014.\n\n9. Shelby takes on gun control\n\nAlabama\u2019s senior U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Tuscaloosa, doesn\u2019t go to the mic on the Senate floor very often. So when he does, it tends to be a pretty big deal.\n\n\n\nSuch was the case on April 17 when Shelby decided to speak out against gun control legislation being pushed by Democrats in the wake of the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I rise to defend the Second Amendment to our Constitution,\u201d Shelby said emphatically to begin his remarks. Those words became one of Yellowhammer\u2019s most \u201cliked\u201d and \u201cshared\u201d Facebook graphics of the year.\n\nShelby and his Republican colleagues successfully beat back the gun control measures.\n\n8. Roby to Appropriations\n\nYellowhammer was first to break the news that Rep. Martha Roby, R-Montgomery, was going to land a spot on the powerful House Appropriations Committee on Nov. 25. Nine days later, Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-KY, made it official.\n\nGetting on Appropriations is such a big deal that Roby was willing to give up her seat on the House Armed Services Committee, House Agriculture Committee and the House Education and Workforce Committee in order to get it done.\n\n\u201cAppropriations has oversight on the whole range of government spending,\u201d Roby explained. \u201cThis new role provides a unique opportunity to push for the kind of conservative spending priorities that will put us on a sustainable financial path for future generations.\u201d\n\n7. Budget chairmen resign\n\nBudget chairmen are some of the most powerful players in state politics, overseeing how the state\u2019s resources are allocated.\n\nRep. Jay Love, R-Montgomery, and Rep. Jim Barton, R-Mobile, had been the House\u2019s budget gurus since Republicans took control in 2010.\n\nLove announced his resignation from the House effective Aug. 1, and shortly thereafter took on a role with the Business Council of Alabama\u2019s newly formed Business and Education Alliance. Barton resigned the following week to partner up with longtime Montgomery lobbyists Alison and Phillip Kinney to form Barton & Kinney, LLC.\n\nTheir resignations, combined with other lower-profile departures from the legislature, led House Republicans to include a bill in their upcoming 2014 legislative agenda to cut down on legislators leaving office mid-term to become lobbyists.\n\n6. Sessions takes national spotlight during immigration reform debate\n\nNational media outlets from the New York Times and CNN to Fox News and Breitbart all hailed (or excoriated) Sessions as the GOP\u2019s leading voice against the Gang of Eight\u2019s comprehensive immigration reform proposal.\n\n\n\nThe bill ultimately passed the Senate with Obama cronies chanting \u201cYES WE CAN!\u201d in the gallery, but that didn\u2019t stop Sessions from rallying the Republican majority in the House to squash it.\n\nBetween his role as the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and his vehement opposition to amnesty, Sessions really carved out some space for himself on the national scene this year.\n\nIf Republicans manage to retake the Senate in 2014, Sessions and his Alabama colleague Sen. Shelby could potentially be chairing two of the body\u2019s most powerful committees \u2014 Budget and Appropriations.\n\n5. Alabama Democrats hit rock bottom\n\n2010 may be remembered as the year that more than a century of Democrat rule in Alabama came to an end, but 2013 is the year the Party really bottomed out.\n\nFormer Alabama Democrat Party Chairman Mark Kennedy flat out left the Party and started an entirely new group, optimistically (i.e. comically) named \u201cThe Alabama Democratic Majority.\u201d\n\n\n\nImmediately after Kennedy bolted, acting Alabama Democrat Party Chairwoman Nancy Worley told her Executive Board the Party was \u201cbroke, broke, broke.\u201d So broke, in fact, that 30 minutes after Worley took over as head of the Party, they were booted out of their headquarters because the rent was overdue. Then the water company said they were cutting them off\u2026 followed by the power company\u2026 followed by the banks informing her that Party credit cards were maxed out and being cancelled.\n\nThe Party is some $500,000 in debt, a good chunk of which goes all the way back to 1999 when the Party took out loans to help finance then Gov. Don Siegelman\u2019s ill-fated lottery campaign.\n\nThe once mighty Party is now largely divided along racial lines, with Kennedy & co. having left Joe Reed, chairman of the Party\u2019s black wing, behind.\n\n4. Tea Party takes on Common Core\n\nThe repeal of Common Core standards was the top priority for many grassroots conservatives around the state in 2013. Numerous Tea Party organizations were omnipresent in the halls of the State House during the week before the Common Core repeal bill was to come up in committee. But just as the repeal movement started gaining momentum, a disastrous public hearing stopped it in its tracks. The repeal bill unfortunately died in Senate committee.\n\nState Board of Education member Mary Scott Hunter has been the face of pro-Common Core Republicans in the state. She has stated publicly that the Board of Education made the decision to pass Common Core and doesn\u2019t want the legislature telling them how to do their job.\n\nAlabama\u2019s Republican National Committeeman Paul Reynolds passed a resolution at the RNC\u2019s Spring meeting rejecting Common Core. Sen. Jeff Sessions also signed on to a letter pushing to defund it.\n\nMeanwhile, the leftwing Alabama Education Association (AEA), which doesn\u2019t care much about actual education policy, couldn\u2019t be more thrilled watching Republicans shred each other over the issue.\n\nGrassroots groups continue to push for repeal, but Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh has said Common Core is \u201coff the table\u201d for the 2014 session.\n\n3. Bentley refuses to expand Medicaid\n\nIn the face of increasing pressure from liberal opinion columnists, the Alabama Hospitals Association, the head of Alabama\u2019s public retirement systems, and others, Gov. Bentley held the line for conservatives in 2013 and refused to expand Medicaid under ObamaCare.\n\nHe\u2019s taken a much tougher tone than we\u2019re used to hearing from the Governor Doctor, even calling out expansion proponents for citing a \u201cbogus\u201d study in their attempts to sway public opinion.\n\nOrganizations in favor of expansion continue to ramp up their communications efforts in hopes that Bentley will reconsider his position after he wins reelection next year.\n\n2. Enviros descend on Alabama\n\nEnvironmental activists made more noise in Alabama in 2013 than any other leftwing group. After receiving roughly $3 million from the San Francisco-based Energy Foundation to advance the Obama Administration\u2019s \u201cWar on Coal\u201d in Alabama, little known enviro groups like the Southern Environmental Law Center and Alabama Environmental Council became household names to Alabama conservatives.\n\nThe Alabama Public Service Commission, typically anything but a hotbed of political activity, became ground zero for the environmentalists\u2019 assault.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental activists showed up at the district offices of Alabama congressmen to give them \u201cClimate Change Denier Awards.\u201d\n\nEmails obtained through open records requests revealed that government employees working for the Regional Planning Commission of Greater Birmingham colluded with enviros in an attempt to halt a major economic development project.\n\nThe list of their 2013 exploits could go on and on and on.\n\nRepublicans in the Alabama legislature are planning legislation to protect Alabama from certain environmentalist movements in 2014. And Sen. Richard Shelby closed out the year by calling for a U.S. Department of Energy investigation into whether the groups inappropriately used taxpayer money to advance an \u201canti-coal agenda in Alabama.\u201d\n\n1. Alabama Accountability Act\n\nShortly before 5 p.m. on Feb. 28, in a committee room on the seventh floor of the Alabama State House, a small group of legislators, citizen activists, lobbyists and members of the press witnessed something truly historic. School choice was finally coming to Alabama.\n\nThe defenders of the status quo were stunned.\n\nAEA Head Henry Mabry curses as he walks out of the room. \"SH**\" Just witnessed history. Major ed reform coming to Alabama today. #alpolitics \u2014 Yellowhammer (@YHPolitics) February 28, 2013\n\nThe bill went on to pass in both the House and Senate. And after a couple of weeks of confusion, lawsuits, court rulings that went all the way to the Supreme Court, and general chaos, Governor Bentley signed the Accountability Act into law on March 14.\n\n\u201cFor the first time ever, we\u2019re giving all public schools the flexibility they need to better serve their students,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cThis also gives flexibility to children and parents by providing new options for students who are stuck in persistently low-performing schools. All children deserve access to a quality education, no matter where they live. This provides a new option to help children receive the best education possible.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe AEA declared all-out war, unleashing a wave of attack ads focusing on Republican legislators who supported the bill. But in spite of their efforts, Alabamians continued to overwhelmingly support the Accountability Act and, more broadly, the concept of school choice.\n\nThe Tax Credit Scholarship Fund setup by the Act has already reached 80 percent capacity, with Alabamians having donated over $19 million to scholarship granting organization charged with distributing scholarships to students in failing schools. That\u2019s a blistering rate, considering that portion of the bill only went into effect in May.\n\nThe Accountability Act is far from a panacea that will heal all of Alabama\u2019s education woes. But the fact that Alabama made positive education reform for the first time in over 40 years makes the passage of the Accountability Act the defining moment of Alabama politics in 2013.\n\nFollow Cliff on Twitter @Cliff_Sims", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yellowhammer ranks the top moments in Alabama politics in 2013.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "It\u2019s the time of the year, ladies and gentlemen, when every publication under the sun is releasing their year-end lists, and Yellowhammer is no exception.
