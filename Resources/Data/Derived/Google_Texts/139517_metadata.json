( Lisa Aliferis/KQED )\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Supporters of an effort to repeal California\u2019s new law requiring mandatory vaccines for schoolchildren faced a Monday deadline to turn in enough signatures to qualify a ballot initiative asking voters to repeal the law.\n\nThe group had until the end of the day to submit the needed 366,000 signatures to county clerks to ask California voters to repeal SB277, which struck down the state\u2019s personal belief exemption for immunizations, a move that requires nearly all public schoolchildren to be vaccinated.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown signed SB277 into law earlier this year amid fierce opposition from some parents rights groups who argue the state should not force their children to be vaccinated. He said the science is clear that vaccines \u201cdramatically protect children against a number of infectious and dangerous diseases.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether supporters have enough signatures to make it to the ballot and it might not be known until next week, when clerks face a deadline to report how many signatures they received. The leading proponent of the effort, former Republican Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, said in an email Monday that volunteers were coerced and threatened while collecting signatures.\n\nDonnelly did not return repeated messages inquiring about the effort\u2019s chances, but said in his email that he was proud of the volunteers who worked on the campaign \u201cwhatever the outcome is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe SB277 Referendum was sabotaged from without and within by powerful forces from its very inception, but we never gave up and we never gave in,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe bill\u2019s author, Sen. Richard Pan, D-Sacramento, told reporters Monday that he\u2019s confident voters support the vaccination requirement, whether the initiative makes the ballot or not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the voters of California are not interested in letting a privileged few take away the rights of all Californians to be safe from preventable disease,\u201d Pan said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the signatures, I think it would be a direct reflection of the fact that Californians wanted to see their communities safe.\u201d\n\nCalifornia will join Mississippi and West Virginia as the only states with such strict requirements, if the law takes effect as planned next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The group has until the end of the day Monday to file the needed 366,000 signatures to place a referendum on the ballot.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Vaccine Law Opponents File Petitions for Repeal\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/09\\/28\\/california-vaccine-law-opponents-file-petitions-for-repeal\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-09-28 15:40:15\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-10-21 11:21:20\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":85535,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"SB277\",\"Science\",\"Vaccines\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/09\\/IMG_5587-2-e1443479782980.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The group has until the end of the day Monday to file the needed 366,000 signatures to place a referendum on the ballot.", "title": "California Vaccine Law Opponents File Petitions for Repeal", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/09/28/california-vaccine-law-opponents-file-petitions-for-repeal/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/09/IMG_5587-2-1440x1080.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,sb277,science,vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a0c\"", "article_summary": "Opponents to SB277 staffed a booth at a Berkeley street fair earlier this month to collect signatures to place a referendum challenging the vaccine law on the ballot.\n( Lisa Aliferis/KQED )SACRAMENTO, Calif.
