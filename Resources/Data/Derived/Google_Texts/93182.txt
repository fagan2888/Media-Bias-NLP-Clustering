Oswego resident James Marter has announced his candidacy for the United States Senate.

In his campaign announcement, Marter said he based his decision to seek the Republican nomination on Senator Mark Kirk’s record.

“He is a consistent supporter of gun control with an ‘F’ rating by the NRA, and has a history of opposing school choice, and has opposed almost every effort to significantly cut spending or balance the budget, and finally he is the only sitting Republican senator to have voted for Cap and Trade energy taxes,” Marter said on his website.

Marter said some of the issues he’d like to tackle include repealing the Affordable Care Act, which he describes as the “Un-Affordable Care Act, defunding Planned Parenthood, voting for pro-life registration, stopping the influx of immigrants and balancing the budget.

“Fix the tax code, make it flat and simple, and slash the size of the IRS,” Marter said. “Stop giving our treasury to foreign countries, crony capitalists and end the ‘corporate’ welfare.”

Marter also firmly supports the right to bear arms, as stated in the Bill of Rights.

Marter currently owns Marter Enterprises, LCC, which was established in 2002. He was educated at Purdue University where he received a bachelors of science in industrial management and computer science. He attended Limestone Community High School in Bartonville, Illinois, graduating in 1981.

Marter has been married to his wife Jill for 30 years and has four children with her. He is a member of St. Anne Catholic Church in Oswego.
