Evangelist Franklin Graham has extended his perpetual outrage into the realm of comic books.

With the announcement earlier this week from comic book maker Marvel that classic X-Men character Bobby Drake aka Iceman will come out of the closet, Graham took to social media for a vehement display of displeasure.

Graham, who is openly anti-gay, has previously praised Vladimir Putin for his anti-gay propaganda laws and came out in support for Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal yesterday after he wrote on op-ed in the New York Times entitled “I’m holding firm against gay marriage.”

Iceman isn’t the only gay comic book character. Northstar, part of X-Men, married his boyfriend Kyle Jindau back in 2012, and Catwoman came out as bi-sexual in her own DC series.
