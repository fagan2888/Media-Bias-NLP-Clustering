CoOpportunity doesn\u2019t have enough cash on hand to be sure it can pay claims for its 120,000 customers, if necessary. The company has only $17 million in cash and assets, Gerhart said.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s Obamacare administrator the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services initially gave CoOportunity a $112 million loan award in Feb. 2012, but doled out an additional $32.7 million emergency award to keep the company solvent in September of this year.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t enough to keep it in business. CoOpportunity\u2019s management expected to receive more federal money than they did, putting them in continuing financial peril.\n\nThe nonprofit insurers were single-payer advocates\u2019 answer to private insurance companies, which some argued hiked premiums just to pad their profits. But after its initial year of Obamacare, CoOportunity was struggling so much that it ended up having to up its premiums in Iowa by 19 percent on average.

Customers\u2019 coverage will continue for now, but Gerhart expects that most customers will switch to other insurers operating on Iowa\u2019s and Nebraska\u2019s Obamacare exchanges by the end of the open enrollment period on Feb. 15. It\u2019s no longer accepting new sign-ups for coverage.\n\nThe state of Iowa, in the form of Gerhart himself, is in charge of the company now, according to Dana McNeill, a CoOpportunity vice president.\n\nThe Obamacare-created company has been bleeding cash over the past several months. Its net cash and investments fell from $121.5 million on Oct. 31, just a month after receiving a solvency loan from the Obama administration, to $17 million on Dec. 12, the Des Moines Register reports.\n\nIt\u2019s far from the only Obamacare-created company that\u2019s in peril. The Obama administration handed out almost $3 billion in loans to get the co-ops started in 2013. They were included in the law to placate critics on the left who advocated a public insurance option and lost.\n\nIn Sept. 2014, the administration handed out another round of solvency loans to a number of co-ops who needed help staying in business. Six state co-ops received a total of almost $268 million in extra loans to help keep the companies solvent and in business.\n\nEven since then, the administration issued two last-minute solvency loans, which it kept quiet for weeks. Kentucky Health Cooperative received an extra $65 million emergency solvency loan days before the second open enrollment period launched and the co-ops began to sign up new customers \u2014 but CMS did not announce the loans until Dec. 15, along with another last-minute $23 million solvency loan to Wisconsin\u2019s Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative.
