That was around average compared to other countries, with Brazil on the high end at 63 percent and China the low at 24 percent. But if you phrased the question a little differently, you got a different response. When asked whether it\u2019s good or bad for corporations to be influential, just 31 percent of Americans said it\u2019s a good thing. Only Germany, Poland, Britain and Hong Kong had a lower percentage of people say that. In other words, Americans are relatively OK with Big Business\u2019s current power, but they don\u2019t want them to be influential. That seems slightly contradictory. But Irwin clears this up. \u201cAmericans aren\u2019t antibusiness, in other words,\u201d he writes. \u201cThey\u2019re just against business having what they see as too much power in Washington.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why Americans would be hostile to Big Business right now. Consider this: In the New York Times on Thursday, Jonathan Weisman wrote about the corporate donors for the 501(c)(4) arm of the Republican Governors Association (officially called the Republican Governors Public Policy Committee). 501(c)(4) organizations are groups that are designed to improve \u201csocial welfare.\u201d More importantly, they don\u2019t have to reveal the names of their donors or the donation amounts. That\u2019s been a boon for political groups, but the Republican Governors Public Policy Committee screwed up and accidentally revealed its donor list. As Weisman reported, a number of big corporations\u2014Aetna, Coca-Cola, Exxon Mobil, Koch Companies, Pfizer, Walmart and others\u2014have donated more than $250,000 to the organization. In return, they\u2019ve received invitations to \u201cexclusive dinners\u201d and special policy meetings. Some events have featured skiing and snowmobiling. At the 2012 conference in Las Vegas, guests \u201cwere also treated to an \u2018under the Eiffel Tower\u2019 event at the Paris Las Vegas hotel\u2019s Chateau Nightclub.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Governors Public Policy Committee may have accidentally revealed its donor list, but it certainly isn\u2019t alone. The Democratic Governors Association has its own 501(c)(4) called the Center for Innovative Policy. It almost certainly offers the same perks and access to its corporate donors. It\u2019s easy to imagine how that access can lead directly to beneficial policy decisions. No wonder Americans don\u2019t want corporations to have too much power.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "In the Upshot on Wednesday, Neil Irwin looked at a new, massive survey on American attitudes towards big business and tried to explain a contradiction in the numbers.Forty eight percent of Americans think that corporations have too much power.
