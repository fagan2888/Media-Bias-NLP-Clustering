One determined which Americans would qualify for subsidized health insurance under Obamacare\u2019s federal and state exchanges. Another defined the minimum coverage standards that insurance plans must meet under the new law.\n\nSeveral environmental regulations were also delayed, including a rule requiring cleaner gasoline and lower-pollution vehicles that critics in the oil industry warned would increase the cost of gasoline. That rule was ready in December 2011 but was only issued in March 2013. Other regulations delayed until after the election dealt with coal ash disposal and emissions caps on existing power plants, according to the Post.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget, which reviews new regulations, told the Post that the agency \u201cworks as expeditiously as possible to review rules, but when it comes to complex rules with significant potential impact, we take the time needed to get them right.\u201d\n\nBut critics are bound to see political motives behind the delays, and it seems Congress is already gearing up for a fresh series of hearings.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Federal Rights and Agency Action, told the Post he\u2019s concerned about the tangible effects of the delayed regulations.\n\n\u201cLegal protection delayed is protection denied,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to officials at the top rungs of the White House power structure and at OIRA and we\u2019re going to hold their feet to the fire, and we\u2019re going to make sure they\u2019re held accountable in a series of hearings.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Politically sensitive regulations on Obamacare subsidies, environmental protection were slow-walked ahead of the election, officials say", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-wh-delayed-obamacare-epa-rules-till-after-2012-election/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/15/aa8c47d4-582a-407f-aed5-cc34222d3fce/thumbnail/1200x630/d324ad3f114f18b851af305bfaa5e55c/167281021.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Politically sensitive regulations on Obamacare subsidies, environmental protection were slow-walked ahead of the election, officials say", "title": "Report: W.H. delayed Obamacare, EPA rules till after 2012 election"}, "twitter": {"description": "Politically sensitive regulations on Obamacare subsidies, environmental protection were slow-walked ahead of the election, officials say", "title": "Report: W.H. delayed Obamacare, EPA rules till after 2012 election", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/report-wh-delayed-obamacare-epa-rules-till-after-2012-election/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/report-wh-delayed-obamacare-epa-rules-till-after-2012-election/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-wh-delayed-obamacare-epa-rules-till-after-2012-election/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/15/aa8c47d4-582a-407f-aed5-cc34222d3fce/thumbnail/1200x630/d324ad3f114f18b851af305bfaa5e55c/167281021.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/report-wh-delayed-obamacare-epa-rules-till-after-2012-election/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/report-wh-delayed-obamacare-epa-rules-till-after-2012-election/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca9db\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLegal protection delayed is protection denied,\u201d he said.\nOther regulations delayed until after the election dealt with coal ash disposal and emissions caps on existing power plants, according to the Post.\nSen.
