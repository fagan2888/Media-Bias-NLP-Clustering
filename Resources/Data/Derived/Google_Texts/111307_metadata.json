Keller Williams\u2019 89,000 associates will now have the opportunity to pick plans via ConnectedHealth, although they will still have to pay for them.\n\n\u201cWhen the Affordable Care Act passed, we got into a conversation with Willis (Keller Williams\u2019 health insurance broker) about what that means for our real estate associates,\u201d said Leslie Vander Gheynst, director of Human Resources at Keller Williams.\n\nShe said Keller Williams had always offered its employees benefits, but their associates \u2014 mostly independent contractors \u2014 were a different story.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires every American to purchase health insurance under threat of penalty, and provides financial support for those with a low income.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a solution so that our associates wouldn\u2019t be penalized,\u201d said Vander Gheynst.\n\nThe solution she came up with was ConnectedHealth. The platform operates in a similar fashion as the newly-opened public exchanges: customers can look at different healthcare plans explained in simple language and choose one that suits their needs.\n\nKeller Williams\u2019 decision to help its employees is a rarity among real estate companies, who largely leave their associates to fend for themselves when it comes to healthcare.\n\nAccording to surveys by the National Association of Realtors, between 28% and 30% of Realtors in the U.S. don\u2019t have healthcare coverage. Marcia Salkin, NAR\u2019s managing director for legislative policy, said that about half of those Realtors with insurance are on the plan of a spouse with employer-sponsored healthcare.\n\n\u201cFor the most, part real estate companies offer healthcare only to salaried employees, and typically don\u2019t offer it to associates,\u201d said Salkin. She added that a large portion of Realtors likely qualify for federal financial support under the Affordable Care Act. Any household with an income below about $96,000 \u2014 or 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 is eligible for insurance credits.\n\nMany brokers not only stand to benefit from credits, but also from the fact that they can no longer be turned down because of age or pre-existing conditions.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been telling our members is to check out the exchanges. They should by all means keep working with (insurance) brokers they\u2019ve worked with in the past, but also make sure their current programs are eligible for credits,\u201d said Salkin. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act should benefit our membership.", "article_metadata": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f45\"", "article_summary": "Keller Williams\u2019 89,000 associates will now have the opportunity to pick plans via ConnectedHealth, although they will still have to pay for them.\nShe said Keller Williams had always offered its employees benefits, but their associates \u2014 mostly independent contractors \u2014 were a different story.\n\u201cWhen the Affordable Care Act passed, we got into a conversation with Willis (Keller Williams\u2019 health insurance broker) about what that means for our real estate associates,\u201d said Leslie Vander Gheynst, director of Human Resources at Keller Williams.\nShe added that a large portion of Realtors likely qualify for federal financial support under the Affordable Care Act.\nKeller Williams\u2019 decision to help its employees is a rarity among real estate companies, who largely leave their associates to fend for themselves when it comes to healthcare."}
