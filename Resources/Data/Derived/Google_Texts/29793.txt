In honor of this Easter weekend a group from Clarke County made a trek across the area to spread the message of Jesus' love.

It's an annual event called the Via Dolorosa walk put on locally by the Faith Assembly of God. Participants walked all day from Enterprise to Stonewall, to Quitman, to Archusa Memorial Gardens. The group started out with 100 walkers from many different denominations. They carry giant crosses as a reminder of the sacrifice of Jesus.

"If we can just show an ounce. Just a little bit of what Jesus did on that cross," youth pastor Jonathan Fulcher says. "The love that he showed on that cross for us, it made an impact. If it reaches just one person in our community, then we've done exactly what we need to do through this. "

The group wore blue shirts in honor of Monica Gavin, who's participated in all of the walks for the past 20 years.
