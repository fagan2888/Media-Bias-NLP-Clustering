Some content on the site doesn't even appear to have been proof-read\n\nIt appears that only a handful of users have been able to sign up for health insurance through Healthcare.gov ten days after the site launched\n\nIn 2011, the Obama Administration agreed to pay contractor CGI Federal $93.7 million to build, launch and maintain Healthcare.gov.\n\nIn the two and years since CGI Federal won the bid to build the Obamacare site, the company requested more and more money to cover cost over-runs. And the federal government had agreed.\n\n\n\nExperts say the site has dramatic problems with the back-end architecture has resulted in servers becoming overloaded and bogging down. But the interface is also a problem. Much of the site contains grammatical and typographical errors. Java Script errors prevent pages from loading correctly in browsers.\n\n\n\nEven more infuriating, Andrew Couts of Digital Trends points out, is the fact that much larger, more successful sites have been built for far less money.\n\n\n\nCGI has collected $634 million overall in Department of Health and Human Services contracts since 2006.\n\n\n\nFacebook operated for its six years, until June 2010, on less than $600 million in outside funding - a acquiring more than half a billion users and more than 130million monthly unique page views.\n\n\n\nTwitter, founded in 2006, operated on $360 million in investment until 2011 - when servers were processing more than 140 million tweets a day.\n\n\n\nThe October 1 roll out of health insurance exchanges is one of the key pieces President Barack Obama's health care law\n\nThe professional social network LinkedIn built a base of more than 230 million users with $200 million in funding.\n\nThe Washington Post reports that 4.7 million people tried to log onto the site in the first 24 hours.\n\nBut, the government has refused to release traffic number for Healthcare.gov since.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the site allowed visitors to create a username, but was not allowing log-ins.\n\n\n\nDigitial Trends points out that it's not as though the United States of is short on talent when it comes to developing online software - Americans invested the Internet itself, after all.\n\nCGI Federal has refused to comment on the glitches and why Healthcare.gov has failed to work - or when full service might be restored.\n\n\n\nGovernment contractor CGI Federal won the contract to build Healthcare.gov two years ago - for $94million\n\nThe Department of Better Technology , a federal contractor that competes with CGI Federal, sheds some insight into why the Healthcare.gov contract might have failed so spectacularly.\n\n'That cancer is called \u201cprocurement\u201d and it\u2019s primarily a culture driven cancer one that tries to mitigate so much risk that it all but ensures it. It\u2019s one that allowed for only a handful of companies like CGI Federal to not only build disasters like this, but to keep building more and more failures without any accountability to the ultimate client: us,' the company wrote in an op-ed posted on its site.\n\nOn top of promoting mediocrity, the federal procurement system also weighs down site developers with 6,500 pages of registration and regulation for contractors.\n\n\n\nThose restriction ensure that 'very few new businesses can compete for contracts, and the ones that do end up becoming specialists in those regulatory burdens, not in doing the right thing,' the Department of Better Technology says.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Obamacare,website,cost,394,MILLION,doesnt,work", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2452404/Obamacare-website-cost-394-MILLION-doesnt-work.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Despite the massive bill to taxpayers, Healthcare.gov has allowed only a handful of Americans to sign up for plans on the insurance exchange market.", "title": "Obamacare website cost $394 MILLION and it still doesn't work", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2452404/Obamacare-website-cost-394-MILLION-doesnt-work.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/10/article-2452404-18A83F7300000578-288_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2452404, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Obamacare,website,cost,394,MILLION,doesnt,work", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-10-10T16:31:02.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Michael+Zennie", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-10-22T03:36:50.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Obamacare website cost 394 MILLION doesnt work"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Despite the massive bill to taxpayers, Healthcare.gov has allowed only a handful of Americans to sign up for plans on the insurance exchange market.", "title": "Obamacare website cost $394 MILLION and it still doesn't work", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2452404/Obamacare-website-cost-394-MILLION-doesnt-work.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/10/article-2452404-18A83F7300000578-288_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Despite the massive bill to taxpayers, Healthcare.gov has allowed only a handful of Americans to sign up for plans on the insurance exchange market."}, "article_summary": "In the two and years since CGI Federal won the bid to build the Obamacare site, the company requested more and more money to cover cost over-runs.\nCGI Federal has refused to comment on the glitches and why Healthcare.gov has failed to work - or when full service might be restored.\nThe October 1 roll out of health insurance exchanges is one of the key pieces President Barack Obama's health care lawThe professional social network LinkedIn built a base of more than 230 million users with $200 million in funding.\nTwitter, founded in 2006, operated on $360 million in investment until 2011 - when servers were processing more than 140 million tweets a day.\nFailure: This is the error message MailOnline received on Thursday when a reporter tried to sign in to Healthcare.gov."}
