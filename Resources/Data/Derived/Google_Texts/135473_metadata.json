Democratic incumbent Rep. Anne Kuster has come out swinging by trying to tie her Republican opponent, New Hampshire House Representative Marilinda Garcia, as a Tea Party extremist.\n\nKuster spokesperson Rosie Hilmer said, \u201cFrom wanting to completely abolish the Department of Education, to opposing the Violence Against Women Act and a woman\u2019s right to choose, to voting to privatize Social Security, her [Garcia\u2019s] policies would be devastating for hardworking Granite State families across the board. Students, women, seniors, and their families deserve to know the truth this election season about how Garcia\u2019s extreme Tea Party positions would affect them.\u201d\n\nYet, Kenny Cunningham, communications director for Garcia\u2019s congressional campaign, issued the following statement about Kuster\u2019s ad:\n\n\u201cIt is extremely disappointing that Ann Kuster is already relying on negative attack ads in her race for re-election. Ann Kuster clearly has no record to run on from her time in Congress, and she is trying to distract from her unwavering support for President Obama and Obamacare. Obamacare has drastically burdened our hardworking retirees with its severe cuts to the Medicare advantage system and has reduced choices for patients, as the majority of New Hampshire health care providers are now out of network. No state has been harder hit by the Obama-Kuster agenda, so it is no surprise that Kuster is using negative, dishonest ads to distract from her record and paint Marilinda Garcia as someone she is not.\u201d\n\nElected in 2012, Kuster has yet to hold a town hall meeting with her constituents. She did attend one outside her district in Manchester back in November of 2013, but it was a disaster; she had a painfully awkward response to a question that asked her opinion on the creation of a select committee to investigate the Benghazi terror attacks.\n\nNonetheless, some of her constituents are getting restless. In a letter to the editor featured in the Laconia Daily Sun, Ryan Smith asked Rep. Kuster why she is \u201cunwilling to participate in this tradition\u201d of hosting a town hall. In another letter to the editor for the Eagle-Tribune, Noel Lyons-Baker wrote, \u201cIf Annie Kuster doesn't have time to meet with me in the span of four years [alluding to her 2010 run as well],[sic] she certainly doesn't deserve to represent me in Washington.\u201d\n\nSo, while Kuster may rail against Garcia and the Tea Party, she should probably focus on organizing some town halls. Then again, it\u2019s kind of hard for Democrats to defend the president\u2019s policies right now. So, don\u2019t expect Kuster planning any such meetings in the foreseeable future.\n\nOn the other hand, State Rep. Garcia's ad really isn't all that negative. It talks about the string of scandals that has eroded the public trust in government and how we need a \"new generation of conservative leaders to challenge the status quo.\" Garcia says she's done that in New Hampshire and will carry that tradition to Washington D.C.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patience wearing thin..05/26/2016 20:32:57PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Patience wearing thin.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Rep.
