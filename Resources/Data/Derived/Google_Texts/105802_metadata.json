The design includes features like specially shaped sofas that can seat as many as a dozen visitors. These amenities put patient needs at the forefront, according to Forbes contributor Micah Solomon.\n\n\"The relationship that matters is among your customers; the relationship between your customer and their service provider--you--is in a real sense secondary: it's a role for you of facilitation and support,\" Solomon writes. \"If you provide a stage, a backdrop for the primary relationships of your customer, you can become, and remain, their provider of choice.\"\n\nAs providers structure their customer service model around this idea, Solomon writes, they should keep a few considerations about modern demographics in mind, such as:\n\nThe larger number of single-person households, which means single people will form \"alternative groupings\"\n\nThe fact that millennials travel with their parents far more than previous generations\n\nThe high number of U.S. households--80 percent--that do not follow the traditional nuclear family format of a mother, father and children\n\nThe increasing number of people who travel for an interest or hobby\n\nSolomon compares the amenities offered by Mayo to those at the newly-opened Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World Resort, which similarly considers units other than the nuclear family in hospitality and customer service considerations.\n\nA May article drew similar parallels, suggesting lessons in customer service Disney theme parks can teach healthcare, such as personalizing the experience for individual customers based on their preferences. Others, however, have argued that some customer service amenities, such as flat-screen televisions and room service, have more to do with marketing than patient outcomes, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Forbes article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAre high-end, hotel-like amenities a waste of money?\n\n4 lessons Disney can teach healthcare leaders\n\nDo hotel-like hospitals deliver patient-centered care?\n\nWhat patients want in a hospital\n\nFierce Q&A: NYU Langone VP on why a hospital is not a hotel\n\nJohns Hopkins unveils $1.1B hotel-like hospital\n\nHospital room service boosts patient-centered care\n\nCalifornia hospitals amp up customer service to boost HCAHPS scores, reimbursement", "article_metadata": {"description": "A patient experience approach by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota may represent a new front in healthcare customer service,\u00a0according to\u00a0Forbes.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A patient experience approach by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota may represent a new front in healthcare customer service,\u00a0according to\u00a0Forbes.", "title": "Mayo Clinic looks to changing demographics in customer service approach", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/mayo-clinic-looks-changing-demographics-customer-service-approach/2014-10-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "customer service,hospital amenities,Mayo Clinic,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Experience,Patient Satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2104\"", "article_summary": "A patient experience approach by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota may represent a new front in healthcare customer service, according to Forbes.\nOthers, however, have argued that some customer service amenities, such as flat-screen televisions and room service, have more to do with marketing than patient outcomes, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nA May article drew similar parallels, suggesting lessons in customer service Disney theme parks can teach healthcare, such as personalizing the experience for individual customers based on their preferences.\nTo learn more:- read the Forbes articleRelated Articles:Are high-end, hotel-like amenities a waste of money?\nWhat patients want in a hospitalFierce Q&A: NYU Langone VP on why a hospital is not a hotelJohns Hopkins unveils $1.1B hotel-like hospitalHospital room service boosts patient-centered careCalifornia hospitals amp up customer service to boost HCAHPS scores, reimbursement"}
