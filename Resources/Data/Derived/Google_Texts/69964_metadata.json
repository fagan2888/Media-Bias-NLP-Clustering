Maybe you have one already, though it\u2019s likely you haven\u2019t gotten yours yet. Either way, you\u2019re probably wondering what all the buzz is about.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat are these new cards?\n\nAt long last the U.S. is playing catch up, adopting a technology known as EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) that is long past being headline news in Europe and other places around the globe. The new card includes a chip \u2014 it\u2019s a small metallic rectangle or square embedded in the plastic \u2014 that acts like the magnetic stripe with two key differences to improve security. \u201cThe chip generates a unique code for every transaction so it cannot be easily copied,\u201d explains Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at Intel Security. Second, the cards typically will require you to enter a PIN to verify that you are who you say you are.\n\nRelated: Your Credit Card Is Getting an Upgrade. Are You Ready?\n\nThe old cards and readers aren\u2019t going to disappear all at once, but Oct. 1 is the deadline created by Visa, MasterCard and American Express for retailers to switch over to the new technology or be held liable for any fraudulent credit card activity they process. As part of the change, about 1.2 billion credit and debit cards and 12 million card-reading terminals have to be upgraded.\n\nWhat does this mean for me?\n\n\u201cBetter overall security than magnetic strip cards because they require a two-factor authentication,\u201d says Davis. He adds that the credit card readers that store magnetic information and record your PIN number don\u2019t work with these cards, \u201cso career criminals will have a harder time stealing your information.\u201d Also, in case of a database hack, cyber criminals would see a useless log of transaction codes rather than sensitive card information.\n\nRelated: The Upside to Those Credit Card Hacks\n\nSo can I stop worrying about credit card fraud?\n\nNope, sorry. The \u201cprotection\u201d you get with a chip card doesn\u2019t really extend beyond the brick and mortar world. In fact, experts expect that online credit card fraud will dramatically increase. \u201cThis was the experience in the United Kingdom, where online credit card fraud went up 79 percent in the three years following the switch to EMV chip credit cards,\u201d says attorney Steven Weisman, author of Identity Theft Alert. \u201cThe chip cannot be used in online purchases, so all the criminal needs is the credit card number and the expiration date, which can be obtained in a myriad of ways.\u201d\n\nThere are safeguards, however. At American Express, you can get an \u201calert\u201d any time your card is charged but not present.\n\nThe bottom line: EMV technology is not a silver bullet. It can reduce fraud but not eliminate it.\n\nRelated: 3 Simple Steps to Protect Yourself from Cyber Criminals\n\nHow exactly do the new cards work?\n\nThe credit card machines in retail stores will still function with a swipe because your card will continue to have a magnetic stripe on the back. If a merchant is switching to EMV acceptance, check-out clerks will forego asking you to swipe and instead will have you insert the card into the slot, chip side first. The card remains in the slot for long enough that the chip security data can be read and verified, which is a couple of seconds or less, says Toffer Grant, CEO and founder of PEX Card, a pre-paid expense card solution for small and medium sized businesses. You may also need to enter a PIN code \u2014 or, more likely, sign a slip because chip-and-signature is taking much stronger root in America than chip-and-PIN, says Robert Siciliano, CEO of www.IdTheftSecurity.com.\n\nThis last part isn\u2019t good news. \u201cThe signature version\u2019s most obvious drawback is that it\u2019s useless in all the other nations where PIN technology rules. A signature can be forged and a card can be intercepted prior to transaction completion. Consumers, thinking that the \u2018chip\u2019 part of their signature version means great security, will be miffed once they realize how vulnerable signature really is,\u201d says Siciliano.\n\nSo what\u2019s this all going to cost?\n\nAdditional security isn\u2019t free. The average cost of a new card to the issuers is estimated to be $3.50, and the point-of-sale terminals can run from $500 to $1,000. Consumers shouldn\u2019t have to pay any direct costs, but because adoption is likely to be slow, there may be some hiccups as part of the transition. \u201cGiven that this is new for everyone, shoppers and merchants together can expect that it will take a little time for habits to change,\u201d says Grant.\n\nRelated: The Best Things to Charge on Your Credit Card\n\nThe changeover may cause some confusion for check-out employees and shoppers alike, which could add to the amount of time it takes to pay for your purchases. Keep in mind that as merchants switch over, many will have new hardware, but not new software. Hopefully, this problem will dissipate as everybody gets the hang of the new system \u2014 and by the time holiday shopping season rolls around, the new technology will feel more familiar. For now, says Matthew Goldman, CEO of Wallaby Financial, \u201cYou can ask the merchant, or just try swiping. If the terminal accepts chip cards, it will flash an error and instruct you to dip instead of swipe.\u201d\n\nBut any temporary pain will be worth the long-term gain. Wade Barnes, senior vice president and director of retail banking at 1st Mariner Bank sums it up for consumers: \u201cBe excited that steps are being made to protect you from fraud with no action or cost required at your expense. The cards are safe and a step forward in fraud protection.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "By now you\u2019ve heard about the new credit cards with computer chips in addition to the", "title": "Your New Chip Credit Card: Everything You Need to Know", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/01/Your-New-Chip-Credit-Card-Everything-You-Need-Know", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10012015_Credit_Card_Chip.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/01/Your-New-Chip-Credit-Card-Everything-You-Need-Know", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/10012015_Credit_Card_Chip.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "By now you\u2019ve heard about the new credit cards with computer chips in addition to the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: The Upside to Those Credit Card HacksSo can I stop worrying about credit card fraud?\nIn fact, experts expect that online credit card fraud will dramatically increase.\n\u201cThis was the experience in the United Kingdom, where online credit card fraud went up 79 percent in the three years following the switch to EMV chip credit cards,\u201d says attorney Steven Weisman, author of Identity Theft Alert.\nThe \u201cprotection\u201d you get with a chip card doesn\u2019t really extend beyond the brick and mortar world.\nThe credit card machines in retail stores will still function with a swipe because your card will continue to have a magnetic stripe on the back."}
