Musicians wondering how new tax credits for health insurance or new Oregon Health Plan rules could help with low-cost coverage can learn more tonight at the Doug Fir Lounge.







The forum runs from 6p.m. to 8p.m., and Cover Oregon, the state's new online health exchange, will present information about the changes under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. The changes raise a special set of questions for musicians whose income varies month to month.

Though the website isn't yet enrolling people, Cover Oregon will allow people to reduce monthly commercial health insurance premiums using tax credits based on projected 2014 income.

Moreover, the Oregon Health Plan will no longer use an asset test to disqualify people for having substantial savings. Instead, eligibility will be based solely on income, and the cap on income is going up significantly -- to about $15,860 for individuals or $21,408 for a family of two.

The event is hosted by the Doug Fir and the Jeremy Wilson Foundation, and will include a performance by Pete Krebs, the Portland guitar player who is battling a rare form of cancer.
