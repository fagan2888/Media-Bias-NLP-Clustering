You can read about it in my 2010 resignation letter from Shimer\u2019s Board of Trustees.\n\nSo how has Shimer done since the inmates took it over? A ranking of colleges published by Washington Monthly in October \u2014 based on cost of tuition, student indebtedness, and graduation rates, and adjusted for the percentage of students who are minority or low-income \u2014 ranked Shimer the worst college in America.\n\nThat\u2019s not a typo. Shimer College isn\u2019t just bad, or near the bottom. It\u2019s the absolute worst college in the country.\n\nHow does a college get to be that bad? A reporter for the British newspaper, The Guardian, was curious and visited the school to find out. His report, in which he noted Shimer is \u201cthe very zenith of terrible,\u201d makes for entertaining reading, at least for those unfamiliar with the history of the institution. The Guardian\u2019s Jon Ronson writes:\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, Shimer was the second smallest college in America in 2012, after the Alaska Bible College. In its 1960s heyday it had 400 students. In 2011 there were 126, which slipped to 112 in 2012, then down again to 97 in 2013. And now they have 74.\n\nSeventy-four students? That\u2019s not a college, it\u2019s a book club \u2014which has long been the rap on Shimer College, and something we reformers set out to change.\n\nNearly all the reformers were kicked off the board of trustees or had resigned by the end of 2010. How different would the college be today if the anti-reformers had put the interests of college ahead of their self-interest and ideological agendas? We\u2019ll never know.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/12/shimer-great-books-horrible-college/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/800px-Shimer_College_Assembly_Nov_15_2009.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Shimer: Great Books, Horrible College"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1720\"", "article_summary": "A few years ago, I was one of a dozen brave souls who tried to save Shimer College \u2014 a small \u201cgreat books\u201d college in Chicago \u2014 from falling enrollment, bankruptcy, and a dysfunctional cultural atmosphere.\nThat\u2019s not a college, it\u2019s a book club \u2014which has long been the rap on Shimer College, and something we reformers set out to change.\nShimer College isn\u2019t just bad, or near the bottom.\nThe Guardian\u2019s Jon Ronson writes:According to the Huffington Post, Shimer was the second smallest college in America in 2012, after the Alaska Bible College.\nIt\u2019s the absolute worst college in the country."}
