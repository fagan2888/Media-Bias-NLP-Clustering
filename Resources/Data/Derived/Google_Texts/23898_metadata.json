WMT said Brett Biggs would take over the role of chief financial officer from Charles Holley, who will step down later this year. Biggs, 47 years old, currently manages the finances of WMT\u2019s international division.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer in terms of revenue also announced that it has selected Steve Bratspies as its chief merchandising officer, which is an important responsibility deciding what and how the company will sell products at its roughly 4,500 stores across the U.S. Bratspies is filling a position that has been vacant for a year after the exit of Duncan Mac Naughton.\n\nThe appointments are the latest in series of changes in the top positions under CEO Doug McMillon, who has been restructuring the company since he took charge of the retailer about 18 months ago.
