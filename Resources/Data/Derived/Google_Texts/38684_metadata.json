While Duchene has kept his position of center, O\u2019Reilly is learning a new position, left wing, on a line with Duchene. The early results, including their showing in scrimmages Thursday, have Avs coach Patrick Roy smiling.\n\n\u201cWow. I thought it was a nice clinic out there,\u201d said Roy, when asked about their performance. \u201cHe and Ryan seem to work really well together.\u201d\n\nWhen the Avs drafted Nathan MacKinnon first overall this summer, O\u2019Reilly was converted from a top-three center to a top-six winger. While Duchene has looked tremendous in camp, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s play has been even more noticeable. Not only has he been strong in open-ice, freewheeling situations, he has been tough to handle in the corners.\n\n\u201cRyan is a smart guy. He\u2019s so good along the wall,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe\u2019s really making room for \u2018Dutchy,\u2019 and they\u2019re clicking really well.\u201d\n\nDuchene\u2019s line was often matched against MacKinnon\u2019s line, with Jamie McGinn and Steve Downie, and was clearly superior in its 5-3 win in the scrimmage. MacKinnon, in fact, seemed a bit upset at his play in his first scrimmage of camp, saying it went \u201cjust all right.\u201d\n\nBut Roy was happy with what he saw from his prized 18-year-old rookie, while acknowledging there is room for growth.\n\n\u201cI thought he was good. He started to feel more comfortable on the ice. His passes started to connect more and he looked good out there,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThis is according to our plan. Sometimes, when you want to impress too much, the opposite happens. All he needs to do is be himself, and he\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\nDuchene can relate to what MacKinnon is going through. He too came to the Avs as an 18-year-old lottery pick, but now is a four-year veteran with advice to his fellow Ontario native.\n\n\u201cThe pace is definitely faster, and he\u2019s going to see he doesn\u2019t have as much time with the puck as in junior,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cAnd the (defensive) zone thing to learn as a young centerman is really tough to learn. In junior, you have maybe one line that can make you work defensively, then the rest of the lines you\u2019re able to kind of read what they\u2019re going to do. At this level, you\u2019ve got four lines that can do it. It\u2019ll be an adjustment for him, but he\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s going to take some time, but he\u2019s got so much raw ability. He\u2019ll get the timing down and he\u2019ll be great.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly maintained he\u2019s just happy to have a full training camp this season, as opposed to last season\u2019s lockout/contract situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just nice to be with the guys and be working with them,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\n\nFootnotes. Downie left the scrimmage early, but Roy said the forward was fine and would return Saturday. Downie missed all but two games last season with a knee injury. \u2026 Defenseman Erik Johnson scored two goals in his Black team\u2019s win over the Blue.\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Matt Duchene and Ryan O\u2019Reilly becoming dynamic duo for Avalanche", "title": "Matt Duchene and Ryan O\u2019Reilly becoming dynamic duo for Avalanche", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/13/matt-duchene-and-ryan-oreilly-becoming-dynamic-duo-for-avalanche/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130303__SP03HKNAVSOREILLY_KO19198p1.jpg", "height": 476}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130303__SP03HKNAVSOREILLY_KO19198p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-13T15:17:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T13:35:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadb4\"", "article_summary": "While Duchene has kept his position of center, O\u2019Reilly is learning a new position, left wing, on a line with Duchene.\nWhen Matt Duchene and Ryan O\u2019Reilly saw their names connected in the media last season, the headlines were not always very good.\nAll he needs to do is be himself, and he\u2019s going to be fine.\u201dDuchene can relate to what MacKinnon is going through.\n\u201cThe pace is definitely faster, and he\u2019s going to see he doesn\u2019t have as much time with the puck as in junior,\u201d Duchene said.\nDuchene and O\u2019Reilly dominated much of the action in Friday\u2019s scrimmages at Family Sports Center."}
