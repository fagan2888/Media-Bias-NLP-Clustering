The Daniel J. Murphy Jr. Memorial Regatta will be held Sept. 6 and 7 at Lake Lenape in Mays Landing. The American Power Boat Association is inviting all 350 CID garveys, mod and stock classes.

Classes will run together, with as many qualifiers as needed to make a final. The mods will start directly behind the stock class with a 5 second or so delay.

This is a 3/4- to 1-mile course that is fitted well to the garvey’s usual course sizes. All club affiliations are invited to participate. The fees are $50 for a single event weekend APBA membership (unless you are already an APBA racing member) plus the race entry fee of $110.

Tuckerton fire company helped

At Tuckerton Beach recently, the Jersey Outlaws saw an unprecedented number of fans – estimated at more then 1,000 – as they partnered with the Tuckerton Fire Company for a fundraising effort.

The Tuckerton Fire Company said, “Thanks to the Jersey Outlaws for partnering with us to help us raise funds through refreshment sales at today's boat races.’’

Fans gathered at the municipal dock and cheered on their favorite drivers.
