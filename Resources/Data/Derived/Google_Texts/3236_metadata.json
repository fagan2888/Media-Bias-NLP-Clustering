( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer )\n\nErie's Red Hawk Elementary recently was awarded a grant to develop an online class for teachers on incorporating more movement into the school day.\n\nThe $50,000, two-year Thriving Schools grant from Kaiser Permanente Colorado allows the school to continue work from a previous $100,000, two-year Thriving Schools grant, said Red Hawk Principal Cyrus Weinberger.\n\n\"We want to take a very successful model and scale it up,\" he said.\n\nIn the most recent round of Thriving Schools grants, sixteen Colorado school districts will receive a combined $968,080.\n\nAlong with the grant to St. Vrain's Red Hawk, the neighboring Adams 12 school district will receive $150,000 over two years to introduce and support physical activity programs at multiple schools, including Legacy High School.\n\nAt Erie's Red Hawk, the school has scheduled student movement sessions each morning since the school opened in August 2011.\n\nWeinberger said the benefits of integrating movement in the school day \u2014 higher academic performance, better retention of information and focus, and fewer behavior issues \u2014 is backed by about 20 years of research.\n\nUsing the first Thriving Schools grant, he said, Red Hawk provided training for 75 teachers at five elementary schools plus Erie Middle and Erie High. The teachers also met monthly Red Hawk mentors.\n\nThe new grant will go to develop a semester-long online class that will culminate with a capstone project at the teacher's school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Teachers will learn about the research and resources, then, within their school, they'll identify a project to bring in more physical activity,\" Weinberger said. \"The goal is for those teachers to form a core team to sustain what they're doing over time.\"\n\nTodd Bissell, principal at Erie Middle School, said teachers were \"really intrigued\" by the idea of integrating movement into class time.\n\nHe said about 10 teachers received training from Red Hawk, then shared what they learned with the rest of the school's staff members. Teachers started adding \"brain breaks\" and other physical activity in late spring.\n\nThe options are flexible enough to meet the needs of different grades, he said. Sixth-graders, for example, like jumping jacks and following choreographed dance moves. Eighth-graders like to take outside walks.\n\n\"It helps them become more attentive in class,\" Bissell said. \"It helps wake the brain up.\"\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28946719/red-hawk-awarded-grant-continue-teacher-training-movement", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28946719:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-10T13:15:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Erie's Red Hawk Elementary recently was awarded a grant to develop an online class for teachers on incorporating more movement into the school day.", "title": "Red Hawk awarded grant to continue teacher training on movement", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28946719/red-hawk-awarded-grant-continue-teacher-training-movement", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1009/20151009__11DCAMOVw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1009/20151009__11DCAMOVw~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2015-10-09T14:26:14-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-09T13:48:36-0600", "description": "Erie's Red Hawk Elementary recently was awarded a grant to develop an online class for teachers on incorporating more movement into the school day.", "byline": "By Amy BoundsStaff", "pubDate": "2015-10-09T14:26:59-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-10T13:15:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Red Hawk awarded grant to continue teacher training on movement", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Boulder Education & Schools", "news_keywords": "news information  boulder county schools elementary middle high preps", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-schools/ci_28946719/red-hawk-awarded-grant-continue-teacher-training-movement", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Erie's Red Hawk Elementary recently was awarded a grant to develop an online class for teachers on incorporating more movement into the school day.", "title": "Red Hawk awarded grant to continue teacher training on movement"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/1009/20151009__11DCAMOVw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "The $50,000, two-year Thriving Schools grant from Kaiser Permanente Colorado allows the school to continue work from a previous $100,000, two-year Thriving Schools grant, said Red Hawk Principal Cyrus Weinberger.\nUsing the first Thriving Schools grant, he said, Red Hawk provided training for 75 teachers at five elementary schools plus Erie Middle and Erie High.\nAt Erie's Red Hawk, the school has scheduled student movement sessions each morning since the school opened in August 2011.\n( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer )Erie's Red Hawk Elementary recently was awarded a grant to develop an online class for teachers on incorporating more movement into the school day.\nThe school has been awarded a grant to develop an online class for teachers on incorporating more movement into the school day."}
