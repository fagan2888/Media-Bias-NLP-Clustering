Nearly all Americans will be required to have health insurance by 2014 or pay an escalating series of penalties to the government.\n\nThe UConn Poll found that a large majority of Americans (84 percent) say they\u2019re aware of the deadline to purchase health insurance, one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s most contentious provisions. Two-thirds (66 percent) say they won\u2019t participate in the health insurance marketplaces opening Oct. 1, including more than a quarter (27 percent) of people who currently have no health insurance.\n\nWhile most Americans (57 percent) say they have enough information on the Affordable Care Act, significant numbers of respondents are less clear on what the law means. Forty-five percent say they\u2019re not sure how the Oct. 1 opening of insurance marketplaces will affect their own health coverage.\n\nThere is broad support for the idea of government-backed healthcare, however, with 61 percent saying the government should provide it for those unable to pay for it, compared to 31 percent opposed.\n\n\u201cWhile Americans may like the concept of making healthcare available to all, they aren\u2019t enthusiastic about this particular law,\u201d says UConn Poll director Jennifer Necci Dineen. \u201cSome of that may be tied to how they feel about President Obama and the state of the country.\u201d\n\nAccording to Paul Herrnson, executive director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research and professor of political science at UConn, \u201cAmericans\u2019 opinions about the government\u2019s role in providing health care have shifted over time, especially when it comes to addressing the needs of the less well off. In 1938, 78 percent believed that the government should be responsible for providing medical care for those who are unable to pay for it; only 19 percent opposed it. During the early 1990s, public support was at 80 percent.\n\nThe poll found that 64 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track, with 24 percent saying it\u2019s headed in the right direction. Americans also take a dim view of the job President Obama is doing, with 51 percent disapproving and 44 percent giving him their seal of approval. Congress is even less popular: 77 percent say they disapprove of the job lawmakers are doing, compared to 16 percent who approve.\n\n\u201cFifty percent of the country is unhappy with the job President Obama is doing, and so that makes it hard to sell a piece of legislation with his name on it,\u201d Dineen says, pointing to low marks for how Obama is handling the federal budget deficit (36 percent approve), healthcare reform in general (44 percent), and the situation in Syria (45 percent).\n\nIn a more detailed look at the country\u2019s opinions on the Affordable Care Act, some clear distinctions emerge. Those in the Northeast are more likely to have a favorable view of the law (49 percent) than those in the Midwest (34 percent), the South (35 percent), or the West (37 percent).\n\nThose likeliest to regard the law favorably include Democrats (69 percent), people with a post-graduate education (58 percent, compared to 33 percent of college graduates), and those aged 18 to 34 (52 percent). Those most likely to view the Affordable Care Act unfavorably include Republicans (85 percent), those aged 35 to 49 (66 percent), and people who attended college without earning a degree (62 percent).\n\nDifferences in opinion between the two parties are at a historic high. Digging back into the Roper Center\u2019s archive, Herrnson found that 83 percent of individuals who voted for a Democrat in the 1938 congressional elections supported government provision of medical care for the needy, compared to 70 percent of Republican voters. In 1991, 89 percent of Democrats supported this position, as did 73 percent of Republicans and 80 percent of independents. The corresponding figures in the UConn poll are 84 percent, 42 percent, and 60 percent.\n\nFor a complete set of questions and tabulations, visit www.poll.uconn.edu.\n\nThese findings are based on The UConn Poll. The national sample of 1,015 randomly selected adults were interviewed by landline and cellular telephone between Sept. 13 and Sept. 19, 2013. The margin of sampling error for the survey is +/- 3 percentage points for the entire sample, and larger for subgroups.\n\nThe data have been weighted by the number of adults in a household and the number of telephone numbers, land and cellular, at which adults in the household can be reached in order to equalize the chances of an individual adult being selected. The data have also been weighted by the sex, race, and level of education of the respondent, based on the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "UConn Today", "description": "More than half of Americans say they disapprove of the law, but nearly half say they don\u2019t know as much as they\u2019d like about the program.", "title": "UConn Poll: As \u2018Obamacare\u2019 Enrollment Begins, Majority Unfavorable - UConn Today", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://uconn-today.universityofconn.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/opinion-on-affordable-care-act-featured2.jpg", "height": 420}, "updated_time": "2013-09-30T16:31:11-04:00", "url": "http://today.uconn.edu/2013/09/uconn-poll-as-obamacare-enrollment-begins-majority-unfavorable/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than half of Americans say they disapprove of the law, but nearly half say they don\u2019t know as much as they\u2019d like about the program.", "creator": "@uconn", "image": "http://uconn-today.universityofconn.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/opinion-on-affordable-care-act-featured2.jpg", "title": "UConn Poll: As \u2018Obamacare\u2019 Enrollment Begins, Majority Unfavorable - UConn Today", "site": "@uconn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UConn/", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2013-09-25T05:01:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-30T16:31:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbe2\"", "article_summary": "The corresponding figures in the UConn poll are 84 percent, 42 percent, and 60 percent.\nWith enrollment set to begin Oct. 1, a UConn Poll released today finds most Americans disapprove of the landmark legislation formally known as the Affordable Care Act.\nThese findings are based on The UConn Poll.\nThe UConn Poll found that a large majority of Americans (84 percent) say they\u2019re aware of the deadline to purchase health insurance, one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s most contentious provisions.\nIn a more detailed look at the country\u2019s opinions on the Affordable Care Act, some clear distinctions emerge."}
