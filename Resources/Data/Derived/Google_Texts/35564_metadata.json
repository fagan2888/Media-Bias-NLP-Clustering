Not only that, but it seems Obama\u2019s primary legacy will be to undo that of his Democrat predecessor.\n\nJust one day after Obama delivered a speech before the NAACP in Philadelphia to declare criminal justice reform, Clinton took the stage to admit that his prison reform policies actually made things worse.\n\n\u201cI signed a bill that made the problem worse, and I want to admit it,\u201d Clinton confessed. \u201cIn that bill, there were longer sentences. And most of these people are in prison under state law, but the federal law set a trend. \u2026 And that was overdone. We were wrong about that. \u2026 The good news is we had the biggest drop in crime in history. The bad news is we had a lot of people who were locked up, who were minor actors, for way too long.\u201d\n\nObama is now poised to fix undo Clinton\u2019s policy by pushing for prison reform, which both conservatives and liberals agree needs to be addressed. Clinton\u2019s approach was viewed as tough on crime, and crime did decline. Obama\u2019s approach is essentially to go the other direction \u2014 to focus on the community, the courtroom and the cell block by spending money on pre-kindergarten education, reducing or eliminating mandatory minimum sentencing and allowing convicted felons the right to vote. Perhaps Obama recognizes that Hillary needs all the help she can get.\n\nBut the legacy rewrite is more than just prison reform.\n\nClinton\u2019s legacy also includes enacting the \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy for the military, which allowed homosexuals to serve in the military as long as no one asked and no one told. Obama pledged to end this \u201cdiscrimination\u201d and urged Congress in December 2010 to repeal Clinton\u2019s policy over the objections of the Service Chiefs and the majority of military members.\n\nThen we have the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which Bill Clinton signed into law after receiving \u201coverwhelming congressional support.\u201d In 2011, Obama and then-Attorney General Eric Holder deemed DOMA to be unconstitutional and stated that the administration would no longer enforce the law. But it didn\u2019t stop there. Under pressure from Obama and Holder, numerous lower courts overturned state marriage amendments. Ultimately, we saw the results of Obama\u2019s political goals to fundamentally transform America when five black-robed despots of the Supreme Court forced same-sex marriage on the entire country.\n\nUnder Clinton, the federal budget was balanced, though the credit really belongs to the Republican Congress. Obama did the opposite of balancing the budget, spending more money in six years than all of the presidents before him combined. Deficits and the debt skyrocketed to record highs. It\u2019s quite apparent that Obama thinks the position of commander in chief means spender in chief \u2014 unless it\u2019s spending money for defense.\n\nClinton (and his wife) even tried and failed to engineer a federal takeover of the health care system. With ObamaCare, Obama achieved what Clinton could not.\n\nClinton is also known for welfare reform during his tenure. In 2012, Clinton said of his reform (read: the reform passed by a Republican Congress), \u201cThis is personal to me. We moved millions of people off welfare. It was one of the reasons that, in the eight years I was president, we had a hundred times as many people move out of poverty into the middle class than happened under the previous 12 years. A hundred times as many. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Obama greatly expanded welfare, keeping more people mired in poverty and dependent upon the government. In fact, there are currently more than 45 million Americans who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, a.k.a. food stamps. There are more people receiving help from the federal government than there are in the entire population of Canada. Thanks Obama.\n\nPerhaps the only place Obama has really followed Clinton\u2019s legacy is on foreign policy \u2014 and that\u2019s not a good thing. As Ken Blackwell notes, \u201cOn October 21, 1994, President Bill Clinton announced a deal with North Korea aimed at ending its pursuit of a nuclear weapon.\u201d Clinton claimed it was a good deal because North Korea would freeze and dismantle its nuclear program, which would better protect our allies. In addition the North Koreans would be monitored by the United States and international inspectors to ensure they were keeping to their commitment. We know the results of this deal \u2014 on Oct. 9, 2006, North Korea conducted its first successful test of a nuclear weapon.\n\nObama has now negotiated accepted a similarly terrible nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama claims his deal will prohibit Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapon and claims that inspectors will have access to Iran\u2019s supply chain of nuclear material, as well as conversion and storage facilities. We hope Congress rejects it. But even more so, we hope Iran doesn\u2019t achieve what North Korea did thanks to a Democrat president.\n\nIn light of all this, we\u2019re left with a simple question: If the last seven years has been about undoing the Clinton legacy of the \u201890s, why should the nation election Hillary?", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's clear just how far left Democrats have gone in 20 years.", "csrf-token": "WoFMpXrqjeCybMz0PmDVPuDVkPkcNHOYBLcm2G+kPc0=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "It\u2019s clear just how far left Democrats have gone in 20 years.", "title": "Obama's Legacy Will Be Undoing Clinton's", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/36582", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2015-07-24-0ac62d68.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Government & Politics Obama's Legacy Will Be Undoing Clinton'sWhen comparing the presidency of Bill Clinton with that of Barack Obama, it\u2019s clear just how far left Democrats have gone in 20 years.\nIn light of all this, we\u2019re left with a simple question: If the last seven years has been about undoing the Clinton legacy of the \u201890s, why should the nation election Hillary?\nNot only that, but it seems Obama\u2019s primary legacy will be to undo that of his Democrat predecessor.\nPerhaps the only place Obama has really followed Clinton\u2019s legacy is on foreign policy \u2014 and that\u2019s not a good thing.\nBut the legacy rewrite is more than just prison reform."}
