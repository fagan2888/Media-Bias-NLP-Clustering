Ironically, despite being the most powerful man in one of the world\u2019s greatest cities, Emanuel\u2019s profile right now outside Illinois is probably the lowest it\u2019s been since his brief and extremely lucrative late-90s hiatus. As a professional consumer of political media, I\u2019ve enjoyed the break from Emanuel\u2019s signature brashness and machismo. But as a lefty who believes the Democratic Party can be made better (which is not the same as good) Emanuel\u2019s upcoming, near-certain, and little-noticed reelection makes me nervous about the party\u2019s near-term future.\n\nIn defense of the national media\u2019s scant attention, I should note that this year\u2019s mayoral election has been extremely uncompetitive, which best explains why its mostly flown under the radar. Judging by the latest polling, there\u2019s no doubt that the mayor will receive more votes than any other single candidate on Election Day. Instead, the question is whether he\u2019ll win the 50 percent-plus-one-vote he needs to avoid an April runoff against whoever finishes second. On that score, and with less than a week before Chicagoans head to the polls, Emanuel\u2019s coming up short. But according to the Chicago Tribune, nearly 20 percent of voters still haven\u2019t decided how to cast their vote yet \u2014 and Emanuel\u2019s team has an insane amount of money to spend on advertising for the final push.\n\nStill, all the money in the world can\u2019t make people vote, and campaigning to avoid a future runoff \u2014 which Emanuel would almost certainly win, too \u2014 isn\u2019t quite the stuff of political dreams. That\u2019s probably the best explanation for this recent piece on Emanuel in the New York Times, which focuses on efforts to woo African-American voters that the paper implies are desperate and belated. \u201c[A]n essential worry for his campaign is how well he will do with black residents,\u201d the Times reports, before noting that \u201calienated black voters\u201d could tether Emanuel below that 50-plus-one threshold. And as the Times shows, if African-Americans decline to do Emanuel any favors, they won\u2019t lack for reasons.\n\nTo be clear, there\u2019s no reason whatsoever to think Emanuel \u2014 who left the inside track for being the first Jewish speaker of the House in order to serve as chief of staff for the first African-American president \u2014 harbors negative feelings towards African-Americans. As is increasingly the case in the U.S., the problem is fundamentally more about class than race. But you can hardly blame black people in Chicago if they decide the mayor\u2019s personal views don\u2019t compensate for his neoliberal policies, which have often been terrible for those Chicagoans who aren\u2019t members of Emanuel\u2019s affluent political base. If you look at his record thus far, in fact, it\u2019s hard not to think that Emanuel has almost been trying to vindicate the leftwing critics of his neoliberal, Clintonian approach.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The neoliberal firebrand will be reelected, but here's why his struggles reveal a changing Democratic base", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The neoliberal firebrand will be reelected, but here's why his struggles reveal a changing Democratic base", "title": "Rahm Emanuel\u2019s hollow victory: Why Chicago\u2019s mayoral campaign has national implications", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/18/rahm_emanuels_hollow_victory_why_chicagos_mayoral_campaign_has_national_implications/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/rahm_rect_revised.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The neoliberal firebrand will be reelected, but here's why his struggles reveal a changing Democratic base", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/10/rahm_rect_revised.jpg", "title": "Rahm Emanuel\u2019s hollow victory: Why Chicago\u2019s mayoral campaign has national implications", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Rahm Emanuel\u2019s hollow victory: Why Chicago\u2019s mayoral campaign has national implications", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Clinton, Chicago, Chicago Teachers Union, Education, Education Reform, Hillary Clinton, Karen Lewis, Michael Bloomberg, neoliberalism, Rahm Emanuel, Richard Daley", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As a professional consumer of political media, I\u2019ve enjoyed the break from Emanuel\u2019s signature brashness and machismo.\n\u201c[A]n essential worry for his campaign is how well he will do with black residents,\u201d the Times reports, before noting that \u201calienated black voters\u201d could tether Emanuel below that 50-plus-one threshold.\nOn that score, and with less than a week before Chicagoans head to the polls, Emanuel\u2019s coming up short.\nAnd as the Times shows, if African-Americans decline to do Emanuel any favors, they won\u2019t lack for reasons.\nInstead, the question is whether he\u2019ll win the 50 percent-plus-one-vote he needs to avoid an April runoff against whoever finishes second."}
