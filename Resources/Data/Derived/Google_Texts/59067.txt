>>> WE'RE BACK. ARE THE STOCK MARKETS RIGGED FOR THE BENEFIT OF INSIDERS? MY NEXT GUEST MICHAEL LEWIS HAS STIRRED THINGS UP THIS WEEK. A LOT OF CONTROVERSY OVER REVELATIONS HE'S MADE ABOUT WHAT'S CALLED HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING IN HIS LATEST BOOK "FLASH BOYS; A WALL STREET REVOLT." MICHAEL LEWIS, WELCOME BACK. >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. >> YOU ARE SO COOL, WITH A TIE, YOU ALWAYS COME 0 PLAY. >> I CAN BARELY GET OUT OF BED ON SUNDAY MORNING. >> YOUR GAME FACE ALONE WINS THE AWARDS. ISN'T THAT THE COMMERCIAL? THIS BOOK HAS MADE A LOT OF HEADLINES. I WANT TO CUT TO ASPECT OF THE CONTROVERSY OF IT, WHO DOES IT AFFECT. JIM CRAMER ON CNBC SAID IF YOU'RE THE AVERAGE INVESTOR, YOU'RE NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS OF STOCK PRICES. YOU'RE HOLDING SOMETHING FOR A LONG TIME. WHO'S MOST AFFECTED BY THIS? >> STOVE TWO ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION. ANYBODY WHO IS NOT A HIGH FREQUENCY TRADER IS COMPETING ON AN UNLEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN THE EXCHANGES WITH THE HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS. THEY HAVE INFORMATION -- ADVANCED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO BEFORE YOU DO IT. WHO, BUT THE PRICE EVERY TIME IS PENNIES. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TRIVIAL SUMS OF MONEY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR IF YOU LOOK AT IT THAT WAY. IF YOU ADD UP THE SKIM OR SCALP, IT'S BILLIONS A YEAR. THAT'S A TAX ON INVESTMENT CAPITAL. THAT'S NOT I DON'T THINK THE BIG PROBLEM. THE BIG PROBLEM IS IN ORDER TO SORT OF MAXIMIZE THE COLLISIONS BETWEEN HIGH FREQUENCY TRADERS AND REGULAR INVESTORS TO THE DETRIMENT OF REGULAR INVESTORS, THE EXCHANGES HAVE BEEN COMPROMISED AND MADE WAY, TOO. COMPLICATED. THEY'RE UNSTABLE. WE HAVE FLASH CRASHES. WE HAVE OUTAGES AND IPOs THAT DON'T WORK. THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THE INTEGRITY OF THE STOCK MARKET AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF WALL STREET TO THE REST OF SOCIETY. SO I THINK IT'S NOT A -- IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR TRADING ON E TRADE, YOU'RE PAYING TRIVIAL SUMS OF MONEY. IT'S COSTING YOU PROBABLY TRIVIAL SUMS OF MONEY. THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS WHAT IT'S DONE TO THE HEART OF CAPITALISM. >> I SAW THE QUESTION WHERE ARE THE REGULATORS. WE GET INTO A SYSTEM THAT GETS MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED EVEN THE PRACTITIONERS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY WERE CREATING AND HOW TO MANAGE IT. MAYBE HERE IT'S PURE MANIPULATION. YOU WRITE SOMETHING WHERE YOU SAY WALL STREET FIRMS NOT JUST THE BIG BANKS BUT ALL OF THEM HAVE GROWN GREATLY MORE CONCERNED THAN THEY WERE IN THE LATE 80s WITH THE WHAT SOME JOURNALISTS MIGHT SAY ABOUT THEM. THEY HAVE A LOT MORE TO FEAR. >> THE REPORTING ENVIRONMENT HAS CHANGED. AND IT'S CHANGED IN THIS WAY. THE FIRMS ARE MUCH MORE CORPORATE. THEY'RE MUCH MORE RESISTANT TO ANY KIND OF INQUIRY. BUT HAVING SAID THAT, THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THESE FIRMS ARE MUCH LESS LOYAL TO THE FIRMS. EVERYBODY'S A FREE AGENT ON WALL STREET. IT'S MUCH EASIER IN SYSTEM WAYS TO GET STORIES BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL GO OUT FOR A BEER WITH YOU AND SPILL THE BEANS ABOUT THEIR FIRM BECAUSE THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FIRM. BUT THE FIRMS THEMSELVES ARE OPAQUE. I MEAN, THEY'RE HARD TO UNDERSTAND. AND THE FACT IS THAT I MEAN, SINCE THE 1980s, THE FINANCIAL SECTOR HAS GOTTEN SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. THIS COMPLEXITY IS A FORM OF OPACITY. AT SOME POINT THE COMPLEXITY LIKE WITH THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS, AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS WAS THE PROBLEM THAT NOBODY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS IN A SUBPRIME CDO. AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS STORY THAT I JUST DESCRIBED, NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THE STOCK MARKET. IT'S CRAZY. THE STOCK MARKET HAS BECOME LIKE A SECRET. HOW IT WORKS. >> AND THAT'S A QUESTION. >> THEY MAY WORRY LESS ABOUT THEIR FIRM, BUT THEY'RE WORRIED AS MUCH OR MORE THAN EVER ABOUT THEIR OWN REPUTATION BECAUSE THE REGULATORY JUTENY AND POLITICAL RISK TO THEM IS THAT MUCH HIGHER. JAMIE DIMON OR BLANKFEIN, THEY'RE QUASI POLITICAL FIGURES, YEAH, THEY'RE CORPORATE FIGURES BUT FEELING A POLITICAL RESPONSIBILITY OR ACCOUNTABILITY OR EXPOSURE THAT THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. >> THERE'S A BIGGER PROBLEM HERE. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I GUESS I'M GETTING OLD, YOU INVEST IN A COMPANY WITH THE IDEA SOME DAY THAT WILL COMPANY WOULD BE MORE VALUABLE. 10, 20 YEARS AGO. >> THINGS GOT SHORT AND PEOPLE WERE FOCUSED ON THE CORNER. NOW WE'RE FOCUSED ON MILLISECONDS. WE NEED TO GET BACK MORE TO A BIT TO LAST, INVEST IN THE FUTURE, NOT JUST MAYBE THERE'S POLICY CHANGES NECESSARY TO INCENT FOR LONG-TERM BUY AND HOLD KIND OF INVESTMENT WHICH IS WHAT'S CRITICAL TO BUILD OUR ECONOMY IS TO BACK THESE COMPANIES, PARTICULARLY BACK THE STARTUPS WITH LONG-TERM MONEY, NOT THE SHORT-TERM HOT MONEY. >> IT'S A QUESTION, TOO. TO WHAT EXTENT WALL STREET HAS CHANGED AS WELL AS WASHINGTON'S ABILITY TO PREVENT THE NEXT BIG THING FROM HAPPENING. >> I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WOULD HAVE FOR MICHAEL AS YOU TALK ABOUT THE CONFIDENCE IN THE MARKET AND EXCHANGES, WHAT'S THE ANSWER? IS IT MORE REGULATION OR DIFFERENT KIND I HAVE REGULATION OR NEW EXCHANGES? WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND. >> THE MAIN CHARACTER OF THIS STORY IS INTERESTING. THEY'RE ALL STARTERS WALL STREET INSIDERS AND PIECED TOGETHER HOW THE MARKET IS WORKING FROM THE INSIDE. THEY COME TO THE CONCLUSION, ONCE THEY DISCOVER WHAT THEY DISCOVER, THEY GO TO THE FCC. IT'S PARALYZED. IT'S NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT SMART. THEY CAN'T SEE THE FCC EVER TAKING ACTION IN ADVANCE OF A CRISIS. BUT THEY SEE THAT LIKE THE PROBLEM IS, WELL MEANING REGULATION BEING GAMED BY REALLY SMART PEOPLE IN THE MARKET. YOU CREATE THE NEW REGULATION. SOME COMES ALONG AND GAMES IT. I THINK WHAT THEY'VE DONE, THEY'RE MARKET BASED SOLUTIONS. THE SOLUTION IS DISRUPTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. THE WAY YOU ENABLE THAT IS TRANSPARENCY. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT INVESTOR, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BIGGEST HEDGE FUNDS AND PUJ FUNDS ALL INVESTORS HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW THEIR STOCK MARKET ORDERS ARE HANDLES. THE REASON THEY CAN BE FLEECED, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. IF YOU CAN INTRODUCE TRANSPARENCY IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, THEN YOU INTRODUCE AN INCENTIVE IN THE MARKET FOR PEOPLE TO CREATE A FAIR EXCHANGE AND GO TO A FAIR EXCHANGE. >> DRIVING THAT TRANSPARENT IS IMPORTANT. THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO RATCHET EVERYONE BACK AND TAKE AWAY IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGY. BUT THE FACT IS THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS DRIVEN SPREADS DOWN, AS MADE TRADING FASTER, HAS GIVEN ASSURANCES AND SOME TRANSPARENT SIT TO THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR AND THAT'S BEEN ENORMOUSLY BENEFICIAL. >> YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THAT AWAY. YOU HAVE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE COMPUTER AND COMPUTER SACRAL PING. THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN FABULOUS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR. >> MICHAEL, I CAN'T WAIT TO READ YOUR BOOK. I FEEL LIKE THE FELLOW WHO WAS IN A HAZE OVER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. >> STILL WELCOME. >> BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH. WHAT I'M FEELING THOUGH IS THAT THIS FEELS LIKE THE NEXT GENERATION OF MATCHES OF THE UNIVERSE. IT'S ALL HUBRIS AND THIS HOT DOG ATTITUDE SOME PEOPLE HAVE ON WALL STREET. >> I'M GOING TO LET THAT COMMENT
