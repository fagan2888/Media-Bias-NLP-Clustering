Livestrong VP reflects on 'hard year'\n\nOne year ago, the world saw Lance Armstrong\u2019s sit-down with Oprah Winfrey, in which the cyclist confessed to having used performance-enhancing drugs to help his wildly successful cycling career.The interview came on the heels of increased pressure from investigations into his past performances, sponsorship withdrawals and even a parting of ways with the cancer foundation, Livestrong, that Armstrong himself founded.\n\nMorgan Binswanger is Livestrong\u2019s executive vice president of Government Relations and External Affairs and reflected on the past year in an interview with POLITICO.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a hard year, there\u2019s no question,\u201d Binswanger said. \u201cI think the year has been as hard as it could have been.\u201d Binswanger said, in the middle of December, that fundraising for 2013 was down \u201cabout 30 to 35 percent,\u201d which was actually \u201cbetter than we had forecasted for this year.\u201d\n\nThe group lost some of its major sponsors, such as Nike, and Binswanger said the organization has had to spend much of the past year not talking about its core mission of helping cancer patients because \u201cwe\u2019ve been on the crisis management circuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to keep it in perspective and, as much as we understand that people are going to be asking about, \u2018OK, what\u2019s next?\u2019 or \u2018What was the last year like?\u2019 our job is to focus on our mission and our constituency and that\u2019s what I think we really missed this year. That\u2019s what we emotionally missed. That\u2019s been hard. That part has been hard.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, Binswanger says, the last year has been instructive, at the very least, and even \u201cliberating\u201d in some respects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s allowed us to both refocus on the core execution of what we do. \u2026 It\u2019s made us truly focused on listening to the cancer community and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve always been very good at but it sharpened the blade a little bit, so to speak, and that\u2019s been really valuable. \u2026 I think this has also been somewhat of an, oddly reinvigorating year for the organization to shake up things we\u2019ve been doing the same way for a while.\u201d\n\nBinswanger says the past year made the organization realize that not everybody \u201cknows what we do and why we do what we do.\u201d In the wake of Armstrong\u2019s confession, numerous articles ran exploring whether Livestrong served not simply as an advocacy organization for cancer victims but also as a convenient celebrity platform and financial aid for Armstrong.\n\n\u201cThe liberating factor has been being able to talk about not only what we do but why we do it,\u201d Binswanger said.\n\nBinswanger said the group\u2019s Washington efforts, which have always been significant (the Chronicle of Philanthropy noted in 2013 that \u201cSince 2001, Livestrong has spent $3.56-million on federal and state lobbying\u201d), haven\u2019t been affected by Armstrong\u2019s fall from grace.\n\n\u201cI think if we were a brand new organization that somebody of Lance\u2019s stature had started, I think that would be a really hard thing,\u201d said Binswanger, adding that \u201cD.C. is certainly a place where we\u2019re going to continue to be working. \u2026 We do a lot of work with [Affordable Care Act] implementation, we\u2019re spending a lot of time on that.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cwhat we know, as 15 years old, is that we have an enormous amounts of relationships and data to provide to policymakers in presenting the voice of cancer patients. \u2026 Our tenure allows us, certainly within the policy world to make a pretty clear and concise case that has very little to do with the celebrity factor that you\u2019re referring to.\u201d\n\nAlthough clearly wounded by Armstrong\u2019s tarnished reputation, Binswanger isn\u2019t overly eager to throw the cyclist under the bus.\n\n\u201cI want to echo that Lance has always been very, very committed to the cancer fight and over the course of 15 years, there are very few people who have remained committed to an issue and those who have been really effective and I think Lance has been one of those, to impact change over a long period of time instead of just going to one chicken dinner.\u201d\n\nHe later added: \u201cOne of the things that got lost in the course of the Lance stuff is that Lance started the foundation before he was very famous. He came out of his treatment and wanted to do something and he started this foundation before anyone knew who he was, before the Tours, before all this stuff. And I think that speaks to the power of individuals doing great things, whatever that is, and trying to do something, in this case serving people who are in great need. People can make a difference.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The group has lost some of its major sponsors and spent much of the past year in crisis management.", "title": "Livestrong VP reflects on 'hard year'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/livestrong-vice-president-interview-102306.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/17/140116_livestrong_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Lance Armstrong,Livestream", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The group has lost some of its major sponsors and spent much of the past year in crisis management.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s been hard.\nStory Continued Below\u201cIt\u2019s definitely been a hard year, there\u2019s no question,\u201d Binswanger said.\n\u201cI think if we were a brand new organization that somebody of Lance\u2019s stature had started, I think that would be a really hard thing,\u201d said Binswanger, adding that \u201cD.C.\nMorgan Binswanger is Livestrong\u2019s executive vice president of Government Relations and External Affairs and reflected on the past year in an interview with POLITICO.\n\u201cThe liberating factor has been being able to talk about not only what we do but why we do it,\u201d Binswanger said."}
