Twice a week, they come to this classroom to work on their creations, born from a problem they want to solve.\n\nCaitlin Trutnau created a desk with reenforced rubber flaps that fold down and form a safe enclosure to protect kids from an intruder in the classroom.\n\n\u201cWe noticed that desks weren\u2019t very safe as is, and we thought of a way that it can be safer,\u201d she said.\n\nJulie Fredericksen invented a high-top sneaker that can be turned into a high heel with a simple screw-on piece.\n\n\u201cWhenever I buy a high top, I always want a high heel, and so it gets my closet really messy and stuff,\" said Fredericksen. \"So now, with the combination of both of them, it takes up less space.\u201d\n\nStudents compete with other students in town, as part of an Invention Convention, with winners taking their inventions to a state competition.\n\nBut for their teacher, it\u2019s less about the final product, and more about critical thinking, problem solving, and dealing with failure when the inventions don\u2019t quite work out the first time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t teach our children to fail successfully, and I think it\u2019s not just my children, it\u2019s all children. We don\u2019t teach them how to pick themselves up, brush themselves off, and start all over again,\u201d said Ripa.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Young inventors take place in an enrichment program for gifted fourth- and fifth-graders at Pond Hill Elementary School in Wallingford.", "title": "Wallingford Students Invent Clever Creations", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Connecticut", "description": "Young inventors take place in an enrichment program for gifted fourth- and fifth-graders at Pond Hill Elementary School in Wallingford.", "title": "Wallingford Students Invent Clever Creations", "url": "http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/making-the-grade-education-pond-hill-elementary-wallingford-253658851.html", "image": "http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1200*675/wallingford+mtg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Young inventors take place in an enrichment program for gifted fourth- and fifth-graders at Pond Hill Elementary School in Wallingford.", "creator": "@nbcconnecticut", "url": "http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/making-the-grade-education-pond-hill-elementary-wallingford-253658851.html", "image": "http://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1200*675/wallingford+mtg.jpg?ak=bc", "title": "Wallingford Students Invent Clever Creations", "site": "@nbcconnecticut", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 81242742459}, "keywords": "education,wallingford,pond hill,making the grade", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCConnecticut", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/365381400176912"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "education,wallingford,pond hill,making the grade"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6e17\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe don\u2019t teach our children to fail successfully, and I think it\u2019s not just my children, it\u2019s all children.\nWe don\u2019t teach them how to pick themselves up, brush themselves off, and start all over again,\u201d said Ripa.\n\"They have that spark, that curiosity, that asking the questions, that thinking outside the box,\u201d Ripa said of her students.\nTwice a week, they come to this classroom to work on their creations, born from a problem they want to solve.\nTake a good look inside teacher Karen Ripa\u2019s class at Pond Hill Elementary School in Wallingford and you just might find the next Thomas Edison."}
