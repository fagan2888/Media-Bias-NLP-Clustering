And last night, Stewart keep up the \"Strife Of Pie\" charade, explaining that even a dog wasn't interested in Chicago's pies. And that dog has happily eaten a lot of garbage in his lifetime.\n\nTo truly explain why New York pizza is superior to Chicago pizza, Stewart enlisted Matthew Broderick, Steve Buscemi and Michael Strahan to defend the Big Apple's honor. New York pizza is magic, you see. It's apparently capable of making a man in a wheelchair finally be able to walk, to help Michael Strahan fly when he can't catch a cab and it can even make the Obamacare website work. Now, that really is magic.\n\nWhile Stewart may not want to actually anger Chicagoans, he isn't about to let this one go. He invited Marc Malnati of Lou Malnati's pizza on set, along with a deep-dish pie (Malnati recently made his opinions known about New York's \"limp\" pizza). After making some cracks about the weight of the pie, Stewart relents. \"It's very tasty,\" he admits. There you have it folks, The Great Pizza Truce Of 2013.\n\nMore: Jon Stewart", "article_metadata": {"description": "A lot has happened since November 13, 2013, the fateful evening in which", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-11-22 09:39:57 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "A lot has happened since November 13, 2013, the fateful evening in which", "title": "WATCH: Jon Stewart Defends His 'Deep Diss,' But Admits Chicago Pizza Is 'Tasty'", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/21/jon-stewart-deep-dish_n_4316261.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1475022/images/o-PIZZA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostChicago", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1475022/images/o-PIZZA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "A lot has happened since November 13, 2013, the fateful evening in which", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "WATCH: Jon Stewart Defends His 'Deep Diss,' But Admits Chicago Pizza Is 'Tasty'"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-21 09:39:57 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4316261", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "chicago", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "video,daily show pizza,Jon Stewart,jon stewart pizza rant,jon stewart pizza,jon stewart pizza apology,marc malnati,jon stewart deep dish apology,daily show pizza rant,jon stewart deep dish", "article": {"section": "Chicago", "tag": "video,daily show pizza,Jon Stewart,jon stewart pizza rant,jon stewart pizza,jon stewart pizza apology,marc malnati,jon stewart deep dish apology,daily show pizza rant,jon stewart deep dish", "published_time": "2013-11-21 09:39:57 -0500", "modified_time": "2013-11-21 09:41:05 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "To truly explain why New York pizza is superior to Chicago pizza, Stewart enlisted Matthew Broderick, Steve Buscemi and Michael Strahan to defend the Big Apple's honor.\nMore: Jon Stewart\nHe invited Marc Malnati of Lou Malnati's pizza on set, along with a deep-dish pie (Malnati recently made his opinions known about New York's \"limp\" pizza).\nNew York pizza is magic, you see.\nAfter making some cracks about the weight of the pie, Stewart relents."}
