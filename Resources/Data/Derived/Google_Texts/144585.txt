The SpaceX company has successfully launched another fresh load of supplies to the International Space Station. But its revolutionary attempt to land the leftover booster on an ocean barge did not fare as well.

SpaceX's billionaire founder Elon Musk says the first-stage of the unmanned Falcon rocket made it to the platform floating a couple hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast. But he says the booster came down too hard and broke apart.

It's the first time anyone tried anything like this.

According to Musk: "Close, but no cigar this time." But he says it bodes well for the future.

A SpaceX rocket has blasted off with supplies for the International Space Station. And the company is on course to attempt an unprecedented landing on an ocean barge with the leftover booster.

The unmanned Falcon rocket soared into a clear pre-dawn sky at Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Saturday.

The primary mission for SpaceX is delivering more than 5,000 pounds of food, experiments and other items ordered up by NASA. But the California-based company led by billionaire Elon Musk will attempt an even more extraordinary feat once the Dragon launches: flying the booster rocket to a platform floating a couple hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast. A vertical touchdown is the goal.

It's the second try this week by SpaceX to launch its Dragon cargo ship. Rocket trouble halted Tuesday's countdown.
