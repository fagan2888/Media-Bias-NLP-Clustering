Those who trust the administration are more optimistic about the potential for transparency, but the majority are skeptical or indifferent.\n\nWhile 65 percent of Americans have used the internet in the past year to access information relating to the government, only five percent said that federal and state administrations were \u201cvery effective\u201d at sharing information, a Pew Research poll has shown.\n\nState governments are slightly more \u201csomewhat effective\u201d than federal authorities, at 44 percent to 39. Local administrations earned the best grade. However, only seven percent viewed them as \u201cvery effective\u201d and 45 percent as \u201csomewhat\u201d effective.\n\nJust 5% of Americans say federal gov't is effective in sharing data with public; 39% say \"somewhat\" effective http://t.co/fz4Z7p0DuQ \u2014 Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) April 21, 2015\n\nThe poll results indicate that \u201cgovernment data initiatives are in their early stages in the minds of most Americans,\u201d Pew researchers John Horrigan and Lee Rainie wrote. Most people have used the internet to look up federal, state and local information, pay fines and renew licenses, or find out opening and closing hours for parks.\n\nThere is good news for advocates of government transparency who hope it will lead to more accountability: 53 percent of the respondents share this belief, while 56 percent say it will give journalists better access to monitor government activities. The public is evenly split on the potential for better customer service, at 49 percent either way.\n\nThose who trust the government have more faith in the benefits of data-sharing and transparency. However, the researchers note that very few respondents actually have faith in the government. Only 23 percent said they had confidence in the federal government \"most of the time\", another 56 percent trust only \"some of the time\", while 19 percent said they \"never\" have faith in the government.\n\nWhile this is a slightly higher level of belief than the 17 percent during the 2008 financial crisis, Pew researchers point out that confidence levels were above 50 percent before the Watergate scandal and President Nixon\u2019s resignation in 1974.\n\nThe poll\u2019s sample included 48 percent who identified themselves as Democrats and 41 percent who are Republican followers. Democrats are twice as likely to trust the government, the survey found.\n\nPew researchers divided the respondents into four major groups, depending on their use of government data and confidence levels. The \u201cArdent Optimists\u201d were the 17 percent of adults who use online resources to connect with the government, rely on its data, and think transparency will help make the authorities more accountable and allow them to perform better. Another 20 percent were dubbed \u201cCommitted Cynics,\u201d who use online government resources, but are skeptical of the potential for improvement in performance and generally distrust the authorities.\n\nREAD MORE: 6 ways US govt is breaking own censorship record\n\n\u201cBuoyant Bystanders\u201d were the 27 percent who trust the government and like the idea that data could improve performance, but don\u2019t actually use the online tools to connect with the government. The largest group, at 36 percent, was labeled the \u201cDormant Doubters.\u201d They have low levels of trust in the authorities, don\u2019t use the internet to interact with the government, and don\u2019t think data initiatives will do much to improve performance or accountability.\n\nThe poll was conducted from November 17 until December 15 last year, in English and Spanish. The sample was taken from 3,212 US adults, who were contacted by mail and via the internet, with the margin for error being two percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only five percent of Americans believe the government is doing a good job of sharing data, a new poll reveals.
