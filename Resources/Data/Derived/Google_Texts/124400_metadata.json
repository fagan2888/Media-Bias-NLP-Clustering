And there have been troubles for some of the state-created exchanges.\n\nSarah Kliff is following all this for The Washington Post.\n\nAnd it\u2019s good to you have back with us.\n\nSARAH KLIFF, The Washington Post: Thank you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, Sarah, let\u2019s stipulate that things, as we said, do seem to be generally going better for the sign-up process. That\u2019s your understanding?\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But let\u2019s talk about, for example, people who are eligible for Medicaid, going on the federal Web site and some of them are having problems. Tell us about that.\n\nSARAH KLIFF: The problem that they\u2019re having is their information isn\u2019t getting transmitted to the state. So they go on to HealthCare.gov, they find out they are eligible for Medicaid, they think they enrolled, but that information never makes its way to the state Medicaid office.\n\nAnd this is due to some technology they had hoped would be ready not being ready in time. So what\u2019s happening instead is these state Medicaid offices making phone calls and telling people actually the fastest way to go get signed up is go to your state Medicaid office, that healthcare.gov isn\u2019t actually the best path to getting signed up right now.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, that what they are doing to try to rectify this?\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Right. They are really trying to reach these people.\n\nAnd we should mention it is a smaller subset of the Medicaid-eligible. We know that about 3.9 million have been found eligible for Medicaid. And we think this universe of people is about 100,000 people. So it\u2019s a subset, but they\u2019re trying to reach these people by phone calls and by letters to tell them go to your state office.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me. Are they having success doing that?\n\nSARAH KLIFF: We\u2019re still seeing that right now. They\u2019re still right in the middle of that outreach.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So let me ask you about the state exchanges. Some of the states have apparently had a smooth process, but then there are some states, Maryland, Oregon, among others, where there have been real problems. What are you learning about that?\n\nSARAH KLIFF: We\u2019re seeing that some states that really wanted the Affordable Care Act to work, especially Maryland and Oregon, are two that you mentioned that have really had the most severe problems, who volunteered to build these exchanges, and just really couldn\u2019t get them off the ground.\n\nSo you\u2019re seeing a lot of work-arounds in those states. Oregon has really relied on paper applications. They have processed about 20,000 enrollments into private insurance largely on pen and paper. Maryland is looking at some emergency legislation to let people who tried to sign up, but ran into technical issues, still get those policies in January.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So it\u2019s \u2014 essentially, it\u2019s a different story in every state?\n\nSARAH KLIFF: It is, yes. You have seen one state, and it\u2019s nothing like other states. Washington next to Oregon, for example, is having a great experience and signing lots of people up.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Sarah, the other thing you were telling us is, is that now some people are signed up and are starting to actually take advantage of this coverage, you\u2019re turning your attention to what their experience is. Tell us about that.\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Right.\n\nSo now that you have got about an estimated six million people signed up, the thing we want to know is, is that going well for them? Are they liking the coverage and the doctors and the co-pays that they\u2019re experiencing for the first time?\n\nSo, for the past three months, this has been a story about enrollment and technical glitches and getting signed up. Going forward, there will still be some of that, but it will also be a story about health care and doctors, and are people liking the products that they\u2019re buying through HealthCare.gov?\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And that is what you are just now able to start looking at?\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Right. We are just getting a trickle of anecdotes right now. It will be a little while, about a year, until we learn the larger impact. We\u2019re starting to hear some stories of how it is going.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, everybody is impatient about how it is going.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: The last thing I want to ask you about, though, is what the Republicans are doing. And, of course, they have been trying repeatedly to overturn the law completely, but they\u2019re also trying other methods.\n\nOne of their \u2014 the things they have rolled out this week is an effort to look at how secure the federal website is. Tell \u2014 explain what they\u2019re trying to do.\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Right.\n\nThey\u2019re definitely trying to put a spotlight on HealthCare.gov, and in light of all the technical issues that have raised concerns about the security of the site, since you do have people entering information like their address and their Social Security number.\n\nOne thing they will be voting on is an effort for more reporting about breaches to the Web site with the \u2014 which the Obama administration said today they oppose this legislation, they think there is more than enough reporting. The White House does say they believe the site is secure, that there have been no breaches to speak of so far, and that they think it stands up to the security tests that they have put it through.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Is there any sense of how successful the Republicans are going to be? I mean, we know numbers are different in the House than in the Senate, but what is your sense of that?\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Right.\n\nIt probably has better odds in the House than in the Senate, like most of the attacks on the Affordable Care Act. They tend to pass the \u2014 pass through the House, but in the Senate run into difficulties. And the \u2014 interestingly, the White House has said they oppose this legislation, but they didn\u2019t issue a veto threat, which would be the more aggressive step to take.\n\nSo, that was one interesting nuance in how the White House is reacting to this.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I know will you keep watching it, and we will too.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Sarah Kliff, thank you.\n\nSARAH KLIFF: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The process of enrolling in health care coverage appears to be going smoother, but problems persist for some state-run exchanges and consumers.
