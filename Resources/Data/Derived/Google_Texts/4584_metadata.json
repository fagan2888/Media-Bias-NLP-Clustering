Within two hours, as the family of four including eight-year-old Lucas and his younger sister Emilea returned from the nearby Natural History Museum, they found their windows had been smashed.\n\nThere must have been a burglary, they thought; in fact, as they found later, their vehicle had been at the centre of a major security alert involving the bomb squad. Counter-terrorism police had evacuated the museum and closed roads before breaking into the van, suspecting it contained a bomb. Instead, they found dolls and stationery scattered around inside.\n\nCristian Ivan, the Romanian father, had no idea the big \u201cIran is Great\u201d sign emblazoned on both sides of his van could cause such a commotion.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nCristian, his French wife, Audrey, and German-born children had arrived a week earlier to participate in a festival in Wales, their first visit to the UK. In the five years since they started to live and travel in their van around the world, visiting museums has become an essential part of the home schooling of their kids. It was during a trip to Iran that they fell in love with the country and later decided to start their own campaign encouraging others to visit.\n\n\u201cVisiting museums is like school for our children,\u201d Cristian said. \u201cWe parked the car in front of the Science Museum; when we came out we were confused \u2013 why would the police do something like that? We were told it was because of the message written on the van.\u201d\n\nCristian particularly felt agitated that the police had not left any note behind, explaining what had happened. \u201cI went to the police station and they accused me of provoking the whole thing, they wanted me to feel responsible for expressing my views about this country, Iran.\u201d He has not received an apology.\n\nLater that day at the station, a policewoman told Cristian in an episode that has since been posted online: \u201cWe had to block the road, we had to call out the bomb squad, we had to call up supervisors to come down, we had to close everywhere off because your vehicle was parked in a higher security hotspot in London with that written on the sides. That\u2019s the justification, it doesn\u2019t say \u2018Spain is Great\u2019, \u2018Italy is Great\u2019, whatever.\u201d\n\nA Metropolitan police spokeswoman told the Guardian on Thursday: \u201cThere was a security alert in the Kensington area on Monday as a result of a suspicious vehicle.\u201d When pressed if the police has since apologised, the Met said it has not received an official request of such.\n\nCristian Ivan cleans up his van after a window is smashed outside the Science Museum\n\n\u201cDo I have to beg for an apology?\u201d Cristian complained. \u201cThey broke into my private property, they damaged my property, it\u2019s where we live. Our children are frightened, they don\u2019t feel secure, they were so scared they slept in our bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not blaming the police for what they did, I\u2019m blaming them for what they did not,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand they need to do their job but they could have left a note \u2018we damaged your car\u2019, \u2018sorry\u2019 or at least saying \u2018it was us, please call us\u2019.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe family behind the Iran is Great van: \u2018what happened to us was serendipity\u2019\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Counter-terrorism police were called this week to investigate a family van parked in central London, with \u2018Iran is Great\u2019 emblazoned on its sides.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Counter-terrorism police were called this week to investigate a family van parked in central London, with \u2018Iran is Great\u2019 emblazoned on its sides.", "title": "UK Counter-Terrorism Police Send In The Bomb-Squad Because Van Had 'Iran Is Great' Painted On It", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/uk-counter-terrorism-police-send-in-the-bomb-squad-because-van-had-iran-is-great-painted-on-it/208464/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1657.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-07T15:08:47-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Counter-terrorism police were called this week to investigate a family van parked in central London, with \u2018Iran is Great\u2019 emblazoned on its sides.", "title": "UK Counter-Terrorism Police Send In The Bomb-Squad Because Van Had 'Iran Is Great' Painted On It", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/iran_great.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "United Kingdom", "published_time": "2015-08-08T05:00:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-07T15:08:47-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "UK Counter-Terrorism Police Send In The Bomb-Squad Because Van Had \u2018Iran Is Great\u2019 Painted On ItCounter-terrorism police were called this week to investigate a family van parked in central London, with \u2018Iran is Great\u2019 emblazoned on its sides.\nAt 1pm on Monday, a family van parked outside the Science Museum in central London.\nCristian Ivan, the Romanian father, had no idea the big \u201cIran is Great\u201d sign emblazoned on both sides of his van could cause such a commotion.\nCounter-terrorism police had evacuated the museum and closed roads before breaking into the van, suspecting it contained a bomb.\n\u201cWe parked the car in front of the Science Museum; when we came out we were confused \u2013 why would the police do something like that?"}
