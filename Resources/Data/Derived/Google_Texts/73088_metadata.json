So far, though, nobody has taken to the front lines and deployed the kind of humor that we see on late night monologues and, of course, all over the Internet.\n\nThat changed last night, when Jimmy Kimmel sent Jake Byrd, one of his \u201ccorrespondents,\u201d to a Trump rally in Dallas. It starts off with Byrd interrupting interviews with Trump supporters, and I\u2019d give the comedy there a solid 7/10. But the best part, by far, comes inside the rally, when Byrd, with a giant cowboy hat complete with a \u201cDTF\u201d logo, finagles a seat directly behind Trump, in direct view of the cameras. His reactions there are priceless, and my favorite moment comes when Trump promises to abolish Obamacare, at which point Byrd jumps up in a fit of enthusiasm, yelling, \u201cno more medicine!\u201d\n\nWatch the full video above, and let\u2019s hope Byrd becomes a fixture at these rallies.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Kimmel Sends a Secret Agent to a Trump Rally, Hilarity Ensues - Paste Magazine", "og": {"url": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/09/kimmel-sends-a-secret-agent-to-a-trump-rally-hilar.html", "site_name": "pastemagazine.com", "image": {"width": 556, "identifier": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/TrumpRallyMain.png", "height": 314}, "type": "article", "title": "Kimmel Sends a Secret Agent to a Trump Rally, Hilarity Ensues"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/TrumpRallyMain.png", "site": "@pastemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kimmel Sends a Secret Agent to a Trump Rally, Hilarity Ensues"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "8f36922bc91ba221f10d82c407d8b6a9"}, "fb": {"admins": 1185614656, "app_id": 127550380613969, "pages": 18512903240}, "keywords": ", Kimmel Sends a Secret Agent to a Trump Rally, Hilarity Ensues, Comedy, Video, Articles, Paste", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "That changed last night, when Jimmy Kimmel sent Jake Byrd, one of his \u201ccorrespondents,\u201d to a Trump rally in Dallas.\nSince Donald Trump is more comedian than politician, it makes sense that his rallies would be ripe for comedy.\nIt starts off with Byrd interrupting interviews with Trump supporters, and I\u2019d give the comedy there a solid 7/10.\nBut the best part, by far, comes inside the rally, when Byrd, with a giant cowboy hat complete with a \u201cDTF\u201d logo, finagles a seat directly behind Trump, in direct view of the cameras.\nSo far, though, nobody has taken to the front lines and deployed the kind of humor that we see on late night monologues and, of course, all over the Internet."}
