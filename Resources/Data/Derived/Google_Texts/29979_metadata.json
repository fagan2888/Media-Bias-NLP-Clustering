The CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG), which owns many well-cherished eateries in New York, including Union Square Caf\u00e9 and Grammercy Tavern, delivered the opening keynote address at the recent M&A East conference, sponsored by ACG Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cService is delivering on your promise. Hospitality is making people feel good while you're delivering on that promise,\u201d Meyer told dealmakers. In keeping with the theme of his remarks, Meyer exuded a relaxed and congenial presentation style on stage at the Pennsylvania Convention Center.\n\n\u201cMake your company the favorite company to do business with, make your private equity firm the favorite,\u201d Meyer urged M&A East attendees, including PE investors, strategic buyers, investment bankers, M&A attorneys and accountants. The key to becoming a favorite with customers is to look out for your employees. \u201cPut your customers second and your own team first,\u201d Meyers advised dealmakers.\n\nAfter the keynote, Meyer spent some time in the exhibit hall, chatting in a friendly, unhurried fashion with attendees, practicing the law of hospitality he preached.\n\nThe day after Meyer addressed the M&A East audience, he announced a bold move designed to enhance team spirit at his restaurants. Over the course of the next year, the New York fine-dining establishments owned by USHG will stop accepting gratuities. It\u2019s an effort to pay workers more fairly and consistently.\n\n\u201cWe believe hospitality is a team sport, and that it takes an entire team to provide you with the experiences you have come to expect from us,\u201d Meyer said in a letter on USHG\u2019s website explaining the decision and pointing out that New York regulations deem which restaurant workers can share tips, and which can\u2019t. \u201cUnfortunately, many of our colleagues \u2014 our cooks, reservationists, and dishwashers to name a few \u2014 aren\u2019t able to share in our guests\u2019 generosity, even though their contributions are just as vital to the outcome of your experience at one of our restaurants.\u201d\n\nPrices at USHG restaurants will rise approximately 20 percent, in line with local tipping practices. \u201cThe total cost you pay to dine with us won\u2019t differ much from what you pay now. But for our teams, the change will be significant.\u201d The move to eliminate tips was triggered by the need to ensure that compensation for fine-dining workers remains competitive with compensation for fast-food workers. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in September approved an increase in the minimum hourly wage for fast-food workers from $8.75 to $15, to be phased in over the next three years. Meyer\u2019s new policy will be watched closely by the restaurant industry, and observers expect many fine-dining eateries to follow his lead.\n\nMeyer\u2019s culinary career began relatively modestly 30 years ago in October 1985, when he opened Union Square Caf\u00e9. Meyer funded the endeavor with about $980,000 in personal savings and family loans, he told the M&A East audience. Inspired by restaurants he had enjoyed while traveling in Europe, Union Square Cafe is credited with bringing the farm-to-table movement to New York City and with helping to revitalize the Union Square neighborhood. (Ironically, due to rent increases, Union Square Caf\u00e9 will soon move a few blocks away, to the space currently occupied by City Crab & Seafood Company, where Meyer has secured a 15-year lease and has planned a major renovation.)\n\nInitially, Meyer expanded at a snail\u2019s pace. Wary of repeating mistakes made by his father, a hotel owner who declared bankruptcy after expanding too quickly, Meyer waited nine years before opening his second restaurant, Grammercy Tavern, with chef Tom Colicchio in 1994. (Colicchio departed amicably in 2006 to focus on his own restaurants, and Grammercy Tavern\u2019s executive chef is now Michael Anthony).\n\nToday, USHG owns more than a dozen upscale dining establishments in New York, including the jazzy Blue Smoke, Eleven Madison Park, The Modern (at the Modern Museum of Art) and Untitled (at the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s new home in the meatpacking district). The company also runs an organizational consulting business, and USHG has begun backing restaurants outside New York, such as GreenRiver in Chicago.\n\nA proponent of \u201cmanagement by walking around,\u201d Meyer\u2019s style is hands-on, and he is a frequent presence at many USHG restaurants, where he stops by tables to greet loyal customers and celebrity patrons. Over the years, Meyer has brought in outside investors. In 2012, Los Angeles private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP acquired a 39.5 percent stake in USHG for an undisclosed amount. Today, Meyer also serves on the board of OpenTable Inc., the online restaurant reservation service bought by The Priceline Group Inc. (Nasdaq: PCLN) for $2.6 billion in 2014.\n\nOutside the realm of fine dining, Meyer has played a significant role in the reinvention of the burger joint. In 2001, on something of a whim, he instructed the staff at tony Eleven Park Madison to set up a temporary hot dog cart across the street in Madison Square Park to support the park\u2019s first art installation. In 2004, USHG won a bid to open a permanent kiosk in the park, and Shake Shack Inc. (NYSE: SHAK) was born.\n\nSelling high-quality fast food (including a portobello mushroom-based \u2018Shroom Burger for vegetarians), the original Shake Shack stand quickly became a favorite lunch spot for those who worked in the neighborhood. Thanks to web cams and Twitter feeds that enabled would-be customers to monitor the ever-growing lineups remotely, Shake Shack\u2019s popularity flourished among the blossoming New York tech startup community. Grass-roots publicity came from entrepreneurs, such as Tumblr Inc. founder David Karp, and venture capitalists, such as Union Square Ventures co-founder Fred Wilson, who mentioned the outdoor eatery on their blogs and social media accounts.\n\nContinuing the cautious approach, it took five years before Meyer launched a second location, but Shake Shack has been expanding significantly all over the world ever since. Plans are in the works for a Tokyo location in 2016. The company split off from USHG in 2009 and went public in 2014.\n\nThroughout his endeavors, Meyer has maintained the focus on hospitality, as he discussed in his 2008 book, Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business. As he told the M&A East audience, his recipe for success consists of \u201c49 parts performance, 51 parts hospitality.\u201d\n\nPhoto credits (from top to bottom): Sarah Bones, Union Square Hospitality Group, Madison Square Park Conservancy\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/consumer_goods_retail/restaurateur-danny-meyer-urges-dealmakers-to-focus-on-hospitality-258555-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/dannymeyer.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Restaurateur Danny Meyer, of Union Square Caf\u00e9 and Shake Shack Fame, Urges Dealmakers to Focus on Hospitality"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda0d2\"", "article_summary": "Meyer\u2019s culinary career began relatively modestly 30 years ago in October 1985, when he opened Union Square Caf\u00e9.\nRestaurateur Danny Meyer, of Union Square Caf\u00e9 and Shake Shack Fame, Urges Dealmakers to Focus on HospitalityThe CEO of Leonard Green-backed Union Square Hospitality Group advised ACG Philadelphia\u0092s M&A East attendees to \u0093make your company a favorite\u0094Understanding the difference between service and hospitality is crucial to the success of a restaurant, or any business, according to acclaimed entrepreneur Danny Meyer.\nMeyer funded the endeavor with about $980,000 in personal savings and family loans, he told the M&A East audience.\nInspired by restaurants he had enjoyed while traveling in Europe, Union Square Cafe is credited with bringing the farm-to-table movement to New York City and with helping to revitalize the Union Square neighborhood.\nThe CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG), which owns many well-cherished eateries in New York, including Union Square Caf\u00e9 and Grammercy Tavern, delivered the opening keynote address at the recent M&A East conference, sponsored by ACG Philadelphia."}
