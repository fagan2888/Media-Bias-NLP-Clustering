Historians will look back on this time as \u201cthe Obama criminal years.\u201d\n\nHow lawless is the Obama administration? Many of the dirty deeds and scandals of Obama & Co. are public knowledge. Let\u2019s start with the most astonishing.\n\nMany citizens are aware that because of ObamaCare, millions of Americans are losing their health care coverage. Is this incompetence, or criminal fraud?\n\nOne thing is certain: it would be fraud if a private sector CEO knew that millions of customers would lose their insurance, yet repeated the same lie over and over -- \u201cIf you like your health insurance, you can keep it. Period.\u201d\n\nWhy would we not hold a politician to the same standard?\n\nThat brings up the question \u201cIS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?\u201d\n\nBut this fraud isn\u2019t just about money and power. It\u2019s about cancer patients, our fellow citizens who may lose their lives as well as their health care coverage because of ObamaCare.\n\nEven innocent children with cancer are among the victims of ObamaCare.\n\nYes, it turns out ObamaCare is one big death panel. With their policies being cancelled, these sick Americans are losing the very doctors, hospitals and treatments that have kept them alive.\n\nWhat if some of them die from the stoppage of treatment? What if some die from stress and worry? What if some commit suicide from depression?\n\nThese are complicated questions. But isn\u2019t the person whose lies and misrepresentations harmed them, at least partly responsible for their deaths?\n\nSo, IS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?\n\nThis president has no shame. How many Americans know that a cancer patient merely discussing the disastrous ramifications of ObamaCare in public (thereby embarrassing Obama), is now being persecuted by the IRS?\n\nYes, it\u2019s true. Bill Elliott is that terminally-ill cancer patient. He was audited by the IRS within days of an appearance on Fox News.\n\nThe IRS scandal is far more widespread than the American public knows. It is not just about Tea Party groups.\n\nThe IRS was used by Obama to go after any citizen daring to criticize him in the national media.\n\nI\u2019m one of those victims. These actions by a president are absolutely criminal. Richard Nixon\u2019s articles of impeachment included the exact same charge of using the IRS to punish critics and silence free speech. But terminally ill cancer patients?\n\nObama has sunk to new lows. I'm a big boy. What he did to critics like me is disgusting and un-American. But what he did to a terminally ill cancer patient is disgraceful and unimaginable. This president is an out-of-control bully, pure and simple.\n\nWill anyone show the courage to investigate and prosecute Obama?\n\n\u201cIS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?\u201d\n\nBut wait (as late night infomercial pitchmen like to say), \u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d When the citizens went to the \"state of the art\" ObamaCare web site for help, to try to save themselves, they found it defective.\n\nIt turns out the website was built so poorly, the personal information of consumers can be easily stolen. And it\u2019s not just online scam artists we\u2019re worried about. The \u201cObama navigators\u201d themselves might do the stealing -- after all, it turns out many of them have criminal records.\n\nRather than hiring one of many highly-qualified American high tech Internet companies, why would Obama give a NO BID contract for hundreds of millions of dollars to a firm with less than stellar credentials?\n\nSurely the reason couldn\u2019t be that it\u2019s the firm of one of Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton Black Alumni Association buddies?\n\nDon\u2019t you wonder how many of those millions of taxpayer dollars are committed to Democrat causes, or are now sitting in a Swiss bank account?\n\nCan you imagine if this happened at a private sector company?\n\nCan you imagine the outrage and criminal accusations coming from consumer protection advocates?\n\nCan you imagine how quickly the federal government would shut down the business?\n\nThe criminal would have been \u201cperp walked\u201d out of his office in front of waiting journalists and photographers. He\u2019d be facing a lifetime in prison.\n\nSo, \u201cIS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?\u201d\n\nAs bad as it is, ObamaCare is just another of the nonstop scandals of this administration. Any one of these scandals would have already forced a Republican president out of office. Obama owns all of them.\n\nBenghazi. More absurd lies than ObamaCare, a possible arms deal with rebels gone bad, and the cover-up of murder.\n\nFast and Furious. Another government arms deal gone bad, responsibility for the murder of a U.S. border guard, another blatant cover-up.\n\nThe NSA scandal. Obama listens into all of our calls and communications. I hope he\u2019s listening to mine. He\u2019ll hear the word IMPEACHMENT come up in every sentence.\n\nThe AP scandal. Obama and paranoid buddies like Attorney General Eric Holder are even illegally spying on their adoring Kool-Aid drinking friends in the media.\n\nThe IRS scandal. It\u2019s not just about targeting his political opposition. It\u2019s about the much more serious scandal of using the IRS to change the outcome of the election. Obama\u2019s goal was to neutralize the powerful Tea Parties to prevent a repeat of the 2010 GOP landslide.\n\nGuess what? It worked.\n\nObama used the IRS to kill conservative momentum, intensity, and enthusiasm, silence criticism in the media, and starve conservative fundraising. These guys put the \"thug\" in Chicago.\n\nThe Census Bureau scandal. It appears government employees faked the unemployment numbers in the weeks leading up to the election to re-elect a president who wouldn\u2019t know what a job looked like, if it hit him in the face.\n\nHow could one leader be involved in this many lies, frauds, scandals, and cover-ups? There\u2019s enough here for a century of presidents!\n\nForget impeachment, it\u2019s time for criminal prosecution. There\u2019s enough here to put a CEO away for multiple life sentences. Bernie Madoff would blush at what Obama has pulled off (so far).\n\nThe question is, \u201cIS THIS PRESIDENT TOO BIG TO JAIL?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-09 03:31:02 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "How lawless is the Obama administration?
