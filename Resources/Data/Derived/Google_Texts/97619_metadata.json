Greater than ever before!\u201d\n\nOne of the first orders of business was to criticize the country\u2019s $19 trillion deficit that soon will be $21 trillion because of the recent hastily passed federal budget.\n\nTrump also said the art of the deal was not used by the Obama administration in dealing with Iran.\n\n\u201cWe give Iran $150 billion, and they\u2019re going to be allowed to self-inspect,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t give us our prisoners back. They\u2019re going to start new negotiations to give us our prisoners back. Three years ago, they should have said, \u2018Give us our prisoners back and then we will negotiate.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cJUST STAND THERE\u201d: South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, the moderator, asked Trump what types of people he would appoint to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cConservatives,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d want strong conservatives. Great legal scholars. Peo\u00adple who respect our Con\u00ad\u00adsti\u00ad\u00adtution. There\u2019ve been so many bad decisions. Immigration. I want people who are truly in love with the Constitution. Most people had never heard of executive action \u2026.\n\n\u201cExecutive action can be undone,\u201d he said. \u201cTwo minutes after I take an oath, I would be getting rid of them in the first hour.\u201d\n\nHe said he went to the South\u00ad\u00adwestern border and talked to Border Patrol members who really want to do their jobs but are told to just stand there.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a border, we don\u2019t have a country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will build a wall, and it\u2019s going to be a real wall, with a big beautiful door. They have to come in legally.\u201d\n\nTrump said he has taken \u201ctremendous heat\u201d for his controversial statements but that he \u201cdouble downed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t in the race, nobody would be talking about illegal immigration or Islamic terrorists,\u201d he said. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t want to talk about it. Our president won\u2019t even say it.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, since the killings in California, some of his critics are saying, \u201cYou know, he\u2019s got a point.\u201d\n\nOVERREGULATED, UNDER\u00adEDUCATED: Prompted by Wil\u00adson, Trump lambasted large federal agencies such as the Environmental Pro\u00adtec\u00adtion Agency, the Jus\u00adtice Department and the Educa\u00adtion Department.\n\n\u201cCommon Core is a disaster,\u201d he said. \u201cBureaucrats in Washington who are making a tremendous amount of money are deciding what your children learn.\u201d\n\nAnd the EPA\u2019s controversial ruling on clean power and waters is a \u201cland grab.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have clean air and water, but we\u2019ve got to get rid of the regulations,\u201d he said. \u201cShowers \u2026 I can\u2019t wash my hair. They have restrictors for them. I won\u2019t use the example of the toilet \u2026 Yes, I will. So people are flushing seven, eight, 10 times. There are so many bad regulations. They\u2019ve overregulated.\u201d\n\nOBAMACARE: \u201cIt\u2019s failing badly. By 2017, it implodes,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster. Rates have gone up, sometimes over 50 percent. Deduc\u00adtibles are so high some people can\u2019t pay them. Insur\u00adance companies have done really well. We\u2019re going to get rid of the insurance companies.\n\n\u201cObamacare is going down with or without (Su\u00adpreme Court Chief) Justice (John) Roberts. He should never have done it. I think he wanted to be popular with inside-the-beltway people. There\u2019s no legal reason he should not have ended Obamacare the first or second time.\u201d\n\nTHE MEDIA: The only times the TV cameras turn are to shoot pictures of protesters, Trump said.\n\n\u201cThey are so dishonest it\u2019s incredible. If there\u2019s a protester they can turn them (cameras) into a pretzel. You\u2019re dishonest people,\u201d he said, speaking directly to reporters and cameramen across the room.\n\nTHE SECOND AMENDMENT: \u201cWe have a horrible situation. Fourteen people were killed (in California) and more are dying,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the people present had been allowed to carry guns, the terrorists would have gone down with them, he said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problem with the press is they call it domestic violence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey call the man in black the \u2018mastermind.\u2019 They glorify them. \u2026 If the \u2018masterminds\u2019 knew people in there had guns, they wouldn\u2019t have been there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so stupid. They\u2019re taking guns away, but the bad guys are always going to have guns.\u201d\n\nTHE POLICE: \u201cThe police are incredible people. They take such abuse. The police in this country are so under-appreciated.\u201d\n\nIf you see or hear anything that seems suspicious, you should call your local police, he said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about being politically correct,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou have to call someone.\u201d\n\nWhen it was over, Trump spent about 30 minutes signing copies of his books and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d bumper stickers, T-shirts and hats.\n\nALL HE NEEDS IS A FLUTE AND A COBRA: Augusta Mayor Hardie Davis has been called a lot of things, but chances are he\u2019d never been called a \u201csnake charmer\u201d until last week.\n\nWayne Hawkins, the longtime chairman of the May\u00adors\u2019 Masters Reception committee, called to say there wasn\u2019t going to be a reception next year because of the way Davis treated the committee last year. He said he was going to meet with the mayor the next day and tell him so.\n\nHawkins said he\u2019d found the mayor hard to work with in addition to not living up to his promise of chipping in $2,500 for security,\n\n\u201cWhen it came time to pay up, he didn\u2019t have it,\u201d Haw\u00adkins said. \u201cAnd he couldn\u2019t find time to do the radio commercials to advertise the concert, and they didn\u2019t get out soon enough to get the word out, and we were not able to give any money to charity.\u201d\n\nHawkins also said Davis had his own personal photographer following him around taking pictures and ignored Tim Conway, the event\u2019s official photographer.\n\nOther complaints included not being able to contact Davis and having to reprint the invitations which had his name as simply \u201cHardie Davis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI get an e-mail that says, \u2018These have to be reprinted. My name is Hardie Davis Jr.\u2019\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cIt was a nightmare. I\u2019m 63 years old. I don\u2019t know I want to go through that again.\n\n\u201cHe never came to a committee meeting and never said \u2018thank you\u2019 for anything. He got all the glory and credit and didn\u2019t acknowledge any of the people who had worked so hard.\u201d\n\nI told Hawkins to call after he met with Davis and let me know what happened, but that I was certain the mayor would talk him into doing the reception again.\n\nThe next day, Hawkins had softened. He said Davis was a smooth talker and insisted it was a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a snake charmer,\u201d Haw\u00ad\u00adkins said. \u201cHe can just charm you to death with that smooth talk. But it\u2019s still up in the air until I meet with my board.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, City Ink, Government, Metro, Sylvia Cooper", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "The USC Aiken Convo&shy;cation Center was packed to the rafters Saturday with enthusiastic, cheering Donald Trump supporters decked out in \"Make America Great Again\" T-shirts, caps and pins.", "title": "Trump didn't hold back in Aiken talk", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/government/city-ink/2015-12-13/trump-didnt-hold-back-aiken-talk", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe give Iran $150 billion, and they\u2019re going to be allowed to self-inspect,\u201d he said.\nThey\u2019re going to start new negotiations to give us our prisoners back.\nTrump also said the art of the deal was not used by the Obama administration in dealing with Iran.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t have a border, we don\u2019t have a country,\u201d he said.\nAnd they were there to hear Trump say, \u201cWe can make our country great again!"}
