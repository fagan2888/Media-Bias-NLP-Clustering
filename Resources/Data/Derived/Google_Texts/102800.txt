Gallup: Uninsured rate plunges to new low

The number of uninsured Americans has hit its lowest level of President Barack Obama’s tenure, according to new poll numbers.

The uninsured rate dropped to 12.9 percent for 2014’s fourth quarter, a Gallup poll released Tuesday showed. This figure — the lowest since Gallup began measuring daily in 2008 — is down from the 13.4 percent rate in the third quarter in 2014 and down from 17.1 percent in 2013’s fourth quarter.

While the figure has decreased across all demographics, the pollster notes that the sharpest decline in uninsured has been among African-American and low-income Americans. The number of uninsured Hispanics has decreased as well, but they remain the highest uninsured demographic in the country, with 32.4 percent without coverage.

The poll showed a sharp decrease of uninsured U.S. adults from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014 as a growing number of Americans signed up for coverage through state and federal exchanges under the Affordable Care Act. The 2015 enrollment period opened on Nov. 15 and will close on Feb. 15.

The Gallup poll was conducted Oct. 1 to Dec. 30, 2014, and is based on 43,000 interviews with U.S. adults.
