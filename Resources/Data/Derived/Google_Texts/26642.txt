The Affordable Care Act was designed to translate policy into law. Its foundation is reformation of health care insurance financing. This is a cumbersome process, hence the length and complexity of the law.

From 2008 to 2010, I was a health and aging policy fellow on the Senate Finance Committee where I witnessed the birth of this legislation as it tackled health care financing and ways to fix the employer-sponsored health insurance market.

People who are not eligible for Medicare -- like newly widowed and divorced adults between the ages of 18 and 64 -- now have reasonable alternatives.

To understand what works about the Affordable Care Act, it is important to fully appreciate that in the United States, our only access to health care is through insurance, and approximately 70 percent of Americans obtain health insurance through employer-sponsored plans -- plans found in the private insurance markets.

Before the health care law, newly widowed or divorced adults -- 24 percent of women and 30 percent of men between the ages of 18 and 64 -- had few options for access to health insurance. (I include divorced adults because many married couples obtain health care insurance through one spouse’s employer plan.) It is painful enough to lose a spouse through death or divorce but to find out that you’ve also lost your health insurance can be financially overwhelming.

Now that we have the Affordable Care Act and the health insurance exchanges, these people who are not eligible for Medicare have reasonable alternatives. This is a good thing.

If there is one bright, shining success from this law, this is it.
