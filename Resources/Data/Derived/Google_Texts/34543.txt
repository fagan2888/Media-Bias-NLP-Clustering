Obama told a joint news conference with Kenyan counterpart Uhuru Kenyatta that treating people differently eroded freedom and then "bad things happen". Kenyatta said Kenya and America shared many values but not on all issues, saying gay rights was not an issue for his people.

Kenya, like many African states, outlaws homosexuality. Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto said in May that there was "no room" for gays in Kenya. Obama has hailed a July U.S. Supreme Court decision to allow same-sex marriage.
