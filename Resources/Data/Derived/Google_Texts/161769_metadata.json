But because he heisted Donald Trump\u2019s nickname. And don\u2019t tell me Springsteen was called The Boss before The Donald was \u2013 and if that\u2019s the case, then the nickname-giver was a prognosticator and he\u2019s still guilty of this faux pas.\n\nAl Sharpton \u2013 The man is an absolute racist.
