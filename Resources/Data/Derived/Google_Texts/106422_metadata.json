Then, two men approached the house while the driver of the getaway car started to back out.\n\nBallamy was asleep in the front bedroom with her 4-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son when the two men broke in, even though she had the door locked up tight.\n\n\u201cI told them to get out of my house,\u201d said Ballamy. \u201cThey pointed a gun at me said give me all your money.\u201d\n\nBallamy showed News 9 the damage the men did to the front door. She also said, the men not only pointed the gun at her, but her young son too.
