The cabby who took me to my appointment at House office buildings was none too pleased: \u201cLook at this! It\u2019s a ghost town. empty streets. How can they do this when we are just now recovering?\u201d\n\nThe hallways leading to the office of Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Dallas, in the Rayburn Building (named after Texas political icon Sam Rayburn) were just about as empty, though many staffers did seem to be at their posts.\n\nI had stopped in to talk about the economic impact of \u201cuncertainty\u201d with Hensarling, who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and a leading deficit hawk.\n\nA piece I\u2019m writing for this week\u2019s newspaper deals with the impact on our economy stemming from Congress\u2019s stalemate. Economists say there is a drag on economic growth when investors, companies and others lose confidence that the government will address its long-term fiscal challenges.\n\nIt flows from ideas that formed a big part of the Harvard dissertation written by a rising young economics Ph.D. in 1979, a man whose name now comes attached to the title of chairman of the Federal Reserve: Ben Bernanke. You can read the dissertation down below.\n\nAt its simplest, the idea is that if a company with options to expand in any of several ways can\u2019t predict what the fiscal policy will be \u2014 will labor costs go up, or will tax credits for new equipment go down \u2014 the company will sit on its money and choose neither \u2014 even if both options would be good for the company.\n\nMy interview with Hensarling focused on uncertainty stemming from long-term fiscal challenges. He agreed that businesses are telling him that they are putting off investment because they fear higher taxes or other policy prescriptions when Congress gets around to righting its house. But he pushed back against economists who have told me that a big drag isn\u2019t so much the fear of higher taxes, but fear that the two sides are so far apart they won\u2019t reach a solution at all.\n\nOn Obamacare, here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cYes, Republicans don\u2019t want Obamacare that\u2019s clear. But at this point what we are saying is \u2026 if Obamacare is going to be law of the land, it at least ought to be applied equally to all Americans. If employers are going to get a one-year reprieve, we believe hard-working Americans ought to get a one-year reprieve. And we certainly do not believe the president has the power unilaterally to give members of Congress a special deal that working Americans do not get to have, an employer contribution to the individual exchanges. If there is anything Americans have cynicism about it is Washington elites making laws that they don\u2019t have to live under.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve written before about the charge from Republicans that Obamacare is giving \u201cspecial treatment\u201d to members of Congress and their staff members. It still doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Here\u2019s some background if you\u2019re interested.\n\nBut Hensarling said his side has accepted it won\u2019t be able to repeal, delay or defund Obamacare. That doesn\u2019t mean they will stop fighting, he said.\n\n\u201cListen we get it. We understand the president\u2019s not going to allow repeal. We understand the president\u2019s not going to allow defunding, the president is not going to allow delay. But at a bare minimum shouldn\u2019t all Americans be treated equally and fairly under the law? And in divided government, isn\u2019t that the least we can expect?\u201d\n\nBernanke\u2019s dissertation is below.
