A Sunday gathering in the Lanoka Harbor neighborhood turned ugly, police said, when a teenager got upset and assaulted another teen.

Police were called to the residence on Heatherington Court at 2:16 a.m. Sunday by Brett W. Miniaci, 19, of the Forked River section of town. Minianci told police he had been “attending a gathering” when another 19-year-old, Dominique R. Deservio, got upset and punched Minianci three times in the face, causing bruises and small cuts, according to a statement from Lacey Chief of Police David A. Paprota.

Both teens had been drinking before the fight, and both were issued summonses of drinking underage, Paprota said. Diservio was also summonsed on a charge of simple assault, Paprota said.

The Asbury Park Press asked police for a photo of the suspect, but they refused. State law allows authorities discretion in releasing suspect photos, but they often refuse to do so, saying they are prohibited by the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office.
