Pierre, SD

Gov. Dennis Daugaard's office says the Christmas trees that decorate the South Dakota state Capitol will only be available for public viewing through Saturday.



Organizations that decorated the trees will begin taking them down on Sunday. The governor's office invites groups who are celebrating an anniversary in 2015, or simply those who want to decorate trees next year to get in contact.



The display includes nearly 100 trees this year provided by volunteers. The governor, first lady and mayor of Pierre performed a grand lighting ceremony on Nov. 25.
