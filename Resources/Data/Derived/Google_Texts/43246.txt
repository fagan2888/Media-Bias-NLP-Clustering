Family members probably shouldn’t talk politics at the Thanksgiving dinner table, but some things can’t be helped.

Seeing this, the Democratic National Committee put out a guide Wednesday for “Talking Politics with Your Republican Uncle,” which attempts to beat back conservatives’ complaints about President Obama.

“Don’t get me wrong — I love the Republicans in my life. But nothing ruins a slice of pecan pie faster than talking through immigration reform with a cousin who spends too much time listening to Rush Limbaugh,” DNC Digital Director Matt Compton said in a message to Democrats. “We can’t do anything about highway congestion, but we can make sure you have the information you need to answer a bonkers question about President Obama’s record on jobs or the perfect fact to respond to a ridiculous argument about the Affordable Care Act.”

The guide takes on certain “myths,” such as claims Mr. Obama and his health care law are increasing the deficit, or that the president doesn’t care about jobs.

On Obamacare, it says the reforms are “market-based, constitutional, and definitely not socialist.”
