The President has been talking a lot lately about how great the economy is doing. While it may look good for some in the Los Angeles basin, a trip throughout the Golden state would show the President that many Californians are frustrated with his Administration\u2019s economic policies. So, before the President leaves California, he should take a little trip. He should take Colorado to Lincoln, hop on the 10, go north on the 405 to the 5\u2014get off at Lyons for a double-double from In-n-Out\u2014then take the 5 to the 99 to the 65. On this route, he\u2019ll pass through Bakersfield and into the Central Valley, where the nation\u2019s largest vegetable, fruit, and nut producers are located. But right now the drought has made life tough for people in Central Valley communities, and the Obama Administration\u2019s policies sure haven\u2019t helped. Sadly, the Obama economy and the Administration\u2019s harmful water regulatory burdens have left California in a far more precarious place than West L.A. Labor force participation in California is only 61.9 percent, below the national rate of 62.7 percent, which is a full 3.4 percent lower than in 2008. Unemployment in counties across California, especially in the Central Valley, is still in the double digits. If the President is serious about growing the economy and creating opportunity in California, he should direct his Administration to immediately ease the harmful policies that send precious water out to the ocean instead of to our communities. That would create real economic growth and provide greater opportunity to the next generation of our farmers. So while the President is out West, he should take a trip on the freeway out of the big cities and see how the rest of California is doing.\n\nRelated: Kevin McCarthy Elected Majority Leader McCarthy Will Have to Prove Himself on Policy, Fundraising Majority Leader-Elect McCarthy Inherits Top Cantor Aides Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, showing off a lighter side rarely seen in his predecessor, offered some overly-elaborate highway navigation tips \u2014 a la Saturday Night Live's soap-opera parody \"The Californians\" \u2014 for President Barack Obama's fundraising trip to the West Coast.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, showing off a lighter side rarely seen in his predecessor, offered some overly-elaborate highway navigation tips \u2014 a la Saturday Night Live's soap-opera parody \"The Californians\" \u2014 for President Barack Obama's fundraising trip to the West Coast.", "title": "McCarthy Riffs on SNL's 'The Californians' With Highway Tips for Obama", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/mccarthy-riffs-on-snl-californians-with-highway-tips-for-obama", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2014/09/mccarthy_075_090914-445x296.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-10-09T19:44:21Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, showing off a lighter side rarely seen in his predecessor, offered some overly-elaborate highway navigation tips \u2014 a la Saturday Night Live's soap-opera parody \"The Californians\" \u2014 for President Barack Obama's fundraising trip to the West Coast.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,category,author,category,category,category,barack-obama,conservatives,democrats,kevin-mccarthy,republicans-2", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-10-09T19:44:21Z", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T19:44:21Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, showing off a lighter side rarely seen in his predecessor, offered some overly-elaborate highway navigation tips \u2014 a la Saturday Night Live's soap-opera parody", "title": "McCarthy Riffs on SNL's 'The Californians' With Highway Tips for Obama", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/mccarthy-riffs-on-snl-californians-with-highway-tips-for-obama", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/blogs/sites/2/2014/09/mccarthy_075_090914-445x296.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4cf3\"", "article_summary": "But right now the drought has made life tough for people in Central Valley communities, and the Obama Administration\u2019s policies sure haven\u2019t helped.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, showing off a lighter side rarely seen in his predecessor, offered some overly-elaborate highway navigation tips \u2014 a la Saturday Night Live's soap-opera parody \"The Californians\" \u2014 for President Barack Obama's fundraising trip to the West Coast.\nRelated: Kevin McCarthy Elected Majority Leader McCarthy Will Have to Prove Himself on Policy, Fundraising Majority Leader-Elect McCarthy Inherits Top Cantor Aides Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.\nSo, before the President leaves California, he should take a little trip.\nUnemployment in counties across California, especially in the Central Valley, is still in the double digits."}
