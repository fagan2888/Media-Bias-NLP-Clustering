Many employers are reportedly embracing high-deductible plans to avoid Cadillac Tax penalizations.\n\nSaid Bill Melville, Market Analyst for Decision Resources Group, to RevCycleIntelligence.com, \u201cThe Cadillac tax piece, built into the funding of the ACA to help fund things down the road, is the last big piece to be implemented in 2018.\u201d\n\n\u201cPremiums are going to be in the spotlight because this is the first year they\u2019re being calculated in full-year claims,\u201d he stated. [The Cadillac Tax] is a big concern for union-sponsored health plans where something will have to change, perhaps within this or the next administration.\u201d\n\nIs the Cadillac Tax bad for revenue?\n\nThe Cadillac Tax\u2019s overall impact upon the healthcare industry is far from positive, says United States Representative Joe Courtney (D-CT) in a Huffington Post op-ed. The tax is expected to detrimentally impact the health plans of working families, retirees, and Baby Boomers, he says.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, the tax on high-cost health plans will degrade the quality of insurance plans available to employees of all stripes \u2013 teachers, emergency personnel, factory workers, and a myriad of others who may have negotiated for better health insurance plans by forgoing wage increases in the past,\u201d says Courtney.\n\n\u201cIf the goal of the Cadillac tax is to reduce superfluous health care spending, as its proponents assert, then it will also reduce necessary health care spending, which leads to poorer outcomes for patients,\u201d he adds.\n\nThe Cadillac Tax proves especially problematic, he states, because healthcare consumers may choose to not make an appointment with a physician if such a visit is merely too costly.\n\n\u201cThe tax is a blunt, indiscriminate instrument that must be repealed as soon as possible before it reduces access to necessary care, and damages the important progress we have made in reducing uninsured rates and intelligently bending the cost curve of health care spending,\u201d Courtney states.\n\nAs RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, such dire financial consequences are perhaps on the revenue cycle horizon. Said the Alliance to Fight the 40 (Alliance) in a letter to the House of Representatives:\n\nCongress\u2019 original intent was to target only a small number of \u2018overly rich\u2019 plans. However, nonpartisan analyses reveal that it will hit modest health plans that are expensive simply because they are offered in high-cost areas; or because they cover large numbers of people whose health costs are typically higher than average \u2013 women, older and disabled workers, and families experiencing catastrophic health events. \u2026 The stated goal of health reform was to build upon employer-based coverage and lower costs. This tax will do neither. Instead, it will erode an important source of quality coverage and compel a shift of costs to workers \u2013 something neither employers, nor employees want to see happen.\n\nIs the Cadillac Tax good for revenue?\n\nAccording to a New York Times op-ed piece published earlier this week, the Cadillac tax is good for business, primarily business involving increased revenues.\n\n\u201cIf there is to be reform of the Cadillac tax, a responsible approach could be to limit the financial benefits of the tax exclusion to $2,000 (or less) for households making over $250,000 and totally eliminate it for households making over $1 million,\u201d write Ezekiel J. Emanuel and Bob Kocher.\n\n$91 billion will be raised by the Cadillac Tax within 8 years, the authors maintain. Through the active eradication of waste from the healthcare system, out-of-pocket costs will decrease, they claim.\n\n\u201cRepeal it and politicians \u2014 if they are being fiscally responsible \u2014 will have to find other sources of revenue rather than add to the deficit,\u201d the authors say. Out-of-pocket expenses, they add, require immediate addressing.\n\n\u201cThe public is complaining bitterly about the growing out-of-pocket expenses for health care,\u201d they state. \u201cThis is a big problem, largely driven by employers who are shifting costs through higher premiums and more deductibles to their workers.\u201d\n\nAs RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, out-of-pocket copayments, coinsurance costs, and deductible expenses are expected to exceed $345 billion. According to some leading estimates, healthcare spending will soon exceed $10,000 per person if high-deductibles complicate point-of-service collection efforts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Cadillac Tax is a concern for some union-sponsored health plans.
