As of April 1, 2015, all current and future members of Health Excellence Select are automatically enrolled in MyHealth.Us and are receiving new membership cards from Health Excellence Select that includes a unique MyHealth.Us Life Code, MyQR code and toll-free number for immediate assistance. This is in addition to all the other health and concierge benefits Health Excellence Select provides its members. MyHealth.Us is certified HIPAA compliant. MyHealth members and their approved emergency contacts can quickly upload or record files, photos and even dictate information about patients' activities, medication, health, diet, condition, environment that is useful to caregivers and for future diagnosis. MyQR QR codes on membership cards, wristbands, labels and shoe tags can be scanned by first responders to access emergency data and treatment options.

"Our vision has always been to make life saving information rapidly, easily and safely accessible to healthcare providers when it is most critical to deliver quality medical care to patients," said CJ Wilson, founder and CEO of MyHealth.Us.

The Health Excellence Select members program was launched in 2014 by My Academy of Health Excellence, as part of a health sharing organization whose members have significant freedom in choosing care providers, sharing the cost of healthcare, and proactively encouraging and delivering better health, along with life-long health solutions. Any qualified doctor or healthcare expense is shareable under Health Excellence Select's program after a member's minimal financial responsibility. Health assessments, community support, personal assistants and other healthy living services are included.

Rod Maxson, CEO of My Academy of Health Excellence, stated, "Partnering with MyHealth.US was a no brainer. HES is a program that seeks to have a solution to whatever expected or unexpected circumstance a member may encounter. Having a Life Code like this now safeguards our members against a situation where they may be unable to communicate about any medical issues a first responder would need to be aware of."

Jeff Kanter, co-founder of My Academy of Health Excellence, stated, "We are always seeking ways to bulletproof our member's health, especially in areas where they might never foresee the need until it was too late. MyHealth.US' Life Code is a powerful tool that ensures our members' safety and health."
