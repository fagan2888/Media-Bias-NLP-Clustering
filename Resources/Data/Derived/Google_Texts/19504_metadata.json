Or talk with your accountant. Or at least begin gathering documents.\n\nYou might want to do any number of things \u2014 except panic, experts told us. After all, you\u2019re in good company.\n\n\u201cDefinitely the volume (of returns) certainly increases the closer you get to the filing deadline,\u201d said Cari Weston, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants director of taxation.\n\nThe deadline to file 2015 federal tax returns is Monday, about three days later than usual thanks to a little-known Washington, D.C. holiday, Emancipation Day. The Ohio individual income tax filing deadline is also Monday.\n\nAnd no: If you believe you\u2019re due a refund, you shouldn\u2019t ignore the deadline.\n\n+ If you haven\u2019t filed your federal tax return yet, you probably should file for an extension.

And it could cause you trouble back to that original date.\u201d\n\nFile for an extension \u2014 giving yourself six extra months \u2014 by completing and submitting Form 4868.\n\nBut an extension does not give you more time to pay. Accountants advise clients to estimate the taxes they owe and round up (not down) in their estimate. They might also look at last year\u2019s return and pay at least 100 percent of their total tax.\n\nRelated Edens Edge Member Hannah Blaylock Leaves Band\n\nAn unpaid liability means interest and penalties.\n\nWeston describes herself as a \u201cfan of filing for extensions.\u201d Extensions protect taxpayers, she said.\n\n\u201cAt this point, frankly, if you have a refund coming, you should just get an extension and worry about it in the first week of May,\u201d said Bill Duncan, a CPA with accounting firm Thorn Lewis & Duncan.\n\nWeston wouldn\u2019t encourage anybody to rush in preparing a return. Pull together everything you have and start the work, she advised. If you look like you may be due a refund, and perhaps a document or two is missing, go ahead and file for an extension.\n\nOne wrinkle this year is the Affordable Care Act form 1095, said Joel Veldt, a CPA and tax preparer at Dayton tax service firm Ladd & Carter.\n\nThe government decided to let businesses wait until March 31 \u2014 relatively late in the tax season \u2014 to send out the 1095 forms, Veldt said. Form 1095-C describes what health insurance coverage was available to employees. Another form, the 1095-B, provides information about an employee\u2019s actual insurance coverage, including who in an employee\u2019s family was covered.\n\n\u201cWe had to do most of the tax season without those forms,\u201d Veldt said. \u201cWe had to kind of ask questions and fill out a worksheet and guess at it.\u201d\n\nHe quipped that the ACA has probably convinced 10 percent of the CPA profession to retire in the past year.\n\nStill, the extra leap year day and slightly later deadline do give taxpayers a bit of extra breathing room, he said.\n\nAlthough Duncan sees it differently.\n\n\u201cIt makes us more grumpy because it\u2019s another weekend we have to work,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nCPAs are always putting in more hours at this time of year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked every single day since Feb. 1,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cA lot of our preparers are working 60-, 65-hour weeks.\u201d\n\nOne problem in in the final run-up to the filing deadline is simple logistics: Finishing returns, arranging for delivery and pick-up of documents and of course, paying the Internal Revenue Service, if taxes are in fact due.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t started working on your taxes, Veldt\u2019s advice is simple: Start. Get an idea of whether you\u2019re due a refund or whether you owe, and if so, how much.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tax deadline looms: Here\u2019s what you need to know", "author": "By Thomas Gnau - Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/tax-deadline-looms-heres-what-you-need-to-know/nq45H/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2016/04/13/9f/e7/tax-return.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tax deadline looms: Here\u2019s what you need to know", "title": "Tax deadline looms: Here's what you need to know"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2016/04/13/9f/e7/tax-return.jpg", "description": "If you haven&rsquo;t filed your federal tax return yet, you probably should file for an extension.
