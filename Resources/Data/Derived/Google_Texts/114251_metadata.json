Today, it\u2019s a touch screen so you can place your order directly to the kitchen from your table.\n\nThat\u2019s what Ron Shaich, founder and CEO of Panera Bread envisions for his 1,946 bakery-cafes in 46 states. Although Shaich is excited about his forward thinking digital plan, his 80,000 associates who he admitted in a recent commencement address \u201cdepend on us for steady employment\u201d are less sanguine about the prospect.\n\nRelated: Minimum Wage Hikes Could Cause the Rise of Robot-Run Restaurants\n\nShaich told investors during an analysts\u2019 call this last Wednesday, \"Labor is going to go down, and as digital utilization goes up \u2014 like the sun comes up in the morning \u2014 it is going to continue to go up\u2026. As it happens, it's going to benefit larger organizations like Panera, who already have the technology in place.\"\n\nSounds like comments from a hard-boiled business guy, not someone who\u2019s considered a humanitarian running a socially responsible company with a market cap of $4.72 billion.\n\nLast year, speaking at Clark University\u2019s commencement, his alma mater, Shaich admitted he wanted to change the world. And he has taken action against poverty and hunger by starting \u201cPay-What-You Can\u201d cafes in a number of neighborhoods. He also dropped many artificial ingredients from his suppliers, including preservatives, and meat from animals raised with antibiotics.\n\nRelated: We\u2019ll Spend $67 Billion on Robots by 2025\n\nBut business is still Shaich\u2019s first priority, even though he claims lowering labor costs is simply a side benefit of the technology. \"We did our digital capabilities to give a better guest experience. It was never about labor,\" he said.\n\nPanera\u2019s labor costs rose $20 million in Q3\u2014from $170 million to $190 million.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Years ago, the technology of choice in your local diner was a mini jukebox on the tabl", "title": "How Robots Could Put Workers on Panera\u2019s Bread Line", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/How-Robots-Could-Put-Workers-Panera-s-Bread-Line", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Untitled.1.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/29/How-Robots-Could-Put-Workers-Panera-s-Bread-Line", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Untitled.1.png", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Years ago, the technology of choice in your local diner was a mini jukebox on the tabl", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a66\"", "article_summary": "Panera\u2019s labor costs rose $20 million in Q3\u2014from $170 million to $190 million.\nThat\u2019s what Ron Shaich, founder and CEO of Panera Bread envisions for his 1,946 bakery-cafes in 46 states.\nRelated: We\u2019ll Spend $67 Billion on Robots by 2025But business is still Shaich\u2019s first priority, even though he claims lowering labor costs is simply a side benefit of the technology.\nAs it happens, it's going to benefit larger organizations like Panera, who already have the technology in place.\"\nToday, it\u2019s a touch screen so you can place your order directly to the kitchen from your table."}
