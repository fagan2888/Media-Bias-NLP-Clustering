Quarterly GDP growth in the April-June quarter was revised downwards to 0.5 percent, INE said, from an earlier reading of 0.6 percent.\n\nBut the country may not stay immune to the broader euro zone slowdown for long, and some economists believe the pace of Spain's recovery is weakening.\n\n\"In the fourth quarter, we foresee a small slowdown of one or two decimal points, to 0.3 or 0.4 percent,\" Jose Luis Martinez, analyst at Citi said.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah White and Robbie Hetz; Editing by Julien Toyer/Jeremy Gaunt)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Spanish consumer prices dropped for the fifth month running in November, adding pressure on stubbornly low inflation in the euro zone as a whole.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20141127&t=2&i=995053272&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXNPEAAQ0CN", "title": "Falling Spanish prices add to euro zone deflation pressure", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Finance", "sailthru.tags": "US, SPAIN, ECONOMY", "DCSext.ChannelList": "gc04;ousivMolt;FixedIncome;Deflation;Piracy;creditMarkets;rtsCiti;everything;treasuryMarkets;Schwab;Deals;forexNewsCopy;Shell;Amtrak;Davos;Amtrak2;yahoo3;Adfriendly1;echoActivityStream;Suntrust_SmallBiz;ShellEnergy;AllianzInvestments;FedExSMB;Hyundai;Goldman;everythingButHugin;OutloudFeed;chsenergy;chsgrains;chsfood;Allianz;JPMorgan;ssgabonds;sapawareness;sapawarenessbiz;sapawarenesslife;jpGambaroPeople;nyse;trending-hp;samsung;credit-rss;Pfizersafe;Davos2012;davosBackup;cfaglobal;merrilledge;aa48hours;ernstyoung;shipping;citianniversary;accenture;dassaultuk;VanessaTest;lyxor;greenpeace;MLGZero;fedex_neg;ubs;BNY;Bosneg;Intel;BNYForesight;PFG;TCS_IN;ABG_IN;GCA-Economy2010", "keywords": "US,SPAIN,ECONOMY,Europe,European Union,Euro Zone as a Whole,Debt / Fixed Income Markets,Major News,Spain,Central Banks / Central Bank Events,Western Europe,Economic Events,Inflation,Economic Indicators,National Government Debt", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "DCSext.ContentID_GCA-Economy2010": "USKCN0JB0VF20141127", "description": "Spanish consumer prices dropped for the fifth month running in November, adding pressure on stubbornly low inflation in the euro zone as a whole.", "WT.cg_n": "Finance -
