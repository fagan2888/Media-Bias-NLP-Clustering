The city argued UPMC did not meet the requirements of an \u201cinstitution of purely public charity\u201d because it did not benefit enough of the city's poorest residents and was overly focused on its bottom line.UPMC fired back with a lawsuit of its own. But the two sides have since dropped the legal battle after Pittsburgh swore in a new mayor.Illinois has also aggressively pursued policies to define how not-for-profit hospitals and health systems can keep their exemption from taxes. The conversation intensified after Northwestern Prentice Women's Hospital in Chicago, Edward Hospital in Naperville and Decatur (Ill.) Memorial Hospital lost their property tax-exempt status in 2011 based on their low levels of charity care.Connecticut floated a bill last year that would require not-for-profit hospitals to pay property taxes. That legislation is still up in the air , but many state residents already have thrown their support behind it.\u201cThe truth is, nobody wants to pay taxes, but everybody wants services,\u201d Daryl Finizio, mayor of New London, Conn., told Connecticut legislators last March . \u201cThis bill would more equitably, more strongly and more stably fund the services that everyone, including our colleges and hospitals, want and need.\u201dBruce Hopkins, an attorney at Polsinelli specializing in tax-exempt organizations, said hospitals' tax exemptions are based on a \u201ctotally different rationale\u201d than those for insurers. Large hospitals have generally had more success defending their tax exemptions through vague community benefit reports and by setting up separate community foundations.Hopkins is uncertain how the loss of Blue Shield's tax exemption will spill over into the hospital sector. \u201cThis has come up over the years of whether the entity is exempt or acting too much like a commercial entity,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cThis (Blue Shield) development is not going to help, but it shouldn't be a direct correlation.\u201dThe Los Angeles Times on Wednesday reported Blue Shield lost its tax-exempt status. The California Franchise Tax Board made the decision in August, but the announcement was buried in the agency's \u201c revoked exempt organizations list .\u201d The CFTB did not comment further.Blue Shield, the third-largest health insurer in California by market share, has been criticized for extravagant executive pay and higher-than-necessary reserves to pay future claims. Blue Shield ended 2014 with $4.2 billion in its reserve \u201cstabilization fund\u201d in 2014. The company caps net income at no more than 2% of revenue.All Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association plans pay federal taxes, but they also have their own separate corporate tax rules , which amount to hundreds of millions of dollars in special tax breaks. Many, like Blue Shield of California, are exempt from state income taxes, making California's move noteworthy for other not-for-profit health insurers that face regulatory scrutiny over how well they are protecting their members.Follow Bob Herman on Twitter: @MHbherman", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "A recent revocation of Blue Shield of California's not-for-profit tax status raises questions of whether insurers and not-for-profit providers are doing enough to keep irate taxing bodies from following California's lead.", "title": "Blue Shield's lost tax exemption shines spotlight on not-for-profits", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "A recent revocation of Blue Shield of California's not-for-profit tax status raises questions of whether insurers and not-for-profit providers are doing enough to keep irate taxing bodies from following California's lead.", "title": "Blue Shield's lost tax exemption shines spotlight on not-for-profits", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150318/NEWS/150319891", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "A recent revocation of Blue Shield of California's not-for-profit tax status raises questions of whether insurers and not-for-profit providers are doing enough to keep irate taxing bodies from following California's lead.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "title": "Blue Shield's lost tax exemption shines spotlight on not-for-profits", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2015-03-18", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150318/NEWS/150319891", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfca\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis (Blue Shield) development is not going to help, but it shouldn't be a direct correlation.\u201dThe Los Angeles Times on Wednesday reported Blue Shield lost its tax-exempt status.\nBlue Shield ended 2014 with $4.2 billion in its reserve \u201cstabilization fund\u201d in 2014.\n\"The (California Franchise Tax Board) decision has no bearing on our ability to continue to meet the needs of our members and community,\" the insurer said.\n\u201cThis has come up over the years of whether the entity is exempt or acting too much like a commercial entity,\u201d Hopkins said.\nMany, like Blue Shield of California, are exempt from state income taxes, making California's move noteworthy for other not-for-profit health insurers that face regulatory scrutiny over how well they are protecting their members.Follow Bob Herman on Twitter: @MHbherman"}
