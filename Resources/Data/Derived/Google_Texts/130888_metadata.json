When Zito reminded Sestak of the military's ethics rules, she says the Democratic hopeful responded, \"Mmmm. Send us something on that, would you?\"\n\nThe rest of the day's news starts now.\n\nSpeaking of Joe Sestak, he's mostly unknown to Pa. voters in this week's Franklin & Marshall College poll, PoliticsPA reports.\n\nPaycheck Protection gone wild? State Sen. Don White, R-Indiana, is circulating a gag bill that would require political dues to be deducted from Senate employees' paychecks and deposited into Senate GOP campaign coffers, The PAIndependent reports.\n\nSEPTA will run anti-Islam ads, because free speech (ugh), PhillyMag reports.\n\nThe Philly School Reform Commission is gunning for a nearly $3 billion budget for the coming year, PhillyMag also reports.\n\nApril Fool's a bit early, continued: Philly Mayoral candidate Doug Oliver has released a gag poll, trolling rival Lynne Abraham, who released a poll showing her winning, BillyPenn reports.\n\nThe number of schoolkids opting out of standardized tests has quadrupled in the last three years, WITF-FM reports.\n\nAn independent expenditure group backing Philly mayoral candidate Tony Williams is dropping $500k on an ad campaign, WHYY-FM reports.\n\nThe U.S. House has approved a long-term fix for Medicare payments to physicians, The Morning Call reports.\n\nU.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., will not seek re-election, Politico reports.\n\nTo balance budgets, some state governments are cutting higher education, Stateline.org reports.\n\nThe National Journal goes inside Jeb Bush's \"stealth\" campaign to woo Christian conservatives.\n\nWolfWatch.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf keeps his budget cavalcade going today with a 9:45 a.m. stop at Cedar Crest High School in Lebanon (Yes, they have one too) and a 2 p.m. stop at a plastics firm in Scranton.\n\nYou Say It's Your Birthday Dept.\n\nBest wishes go out this morning to our PennLive colleague David Wenner and to lobbyist Dan Hayward. Congrats, gents.\n\nHeavy Rotation.\n\nIf you love Joy Division (and we do) and love The Teletubbies (which some of you might), this is the best thing you will see today.\n\nFriday's Gratuitous Baseball Link.\n\nAlas, the Os dropped a 6-4 decision to Detroit on Thursday. Win some, lose some.\n\nAnd now you're up to date.
