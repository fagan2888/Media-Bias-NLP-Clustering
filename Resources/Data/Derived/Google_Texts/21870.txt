CHICAGO — Oprah Winfrey is selling the furniture, artwork, household items and clothing that once filled her Chicago home.

In the market for size 10 yellow patent leather designer shoes? How about a hand-painted porcelain soup tureen valued at $6,000 to $8,000?

More than 500 items with price points from $50 to $120,000 are going on the auction block Saturday.

The low estimate for everything in the sale is about $800,000. Colleen Gleason, director of estates and appraisals at Leslie Hindman Auctioneers, says there’s no upper limit on the bidding.

Proceeds will benefit the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy Foundation.

Winfrey announced last month that she’s closing Harpo Studios in Chicago, where she made “The Oprah Winfrey Show.” She’s transitioning production for her cable network to a studio in California.
