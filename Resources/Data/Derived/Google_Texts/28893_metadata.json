And he just can\u2019t stand it anymore.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that \u2018hate\u2019 is the right word,\u201d Rubio said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated.\u201d\n\nThis year, as Rubio runs for president, he has cast the Senate \u2014 the very place that cemented him as a national politician \u2014 as a place he\u2019s given up on, after less than one term. It\u2019s too slow. Too rule-bound. So Rubio, 44, has decided not to run for his seat again. It\u2019s the White House or bust.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate. I am not running for reelection,\u201d Rubio said in the last Republican debate, after Donald Trump had mocked him for his unusual number of absences during Senate votes.\n\nFive years ago, Rubio arrived with a potential that thrilled Republicans. He was young, ambitious, charismatic, fluent in English and Spanish, and beloved by the establishment and the tea party.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, who's running for president in 2016, is known for his stances on immigration and tax reform.

(Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nBut Rubio had arrived at one of the least ambitious moments in Senate history and saw many of his ideas fizzle. Democrats killed his debt-cutting plans. Republicans killed his immigration reform. The two parties actually came together to kill his AGREE Act, a small-bore, hands-across-the-aisle bill that Rubio had designed just to get a win on something.\n\nNow, he\u2019s done. \u201cHe hates it,\u201d a longtime friend from Florida said, speaking anonymously to say what Rubio would not.\n\nWhich makes for an odd campaign message.\n\nRubio must convince voters that his decision to leave the Senate \u2014 giving up the power he already has \u2014 is actually a mark of character, a sign that he is too dedicated to public service to stay.\n\nRubio is not a quitter, the argument goes.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s precisely why he\u2019s quitting this place.\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be doing what he\u2019s doing now if he were a quitter,\u201d said Norman Braman, a Florida auto dealer and one of Rubio\u2019s longtime donors.\n\nWatch Marco Rubio during a West Miami City Commission meeting in 1999. It was his first job as a public official. (The Washington Post)\n\n[The story behind Marco Rubio\u2019s frustrating first job as a politician]\n\nLast week was \u2014 by Rubio\u2019s standards \u2014 a very busy week in the Senate.\n\nOn Tuesday, he cast a vote, his first in 26 days. He gave a floor speech, his first in 41 days. In the speech, he asked the Senate to pass a bill that would give Department of Veterans Affairs leaders more power to remove poor-performing employees. But it didn\u2019t happen. To pass something so suddenly, Senate rules required that every single senator agree. A Democrat, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), objected that Rubio\u2019s bill did not allow workers due process.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we will not be able to move forward on this today, it appears,\u201d Rubio said, as his gambit failed. With that, he was done for the week, missing the next three votes.\n\nImpatience had been a hallmark of Rubio\u2019s career, for good and ill. Even in his first elected office, as a young city commissioner in West Miami, Rubio had been exasperated by how slowly his colleagues worked.\n\nIn this case, his decision to give up his Senate seat in 2016 was, in some ways, forced upon him.\n\nThe state\u2019s election filing deadlines might have allowed him to test the presidential waters and then \u2014 if he failed \u2014 drop out and run for reelection as a backup plan. But even that Plan B was far from a sure thing. Rubio would be facing an expensive campaign in a competitive state, having already made clear that the Senate race was his second choice.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Rubio comes under attack from rivals who say he\u2019s become an absentee federal employee. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, in a less-than-subtle knock on his former homestate ally, has said senators who miss work should have their pay docked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just, kind of, like, dude, you know, either drop out or do something,\u201d Bush\u2019s son, Jeb Bush Jr., told New York University College Republicans earlier this month, in comments first reported by Politico Florida. The junior Bush, a Floridian, cast himself as an aggrieved constituent. \u201cWe\u2019re paying you to do something, it ain\u2019t run for president.\u201d\n\nRubio waves off the criticism, saying his rejection of the Senate is all about finding a better way to serve all Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not missing votes because I\u2019m on vacation,\u201d he told CNN on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m running for president so that the votes they take in the Senate are actually meaningful again.\u201d\n\nAsked about his absences recently by Matt Lauer on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d Show, Rubio said: \u201cMy ambitions aren\u2019t for me. My ambitions are for the country, and Florida.\u201d If he is elected to the White House, he added, \u201cwe can begin to fix some of these issues that I\u2019ve been so frustrated we\u2019ve been unable to address during my time in the Senate.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Post, Rubio was asked to go further. What if he didn\u2019t see an opportunity for himself in the presidential race? Would he run for reelection, if the Senate was all he had?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nTo understand how Rubio got to this point, The Post interviewed him, his friends and his staffers, and examined his nearly five-year-old Senate record \u2014 votes, speeches, legislation and committee hearings.\n\nIt is clear that Rubio\u2019s frustration started early.\n\n\u201cDo we just stand around and do nothing?\u201d Rubio said on the Senate floor in November 2011. \u201cOr do we actually begin to act?\u201d\n\nThat was 10 months in.\n\nRubio had arrived in January, after a stunning defeat of Charlie Crist, Florida\u2019s sitting governor. Rubio had previously held the job of Florida House speaker, which had put him in the middle of one legislative fight after another.\n\nHe was used to action.\n\nBut in Washington at that point, action was not an option. The House had been taken by Republicans. Democrats still had the Senate. And those Democrats \u2014 who\u2019d previously passed huge bills on Wall Street reform, health care and financial stimulus \u2014 saw little upside to crafting new, complicated bills. That might force vulnerable Democrats to take votes that could be used against them. And, if they did, the House would probably kill the bills anyway.\n\nSo the Senate fell into a bitter somnolence, interrupted by moments of panic.\n\nIt mainly took action when Congress\u2019s gridlock threatened to shut down the government or cause a national default. In Rubio\u2019s first two years, the Senate held just 486 recorded votes. That was the fewest in 20 years, according to the publication Vital Statistics on Congress.\n\nRubio had proposed an ambitious freshman agenda: cutting spending, rolling back EPA rules in Florida, even a clever legislative trolling effort to cut the money for signs that said this-and-such project was bankrolled by President Obama\u2019s stimulus bill.\n\nAll failed. Rubio\u2019s only successful bill that year was one to name September as National Spinal Cord Injury Awareness Month.\n\nSo, 10 months in, Rubio and Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) unveiled an idea for a fail-proof bill. They assembled 10 job-growth ideas that were effectively pre-chewed: They were known to be bipartisan and uncontroversial. The AGREE Act.\n\n\u201cIt went nowhere,\u201d said one former Rubio staffer.\n\nRubio\u2019s staff blamed its failure on the Republicans and Democrats on the Finance Committee, which had jurisdiction over the bill but ignored it.\n\nIn December of that year, a Florida reporter asked Rubio about the highlights of his first year in office.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of a single real high point,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nIn his second year, Rubio had better numbers. He got four bills through the Senate. But all were symbolic resolutions, including such controversial items as \u201cA resolution congratulating the Miami Heat for winning the National Basketball Association Championship.\u201d\n\nIn his third year, however, it appeared that Rubio\u2019s moment had finally come.\n\nHe joined a bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d that negotiated a massive immigration-reform effort. He argued with talk-radio hosts, trying to sell conservatives on a plan that would give illegal immigrants a path toward citizenship.\n\nThen, when the bill came to the Senate floor, Rubio gave the speech of his career. He used his own parents\u2019 story: They emigrated from Cuba and worked as a bartender and a maid while Rubio was growing up. He talked about the American dream \u2014 and how immigrants treasure it and nurture it.\n\n\u201cHere in America, those who once had no hope will give their kids the chance at a life they always wanted for themselves. Here in America\u201d \u2014 he tapped the lectern \u2014 \u201cgenerations of unfulfilled dreams will finally come to pass. And that\u2019s why I support this reform,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nThe bill passed, giving Rubio the kind of victory that most freshman senators could only dream of.\n\nFor a moment, it also seemed to validate his strategy of working within the slow-moving Senate\u2019s limitations. Two freshmen with presidential ambitions \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul (Ky.) and Ted Cruz (Tex.) \u2014 had rejected that go-along strategy and instead used marathon speeches and other tactics to stop the system in its tracks.\n\nBut soon, Rubio\u2019s moment was over.\n\nThe House Republicans didn\u2019t move on immigration. Rubio didn\u2019t push them. Then, Cruz seized the spotlight, as he started a parliamentary game of chicken that ended with a government shutdown.\n\nAfter that, friends and staffers started to see something different in Rubio. There was a new level of frustration and a new sense that he was looking beyond the place. In his Senate floor speeches, Rubio talked often about his family\u2019s humble backstory. In late 2013 and 2014, he told the Senate six different times that his father had been a bartender.\n\nHis colleagues already knew, of course. But Rubio was aiming at people who didn\u2019t know \u2014 people on the other side of a TV camera.\n\nIn the past couple of years, some of Rubio\u2019s other policy ideas have actually become law.\n\nHis Girls Count Act, which prods developing countries to register girls\u2019 births and give them greater property rights, became law on his second try. His idea to allow the VA administrator greater freedom to fire incompetent leaders also became law, tucked into a larger bill.\n\nBut it\u2019s also been clear that Rubio\u2019s ambitions were aimed elsewhere.\n\nHe began missing votes. He skipped 10 percent of them in 2014 \u2014 making him one of the most absent senators, with the 88th-best attendance record, according to statistics kept by GovTrack.us. He began missing committee work, even on the subject he most identified with. In 2014, Rubio missed 34 of 68 committee hearings and meetings in the Foreign Relations committee, according to his office\u2019s tally.\n\nWhen Rubio tells the story of his career, the moment that he gave up on the Senate does not come until later.\n\n\u201cFor two years, we just tried to slow-dance and wait for the 2012 election,\u201d in the hopes of winning a Republican majority, Rubio said. \u201cAnd then, when that didn\u2019t work out, we spent two years trying to position ourselves for \u201914.\u201d\n\nThen Republicans did win a majority that year. But, Rubio said, he was still told to be patient. The majority was still too small to overcome Democratic filibusters or override presidential vetoes.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s [2015], and the argument is, \u2018We\u2019ve gotta wait to elect the president,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nThat meant the same frustrations, under a new boss.
