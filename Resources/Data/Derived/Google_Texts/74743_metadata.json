The study, led by Peter Horvath, is the first to look at how plant-based glucose can help stabilize human blood sugar. \u201cOur results indicate that the consumption of mushrooms could be useful in regulating glucose levels,\u201d Horvath, who is an associate professor in the Department of Exercise and Nutrition Science at UB, said in a news release. \u201cThis alone may benefit individuals attempting to lose weight and exercise longer.\u201d\n\nMushrooms contain a phytonutrient component as well as the antioxidant ergothioneine \u2014 a plant-based amino acid \u2014 which together protect against tissue damage and can normalize your blood sugar in less than 30 minutes. Given our sugar- and fat-rich Western diet, especially in America, our bodies are often unable to process the large amount of sugar we consume \u2014 turning it into fat, and ultimately causing chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity. So if mushrooms and other plant-based solutions can help normalize that blood sugar, the authors believe they might be onto something. \u201cThe results were quite rapid,\u201d Horvath told The Daily Beast. \u201cIf you could have a mushroom granola bar a half-hour before you work out, well, that would be ideal.\u201d\n\nThe researchers reviewed eight men and 10 women who were aged 19 to 29, and analyzed their body fat as well as fasting glucose levels. Researchers had participants consume sweet drinks, some of which contained Portabella powder and others with none. They found that particularly for young, healthy females, the mushroom powder reduced insulin and glucose levels. Horvath notes that it\u2019s possible to add Portobello powder into smoothies or drinks in order to reap its benefits.\n\nPortobello mushrooms are fat-free and have very few calories, so overall they\u2019re an excellent addition to your diet. They are packed with nutrients, such as selenium, copper, and niacin \u2014 as well as vitamin D, fiber, and protein.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "portobello mushrooms, mushroom health benefits, weight loss", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Mushrooms have been shown to be effective in weight loss \u2014 particularly for women \u2014 due to their ability to normalize blood sugar levels.", "title": "Why Mushrooms Are Magic For Helping You Lose Weight", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mushrooms-weight-loss-portobello-mushrooms-stabilize-blood-glucose-levels-help-women-lose-weight", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/portobello-mushrooms.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mushrooms have been shown to be effective in weight loss \u2014 particularly for women \u2014 due to their ability to normalize blood sugar levels.", "title": "Why Mushrooms Are Magic For Helping You Lose Weight", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mushrooms-weight-loss-portobello-mushrooms-stabilize-blood-glucose-levels-help-women-lose-weight", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/portobello-mushrooms.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/22/portobello-mushrooms.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-22T14:59:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-22T15:18:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Mushrooms have been shown to be effective in weight loss \u2014 particularly for women \u2014 due to their ability to normalize blood sugar levels."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf573\"", "article_summary": "The study, led by Peter Horvath, is the first to look at how plant-based glucose can help stabilize human blood sugar.\nA preliminary study out of the Department of Nutrition Science at the University of Buffalo shows that Portobello mushrooms in particular are effective in helping women lose weight by monitoring blood sugar levels.\nSo if mushrooms and other plant-based solutions can help normalize that blood sugar, the authors believe they might be onto something.\nThey found that particularly for young, healthy females, the mushroom powder reduced insulin and glucose levels.\n\u201cOur results indicate that the consumption of mushrooms could be useful in regulating glucose levels,\u201d Horvath, who is an associate professor in the Department of Exercise and Nutrition Science at UB, said in a news release."}
