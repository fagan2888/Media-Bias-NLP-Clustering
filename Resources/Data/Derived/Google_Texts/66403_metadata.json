That means you can expect long hours and a flurry of activity this week on Jones Street.\n\nHere are just a few of the stories we\u2019ll be watching:\n\nE nvironmental Policy Reform \u2013 The NC House is slated to vote tonight on House Bill 795 \u2013 State Environmental Policy Act Reform. This bill would severely undermine the state Environmental Policy Act (referred to as SEPA). As the Environmental Defense Fund notes under HB 795, \u201creview would only be required for projects that cost at least $20 million in taxpayers\u2019 dollars or that result in permanent changes to more than 20 acres of state-owned land. This would significantly limit the number of projects that require environmental review under state law, even if tens of millions in state tax dollars are being spent.\u201d\n\n(The House meets at 5:30pm this afternoon if you want to contact your representative about the bill.)\n\nGot Milk? Powdered Alcohol? How about your flu shot? \u2013 \u2014 More than a dozen bills are on the agenda for the House Health Committee this afternoon. Among the more interesting:\n\n* Got Natural Milk. (H309) \u2013 allowing the dispensing of raw milk and raw milk products\n\n* Prohibit Powdered Alcohol. (H290) \u2013 making it unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell, transport, import, deliver, furnish, purchase, consume, or possess powdered alcohol\n\n* Pilot Project/Used Needle Disposal. (H712) \u2013 directs the SBI to establish a used needle and hypodermic syringe disposal pilot program to reduce the spread of HIV, AIDS, and other bloodborne diseases\n\n* Require Hospitals to Offer Influenza Vaccine.(H925) \u2013 requires each hospital prior to discharging a patient 65 years of age or older a flu shot\n\nMembers of the Senate Health Care Committee will consider legislation on Monday to prohibit children under the age of 18 from using tanning bed equipment. The Jim Fulghum Teen Skin Cancer Prevention Act (Senate Bill 125) is intended to honor the former Wake County state representative and neurosurgeon.\n\nA similar bill passed the House in 2013 only to die in the state Senate.\n\nReligious Freedom returns \u2013 House Speaker Tim Moore says the Religious Freedom bills are dead for the session but that\u2019s not stopping church groups, Bible study groups, and other conservative organizations from converging on Raleigh Tuesday for the Religious Freedom Day of Action.\n\nMembers will start their day at 9:00 a.m. at the Office of Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, 310 N. Blount Street, Raleigh.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting as they\u2019re voicing support for RFRA legislation, the nation\u2019s highest court will hear oral arguments Tuesday over same-sex marriage. Specifically, the justices will be considering the constitutionality of state bans on same-sex marriage and state refusals to recognize existing same-sex marriage. A decision in this long-awaited challenge is not expected until June.\n\nCurtailing Teachers\u2019 Political Activities \u2013 Also on Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary I Committee will further discuss Senate Bill 480. This bill that passed the Senate Education Committee last week prohibits teachers from campaigning for a candidate during the school day and from using a school\u2019s computers or telephones for campaigning.\n\nLegislative staff may have more details on some of the questions they couldn\u2019t fully answer last week.\n\nInterested in going? The committee meets at 10:00 a.m. in Room 1027/1128 of the Legislative Building.\n\nBig, bad bobcats \u2013 On the lighter side, legislators will discuss this afternoon whether the bobcat should officially be named the state cat. Bobcats, which can weigh up to 40 pounds, can be found throughout North Carolina, especially in the wooded habitats of the coastal plain and the mountains.\n\nThe House Wildlife Resources Committee will vote on House Bill 161 today at 5:00 p.m.\n\nAnd perhaps fittingly, members will also discuss legislation (House Bill 460) requiring individuals to report incidents involving injuries inflicted on humans by domestic or wild animals. (Note to self: Don\u2019t try to pet the official state cat.)", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec71\"", "article_summary": "Curtailing Teachers\u2019 Political Activities \u2013 Also on Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary I Committee will further discuss Senate Bill 480.\nThis bill would severely undermine the state Environmental Policy Act (referred to as SEPA).\n(H309) \u2013 allowing the dispensing of raw milk and raw milk products* Prohibit Powdered Alcohol.\nHere are just a few of the stories we\u2019ll be watching:E nvironmental Policy Reform \u2013 The NC House is slated to vote tonight on House Bill 795 \u2013 State Environmental Policy Act Reform.\nThe Jim Fulghum Teen Skin Cancer Prevention Act (Senate Bill 125) is intended to honor the former Wake County state representative and neurosurgeon."}
