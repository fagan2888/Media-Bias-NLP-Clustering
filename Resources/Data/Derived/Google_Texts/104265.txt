Police training will be a major focus of the Justice Department in the year ahead, as it looks to avoid more incidents like what happened in Ferguson, Mo., last year, where a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black man.

The DOJ is requesting $97 million for police reforms that will expand training and promote the use of body cameras.

Addressing the immigration case backlog will also be a top priority for the Justice Department, as it looks to push more than 30,000 unaccompanied children who crossed the border through the legal system.

The DOJ's Office of Immigration Review is requesting $482 million to hire another 55 immigration judges to help reduce the backlog of cases and to provide legal representation to these unaccompanied children. This is an increase of 25 percent from the current year.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department is requesting $200 million in cybersecurity funding aimed at helping law enforcement detect and deter cyberattacks.
