He who controls the information, as Microsoft, Apple and Google have proven, controls the cash flow. What\u2019s new, however, is that the latest battlefield in the information age isn\u2019t to be found in your computer or even your cherished cellphone, but underneath the hood of your car.\n\nAutoblog.com recently revealed that the Auto Alliance \u2014 one of the industry\u2019s main lobbying arms \u2014 is trying to prevent owners, the Do-It-Yourselfers of backyard legend, from tinkering with their cars. By considering the car as a \u201cmobile computing device\u201d under the 1996 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), automakers are contending that allowing consumers and third parties to repair/alter the computational/information systems of their cars is not only unsafe, but violates their copyright protections. Essentially, the automakers are saying \u201cwe own the rights to the software, we don\u2019t think you\u2019re smart enough to fix it, so only we \u2014 or somebody we designate \u2014 should be allowed to work on your automobile.\u201d\n\nOstensibly, the target is the traditional shade-tree mechanic, the automakers reasoning that modern automotive computer software is simply too complicated to allow amateurs to futz with. Steering, braking and even throttle inputs are too important to the common good, the Alliance of Global Automakers positing that allowing the open manipulations of computer code could pose serious safety concerns.\n\nOil changes: DIY or leave it to the professionals?\n\nAs seemingly logical as the automakers\u2019 argument might be \u2014 who, after all, wants ham-handed Uncle Fester messing with the microchips controlling your airbags \u2014 many in the auto industry see this as just the OEMs latest ploy in trying to corner the auto repair market.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this has anything to do with Do-It-Yourselfers,\u201d said Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, Canada\u2019s leading industry analyst, noting that shade-tree repair is relatively inconsequential \u2014 less than 10% of the entire industry and almost none of it, in Canada at least, hardware or software related.\n\n\u201cThe target, really, is the independent auto repair industry,\u201d says DesRosiers. \u201cIn the United States, less than 25 per cent of all automotive repair is performed at an Original Equipment Service facility [namely a dealer], the vast majority of the work going to the aftermarket, namely chains like Walmart and traditional independent garages.\u201d (Here in Canada, the number is about 38 per cent of all automotive service.)\n\nThat\u2019s a profit centre the OEMs and their dealers would like to capitalize on, especially as the profit margins on the showroom floor dwindle. \u201cAutomakers have figured out that there is less money than ever in new-car sales,\u201d says Andrew Ross, publisher of the repair trade journal Jobber News and AutoServiceWorld.com. \u201cThe real money is in repair.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an imbalance that is only likely to grow because, as DesRosiers notes, consumers are keeping their cars longer, therefore spending less (relatively) on new-car purchases and more on repairs. Making matters worse for the OEMs is that the longer someone keeps their car, the less likely they are to return to the dealer for service.\n\n\u201cMany older cars are now on their third or fourth owner who simply can\u2019t afford the floor rate dealers charge,\u201d notes DesRosiers. Indeed, while 80 to 90 per cent of all automotive service is performed at an OEM dealer during the first four years of ownership, that percentage quickly decreases after the warranty expires.\n\nAlso read: 7 of the worst things you can do to damage your car\n\nFewer than 10 per cent of cars eight years old see the inside of a dealer\u2019s service bay and that is, according to DesRosiers\u2019 latest statistics, less than half way through a modern automobile\u2019s expected lifespan (the average car in Canada is now expected to last an incredible 20 years). As the OEM\u2019s accountants have no doubt already figured out, that\u2019s a lot of money to be leaving on the table.\n\nFor its part, the Auto Alliance would only say \u201cautomakers are committed to ensuring that dealers, independent repair professionals, and consumers will always have access to all needed information and tools to diagnose and repair vehicles.\u201d But Ross says the Canadian Automotive Service Information Standard, hammered out in 2009 between automakers and the Automotive Industries Association of Canada, \u201ccan cost mechanics thousands of dollars to access and is far from complete.\u201d Most, says Ross, just employ the classic \u201cwork-arounds\u201d they\u2019ve always used to access the repair data they need.\n\nDIYers, meanwhile, may find the cost of repair information even more onerous. What 10 years ago might have been a one-time fee of less than $100 for the complete service information for their specific car, may now be a $1,000 annual subscription for the entire model lineup, some manufacturers now refusing to allow enthusiasts to buy individual service manuals.\n\nAnd the real motivation may not even be those highly prized ECUs themselves, but the information they contain. \u201cEven though the auto repair market is highly profitable, it is mature,\u201d explains Ross. \u201cBut the data all those computers collect is a new and, likely, huge profit centre.\u201d Being able to control the data detailing where and when you drive could be particularly profitable, the local Timmy\u2019s, for instance, willing to pay big bucks to have your car inform you that there\u2019s a special on extra-large double-doubles as you drive to work.\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s not a stretch to conclude that monetizing their cars\u2019 on-board data is the automakers\u2019 real motivation for demanding all these restrictions. According to Autoblog, General Motors is already claiming that continuing the exemptions under the DMCA could deal a \u201cserious, and potentially fatal, blow to the future of automotive telematics,\u201d the company saying it might even remove certain features from its OnStar telematics system.\n\n\u201cFollow the money,\u201d admonishes every great small-screen sleuth. In this case, the automakers\u2019 motive would seem to have little to do with the backyard mechanic they claim to be so concerned about. The real question is who is to be allowed to repair your car and, perhaps more importantly, who owns the information \u2014 cue Google-like profits \u2014 it produces. There\u2019s a lot of money riding on the answer.\n\nBlaming DIYers is a complete red herring\n\nAt first glance, the concept that automakers know best and tinkerers should not be allowed to play with computer code beyond their expertise might seem logical, but it\u2019s a red herring at best. The DIYers the automakers are railing against almost never reprogram the safety-related items in their cars. Virtually the entire aftermarket \u201cre-flashing\u201d industry is devoted to getting more power out of the engine, not disabling the anti-lock brakes. And what of systems \u2014 like the one I have in my motorcycle \u2014 that boost performance without altering the original source code? Modifying the fuel injection signal after it leaves the ECU means such systems are not altering the automaker\u2019s original software one iota. Besides, how can carmakers possibly claim to be faultless when giant General Motors couldn\u2019t even recognize that some relatively simple ignition switches were wonky. Nor is the industry\u2019s software faultless, Ross detailing many new cars, some barely five years old, \u201cthat have had to have their computers re-flashed five or six times to address drivability and emissions faults.\u201d So much for OEM infallibility!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Automakers are claiming digital copyright laws, which means you won't have the right to work on your own car", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Driving", "description": "Automakers are claiming digital copyright laws, which means you won't have the right to work on your own car", "title": "Will working on your own car mean breaking copyright\u00a0laws?", "url": "http://driving.ca/auto-news/news/motor-mouth-will-working-on-your-own-car-violate-copyright-laws", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://wpmedia.driving.ca/2015/04/diagnostic2.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=600&h=315&crop=1", "height": 774}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Automakers are claiming digital copyright laws, which means you won't have the right to work on your own car", "creator": "@drivingdotca", "url": "http://driving.ca/auto-news/news/motor-mouth-will-working-on-your-own-car-violate-copyright-laws", "image": "http://wpmedia.driving.ca/2015/04/diagnostic2.jpg?quality=70&strip=all&w=600&h=315&crop=1", "title": "Will working on your own car mean breaking copyright laws?", "site": "@drivingdotca", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The leading online destination for the latest automotive news, reviews, photos and video for Canadians.
