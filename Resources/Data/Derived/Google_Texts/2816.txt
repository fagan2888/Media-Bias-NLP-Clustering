Judd Apatow fake laughed in a photo with Obama so it would look like they were friends

Judd Apatow, the director of “Knocked Up,” and his wife, actress Leslie Mann, met President Obama earlier this year and they didn’t let the opportunity go to waste.

Apatow made the most of their brief photo op time during a fundraiser, first asking Obama to repeat some of the mean tweets he had read on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and then laughing hysterically about it for the actual photo.

“I wanted to get a good picture of us laughing because I knew if we were laughing, it would look like we were friends,” Apatow recounted during his own recent appearance on Kimmel. “…Nobody has ever had their ass kissed harder than that.”
