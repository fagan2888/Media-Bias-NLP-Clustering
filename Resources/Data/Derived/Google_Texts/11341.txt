An elderly Texas woman gave a burglar more than he bargained for, fighting off the man in a feisty attack, according to KHOU Jasper County.

Opal Phelps, 92, said she was awakened during the night by a masked intruder with strange requests, including a demand that she put on her shoes. She said she managed to foil him with a series of arguments, her Life Alert device and a bit of force before he made off with one of her favorite items.

“He tried to make me shut up, but he didn’t have no luck at it,” Phelps told KHOU. “He had a hold of my leg, trying to put them shoes on, and they hard to get on, and I just took my other foot and kicked him right in the face.”
