An Estill police officer was shot Friday during a confrontation with a suspect.

State Law Enforcement Division agents were notified around noon of the shooting and responded to the town in Hampton County, spokesman Thom Berry said.

Initial reports indicated that the officer had been talking with the suspect prior to the gunfire, Berry said.

A confrontation ensued after the officer approached the person. The suspect then pulled out a weapon and fired, shooting the officer in the neck, Berry said.

The officer, who never fired his own weapon, was transported to a Savannah hospital for treatment, Berry said.

The suspect was reportedly in custody Friday, but the person’s name and charges were not released.

Berry did not know the officer’s condition Friday night.
