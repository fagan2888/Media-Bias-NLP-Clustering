The president jokingly responded during a speech: \u201cSo sue me.\u201d\n\nThe Speaker has now acted on the threat, releasing a draft resolution authorizing the House of Representatives to sue the president for failing to enforce healthcare law as it was written.\n\nIn July 2013, the administration unexpectedly announced a one-year delay of the Obamacare provision that would mandate larger employers to provide coverage for their workers or pay hefty fines. That provision, originally supposed to take effect in 2014, was pushed back to 2015, then pushed back a second year for certain employers, according to the National Journal.\n\n\u201cIn 2013, the president changed the health care law without a vote of Congress, effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it,\u201d Boehner said in a statement. \"That\u2019s not the way our system of government was designed to work. No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own.\u201d\n\nThe House Rules Committee will debate the resolution next Wednesday, with Republicans expected to support it and Democrats likely to criticize the move as a political stunt that wastes time and money, according to The Blaze. It is expected to pass the House late next week.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said, this isn't about Republicans versus Democrats; it\u2019s about the Legislative Branch versus the Executive Branch, and above all protecting the Constitution,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThe Constitution states that the president must faithfully execute the laws, and spells out that only the Legislative Branch has the power to legislate.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, he said Obama has set a dangerous precedent of presidential power for future White House residents.\n\n\u201cIf this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well. The House has an obligation to stand up for the Legislative Branch, and the Constitution, and that is exactly what we will do,\u201d Boehner said.\n\nThe president lashed out against the resolution in a speech on the economy in Austin, Texas. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sue me for doing my job? Okay,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI mean, think about that. You\u2019re going to use taxpayer money to sue me for doing my job while you don\u2019t do your job.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest called the move \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is disappointing that Speaker Boehner and Congressional Republicans have decided to waste time and taxpayer dollars on a political stunt. At a time when Washington should be working to expand economic opportunities for the middle class, Republican leaders in Congress are playing Washington politics rather than working with the President on behalf of hardworking Americans,\u201d Earnest said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs the President said today, he is doing his job \u2013 lawsuit or not \u2013 and it\u2019s time Republicans in Congress did theirs,\u201d Earnest continued.\n\nJason Easley at the liberal newsletter PoliticusUSA called the move a \u201csad attempt to recapture the Republican magic of 2010.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoehner and friends failed to repeal the ACA, so they have created a distraction in the hopes that their supporters won\u2019t notice that they have been lied to for the last four years\u201d regarding their promise to repeal the law, Easley wrote. He also believes that Boehner just handed Democrats an issue to campaign on, and that they will be more fired up about the lawsuit than Republicans.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called the prospect of the lawsuit ridiculous, according to Fox News. \"I make of it as subterfuge,\" she said. \"They're doing nothing here. So they have to give some aura of activity.\"\n\nThe Republicans need \"adult in that room,\" she added.\n\nThe House as an entire institution has never sued the president for failing to enforce a law before, Vox reported.\n\n\"The closest was that the Senate Watergate Committee sued President Nixon to get the Watergate tapes,\" Professor Charles Tiefer of University of Baltimore law school, an expert on separation of powers, said.\n\nWilliam & Mary law professor Neal Devins concurred. \"There have been lawsuits between Congressional committees and high ranking executive officials over executive privilege claims,\" Devins told Vox, \"but I am unaware of anything precisely like this possible case.\"\n\nThe vast majority of previous suits by members of Congress against the president have been dismissed for lack of standing. Legal analysts are skeptical that this suit will be any different.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner plans to sue President Barack Obama over the president\u2019s use of executive actions to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare), the Ohio Republican announced Thursday.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner plans to sue President Barack Obama over the president\u2019s use of executive actions to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare), the Ohio Republican announced Thursday.", "title": "\u2018So sue me\u2019: Boehner acts on threat to sue Obama...over delays in Obamacare", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/29/fa/c0/00/22.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/171948-boehner-lawsuit-obamacare-implementation/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "Speaker of the House John Boehner plans to sue President Barack Obama over the president\u2019s use of executive actions to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare), the Ohio Republican announced Thursday.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/29/fa/c0/00/22.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Boehner recently penned an op-ed published to CNN.com, in which he expressed his reasoning behind a move to sue the commander-in-chief.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said, this isn't about Republicans versus Democrats; it\u2019s about the Legislative Branch versus the Executive Branch, and above all protecting the Constitution,\u201d Boehner said.\nThe vast majority of previous suits by members of Congress against the president have been dismissed for lack of standing.\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner plans to sue President Barack Obama over the president\u2019s use of executive actions to delay the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare), the Ohio Republican announced Thursday.\nThe House as an entire institution has never sued the president for failing to enforce a law before, Vox reported."}
