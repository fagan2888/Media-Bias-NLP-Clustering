COLESVILLE, N.Y. (AP) â€” Authorities say an Uber passenger who took the wheel while the driver slept later crashed the car while trying to elude police.

State police say 20-year-old New York City resident Juan Carlos hired the car in Philadelphia to take him 200 miles to central New York.

Police say the driver asked Carlos to take the wheel Saturday while he napped, and a trooper later clocked Carlos going 86 mph in a 65 mph zone on Interstate 81 near Binghamton.

When the real driver woke up and asked Carlos why he was driving so fast, Carlos told him it was because police were chasing them.

Carlos soon crashed. Both suffered minor injuries.

Carlos was charged with fleeing police and driving without a license. It wasn't clear if he has a lawyer.
