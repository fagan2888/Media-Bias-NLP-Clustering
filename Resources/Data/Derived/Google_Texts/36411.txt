After yesterday’s SCOTUS ruling on Obamacare subsidies, most weren’t expecting the Court to move to the Right on same-sex marriage, and they didn’t:

The decision makes same-sex marriage legal in all 50 states:

Per Kennedy, J.: 14th Amend. requires granting right to SSM and recognizing SSMs performed elsewhere. — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

However, Chief Justice John Roberts, who was the darling of the Left after yesterday’s Obamacare decision was announced, was one of four justices who voted against striking down same-sex marriage bans.

Didn't care about gay marriage before, I don't care now, but with this ruling what do Democrats run on now? Pretty much just socialism. — Derek Hunter (@derekahunter) June 26, 2015
