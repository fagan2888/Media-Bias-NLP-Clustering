In a report that surprises no one who shops for groceries, it was reported that a healthful diet—consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish and nuts—costs more than a typical diet of processed foods and grains.

According to CNN on Dec. 5, researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have determined a healthful diets cost $1.50 more per day than a diet consisting of processed foods. The motivation behind the study was that it has never been determined just how much more it would cost to eat well, according to the study’s lead author, Mayuree Rao.

The studies were done after the year 2000 and came from several different countries. Prices were adjusted for inflation and converted to international dollars. Prices were then evaluated on a per serving basis as well as price per 200 calories.

The food group that showed the largest price different was meat, with there being a 29-cent gap between the leaner cut of meat and a fattier cut.

CBS News notes that over a year’s time, eating well would cost $550 more. One of the study’s authors noted, “This would represent a real burden for some families, and we need policies to help offset these costs.”

However, he also notes that in comparison to the costs of treating chronic diseases that can result from poor eating habits, the cost of eating well is very small.
