In 2014, the use of heroin and other opioids killed 1,256 people in Massachusetts, an increase of 34 percent over 2013 and 88 percent over 2012.\n\nThe Gazette sought insights across several disciplines for a three-part report on the crisis and new ideas for responding to it. Read the first part, on the science of addiction, here.\n\n\n\nNo more business as usual. As the death toll from overdoses rages on, a coalition of voices ranging from law enforcement to public health to academia is pushing policymakers to support aggressive new steps to boost intervention, prevention, and treatment for heroin addiction.\n\nIt\u2019s a regional commitment with much wider resonance. Last week during a Boston event, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton joined Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh, himself a recovering alcoholic, to discuss strategies to halt the heroin epidemic.\n\nSimilarly, speaking Friday at a conference in Waltham on the public health and law enforcement response to opioid abuse, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch \u201981, J.D. \u201984, promised that the crisis is on the Obama administration\u2019s front burner. She noted a new plan to monitor the dispensing of prescription drugs, stepped-up federal interdiction of drug trafficking, and a heroin task force that will provide Congress with a far-reaching plan to curb distribution by year\u2019s end.\n\nBy and large, U.S. drug policy in the last 20 years has focused on disruption of the drug trade by law enforcement and punishment for users who commit crimes to support their habits. The surge of heroin overdoses across the country has prompted many police departments to reconsider how they deal with addicts. Once seen as a purely criminal problem, heroin addiction more and more is being treated as a medical issue, with police and prosecutors steering addicts into treatment rather than jail. Many public-safety officials now carry naloxone, an opioid antidote, to administer to addicts overdosing on the scene.\n\nEfforts around addiction research and prevention, however, receive far less attention and financial support. Some say that\u2019s because prevention hasn\u2019t shown meaningful results. Others say that effective prevention efforts have been stymied by insufficient funds and misspending on flawed initiatives.\n\nOf the tens of billions of dollars the United States spends annually to fight drug abuse, \u201conly 5 percent goes to prevent \u2014 and it\u2019s crazy because it should be 80 percent,\u201d said John R. Knight, an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and director of the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned in the last 10 years about human brain development has been astounding, and that\u2019s that the brain continues developing through age 25,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring this period, it\u2019s experiencing rapid growth and any kind of exposure to a psychotropic drug will influence the structure and function of the brain as it\u2019s developing, and the younger the age the exposure begins, the more profound the changes will be.\u201d\n\nAnnual screenings by pediatricians for alcohol, tobacco, and drug use during adolescence \u2014 when addiction usually takes root \u2014 can be \u201chighly effective\u201d in heading off future abuse, Knight said.\n\n\u201cThe question is, from a policy standpoint, where do you want to put your emphasis? Do you want your emphasis to be at the top of the cliff, preventing people from joining the flow of lemmings going over, or do you want to be at the bottom of the cliff picking up the carcasses and patching them?\u201d\n\nThe emphasis on treatment rather than prevention largely stems from the more tangible nature of treatment, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re preventing needless addiction and death, you can\u2019t count the numbers, you don\u2019t know how many you prevented from starting, and so it doesn\u2019t pull at your heartstrings in the same way\u201d that treatment success stories do.\n\n\u201cTreatment tends to be glaring and it\u2019s right in front of us, and we\u2019ve got to do something to stop the damage. People forget that for every one person who has a fatal overdose there are another hundred or thousand that are just starting to use,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be emphasis on prevention or we\u2019ll be doing cleanup forever.\u201d\n\nVicious cycles\n\nUntil very recently, the high cost of private treatment and the scarcity of state-provided beds have been significant barriers for addicts seeking help. But new changes to national health care laws are beginning to make some inroads.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion, between them, paired with the [Mental Health Parity Act] from 2008, represents the largest increase in financing for drug abuse treatment in the history of the country, and that is well timed for heroin, which is the one drug we have a treatment for,\u201d said Mark A.R. Kleiman, M.P.P. \u201977, Ph.D. \u201983, a specialist in drug abuse and crime control policy at UCLA\u2019s Luskin School of Public Affairs.\n\nDifficulty getting treatment combined with heroin\u2019s pernicious hold on users means that addicts often end up cycling in and out of the criminal justice system, committing nonviolent crimes such as burglary to support their habit, getting arrested, and then being placed on probation. When they re-offend or are caught using, most are given repeated warnings about jail time, a threat that rarely materializes, experts say.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, the criminal justice system has been completely backwards,\u201d said Kleiman. \u201cThey take heroin or other opiate abusers and they send them to drug-free counseling. There\u2019s a remarkably low success rate with that population. The standard of care scientifically is substitution, and yet most drug courts don\u2019t even allow methadone,\u201d even though it\u2019s proven to be effective, he said.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s long been known that many heroin users can control their addiction through medically assisted treatments of buprenorphine or methadone, those approaches are often \u201cunderutilized\u201d in favor of abstinence-based 12-step programs, said Knight.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons is that within the treatment industry you have a lot of counseling professionals who are themselves in recovery\u2026 and they\u2019re very well-intentioned, but some of them look at medication-assisted treatment as like a substitute addiction \u2026 and that\u2019s very unfortunate,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong the options now being used more aggressively in Massachusetts to help addicts is \u201cSection 35.\u201d Under state law, family members or law enforcement officials can seek to have users civilly committed if they are deemed out of control and refusing treatment. It\u2019s a strategy that has been around, but one that the state trial court system, which operates 22 drug courts, did not promote until the crisis onset.\n\n\u201cThat has become an increasing book of business for the [trial] court as families are encountering their kids that are so deeply involved with heroin,\u201d said Massachusetts Commissioner of Probation Edward Dolan. \u201cThey haven\u2019t committed a crime, but there\u2019s got to be some level of intervention. They\u2019re not going to go voluntarily and so they petition the court, and the court is ordering people into treatment.\u201d\n\nWhile the state Department of Public Health (DPH) maintains residential treatment beds, the trial court \u2014 which includes the probation department \u2014 is the pathway to half of the state-run beds. Dolan said the two agencies have been working closely during the crisis to better coordinate delivery of treatment and match addicts with available service options. The DPH conducts ongoing analyses of the state\u2019s flow capacity of addicts and treatment to help anticipate the heroin epidemic\u2019s scope, and directs resources to areas where they are most needed.\n\nGlimmer of HOPE\n\nOne experimental initiative that appears to offer great promise to chronic heroin users is Hawaii\u2019s Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE) program. Launched in 2004 to reduce methamphetamine use in Hawaii, it\u2019s a coercive approach being tested by the National Institute of Justice in four jurisdictions, including Massachusetts. The program requires addicts to submit to unannounced drug screenings twice a week under the strict direction of the Probation Department.\n\nAddicts must call in and if told to report, they must immediately appear to submit a urine sample that\u2019s tested for drugs. If they fail a test, don\u2019t show up, or are late for any reason, they are put in jail. So far, the program appears to reduce the number of days addicts spend behind bars and the number of repeat offenses. It shows signs of significantly curbing drug use much more effectively than standard treatment.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re late, you might spend the afternoon in the dock; if [a urine sample is] dirty, you\u2019re going to spend overnight in jail; if we chase you, you\u2019re going to spend a week in jail,\u201d said Dolan. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve observed site after site [is that] with the right kinds of controls \u2014 the randomized drug testing and the immediate response to noncompliance \u2014 it\u2019s stunning how people can stop.\u201d\n\nResults from the state\u2019s use of HOPE with high-risk offenders over the past 2\u00bd years support Dolan\u2019s sentiment. In Salem Superior Court, for example, 569 drug tests from April through June yielded only 44 positives, for a rate of 7.7 percent. In Worcester, 473 tests from May through Aug. 15 yielded 26 positives, a rate of 5.4 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stunning, it\u2019s stunning,\u201d said Dolan, who noted similar results in other courts around the state. He called this approach \u201cthe way to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turns out it\u2019s not the weight of the sanctions, it\u2019s the surety, it\u2019s the proportionality.\u201d\n\nKleiman, who is studying the efficacy of HOPE, which is based on pioneering research by criminologist David Kennedy, a former senior researcher and case writer at Harvard Kennedy School, agrees.\n\n\u201cThe problem with most drug abusers is not that people can\u2019t restrain themselves, it\u2019s that they can\u2019t restrain themselves today for a benefit that\u2019s indefinite and somewhere in the vague future,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re plenty capable of restraining themselves to not be in jail tomorrow night. And once you\u2019ve spent a year or so in your neighborhood not using, you\u2019ve got new habits.\n\n\u201cI think it will be the standard of care 10 years from now.\u201d\n\nStepped-up testing and the readiness to swiftly execute sanctions come with increased costs and demands on probation staffing and training, Dolan cautions. And it\u2019s not an approach that works for every addict \u2014 some need heavier interventions and greater accountability.\n\nBut he sees promise for this and other probation actions against the epidemic in new funding in the state court budget for mental health services and more specialty courts, and in the $27 million plan unveiled in June by Gov. Charlie Baker to bolster the state\u2019s capacity to treat heroin and opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all hinged on our ability to respond immediately,\u201d said Dolan. \u201cThat\u2019s all part of our social contract here. That\u2019s what makes it effective: There\u2019s a direct link between [an addict\u2019s] behavior and the system\u2019s response to it and it\u2019s guaranteed.\u201d\n\nThe third article in the series, on treatment and recovery, will appear next week.
