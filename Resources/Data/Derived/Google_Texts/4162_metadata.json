That would leave one of the nine seats on the court vacant for a full year or more, assuming even a relatively rapid confirmation of someone nominated immediately by President Obama\u2019s successor.\n\nSurprising as it was, McConnell\u2019s willingness to subject the court to a year of frequent 4-4 deadlocks \u2014 which could necessitate a re-argument of a case \u2014 is just another symptom of the overall dysfunction that virtually guarantees Washington will accomplish little or nothing in the next 12 months. That\u2019s because, of the three branches of the federal government, there are now two that appear likely to be be seriously hobbled until 2017.\n\nRelated: Republicans Gear Up for a Bitter Fight Over Scalia\u2019s Supreme Court Seat\n\nWith the Judicial branch in limbo, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan appeared on Fox News Sunday afternoon and said, in effect, that the Legislative branch isn\u2019t likely to get much done, either. He suggested that no progress is possible on issues including government spending, the national debt and the federal deficit while President Obama is in office.\n\nRyan laid out a five-point GOP agenda that includes, among other things, tax reform, energy development, regulatory reform, entitlement reform, repealing the Affordable Care Act (of course) and strengthening national security.\n\n\u201cWe don't think the nation's heading in the right direction, and we believe we owe it to our fellow citizens to offer an alternative,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had a pro-growth economic policy, there is no doubt in my mind that we could get this economy growing faster, people could get better jobs and get a rise in wages, but for our government. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to roll an agenda out there and give the country a choice.\u201d\n\nGiven the broad swathe of policy areas that Ryan wants to address, it\u2019s inconceivable that there aren\u2019t some areas of agreement, or at least principled compromise, where the White House and the Republican-controlled Congress could come together and strike a deal. But Ryan didn\u2019t even suggest the possibility of seeking common ground. Instead, he jumped straight to 2017.\n\nRelated: Why Paul Ryan\u2019s Budget Deal Could Go Down in Flames\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a president to sign bills into law,\u201d he told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, according to a transcript provided by his office. \u201cThat\u2019s why you need a new president. That\u2019s why we\u2019re putting an agenda out there in 2017 showing how we would do that. We\u2019ve passed five budgets that specifically show how we would balance the budget, how we would pay off the debt. We can do this, but you have to have a Republican president to do this, and that\u2019s the whole point of our agenda.\u201d\n\nOf course, President Obama has shown a willingness to sign compromise legislation when he gets it, often to the chagrin of his Democratic allies in and out of Congress. What Ryan is essentially saying here is not that progress \u2014 at least incremental progress \u2014 is impossible, but that he has no expectation of trying to achieve it. Evidently all that the GOP-controlled House will produce, at least this year, is maximalist GOP placeholder legislation \u2014 like ACA repeal \u2014 that gives Republicans everything they want and offers Democrats nothing in return.\n\nIt also means that American voters who might like to see progress on big issues like immigration reform, tax reform, the federal deficit, and really anything else of significance, also get nothing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With a deadlocked Supreme Court and a compromise-averse Congress, 2016 promises to be a year in which simply keeping the lights on will be a major accomplishment.", "title": "Two-Thirds of the US Government Basically Won\u2019t Work for the Next Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/15/Two-Thirds-US-Government-Basically-Won-t-Work-Next-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-11-20T232638Z_1_CBRE9AJ1T4H00_RTROPTP_2_USA-FISCAL-SHUTDOWN-SCENE.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/15/Two-Thirds-US-Government-Basically-Won-t-Work-Next-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2013-11-20T232638Z_1_CBRE9AJ1T4H00_RTROPTP_2_USA-FISCAL-SHUTDOWN-SCENE.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "With a deadlocked Supreme Court and a compromise-averse Congress, 2016 promises to be a year in which simply keeping the lights on will be a major accomplishment.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s because, of the three branches of the federal government, there are now two that appear likely to be be seriously hobbled until 2017.\nHe suggested that no progress is possible on issues including government spending, the national debt and the federal deficit while President Obama is in office.\nWe\u2019ve passed five budgets that specifically show how we would balance the budget, how we would pay off the debt.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re putting an agenda out there in 2017 showing how we would do that.\nIt also means that American voters who might like to see progress on big issues like immigration reform, tax reform, the federal deficit, and really anything else of significance, also get nothing."}
