Since Google began to release details about self-driving car accidents, reports from the Wall Street Journal, the RAND Corporation, and KPMG have all predicted a dramatic shrinking in the auto insurance industry.\n\nSo, to put this speculation into a concrete figure that most people would care about, the Ferenstein Wire asked the actuaries at insurance startup Metromile to take evidence from Google\u2019s detailed accident report and construct their own pricing model for self-driving cars.\n\nMetromile recently partnered with Uber to provide its drivers a special insurance deal. Since Uber is on record for wanting to replace its fleet with self-driving cars, Metromile will likely be among the first companies that must come up with pricing models at scale.\n\nModel Details\n\nThe insurance model is based on a 20-year-old single female in the San Francisco Bay Area, driving 12,000 miles per year. Most of the cost savings from self-driving cars come from the near elimination of accidental collisions (a 90 percent reduction).\n\nSo, why do we still need insurance if so few cars get into accidents?\n\nThe model estimates that some cars may be vandalized or broken into, which makes up much of the yearly insurance cost for autonomous vehicles. In the future, self-driving cars could just park themselves in a secure garage at night rather than waiting around while their owner sleeps or goes grocery shopping \u2014 making the price even cheaper.\n\nTo give readers some back-of-the-napkin estimates about how this might change the value of a car, here\u2019s an example: Over the lifetime of the car, assuming about $6,000 in total savings over 5 years, a self-driving Tesla Model III could be cheaper than a human-powered BMW 2 Series (~$36,000 vs. $37,000 for the BMW in total costs for each car).\n\n\u201cI would anticipate that in the short and medium term, claims are likely to gradually go down as crashes become less common,\u201d says James Anderson, a behavioral scientist at the RAND Corporation, who recently wrote about the long-term impacts of self-driving cars. The Ferenstein Wire asked Anderson and other experts to double-check the validity of Metromile\u2019s model.\n\n\u201cAt some point in the future, it is likely that we will get to 90% reductions in savings,\u201d he continuses, but images that such savings could be 10 or more years down the road when self-driving cars are near universal.\n\nSelf-driving cars are not yet legal, and state governments have been slow to permit them. Self-driving cars face roadblocks from cautious lawmakers and could, eventually, face hurdles from the auto industry.\n\nBut, if consumers know that such laws are costing them $1,000 a year, public pressure could accelerate their legal standing. Nothing gets voters more fired up than their pocket books.\n\n*For more stories like this, subscribe to the Ferenstein Wire newsletter here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Self-driving cars will save the average driver about $1,000 annually, or cost $250 a year total, according to estimates from Metromile.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Self-driving cars will save the average driver about $1,000 annually, or cost $250 a year total, according to estimates from Metromile.", "title": "How Much the Self-Driving Version of Your Car Will Save on Insurance - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/driverless-car-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/19/how-much-the-self-driving-version-of-your-car-will-save-on-insurance/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Self-driving cars will save the average driver about $1,000 annually, or cost $250 a year total, according to estimates from Metromile.", "creator": "@Ferenstein", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/driverless-car-AP.jpg", "title": "How Much the Self-Driving Version of Your Car Will Save on Insurance - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Auto Industry, Auto Insurance, Google, insurance, Metromile, self-driving cars, Uber,Big Government, Economics,self-driving", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Uber", "published_time": "2015-07-19T18:11:24-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRobotic self-driving cars have a near perfect driving record; thus far, when self-driving cars do get into accidents, it\u2019s because humans were responsible.\n(Ferenstein Wire) \u2014 Self-driving cars will save the average driver about $1,000 annually, or cost $250 a year total, according to estimates from auto insurance startup Metromile.\nModel DetailsThe insurance model is based on a 20-year-old single female in the San Francisco Bay Area, driving 12,000 miles per year.\nSelf-driving cars face roadblocks from cautious lawmakers and could, eventually, face hurdles from the auto industry.\nSelf-driving cars are not yet legal, and state governments have been slow to permit them."}
