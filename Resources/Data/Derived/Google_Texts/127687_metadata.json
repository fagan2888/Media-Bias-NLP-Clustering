And at the top of the agenda is the effort to take away health insurance from about 96,000 people in the state.\n\nArkansas\u2019 plan to expand Medicaid is currently on the chopping block, thanks to two key Republicans who say they oppose the policy. The state\u2019s expansion won federal approval last fall, and the upcoming political fight will have tangible consequences for the tens of thousands of people who have already signed up for health care. If lawmakers don\u2019t re-approve the Medicaid expansion during this fiscal session, those individuals will lose their new health plans by the end of June.\n\nLast year, Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe (D) figured out a way to extend health care to thousands of low-income residents by essentially striking a compromise between Republican lawmakers and the Obama administration. Arkansas accepted the federal money designated for states expanding Medicaid, but instead of using it to increase the Medicaid rolls, the funds went toward subsidies to help low-income people purchase private insurance. That compromise, which has been dubbed the \u201cprivate option,\u201d has served as an important model for other states where there\u2019s a lot of political opposition to the government health program. Conservative lawmakers in Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Utah have been inspired to pursue similar Medicaid expansion plans.\n\nBut now, the balance is shifting in Arkansas\u2019 GOP-controlled legislature, and the private option is in danger. Last month, Sen. John Cooper (R) won a special election after specifically campaigning on his opposition to the Medicaid expansion plan. Another Republican, Sen. Missy Irvin, recently changed her mind about the private option even though she supported it last year. That puts supporters of the plan down by one vote \u2014 and Democrats in the state are now worried that Medicaid expansion is \u201cdead on arrival\u201d in the legislature.\n\n\u201cIf we lose one or two votes, it\u2019s critical,\u201d Beebe explained to Kaiser Health News, pointing out that Arkansas needs approval from 75 percent of the members of both houses to pass appropriations measures.\n\nAside from the immediate ramifications for the Arkansas residents who will no longer be able to afford health insurance, the unfolding fight also threatens to jeopardize similar Medicaid compromises in other states. \u201cI do think it would have national repercussions if it were defunded,\u201d Joan Alker, who heads Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, told the Washington Post. \u201cI think a lot of it will come down to the perception why it happened and we\u2019ll just have to see how it plays out.\u201d\n\nBefore agreeing to the private option, Arkansas had one of the most restrictive Medicaid programs in the nation. A family of three with an annual income over $5,000 made too much money to receive assistance from the government program. And thanks to the state\u2019s uninsurance rate, the private option is actually a smart financial decision \u2014 extending insurance to additional low-income families is estimated to save Arkansas about $90 million dollars in uncompensated health care costs.\n\nAcross the country, stubborn resistance to Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion will have stark consequences, particularly in Southern states that already struggle with high rates of poverty and uninsurance. An estimated five million Americans will lack access to affordable health care unless their lawmakers reverse their decision about the optional Medicaid expansion. And a recent study conducted by Harvard researchers found that the GOP-led states refusing to expand Medicaid will ultimately contribute to up to 17,000 avoidable deaths.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "As Arkansas lawmakers reconvene this week, they're kicking off a battle over the state's Medicaid expansion with potentially huge consequences.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "As Arkansas lawmakers reconvene this week, they're kicking off a battle over the state's Medicaid expansion with potentially huge consequences.", "title": "Arkansas May Kick More Than 90,000 Low-Income People Off Of Their Health Insurance Plans", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/10/3271151/arkansas-medicaid-expansion-fight/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/medicaid-matters-e1360793840928.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Arkansas lawmakers reconvene this week, they're kicking off a battle over the state's Medicaid expansion with potentially huge consequences.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/medicaid-matters-e1360793840928-321x214.jpg", "title": "Arkansas May Kick More Than 90,000 Low-Income People Off Of Their Health Insurance Plans", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/medicaid-matters-e1360793840928.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/medicaid-matters-e1360793840928.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-10T12:17:49+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd45f4\"", "article_summary": "Health Arkansas May Kick More Than 90,000 Low-Income People Off Of Their Health Insurance Plans CREDIT:On Monday, the Arkansas legislature convened a new session focusing specifically on fiscal issues.\nAnd at the top of the agenda is the effort to take away health insurance from about 96,000 people in the state.\nAnother Republican, Sen.
