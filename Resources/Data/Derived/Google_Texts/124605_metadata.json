At one point, Kiedrowski says, she was \u201cdisciplined\u201d after a co-pilot complained about her using a breast pump.\n\nMaking matters worse, according to the lawsuit, Frontier policy dictates that pregnant pilots take eight weeks of unpaid leave before their due dates, with no option for paid reassignment; pilots are also allowed 120 days of unpaid maternity leave, but few can afford to take all of it. In short, the pilots claim, Frontier\u2019s policies caused them financial, emotional, and physical harm.\n\nThe movement to normalize pumping in the workplace has been frustratingly slow. The 2010 Affordable Care Act requires employers \u201cto provide reasonable break time\u201d for pumping as well as a dedicated place, \u201cother than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion,\u201d for mothers using a breast pump. But the ACA clause is riddled with loopholes depending on the size of the firm and type of employee, and many companies have found ways to disregard it.\n\nIn an infamous 2012 decision regarding a Houston mother who claimed her company fired her because she asked to pump breast milk at work, U.S. District Court judge Lynn Hughes rejected her claim, opining, \u201cFiring someone because of lactation or breast-pumping is not sex discrimination.\u201d (A higher court later overruled him.)\n\nAngela Ames, a Des Moines loss mitigation specialist, sued her firm when, on her first day back from maternity leave, she was denied access to a place to pump; after Ames had waited for five hours in escalating physical pain, according to her suit, the head of her department told her, \u201cI think it\u2019s best that you go home to be with your babies,\u201d and dictated her resignation letter. Sound like an open-and-shut case of pregnancy and sex discrimination? Nope: In a uniquely enraging 2014 decision, the Eighth Circuit threw it out.\n\nWe can all hope for better for the Frontier pilots, as well as for Mary Gonzalez, the California Marriott employee who sued after the company denied her breaks to pump milk on the basis that she was a gestational surrogate, not a mother. At a moment when a man who once called a lawyer \u201cdisgusting\u201d for requesting a break to pump milk is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, their victories would be all the sweeter.\n\nLakshmi Varanasi is a writer for Slate, where this article first appeared.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The movement to normalize pumping in the workplace has been frustratingly slow.", "og": {"description": "The movement to normalize pumping in the workplace has been frustratingly slow.", "title": "Lakshmi Varanasi: How companies ignore laws to support breastfeeding moms", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20160513-lakshmi-varanasi-how-companies-ignore-laws-to-support-breastfeeding-moms.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20160513-smart_spending_baby_food_14250032.ece/BINARY/original/SMART_SPENDING_BABY_FOOD_14250032", "height": 1234}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-05-13T17:55:37Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-05-13T15:08:29Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Lakshmi Varanasi: How companies ignore laws to support breastfeeding moms\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20160513-lakshmi-varanasi-how-companies-ignore-laws-to-support-breastfeeding-moms.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20160513-smart_spending_baby_food_14250032.ece/BINARY/original/SMART_SPENDING_BABY_FOOD_14250032\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2763333\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-05-13T15:08:29Z\", \"section\": \"Latest Columns\", \"author\": \"LAKSHMI VARANASI\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20160513-smart_spending_baby_food_14250032.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/SMART_SPENDING_BABY_FOOD_14250032", "publishtime": "2016-05-13T15:08:29Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "At one point, Kiedrowski says, she was \u201cdisciplined\u201d after a co-pilot complained about her using a breast pump.\nAt a moment when a man who once called a lawyer \u201cdisgusting\u201d for requesting a break to pump milk is the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, their victories would be all the sweeter.\nLakshmi Varanasi is a writer for Slate, where this article first appeared.\nIn short, the pilots claim, Frontier\u2019s policies caused them financial, emotional, and physical harm.\nBut the ACA clause is riddled with loopholes depending on the size of the firm and type of employee, and many companies have found ways to disregard it."}
