While they can buy health insurance with their own money, they are specifically excluded from receiving any benefits under the ACA. Community groups and non-profits in cities and towns across California work to fill in the gaps.\n\nOne of them is Graton, a small town in Sonoma County, about 20 miles west of Santa Rosa.\n\nWhen I arrive at the Graton Day Labor Center a woman named Maria is standing behind a table filled with containers of homemade food. There\u2019s oatmeal \u2014 with no added sugar, she tells me \u2014 tortillas and salsa, fish for tacos, and salad.\n\nMaria (because of her immigration status, we are not using her last name) is selling the food to laborers heading out to work for the day in agriculture, construction and hospitality. They\u2019re all members of the Day Labor Center which connects its members with employers and also does training and advocacy work. Maria makes nutritious food to try to keep her customers healthy. She clearly cares about good health, but she does not have health insurance.\n\nSpeaking in Spanish, she first jokes, \u201cI don\u2019t have insurance because I don\u2019t get sick!\u201d\n\nThen she explains the real reason. \u201cIt\u2019s because they won\u2019t accept me because I don\u2019t have social security,\u201d she says in reference to a Social Security number.\n\nMaria is undocumented, so she can\u2019t qualify for expanded Medi-Cal or sign up for Covered California.\n\n\u201cThis new Obamacare hasn\u2019t helped my situation at all,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen I ask what would happen if she got really sick, she laughs and holds up a little plastic container. \u201cI\u2019d pass a box around because I couldn\u2019t afford it.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not alone. Up to a million undocumented immigrants in California are expected to remain uninsured after the ACA is fully implementation in 2019.\n\n\u201cThat leaves a lot of low-wage workers without any health care coverage,\u201d says Jesus Guzman, an organizer with the Graton Day Labor Center. \u201cThat leaves a population very much vulnerable.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, State Senator Ricardo Lara proposed a bill which would give undocumented Californians access to expanded Medi-Cal and a dedicated insurance exchange with subsidies available, funded by the state. But the bill is currently on hold in the Senate appropriations committee. Lara\u2019s staff says they\u2019ll be back with another proposal next year. Given that, Guzman says preventive care makes the most sense for the uninsured undocumented immigrants. Access to services and resources can be a challenge.\n\n\u201cWhat we can do here is serve as a conduit between some of those (health) organizations and the folks that need them.\u201d\n\nGraton Day Labor partners with community health centers and hosts a physician\u2019s assistant once a week. They offer trainings in heart healthy practices, and provide job skill and safety education.\n\nBecause diabetes is a huge problem among Latinos, nutrition is another big push. Once a month, the Redwood Empire Food Bank drops off produce at the Graton Day Labor Center. Out of the back of a van, Morgan Smith unloads boxes heavy with lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, oranges, apples, and sweet potatoes. He also brings special boxes for diabetics.\n\n\u201cThis month the box has things like brown rice, dried black beans, high fiber cereal, canned tuna and canned chicken,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHealthy carbos, healthy fats, healthy proteins, about 25 pounds of shelf-stable food, which will hopefully help someone get through the month.\u201d\n\nSmith is also a registered nurse. He and a colleague set up tables in the center\u2019s parking lot. They give free diabetes screenings and share prevention information. Maria and her sisters get in line, and confer about their family health history. Maria holds out her finger for a blood sugar test.\n\nSmith tells Maria her results are normal, and then lets her know about two clinics near where she lives if she has any health needs.\n\nInside the center, Maria\u2019s sister, Flor, joins other members collecting produce. Like her sister, Flor is undocumented and uninsured. She says that if she got insurance tomorrow, she\u2019d go to the doctor and get check-ups for the whole family. She knows well that preventive care only goes so far.\n\n\u201cA while back my husband was injured in an accident at work,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd a bill came, oh my! He had only cut the tip of his finger off, and it cost $10,000.\u201d\n\nFlor says that eventually her husband\u2019s employer paid the bill, but only because her husband had worked for him for so long. Otherwise, she says, she doesn\u2019t know what they would have done.\n\nLisa Morehouse reported this story for the 2014 California Endowment Health Journalism Fellowship, a program of USC\u2019s Annenberg School for Journalism and Communication.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How undocumented immigrants manage health care since they are excluded from the ACA: not easily.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare No Help to Undocumented Immigrants\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/09\\/obamacare-no-help-to-undocumented-immigrants\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-09 01:02:25\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-09 14:18:00\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19440,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Diabetes\",\"Latino Health\",\"Undocumented Immigrants\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/06\\/P1040047.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "How undocumented immigrants manage health care since they are excluded from the ACA: not easily.", "title": "Obamacare No Help to Undocumented Immigrants", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/09/obamacare-no-help-to-undocumented-immigrants/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/P1040047-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "diabetes,latino health,undocumented immigrants", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f85\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019re all members of the Day Labor Center which connects its members with employers and also does training and advocacy work.\nWhile they can buy health insurance with their own money, they are specifically excluded from receiving any benefits under the ACA.\n\u2018That leaves a lot of low-wage workers without any health care coverage.\u2019Some of the people most likely to remain uninsured are undocumented Californians.\nShe clearly cares about good health, but she does not have health insurance.\n\u201cThat leaves a lot of low-wage workers without any health care coverage,\u201d says Jesus Guzman, an organizer with the Graton Day Labor Center."}
