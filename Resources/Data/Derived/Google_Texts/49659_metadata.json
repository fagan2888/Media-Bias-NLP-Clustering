Like their namesake, our Examiners\u2014a great group of top restructuring lawyers, financial advisers, investment bankers, investors and law professors\u2014will examine timely topics and share their insight, bringing light to complex and important issues.\n\nOver the coming months, we\u2019ll also encourage you, our readers, to weigh in and share your views as well. We want to launch a thought-provoking conversation, and we hope you\u2019ll join in.\n\nRead on to meet The Examiners and the first question they\u2019ll tackle. And check back later this month as we start posting their answers.\n\nQuestion: Interest rates that remain near zero and debt maturities that have been pushed out to 2017 and 2018 have helped drive Chapter 11 filings to historic lows.
