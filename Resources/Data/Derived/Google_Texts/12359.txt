Q: Is it true that licking cake batter off a spoon will give you salmonella poisoning?

A: Salmonella in eggs has always been rare, and it’s gotten even rarer.

Salmonella Enteritidis is the subtype of salmonella commonly responsible for salmonellosis, otherwise known as salmonella poisoning. Unfortunately, SE doesn’t produce any visible symptoms in hens, which means it can pass undetected until consumers start complaining of diarrhea and vomiting, sometimes so severe that they lead to hospitalization.

This is what happened in the 1980s, when egg-associated salmonella outbreaks in the northeastern United States killed dozens of people and sickened hundreds.

Following these outbreaks, egg producers started following protocols to prevent salmonella transmission and federal restrictions have recently gotten tighter.

But let’s say an infected egg does make it into your kitchen. If the egg is kept at or below 45 degrees, the salmonella bacteria will have no opportunity to grow. Most outbreaks are linked to restaurants where large quantities of eggs are mixed together and kept at unsafe temperatures.

Finally, even if that bacteria does end up in your mouth and stomach, it might not make you sick.

“Salmonella, like a lot of food-borne bacteria, are what we think of as opportunistic organisms, in that they really don’t compete very well with a lot of other bacteria and microbes that are not only in nature but also are in the human intestinal system,” says David McSwane, a retired public health professor at Indiana University.

So if you’re a reasonably healthy adult, you could probably depend on your microbiome to out-compete small quantities of SE and to prevent you from getting sick.
