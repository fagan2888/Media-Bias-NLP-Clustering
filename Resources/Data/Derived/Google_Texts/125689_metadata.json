The Oilers had a 11.5 percent chance to win the lottery, behind Buffalo (20 percent) and Arizona (13.5). The Sabres and Coyotes will pick second and third, respectively.\n\nThe Avalanche had a 3.5 percent chance to pick No. 1, among the 14 non-playoff teams. Plenty of impact players will likely be available at No. 10, including North American defensemen Ivan Provorov, Jakub Zboril, Thomas Chabot and Jeremy Roy of the Canadian Hockey League\u2019s major-junior system, and Zachary Werenski of the University of Michigan.\n\nThe top-rated North American defenseman is Noah Hanifin of Boston College, but the freshman will likely be among the top five picks.\n\nBuffalo will likely select Boston University center Jack Eichel with the No. 2 pick, and Arizona will get an outstanding player in Hanifan or major-junior center Dylan Strome.\n\nFirst 14 picks\n\n1.
