Huron, SD

With the draw of larger cities and online shopping, it can be difficult for business owners in rural communities to convince customers to shop locally.

Huron Chamber & Visitors Bureau tried meeting that challenge with a new promotion this holiday shopping season. It has seen success.

"We had a phenomenal response," Huron Chamber president Peggy Woolridge Besch said. "We had no idea it would be so well received."

Business owners and Chamber workers encouraged people to turn in receipts for products or services purchased within Huron during the holiday season. Submitted receipts of $25 or more earned buyers a chance to have their names placed in a box.

The Chamber drew from that box each week, giving away 100 dollar rewards. There will be a grand prize drawing next week.

Along with the incentives of the drawings, the Chamber also ran an educational campaign showing how local sales tax revenue is spent in the community. People handed in more than $3.5 million in receipts.

Cliff and Julee Hadley say the promotion seemed to make a difference at their Huron clothing store.

"We've been in business 25 years. We just had our third best Christmas ever, Christmas season and I'm a big believer that the Chamber promotion contributed to that," Cliff Hadley said.

Even though it can be a challenge to convince some to shop locally, Hadley says he wants to compete, not complain.

"But boy, those promotions on top of it really help out with that last little sprint," Hadley said.

The Chamber will draw its final name of the promotion on Monday. That person will choose one envelope from a group of 100. Ninety-nine of the envelopes will have a prize worth $1,000. The other will be worth $25,000.
