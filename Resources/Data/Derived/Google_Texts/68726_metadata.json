These stories begin in childhood and continue throughout life. I, for one, am lucky to have survived my own encounters with police and other security forces. Sandra Bland was not as fortunate.\n\nBland, as has now been widely reported, was driving from Chicago to Texas to take a dream job at her alma mater Prairie View A&M University. She changed lanes to allow a state trooper, Brian Encinia, to pass. Encinia decided to stop Sandra Bland for an \u201cillegal lane change.\u201d As recorded on Encinia\u2019s dashboard camera, the situation begins badly and ends even worse: Sandra Bland\u2019s basic questions about Encinia\u2019s behavior go unanswered. Encinia becomes agitated that she, a black woman, would dare question him. He orders Bland out of the car, then threatens to \u201clight her up\u201d with his taser.\n\nBy this point, Bland must be panic stricken; the state trooper throws her to the ground, assaulting her, injuring her arm and head. The videotape of the incident appears to be altered. The police report is vague and imprecise. Sandra Bland is dead three days later, supposedly hung, having committed suicide with the garbage bag used as a makeshift curtain for her jail cell. This is not a good death.\n\nResponsible black parents tell their children (and those others in their charge) about how to deal with America\u2019s police:\n\nYour life is at risk in every police encounter. The police are not your friends, not if you are a person of color in America. The police could kill you. They are racist, and the system which they are part of is racist. Know your rights but realize that your rights will likely not be respected, because you are black. Do what is necessary to survive. Please come back home alive.\n\nSandra Bland found herself in the middle of those parables and lessons. As a Black American, she knew how badly it could all end. During the 8 minute long dashboard video, she is narrating her own death.\n\nSandra Bland\u2019s story is a story about race, about intergenerational folk wisdom and practical knowledge about how to survive as a black person in a society that still views you as a threat, as the preeminent Other. Sandra Bland\u2019s story is also an example of the great migrations and movements of black folks from and to the South, and the centrality of cars, the road, about Jim and Jane Crow, both in the past and lived present for those of us who are citizens of Black America. It started in the South, and for Sandra Bland, that\u2019s where it ended too.\n\nThe South, with its many thousands of black bodies killed by chattel slavery, and many thousands of Civil War dead, is full of ghosts. My grandmother used to tell me stories about how a white half-man/half-beast specter would run past the rural farm she grew up on, cursing any people he found on the road, spewing fire out of his nose. The beast was fond of black people who dared to pass through his territory. My grandmother made me promise that I would always be watchful for this evil creature, aware of my surroundings at all times.\n\nWith his arrogant swagger, authoritarian demeanor and crude power, Brian Encinia was no \u201chero cop\u201d with a \u201chard job,\u201d one of those police officers deified by an uncritical media and an American cultural mythology that prevents police from being held accountable for their thuggery. Brian Encinia was one of those demons of casual racism and violence that haunt the South (as well as other parts of the country) and the collective imagination of Black America.\n\nFrom the late 19th through to the middle of the 20th centuries, African-Americans left the South \u2014 with its slave-labor camps, mass rape, lynchings, Ku Klux Klan, racial pogroms, ethnic cleansing, debt peonage, and the indignity of Jim and Jane Crow \u2014 for the improved opportunities they imagined would await them in other parts of the country, for \u201cthe warmth of other suns.\u201d Of course, those freedom dreams ultimately encountered the realities of white racism and segregation in places like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Nevertheless, the ledger of African-American freedom and opportunities was more balanced there than under the formal American Apartheid of the Jim and Jane Crow South.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21 centuries, Sandra Bland and millions of other African-Americans are returning to the South: They are participating in a \u201creverse migration\u201d to their ancestral home on this side of the Black Atlantic. Sandra Bland was part of Black America\u2019s Third Great Migration\u2014alas, one that she would not complete, a journey interrupted by an over-zealous cop and death in a jail cell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sandra Bland's story is about race and migration, the ghosts that still haunt us and the violence that won't end", "title": "Sandra Bland\u2019s American tragedy: How a country\u2019s vicious history lives on in an all-too-modern outrage", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sandra Bland's story is about race and migration, the ghosts that still haunt us and the violence that won't end", "title": "Sandra Bland\u2019s American tragedy: How a country\u2019s vicious history lives on in an all-too-modern outrage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/25/sandra_blands_american_tragedy_how_a_countrys_vicious_history_lives_on_in_an_all_too_modern_outrage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/sandra_bland_video_four.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sandra Bland's story is about race and migration, the ghosts that still haunt us and the violence that won't end", "title": "Sandra Bland\u2019s American tragedy: How a country\u2019s vicious history lives on in an all-too-modern outrage", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/sandra_bland_video_four.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chauncey DeVega", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American History, police abuse, police violence, Racism, sandra bland, slavery, The South, White Supremacy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Sandra Bland is dead three days later, supposedly hung, having committed suicide with the garbage bag used as a makeshift curtain for her jail cell.\nSandra Bland was not as fortunate.\nAs a Black American, she knew how badly it could all end.\nSandra Bland found herself in the middle of those parables and lessons.\nIt started in the South, and for Sandra Bland, that\u2019s where it ended too."}
