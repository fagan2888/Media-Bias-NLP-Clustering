( Rick Bowmer / Associated Press )\n\nPARK CITY, Utah \u2014 Lachlan Norris outsprinted Brent Bookwalter to win the final stage of the Tour of Utah, and Joe Dombrowski of Boulder-based Team Cannondale-Garmin finished in the next group on the road to secure the overall title.\n\nNorris and Bookwalter broke away from a selection that made it over the final climb, speeding away on the long downhill into Park City. Norris positioned himself well behind Bookwalter on the final straight, and the Australian rider sprinted ahead at the line.\n\nDombrowski stayed out of trouble all day to secure the victory.\n\n\"I know we've got a barbecue planned,\" he told the Salt Lake Tribune's Christopher Kamrani of his planned celebration. \"I'm sure we'll have some beers. We'll see.\"\n\nMike Woods crashed on the downhill finish, but still took second in the overall standings because his wipeout occurred close enough to the finish that he was credited with the same time as his group.\n\n\"The big goal was to try and shake up the GC and try and get as much time on Joe (as possible),\" Woods told the Tribune. \"But Joe was super strong today and followed every move. I just couldn't shake him.\"\n\nBookwalter's stage runner-up elevated him to third overall.\n\nResults\n\nTour of Utah\n\nStage 7\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1.
