A dangerous new strain of canine influenza has made its way to Arizona. The outbreak of the H3N2 strain started in Chicago last month and been slowly spreading west and has hit Arizona, according to the Humane Society of Southern Arizona.

None of the dogs at the HSSAZ are infected, but HSSAZ officials said they are starting to take precautions.

"We're going to be vaccinating our shelter dogs next week so every shelter dog here will receive it. Every dog that we take in will get it on intake," clinic director, Pat Brayer, said.

Pet owners also said they will start watching for symptoms in their dogs.

"It is in the back of our minds. At the same time we watch our dog very closely. If she starts coughing or having any respiratory issues we take to the vet immediately. Being very proactive dog parents," David Livingston said.

Livingston said he heard about outbreak in Chicago several months ago through his vet. He was told a vaccine wouldn't be necessary because the virus hadn't made it to Arizona at the time. But now, he said he will ask his vet about preventative measures.

The dog flu is contagious and spreads just like the human flu does. Sneezing or coughing can transfer the virus, as well as coming into contact with dogs who are already infected. Places such as shelters, kennels and dog parks could become hot spots for infection.

Symptoms include watery eyes, coughing, fever, loss of appetite and energy and sneezing. Not all dogs show the same symptoms and they range in severity from mild to death.

"A pet owner may think that this will pass. But we advise anyone that suspects their pet may be lethargic is coughing or sneezing, has any type of discharge that they have them checked by their vet," Brayer said.

Vaccines are available at vet clinics. HSSA said they will start offering vaccines if there are more cases in the area.
