The 22-year-old Allen High School graduate and a friend suffering from altitude sickness had begun walking down from the camp about 30 minutes earlier and were in a village below when the avalanche hit the area.\n\nNearly eight days later, Danielle landed safely at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nSeconds after walking through the sliding doors for international arrivals Saturday afternoon, she was embraced by her relieved mother, sister, nephew and boyfriend.\n\nSharon Banks, who had not seen her daughter since March, spent an emotional and draining two days after the earthquake wondering if her daughter was alive.\n\n\u201cIt was an indescribable feeling because you have so many emotions at one time,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNot knowing if she was dead or alive, if she was still on the mountain. Where is she? Am I going to plan a funeral? Am I going to have a body to plan a funeral?\u201d she said. \u201cSo many things go through your head when you don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSharon Banks said that as she and her daughter exchanged messages in the days immediately after the quake, Danielle didn\u2019t tell her a lot about of what had happened \u2014 including that she had been actually in the avalanche.\n\n\u201cIt was an experience,\u201d Danielle Banks said. \u201cIt was kind of like a state of shock.\u201d\n\nWhen the earthquake hit, Danielle said, she and others didn\u2019t realize at first what was happening. Once they did, they ran for open space.\n\nSeconds later, the village where they were located, Gorak Shep, was hit. The town avoided the brunt of the onslaught, and the two hikers weren\u2019t injured.\n\n\u201cI felt very thankful to be where I was at the time,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cI know other mountains \u2026 were covered in rock slides, and avalanches and land slides.\u201d\n\nAftershocks followed, and Danielle and her friend, named Olivia, knew they would have to keep making their way down the mountain.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a high stress situation like that, your survival skills kick in,\u201d she said.\n\nSharon Banks arranged for the two to be airlifted from the village of Namche Bazaar to the embassy.\n\n\u201cThey say you can\u2019t move mountains, but I moved Mount Everest and got her off that mountain,\u201d Sharon Banks said.\n\nAt the airport, she tried to calm her nerves and occasionally teared up thinking about her daughter. Danielle\u2019s boyfriend and nephew held flowers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to have her home,\u201d said Michelle Mackey, Danielle\u2019s sister. \u201cAs soon as I knew she was OK, I\u2019ve been fine, but it was the initial not knowing that was scary. I\u2019m definitely glad she\u2019s back.\u201d\n\nDanielle graduated from Texas A&M University in December and had gone to Nepal to work with a group combating human trafficking. She had taken an extra 10 days to hike.\n\nDuring their exchange of messages after the earthquake, Danielle asked if she should stay to help with relief efforts. Her mother sternly said no, and Danielle said Saturday that she knew leaving was the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cJust being there and taking up those resources that Nepal needs wasn\u2019t something that I wanted to do,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said she hopes that attention doesn\u2019t shift from Nepal in the coming months, and she hopes to return in March to help with the relief effort.\n\nSharon Banks isn\u2019t thrilled about the idea of Danielle going back to Nepal, but she remains proud and supportive.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s her passion. That\u2019s her major is helping women and children in need,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what she wants to do with her life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA1L2FsbGVuLWdyYWQtd2hvLXdhcy1kZXNjZW5kaW5nLWZyb20tZXZlcmVzdC1kdXJpbmctYXZhbGFuY2hlLWFycml2aW5nLWF0LWRmdy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Claire Z.
