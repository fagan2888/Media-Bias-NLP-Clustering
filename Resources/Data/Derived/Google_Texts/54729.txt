A sprawling industrial park near Reno, Nev., became the focus of the secretive site selection process for Tesla’s $5 billion battery factory, but the groundwork taking place is no guarantee the plant and its 6,500 jobs are coming.

Lance Gilman knows the bidding war with Texas, California, New Mexico and Arizona has just begun now that the electric-car maker has confirmed the first stage of preparation for a “gigafactory.”

Gilman, principal and director of the Reno Tahoe Industrial Center, still likes the chances that his site will land the giant lithium battery plant, in a state still recovering from multiple years of having the nation’s highest unemployment rate.

“If you talk about a horse race, no one else I know of has even left the starting gate,” he said. “You are looking at a piece of property that is ready to go tomorrow.”

Tesla chairman and CEO Elon Musk told investors in a webcast Thursday that the company plans similar site work in one or two other states “before we actually go to the next stage of pouring a lot of concrete.”

“Given Reno’s geographic proximity to Tesla’s California headquarters, it should be no surprise that it would be identified as one of the possible sites,” New Mexico Economic Development Secretary Jon Barela said. “Tesla remains a prized economic development target, and we are still very much in the game.”

California Gov. Jerry Brown’s administration has refused to detail what it’s offering, but legislation recently enacted to create a $420 million tax credit for Lockheed Martin also included language to help battery manufacturers, at his request.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s office confirmed Friday that it’s still in the hunt but declined further comment, citing “ongoing negotiations.”

In Arizona, Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild said he doesn’t believe Thursday’s announcement makes Nevada the front-runner. He said Tesla officials “were very clear that they’ve chosen no site yet.”
