The accumulated burden of it is the reason that America is stuck in the slowest economic recovery since the Depression.\n\nI understand why candidates don\u2019t talk about it: Regulation is boring. But it\u2019s important.\n\nThe founders of this republic were willing to die rather than be subject to other people\u2019s rules. Today we are so accustomed to bureaucracy that we\u2019ve forgotten what it means to be free.\n\nWe now have a million rules \u2014 many so complex that even legal specialists can\u2019t understand them. Yet bureaucrats keep writing more. And 22 million people work for government!\n\nOkay, that wasn\u2019t fair. Many of those 22 million deliver mail, build roads and do things we consider useful. But at least a million are bureaucrats. And if you are a rule-maker and you don\u2019t create new rules, you think you\u2019re not doing your job.\n\nOn his \u201cGrumpy Economist\u201d blog, the Hoover Institution\u2019s John Cochrane points out that most of these rule-makers were never even elected, and legislatures rarely vote on their new rules. Yet \u201cRegulators can ruin your life, and your business, very quickly, and you have very little recourse.\u201d\n\nRegulators have vast power to oppress.\n\nTheir power not only hurts the economy, it threatens our political freedom, says Cochran. \u201cWhat banker dares to speak out against the Fed? \u2026 What hospital or health insurer dares to speak out against HHS or ObamaCare? \u2026 What real estate developer needing zoning approval dares to speak out against the local zoning board? The agencies demand political support for themselves first of all.\u201d\n\nSpeaking up will bring unwanted attention to your project, extra delays, maybe retaliation. It\u2019s safer to keep your mouth shut. We learn to be passive and put up with more layers of red tape.\n\nFortunately, a few Americans resist. At Boston\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospital, head cardiologist Dr. Robert Gross dismissed Dr. Helen Taussig\u2019s new idea for a surgical cure for \u201cblue-baby syndrome.\u201d He wanted to do things by the book. So she took the technique to Johns Hopkins Hospital instead. It worked. You don\u2019t hear much about blue-baby syndrome anymore. The embarrassed Gross went on to tell the story many times to teach medical students to listen to new ideas. Breaking the rules saved lives.\n\nBut that happened years ago. Few doctors break the rules today. The consequences are too severe.\n\nAmerican entrepreneurs took advantage of a \u201cpermissionless economy\u201d to create Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc., but they could accomplish that only because Washington\u2019s bureaucrats didn\u2019t know enough about what they were doing to slow them down.\n\nNow regulators have their claws in every cranny of the Internet. Innovation will be much more difficult.\n\nToday\u2019s regulations are often vague. A typical edict: \u201cThe firm shall not engage in abusive practices.\u201d That sounds reasonable, but what is \u201cabusive\u201d? The regulator decides. Compliance is your problem.\n\nIf you have the misfortune to be noticed by the bureaucracy, or maybe a business rival complains about you, your idea dies and you go broke paying lawyers.\n\nEuropean regulators have adopted something even worse, called \u201cthe Precautionary Principle.\u201d It states that you may not sell something until it has been \u201cproven safe.\u201d That too sounds reasonable, unless you realize that it also means: \u201cDon\u2019t try anything for the first time.\u201d\n\nSince we don\u2019t know all the rules, we\u2019re never quite sure if we\u2019re breaking any. Better to keep your head down.\n\nAnd sometimes the rule-makers really are out to get you. Nixon used the IRS against political enemies. So did Obama IRS appointee Lois Lerner.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Americans to fight back. As Gen. Douglas MacArthur said, \u201cYou are remembered by the rules you break.\u201d\n\nAmerica became the most innovative and prosperous nation in history because many Americans were adventurous, individualistic people willing to take big risks to discover things that might make life better.\n\nEvery day, bureaucrats do more to kill those opportunities. We\u2019ll never know what good things we might have today had some bureaucrat not said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidates ought to scream about that.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "I'm upset that the presidential candidates, all of them, rarely mention a huge problem: the quiet cancer that kills opportunity -- regulation.
