Jim McGovern, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, today denounced Congress as \u201cthe poster child for cowardice\u201d for refusing to debate a new war powers resolution to set parameters for the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to \u201cdegrade and defeat\u201d the jihadist terrorists in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAt the behest of Republican and Democratic leaders, Obama sent a proposed war powers resolution to Congress in February outlining his core objectives of systematically destroying the jihadist terror group through a sustained campaign of airstrikes, supporting and training allied forces on the ground and humanitarian assistance \u2013 but without committing a large number of U.S. combat troops to the effort.\n\nRelated: U.S. Shoots Itself in the Foot By Accidentally Arming ISIS\n\nThe administration proposal would give the military \u201cflexibility\u201d to confront unforeseen circumstances, potentially by deploying Special Forces in the region. But it would limit the mission to three years and would not authorize \u201cenduring offensive ground combat operations.\u201d\n\nBut rather than roll up their sleeves and debate and vote on the president\u2019s request for new military authorization, Republican leaders have effectively shelved the issue and moved on to other things, such as rewriting the rules for NSA spying on Americans\u2019 phone calls and providing Obama with fast track authority to negotiate a new trade pact with Asian countries.\n\nWith many conservative Republicans including Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina complaining that the president\u2019s strategy for defeating ISIS woefully inadequate and some Democrats worried that it goes too far in committing U.S. troops and resources to a no-win situation in the Middle East, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chair Bob Corker (R-TN) said recently he had no incentive to take up the issue in his committee.\n\nRelated: Why Congress Should Simply Bag the War Powers Debate\n\nFrankly speaking, this is unacceptable,\u201d McGovern, a member of the House Rules Committee, said on the House floor today, adding that if the Congress \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the stomach\u201d to authorize the war it should vote to bring U.S. forces home, according to Politico. McGovern introduced a bipartisan resolution that would require full debate within 15 days on whether U.S. troops should withdraw from Iraq and Syria. His bipartisan resolution is co-sponsored by Reps. Walter Jones (R-NC) and Barbara Lee (D-CA).\n\n\u201cThis House appears to have no problem sending our uniformed men and women into harm\u2019s way,\u201d McGovern said in prepared remarks. \u201cIt appears to have no problem spending billions of dollars for the arms, equipment and airpower to carry out these wars. But it just can\u2019t bring itself to step up to the plate and take responsibility for these wars.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amid growing signs that the U.S. faces nothing but bad choices in its war against ISIS, Rep.
