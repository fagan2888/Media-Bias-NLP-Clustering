The tax is required under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe steep excise tax is intended to burden people who enjoy generous health plans. However, the NEA\u2019s report asserts, the excise tax actually tends to burden women, older people and people who live in places where the cost of living is already high.\n\nMilliman, an actuarial and consulting firm, produced the report for the NEA. (You can view the full report here.)\n\nThe problem, the report suggests, is that the rules for assessing the excise tax erroneously equate high insurance premiums with lavish health insurance benefits. However, people often must pay higher premiums for reasons that have nothing to do with the quality of the benefits they receive.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it\u2019s more accurate to call the excise tax on high-cost plans an \u2018Age-Sex-Geography Tax,'\u201d said NEA spokeswoman Kim Anderson in a statement obtained by The Daily Caller. \u201cAmerica\u2019s tax policy should not be a game of chance for working families.\u201d\n\nThe report \u201chighlights a significant and damaging flaw in the excise tax,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe excise tax on high-cost plans can randomly and unfairly cause hardship to American workers and their families. In fact, the excise tax will disproportionately hurt women and older workers.\u201d\n\nDespite the finding that an important Obamacare provision wrongly punishes women and old people with \u201carbitrary and negative consequences,\u201d NEA leaders are unable to bring themselves to oppose Obamacare, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature first-term law.\n\n\u201cWe continue to support the Affordable Care Act because it already has strengthened health benefits for kids and families and provided an opportunity for millions of Americans to obtain quality, affordable care,\u201d Anderson explained.\n\nThe teachers union has called on the Republican Congress to pass a law that will \u201cavoid inflicting harm on American workers and their families\u201d while keeping the rest of the Affordable Care Act intact.\n\nLast month, the NEA was in the news because \u201cWisconsin Jobs Now\u201d \u2014 a small, radical group to which the union gave $125,000\u2033 \u2014 sponsored a rally at which two protesters unfurled a banner declaring \u201cALL COPS ARE BASTARDS.\u201d (RELATED: OWN IT: \u2018ALL COPS ARE BASTARDS\u2019 SIGN Shows Up At NEA-Funded Protest)\n\nIn November, the NEA, which spends millions of dollars each election cycle on campaign speech, zealously endorsed a constitutional amendment that would limit everyone else\u2019s ability to spend money speaking about politics. (RELATED: Teachers Union Wants To Amend Constitution To Limit EVERYONE ELSE\u2019S Campaign Speech)\n\n\u201cLet us not deny the regular people a voice in determining the future of our country,\u201d urged NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, adding that she wants \u201cto turn down the volume on corporate speech.\u201d\n\nIn January 2014, prior to President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, the union representing over three million elementary and secondary teachers sent a 1,122-word letter to Obama outlining its policy wish list. Almost none of the longwinded letter bothered to mention the needs of American students.
