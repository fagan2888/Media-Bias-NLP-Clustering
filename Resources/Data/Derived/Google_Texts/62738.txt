Some harsh words from an employee at Georgian Village sparked a Simcoe County and provincial investigation and resulted in additional staff training

Some harsh words from an employee at Georgian Village sparked a Simcoe County and provincial investigation and resulted in additional staff training.

Michelle Pauzé, the county’s seniors services director, said staff investigated a report from one of its staff members raising concerns about how a colleague had spoken to a resident in Georgian Residences - the retirement living component of Georgian Village in Penetanguishene.

The concerned staffer followed the Retirements Home Act rules that requires anyone with reasonable suspicious of harm to report those concerns. The law outlines several grounds, including improper treatment or care, abuse or misappropriation of a resident’s money.

The county conducted an internal investigation and also reported the incident to the Retirement Home Regulatory Authority, which issues licences.

In her report, Pauzé said “there were no findings to substantiate that the interaction was inappropriate; however, recommendations for additional staff training were received to promote more suitable and effective communication techniques between staff and residents.”

The provincial inspection on April 5 included reviewing clinical records and interviews with staff and residents. The April 22 inspector’s report said there was no evidence of non-compliance with provincial standards as outlined in the Retirement Homes Act.

Georgian Residences received its licence from the RHRA in September 2013. It has 42 moderately-sized rental units. Residents can receive an array of supports tailored to meet their needs.

The county’s Georgian Village development also includes Georgian Manor, which is a 143-bed long-term car facility, garden homes and life-lease suites, affordable housing and day programs, as well as a recreation centre, a restaurant and a pub.
