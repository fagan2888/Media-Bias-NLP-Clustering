Gyroscope, rock climbing, among the popular attractions

It was all about kids early Saturday at Longmont's 19th annual Rhythm on the River festival at Roger's Grove Park.

Kids scaled two rock walls, learned to paddleboard and kayak in nearby pools, performed for audiences during a talent competition and completed a ropes course about 20 feet above the ground.

Longmont residents Brady and Kea Toothaker said they were impressed with the short wait times this year after. Last year, they said, their four children waited for hours to participate in some activities and then were rained out in the afternoon.

The family did not wait more than 10 minutes for any activity Saturday, Kea Toothaker said.

The family's four children, Cole, 12; Carly, 10; Kye, 7; and Kendall, 5, were also impressed with the festival this year.

"I liked the gyroscope," Cole said. "It's this big sphere that spins you around and around and around."

Carly said rock climbing was her favorite activity. Kendall and Kye said they liked the bike track and paddleboarding.

The activities were broken into younger and older age groups, Brady Toothaker said, making it easier to allow all of the kids to participate.

The Toothakers said they were also pleased with the cooler-than-normal temperatures Saturday.

Music kicked off at 9 a.m. with the Bakersfield Band and was expected to continue through 8 p.m.

The nearby St. Vrain River remained closed due to damage from the September flood.
