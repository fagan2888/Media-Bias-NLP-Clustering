Shoppers heading out for Black Friday deals in Denver should expect icy, snow-packed roads and frigid temperatures.

Forecasters are calling for a high near 20 in the city with a chance of snow all day. The National Weather Service in Boulder says freezing drizzle could complicate driving Friday night.

“Another weak disturbance will move across the region later this afternoon and tonight,” the weather service said in a forecast bulletin. “Travelers are still urged to use caution today as the cold temperatures will keep some roadways and overpasses slick and icy.”

Police in Colorado Springs say adverse road conditions late Thursday night led one motorist to crash into an officer’s parked cruiser on Interstate 25.

Thankfully, investigators say, the officer was outside of his vehicle and not injured.

Precipitation will taper off on Saturday when forecasters are expecting a high in Denver near 29 degrees.

A slight chance of snow is forecast for Sunday with a high near 32 degrees.
