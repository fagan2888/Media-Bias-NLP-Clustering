Federal and state exchange websites had yet to go live, and congressional appropriators were still writing government spending legislation with an eye toward defunding the law (leading to the partial government shutdown later that year).\n\nIn a typical expression of sentiment from last summer, John Culberson, a Texas Republican, published an email to constituents entitled \u201cMy Day Is Not Complete Unless I Vote to Cut Spending and Repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThis summer, not only are there fewer Obamacare-related news releases, but the tone is also different. Constituents are more likely to read statements on judicial decisions on the law, news about bills intended to trim around the law\u2019s edges, or descriptions of lawmakers\u2019 requests for information from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nCongress Loses Interest in Obamacare Congressional news releases with \u201cObamacare\u201d in the title 300 200 100 0 2013 2014 June July Aug. 300 200 100 0 2013 2014 June July Aug.\n\nAlthough the occasional statements praising the law have been issued by some congressional Democrats, most in that party still appear to shy away from the topic. The database of congressional news releases maintained by The Upshot contains just two positive statements mentioning Obamacare in the title last summer, from Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano of New York and Carol Shea-Porter of New Hampshire, both Democrats.\n\nCongressional opponents of Obamacare haven\u2019t given up, of course. But the relative dearth of Obamacare-titled statements this August shows that they have found other issues to raise with constituents as the midterm elections approach, like investigations into the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCongressional news releases mentioning \u201cveterans\u201d in the title have jumped
