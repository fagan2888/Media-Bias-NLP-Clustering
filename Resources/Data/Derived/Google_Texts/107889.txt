WATCH: Hodor From GoT Plays 'Family Feud'

The Game of Thrones season finale is this weekend. To celebrate, Jimmy Kimmel imagines what it would be like if his favorite character Hodor (played by gay actor, Christian Nairn) competed on Family Feud.

It's fun to imagine how Game of Thrones characters would spend their time if they weren't too busy killing each other. That's just what Jimmy Kimmel did with his favorite character from the show, Hodor. As you might expect, Hodor isn't the best contestant for a gameshow. Maybe Family Feud is a game best left to the Lannisters.

Watch the hilarious clip of Hodor losing Family Feud.
