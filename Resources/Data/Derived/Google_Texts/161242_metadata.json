Joe Carr, the three-term state representative running against Sen. Lamar Alexander, arrived early to Koch\u2019s Bakery (no relation to the billionaire industrialists) in Chattanooga, where correspondent John Roberts asked what it would mean if the insurgent got whupped.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cIt will be because, we, this campaign didn\u2019t do everything we needed to do the get our message out,\u201d said Carr.\n\nA few dozen people trickled in and out of the bakery, taking photos with the candidate, talking about why he deserved to win, as his daughter wrangled media and took photos for the campaign\u2019s Twitter feed. Michael Scallia, the owner of a family shoe repair business, smiled at the scene from beneath a cap with the Gadsden flag emblazoned above the brim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cLamar has violated his oath to the Constitution so many times over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s voted against the people and with the government.\u201d Carr, argued Scallia, was \u201cpro-life, anti-Obamacare, all the good stuff,\u201d whereas Alexander had cast an unforgiveable vote.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s voted for Obamacare,\u201d said Scallia. \u201cIn the Obamacare, gun control was attached, like an earmark. Anything that takes my Second Amendment rights away is a major blow.\u201d\n\nThis was not actually true; that a voter believed it was a signal of what Alexander had to put up with, and what a restive conservative base has come to think about its Washington representatives. It was the reason half a dozen Republican senators had to fend off challengers in 2014, and why more than $100 million had been spent on these intraparty scuffles. Surely, it was the reason why Alexander, who has not lost an election in Tennessee since 1974, spent the final week of the campaign crossing the state on a bus, joined by many of the Republican politicians who had endorsed him\u2014i.e., almost all of them.\n\nAlexander opposed the Affordable Care Act, but disagreed with the 2013 strategy to defund it\u2014the fight that began the government shutdown. That was enough to embolden local Tea Parties to hold meetings and a convention, and get behind a challenger. Alexander opposed every one of 2013\u2019s gun safety bills, but he voted for cloture to begin debate on them. That was enough to turn the National Association for Gun Rights against him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOh; and Alexander voted for 2013\u2019s immigration reform bill, which is lost somewhere in John Boehner\u2019s office and rediscovered only when conservatives roll it up to slap one of its supporters in the face. Carr, a burly 56-year-old with short white hair and a trim beard, made his name on the right by passing new restrictions on illegal immigration. After then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor lost his primary to a professor named Dave Brat, the same forces that backed Brat\u2014radio hosts Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin, to name the most famous\u2014dubbed Carr the next shock upsetter.\n\nIn Chattanooga there was no sign of a Carr surge. No one had actually released a reliable public poll of the race since January, long before Carr got his national media attention. In Koch\u2019s, he sat down with me to talk about what had almost happened the day before in Kansas, where Sen. Pat Roberts had survived a Tea Party challenge from radiologist Milton Wolf.\n\n\u201cIt was 48\u201341, is that right?\u201d Carr asked.\n\nThat was right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cThat just shows you that the pollsters are wrong in their methodology and their sample,\u201d said Carr. \u201cThey blew it pretty bad in the Dave Brat race. Nobody, nobody in their right minds believes that Lamar Alexander has had anything like a 30-point lead in this state. It\u2019s not very professional for a pollster to put out numbers without crosstabs. Hey, I can put out a memo\u2014Joe Carr does a poll, he\u2019s winning with 80 percent of the vote! What we needed to do, with great discipline and perseverance, was build a ground game. We knew at some point in time in the 2014 election cycle, there\u2019d be one event that just\u201d\u2014he held his hands close then threw them apart\u2014\u201cexploded on the scene.\u201d\n\nThis, according to Carr, was Dave Brat\u2019s victory. \u201cWe were in Obion County,\u201d he said. \u201cI was speaking to about 80, 85 people, we were about done. Somebody waves his iPhone in the back of the room\u2014Dave Brat just beat Cantor! And the place just exploded!\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no denying it\u2014when Brat won, a press corps that had slept on the race scrambled to see if any other Brats were out there. Carr got the first sustained media attention of the post-Bratt Tea Party field and a run of national TV interviews. Laura Ingraham, who had stumped for Brat, flew in for his largest rally, ripping Alexander apart for advancing the immigration bill, occasionally mentioning Carr.\n\n\u201cI like metaphors,\u201d Carr explained at the bakery. \u201cYou know Pink Floyd, right? Another brick in the wall. Sarah Palin was a brick in the wall. Dave Brat was a brick in the wall. Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin\u2014they were bricks in the wall. What\u2019s the mortar? It\u2019s our message.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCarr got up to talk to more voters, to pay for everything they\u2019d ordered, and then to hotfoot it to a plane that would take him around the state. (He\u2019d raised more than $1.3 million, roughly a dollar for every six Alexander had.) On the way out, he was stopped by a local Republican who\u2019d immigrated legally from Ecuador. He stopped for almost five minutes, refusing to pander or just slip away from the conversation.\n\n\u201cFor every dollar that an illegal puts into the economy,\u201d he explained, \u201ctwo dollars come out of the public trust.\u201d\n\nThen he had to leave. Two hours later, and a two-hour drive away, a much larger crowd packed into a family restaurant in the town of Oak Ridge. Sen. Lamar Alexander\u2019s operation was as slick as Carr\u2019s was homey, with a black bus parked next to campaign signs that aides were plucking out to be distributed at the next stop. Alexander worked through a crush of local Republicans, which included Gov. Bill Haslam, the former mayor of Knoxville, who was happy to share his political base.\n\nAlexander spared no schmaltz. \u201cWhen I get close to an election,\u201d Alexander said to his crowd, \u201cI look to Lamar Alexander\u2019s Little Plaid Book for inspiration.\u201d He wore plaid. His team distributed plaid signs and stickers. And he whipped out his forgotten plaid book of campaign homilies from his second presidential campaign, 15 years ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a new rule,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cIt\u2019ll be rule No. 312. If it\u2019s three days before a campaign, don\u2019t believe anything new you hear about anybody. If it\u2019s about me and about guns, remember that I have an A rating from the NRA. If it\u2019s about life, remember I\u2019m endorsed by Right to Life. If it\u2019s about immigration, remember that I voted against amnesty.\u201d\n\nAlexander\u2019s Republicans roared their approval.\n\n\u201cAnd last week, I flew back to Washington to vote against the president\u2019s immigration bill!\u201d\n\nThe year\u2019s other Tea Party targets had lacked this combination of cornpone and relevance. Alexander had cast exactly the wrong votes for the Tea Party, but he was not distant; he did not, like Thad Cochran, seem like he was being propped up to run one last time, after forgetting when the election was.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who\u2019s happy with Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Alexander. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with Washington, D.C. I\u2019m running to change Washington, D.C.!\u201d He would, for example, help a Republican Senate \u201cbegin to reverse Obamacare\u201d and \u201cbegin to reverse the trend toward a national school board.\u201d\n\nWhat did that mean? It recalled another issue that Alexander had angered the Tea Party over\u2014his apparent acquiescence to Common Core, the top-down but state-approved education standards. After the rally I asked if he had been referring to Common Core. Not really\u2014that\u2019s not what conservatives resented.\n\n\u201cI think what they resent is the fact that Washington may be requiring states to set specific education standards,\u201d said Alexander, who served as secretary of education after serving as governor of Tennessee. \u201cThat\u2019s not Washington\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nAlexander was saying the right words, basically. It was clear why this race had not gone as volcanic as Mississippi\u2019s, or Kansas\u2019, or even Texas\u2019 odd shadowboxing between Sen. John Cornyn and Rep. Steve Stockman. Neither Alexander nor Carr was making it personal. Carr said that the wounds suffered by Tea Partiers in Mississippi\u2019s runoff \u201cwould take a long time to heal.\u201d But he wasn\u2019t turning his campaign into the revenge mission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNot long after Alexander\u2019s rally, Carr\u2019s plane delivered him at another bakery\u2014in Knoxville this time. Tennessee state Sen. Stacey Campfield, who had recently compared submission to Obamacare to submission to Nazi butchers, joined Carr for a few rounds of aimless voter chats. The senator rejected any idea that a close race would change Alexander\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cSecond place is first loser,\u201d he said.\n\nA voter, Lillian Williams, wanted to show Carr a picture she\u2019d taken\u2014a sign she saw on the road to the airport. In white letters on a blue background, it read, \u201cNo Mas Lamar.\u201d Carr\u2019s campaign had nothing to do with it, like it had nothing to do with Tea Party Patriots branding the senator as \u00a1Lamar! But he shook with laughter at the photo, pulling over the local TV crews so they could get a picture of him with the photo.\n\nAlexander finished the race with an outdoor rally in boiling heat. Carr finished with a thank-you at his Murfreesboro headquarters, about 30 minutes south of Nashville. Election Day broke with no real expectation that Carr could win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cThe liberal media in general has this fetish about declaring the Tea Party dead,\u201d said Ben Cunningham, leader of the Nashville Tea Party, taking a midday break. The local Tea Parties had organized early, after being inspired by the people who elected Ted Cruz and beat Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar in 2012, but \u201cthe cavalry never showed up,\u201d and the media was going to describe this loss as the first clean establishment sweep since 2008.\n\n\u201cI suppose it makes them feel better about the future,\u201d said Cunningham. \u201cBut if Lamar survives tonight, it won\u2019t be a surprise. We mounted a good challenge and there\u2019s a chance that Joe can win this. If he does, we\u2019ll be ecstatic. If he doesn\u2019t? That\u2019s OK. We\u2019ll come back into it when Bob Corker runs again.\u201d\n\nBut that would take four years. In the short term, Carr would lose. The Carr party, held in one of the smaller ballrooms of an Embassy Suites, featured a bluegrass band but zero TV or computer screens. Curious partisans who wanted news on the night\u2019s other races had to borrow a reporter\u2019s computer or walk a few paces to the party of Jim Tracy, a state senator running against incumbent Rep. Scott DesJarlais, who had encouraged an ex-wife to terminate her pregnancies.\n\nSomewhere up the highway in Nashville, Alexander gave a victory speech that the Tea Party never saw. They also missed the news from Knoxville that Stacey Campfield had gone down in a landslide to a Republican who might make be less inclined to compare the president\u2019s health care program to a Nazi scheme. But they crowded as the bluegrass band played Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah,\u201d and cheered when Carr talked about what an important, positive race had just been run. Ultimately, it looked as though he would finish within 10 points of Alexander, who might not even get 50 percent of the vote\u2014a far cry from that Alexander internal poll that was predicting a 29-point landslide.\n\n\u201cWhile this battle was lost tonight, this wasn\u2019t the most important battle,\u201d Carr said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the first battle and it won\u2019t be the last battle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "A tough 2014 primary season for conservative challengers ends with a near-miss.", "fb-share": "A Tough 2014 Primary Season for Tea Party Challengers Ends With a Near-Miss", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "MURFREESBORO, Tennessee\u2014The final day of the last Tea Party-against-the-machine campaign of a disappointing year began with a Fox News interview.
