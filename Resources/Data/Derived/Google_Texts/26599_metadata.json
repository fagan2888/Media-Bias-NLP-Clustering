Other subjects such as Chemistry and Biology were taught by a personal tutor.\n\nRanenthraa did not sit for the Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah exam but thanks to his parents carefully crafting his education route and remaining actively involved in it, Ranenthraa was able to sit for his O-Levels exam when he was just 13-years-old.\n\n\u201cHomeschooling is not easy as the student must have the ability to learn things fast because there isn\u2019t anyone to coach them full-time.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, both my wife and I are working and also need to concentrate on our jobs,\u201d said Siva Prakash.\n\nHe added that they were fortunate that Ranenthraa could grasp concepts quickly. The bright lad scored four Bs for his O-Levels.\n\nRanenthraa had applied to many other universities and had received offers to study medicine in Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia, and Moscow State University, Russia.\n\nHe chose USU as it has a unique medical course structure and was more affordable.\n\nStudents undergo three years in the undergraduate programme that is composed mainly of classroom education before continuing another two years in the professional programme that includes rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand.\n\nIf they pass the undergraduate programme, they will have \u201cS.Ked\u201d as their title and once they finish the professional programme, they will become a general physician and receive the \u201cDr\u201d (doctor) title.\n\nRanenthraa studied at Goon Institute for the varsity\u2019s preparation examination that was held at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia just two months before the medical semester at USU began.\n\nCurrently, his parents are funding his education but he is looking for a sponsor to ease their burden.\n\nWhen asked why Ranenthraa did not apply for scholarships before accepting the offer, Siva Prakash said there was not enough time as his son had to leave for Indonesia.\n\n\u201cAlso, scholarships for medical courses are not easy to come by,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Indo experience\n\n\u201cI am currently not taking Bahasa Indonesia lessons. However, I have no trouble conversing with my lecturers as they can understand Bahasa Malaysia due to it being similar to Bahasa Indonesia,\u201d said Ranenthraa.\n\nHe added that studying medicine in Indonesia was not easy but he was not complaining.\n\nHis favourite subject is Physiology while Anatomy is his least favourite.\n\nAlthough everything is conducted in Bahasa Indonesia, he has a set of lecture notes which have been translated to English.\n\nHe added that the final examinations are conducted in the local language but it is not hard to adapt although some translation is required.\n\nHe is currently living on-campus and is blending in well among his peers on campus.\n\n\u201cMy university friends have no idea of my actual age and I have never found the need to tell them,\u201d said Ranenthraa.\n\nHe does not feel homesick and has easily adapted to life on campus, adding that he has formed a \u201cfamily\u201d of friends in Indonesia.\n\nJust like many other students, he has his share of instant noodles when it comes to meals but confides that he frequents an Indian food shop in front of the university.\n\nThe ardent Chelsea fan said his favourite player is Eden Hazard and that he once harboured dreams of becoming a professional football player.\n\nAttesting to his son\u2019s football mania, Siva Prakash said Ranenthraa would stay awake and watch every match, even if it was being shown at 3am!\n\n\u201cAt 5pm everyday, he will definitely head to the field to play futsal.\n\n\u201cEven if the whole family is on an outing, he will bug his mother to hurry up and take him home so he can join his friends for a game,\u201d said Siva Prakash.\n\n\u201cBoth my other sons are not as enthusiastic about football as him,\u201d he added.\n\nRanenthraa\u2019s love for football was not left behind in Malaysia as he has competed in a varsity-level futsal tournament \u201cJuga Bunito Futsal\u201d in Indonesia and still plays there during his free time.\n\nThis is also the first time he has participated in a futsal tournament even though he played quite often in Malaysia.\n\nRanenthraa said he wants to return to Malaysia and do his housemanship here.\n\nHe wants to specialise in neurology as he said a Canadian study has revealed a link between the nervous system and diabetes, and he hopes to carry out further research on this.", "article_metadata": {"tags": "Education", "og": {"url": "http://www.thestar.com.my/news/education/2014/03/16/teenage-dr-in-the-making/", "image": "http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2014/03/15/21/00/edud_jk_10a_4cols_1603.ashx/", "description": "He may only be 16 but Ranenthraa Sreenivas Rao is fast achieving his dream of becoming a doctor.", "title": "Teenage Dr in the making - Education | The Star Online"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2014/03/15/21/00/edud_jk_10a_4cols_1603.ashx/"}, "title": "Teenage Dr in the making", "description": "He may only be 16 but Ranenthraa Sreenivas Rao is fast achieving his dream of becoming a doctor.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@staronline"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"guid\": \"{25E8352D-2B92-4536-BCAB-55D591B5C87F}\", \"summary\": \"He may only be 16 but Ranenthraa Sreenivas Rao is fast achieving his dream of becoming a doctor.\", \"image_url\": \"http:\\/\\/www.thestar.com.my\\/~\\/media\\/online\\/2014\\/03\\/15\\/21\\/00\\/edud_jk_10a_4cols_1603.ashx\\/\"}", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.knx.thestarmobile", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://apps.appmachine.com/5717FE/logo", "keywords": "Education,education, doctor", "other tags": "education, doctor", "sections": "News - Education, News", "viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-app": "app-id=428184176"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2c2\"", "article_summary": "Although everything is conducted in Bahasa Indonesia, he has a set of lecture notes which have been translated to English.\nHowever, I have no trouble conversing with my lecturers as they can understand Bahasa Malaysia due to it being similar to Bahasa Indonesia,\u201d said Ranenthraa.\nRanenthraa enrolled in Universitas Sumatera Utara (USU), Indonesia last August, just one month after his 15th birthday.\nThe Indo experience\u201cI am currently not taking Bahasa Indonesia lessons.\n\u201cMy university friends have no idea of my actual age and I have never found the need to tell them,\u201d said Ranenthraa."}
