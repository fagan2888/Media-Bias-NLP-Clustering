Their main complaint: Kaiser isn\u2019t hiring enough therapists and psychologists to see patients in a timely manner.\n\nBut the strike also comes after four years of contract negotiations between Kaiser and the National Union of Healthcare Workers have yielded few agreements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried one and two day actions in the past. Kaiser is not paying attention to that,\u201d says Clement Papazian, a social worker at Kaiser and a local union representative. \u201cWe feel like it\u2019s the appropriate time to escalate these actions.\u201d\n\nKaiser called the strike \u201cunnecessary and counterproductive.\u201d\n\nJohn Nelson, Kaiser\u2019s vice president of government relations, says the the hospital system is meeting its patients\u2019 mental health needs, even after Kaiser has taken on thousands of new patients under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cSince 2011, we\u2019ve grown membership by eight percent in California. We\u2019ve increased the number of therapists in California who work at Kaiser Permanente by 25 percent,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThat\u2019s quite an accomplishment.\u201d\n\nNelson said that health care systems across the country have been having difficulty hiring enough therapists and psychologists, because of a shortage of professionals. He said there isn\u2019t enough incentive to get people to enter the field.\n\n\u201cThere are challenges in encouraging folks to pursue that training and to go to school and complete the long licensing process,\u201d he said.\n\nKaiser has faced the ire of state regulators over wait times for mental health care. In 2013, the Department of Managed Health Care fined Kaiser $4 million over long wait times for mental health care. Kaiser initially contested the fine, but agreed to pay it last September \u2014 while still insisting it had not violated regulations.\n\nNelson insisted the strike was really a bargaining strategy by the union. The latest issue to be debated in contract negotiations is retiree health benefits.\n\n\u201cThey want to carve out retiree health care,\u201d said Clement Papazian. He says Kaiser\u2019s latest proposal is to put current employees, once they retire, on a \u201csubstandard\u201d Medicare plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a much less desirable health care benefit, and it\u2019s a bitter pill for those of us who work in health care and expend a career providing these services.\u201d\n\nThe union plans to hold rallies outside Kaiser facilities in Northern and Southern California throughout the week.\n\nNelson says Kaiser has enough non-union staff to handle any urgent psychiatric needs during the strike, but some routine therapy appointments will be canceled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Contract negotiations between Kaiser and the union have dragged on more than four years.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Kaiser Mental Health Workers Launch 7-Day Strike\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/01\\/12\\/kaiser-mental-health-workers-launch-7-day-strike\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-12 00:11:36\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-01-12 10:30:41\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23418,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Kaiser\",\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/01\\/Kaiser-jpg-640x480.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Contract negotiations between Kaiser and the union have dragged on more than four years.", "title": "Kaiser Mental Health Workers Launch 7-Day Strike", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/01/12/kaiser-mental-health-workers-launch-7-day-strike/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/01/Kaiser-jpg-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "kaiser,mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda172\"", "article_summary": "In 2013, the Department of Managed Health Care fined Kaiser $4 million over long wait times for mental health care.\nKaiser has faced the ire of state regulators over wait times for mental health care.\nBy April DemboskyMental health clinicians at Kaiser are walking off the job Monday, commencing a week-long, statewide strike.\n\u201cThey want to carve out retiree health care,\u201d said Clement Papazian.\nBut the strike also comes after four years of contract negotiations between Kaiser and the National Union of Healthcare Workers have yielded few agreements."}
