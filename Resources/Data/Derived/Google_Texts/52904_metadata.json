Have no fear, the Nintendo 3DS and some great holiday games are here.\n\nNintendo 3DS is today's premiere handheld. The graphics are incredible and the games are fun.\n\nLet us take a look at some of the best holiday games for this year.\n\n\"Pokemon\" is one of the most popular video game series ever. Over 100,000,000 copies of the various games have been sold worldwide. The newest offering for the 3DS is no different.\n\n\"Pokemon\" created Alpha and Sapphire for the Gameboy Advance years ago; now they are remaking the game for the 3DS with a few added features.\n\n\"Pokemon\" has impressed pocket monster collectors for decades, why should they stop now? The game utilizes the improved graphics on the 3DS and adds a fun GPS-like device for finding Pokemon in the fields.\n\nIf you are a sports fan, particularly football (soccer), you are going to love \"FIFA 15\" on the 3DS. The game is easy to pick-up and play, but difficult to master. Give it a try and try to win some trophies along the way. Best Buy has the special Legacy Edition for just $29.99.\n\n\"FIFA 15\" for 3DS is rated an 8 or a \"great\" rating by Gamespot and averages an 82 on metacritic.com.\n\nMaybe you want to play a shooting game with your 3DS. For just $19.99 you can buy \"Call of Duty Black Ops\" from Best Buy. They have a price match guarantee and even price match with Amazon.
