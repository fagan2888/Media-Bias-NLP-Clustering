Letter: Wide divide for Trump, Clinton

The presidential primaries have emphasized that the electorate is angry with Washington and the politicians who are in control. It is easy to understand the public's frustration, given the ongoing dysfunction of government. In my opinion, this dysfunction is a result of too many ideologues and too few statesmen in Congress.

A "statesman" is an individual who exhibits wisdom and courage in directing the affairs of government and in dealing with important public issues. A statesman will work for the collective good and will compromise a position to achieve that goal. By contrast, the "ideologue" has no interest in the collective good and sees no reason to compromise.

Congress is currently being dominated by ideologues. The reign of the ideologues started when Republican voters decided to elect so-called tea party candidates to office. The electoral success of the tea party candidates resulted in a shift to the right by previously moderate Republicans and, in some cases, moderates even decided to abandon public office altogether.

To the shame of the Republican leadership, they have allowed this minority to dictate their agenda. In budget debates, the tea party has been willing to shut down the government in pursuit of its narrow agenda. Rather than working on common-good issues such as improving the Affordable Care Act or enacting immigration reform, Republicans have focused on ideological issues such as defunding Planned Parenthood and opposing same-sex marriage.

Our country desperately needs statesmen in Congress and the White House come January. Regarding the presumptive presidential candidates, Donald Trump is neither an ideologue nor a statesman, he is a loose canon; Hillary Clinton is not an ideologue, but rather, a statesman.
