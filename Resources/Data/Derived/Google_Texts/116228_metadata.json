and to create a state-controlled insurance exchange have consequences,\u201d Goodwin wrote. \u201cAs health insurers merge and consolidate, withdraw from our market and reduce the areas in which they

reform is driving up insurance costs, reducing consumer options and making it impossible for insurers to profitably sell policies in North Carolina.Most recently, he said, all three insurers on the federal insurance exchange have eliminated agent commissions for selling individual policies in the state.\u201cInsurers cannot continue to have annual losses in the hundreds of millions and be

largest health insurance company, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, said it may not offer ACA plans next year.Due to significant losses, the insurer said it could pull out of the individual market in the
