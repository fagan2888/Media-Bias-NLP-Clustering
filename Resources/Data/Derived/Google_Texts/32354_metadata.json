With a first-degree burn, there is oftentime swelling and minor pain. A second-degree burn, where the second layer of skin has burned through, produces severe pain and blisters. A third-degree burn is the most serious of burns; all of the skin's layers are burnt, exposing fat, muscle, and even bones.\n\nTwo years ago, Dr. J\u00f6rg Gerlach thought that he might have a solution to help speed up the recovery process for many burn victims. It\u2019s called the Skin Cell Gun, and it takes a person\u2019s own skin cells, adds them to a water-like solution, and sprays them back on. The healing time is quicker than conventional skin grafting techniques, taking approximately three to four days.\n\nWhen this gun was first introduced it helped to heal only a several dozen patients. And because it was only in its prototype stage there wasn\u2019t that much evidence to support long-term stability. There hasn\u2019t been much news about it since its original introduction to the scientific community.\n\nTake a look at the video below, showing Matthew Uran, a state police officer who was burned in a Fourth of July bonfire gone wrong. The side of his body was completely burned, and his arm \u201clooked like a piece of charred meat, like someone had left a hot dog on too long.\u201d\n\nAfter being one of the first people to use the Skin Cell Gun, Uran healed in a matter of days. \u201cThey did it on a Friday, and my follow up was on Monday \u2014 the burn unit said it was healed,\u201d he said.\n\nWARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT\n\n.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "skin cell gun", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Skin Cell Gun supposedly cut down healing time for burn patients by weeks.", "title": "What Happened To The Skin Cell Gun?
