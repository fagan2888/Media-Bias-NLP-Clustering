George Cardenas (12th), chief sponsor of the so-called \u201csweetened beverage tax,\u201d said it would be easier for Chicagoans to swallow than the new $11- or $12-per-month garbage collection fees Mayor Rahm Emanuel has told aldermen he will include in his 2016 budget plan.\n\nCardenas chairs the City Council Health Committee, held a public hearing on the sugary drink tax on Wednesday. He has argued the tax would help combat health problems like diabetes and obesity. He has estimated it could generate $134 million in new revenue for the city, and more than replace the $100 million in garbage collection fees the mayor\u2019s office has suggested.\n\nThe penny-an-ounce tax on sugary drinks would include soda, energy drinks, juices, and teas. Consumers would pay $1.44 more for a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans, and 66 cents more for a two-liter bottle.\n\nThe tax also would apply to fountain drinks, as well as syrups and powders used to make soda or other sugary drinks at home.\n\nThe plan has met with opposition from the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, the Illinois Restaurant Association, and the American Beverage Association.\n\nWBBM 780\u2019s Craig Dellimore WBBM 780/105.9FM playpause\n\nIllinois Retail Merchants Association general counsel Tanya Triche said relying on the sugary drink tax to replace revenue from a garbage collection fee is a losing idea.\n\nBeverages Subject To Sugar Tax\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about a garbage fee, you\u2019re talking about a stable source of income: home ownership, which has been fairly stable in the city of Chicago. When you\u2019re talking about a consumption tax, like this, it\u2019s an unstable source of revenue, because people can easily avoid it by going outside of the city to purchase those products. So, why you would replace something that\u2019s stable with something that\u2019s not stable defies logic,\u201d she said.\n\nIllinois Restaurant Association president Sam Toia said the sugary drink tax would hurt businesses, and cost jobs.\n\n\u201cThis tax would drive up costs for thousands of restaurants in our city; increase prices for diners, shoppers, and families; and ultimately reduce jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cThe restaurant industry, we\u2019re getting nickeled and dimed to death. We had the entry-level wage go up, the Affordable Care Act, we look like we\u2019re going to have property taxes going up, and now it looks like there could be a third tax on soda pop.\u201d\n\nCardenas said the tax is a way to hold the soft drink industry accountable for its unhealthy sugary products.\n\n\u201cYou have Coca-Cola in this case, and if I can say so, spending a billion dollars in marketing,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we counter that with children being bombarded by sugary drinks?\u201d\n\nHowever, the groups noted Chicago already levies two separate taxes on soda \u2014 a 9 percent fountain drink tax paid on the syrup in sugary drinks and a 3 percent soft drink tax on cans and bottles of soda \u2014 which have not succeeded in reducing consumption of sugary drinks or fighting obesity and diabetes.\n\nFormer city Corporation Counsel Mara Georges joined the business groups to say the tax would be unconstitutional, because the city\u2019s taxes on sweetened drinks already are at the limit set by the state, and any increase would have to be applied to all goods equally at this point.\n\nThe state could raise the limit on the soft drink tax, however.\n\nNo vote was at Wednesday\u2019s hearing on the sweetened beverage tax, and Emanuel\u2019s office has not said if he supports the idea.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At least one alderman has called it a sweet idea -- a penny-an-ounce tax on sugary drinks -- but it's left a bad taste in the mouths of Chicago restaurants and retailers.
