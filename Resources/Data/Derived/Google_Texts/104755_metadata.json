With the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world \u2014 and about a quarter of the world\u2019s prisoners \u2014 the need for some structural changes is becoming quite clear. Yet focusing on incarceration can ignore another serious legal issue hitting young men especially hard: arrest rates.\n\nA new study released last Monday in the Crime & Delinquency journal, led by University of South Carolina criminology professor Robert Brame, finds that, \u201cBy age 18, 30 percent of black males, 26 percent of Hispanic males and 22 percent of white males have been arrested.\u201d Worse, by the time they reach age 23, those numbers increase to 49 percent, 44 percent, and 38 percent, respectively.\n\nNumbers for women trend much lower, but remain significant: \u201cBy age 23, arrest rates were 20 percent for white females and 18 percent and 16 percent for Hispanic and black females, respectively.\u201d\n\nOne might respond to Brame\u2019s study by saying arrests are not as meaningful as convictions and incarcerations. As the study points out, however, \u201cprevious research has suggested that the negative consequences of arrest (at least with respect to employment) occur even when arrest does not lead to conviction.\u201d At a time when labor force participation is sitting at its lowest since 1978, the impact of this can hardly be overstated.\n\nThis data also comes at a time where the conversation around marijuana decriminalization is really heating up. As drug-related arrests outpace almost all others nationwide, and with about a quarter of all state prison admissions in 2011 coming primarily from drug-related offenses \u2014 and half of all federal prison admissions in 2012 \u2014 it\u2019s stands to reason that those concerned with the future of our young people should also be taking a serious interest in the U.S. drug policy.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has been an outspoken advocate of several major reforms. He and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), have advocated creating a \u201csafety valve\u201d for those caught up in abuse of mandatory minimum provisions that result in absurdly long prison sentences for those committing nonviolent or coincidental crimes. Paul has also stood by the decriminalization of marijuana, saying that the goal for users \u201cis not to legalize them but not to incarcerate people for extended periods of time.\u201d\n\nPaul also has supported a devolution effort to put more power over drug laws into the hands of states. \u201c[M]ost policies of crime and punishment,\u201d he points out, \u201cshould be and are addressed at the state level.\u201d The state of California, for example, experienced a resounding success after loosening possession laws for marijuana, with drug arrests decreasing by nearly 50 percent between 2010 and 2011. Colorado and Washington state have gone even farther, with the opening of (heavily taxed) recreational marijuana outlets being approved by voters.\n\nFor many Americans, the response to all of this is a collective \u201cabout time.\u201d\n\nThe assumption that sits under any free society is this: Human beings are capable of self-government. If this were not true \u2014 and bear in mind, it was assumed not to be for the vast majority of human history \u2014 then liberal societies would be impossible. Yet by continuing to demonize and treat as criminal even the possession of small amounts of a drug like marijuana, we treat citizens like infants and cripple them from living free and fulfilling lives.\n\n\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019s unfortunate that this argument needs to be made. Marijuana has been given a bad rap: It\u2019s the drug for burnouts, bums, do-nothings and all-around losers. It deflates you (see?). To attach moral arguments about freedom and self-government to unappealing things is unpleasant, sure, but it is a duty.\n\nThe trend of decriminalization and legalization of \u201csoft\u201d drugs is thus a promising sign, especially to those for whom arrest at an early age can greatly damage career prospects and opportunities; but as government enforcement lifts, we must also take responsibility, both personally and in our communities, to make sure that greater liberty is put to responsible use.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "By now, just about everyone knows that the United States has something of an incarceration problem.
