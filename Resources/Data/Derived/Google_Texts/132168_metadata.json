The New York Times reports that the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has won an injunction \u201cthat blocks an Obama Administration requirement to provide contraceptive care to employees at its nonprofit affiliates:\u201d\n\n\n\nThe ruling found that the regulation violated the religious freedom of the four nonprofit groups \u2014 two high schools and two health care systems \u2014 that are affiliated with the archdiocese but employ people of any faith. Under the Affordable Care Act, the nonprofit groups were required to provide the contraceptive coverage, authorize a third party to voluntarily pay for and provide the coverage, or pay steep fines. The ruling, by Brian M. Cogan of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, found that forcing the groups to authorize a third party to provide contraceptive care still violated their religious beliefs even if they were not financially support contraception. Churches are already exempt from the mandate to provide contraceptive care.\n\nI believe the Times writer meant to say that the Administration would violate religious conscience even if the Archdiocese was \u201cnot required to financially support contraception,\u201d which was a key element of the government\u2019s case. They were essentially trying to construct a system that would obscure the financial connection between health care provided by the plaintiffs, and the contraceptive benefits mandated under ObamaCare. The idea was that the Archdiocese would sign off on the benefits, but wouldn\u2019t directly pay for them. It didn\u2019t fly with the judge, which seems awfully significant.\n\nJudge Cogan\u2019s decision was the first permanent injunction against the regulations. A temporary injunction was issued in favor of a nonprofit Catholic organization in Pennsylvania. The Archdiocese of New York, which sued along with the schools and hospitals, hailed the decision as a victory. \u201cThe court has correctly cut through the artificial construct which essentially made faith-based organizations other than churches and other houses of worship second-class citizens with second-class First Amendment protections,\u201d Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese, said in a statement.\n\nGabriel Malor at Ace of Spades has been justly hailed for writing an excellent breakdown of the decision. It\u2019s well worth a read in full; most major media reports I\u2019ve seen have greatly downplayed the severity of the spanking Judge Cogan administered to the Administration, particularly in the area of chastising the government for not really understanding how its own regulations work. Malor\u2019s fourth and fifth points seem especially ominous for the future of ObamaCare \u2013 in essence, the law has already been so sliced, diced, shredded, modified, and delayed by regulatory and executive fiat that it\u2019s hard to argue any portion of it retains a \u201ccompelling purpose.\u201d One might say that since the Administration doesn\u2019t take the Affordable Care Act seriously as \u201claw,\u201d judges won\u2019t either.\n\nThere are many legal arguments swirling around the ObamaCare mandates, but their central logical principle is easy enough to understand: the State\u2019s vision of our common social needs is far more important than anyone\u2019s right to invoke their conscience and disobey. But the Affordable Care Act died and began decomposing the moment it was born. It only exists at all today because so much of it has been delayed, modified, and suspended. How can anyone seriously argue that the State\u2019s vision, expressed through such a fractured lens, is more pure than the individual conscience of those who refuse to accept mandates that run contrary to their closely held beliefs?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "Why should courts take the Affordable Care Act seriously as law, when the Administration so clearly does not?", "title": "Catholic Archdiocese of New York wins injunction against ObamaCare mandates | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/archdiocese_ny-480x319.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/12/17/catholic-archdiocese-of-new-york-wins-injunction-against-obamacare-mandates/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "Why should courts take the Affordable Care Act seriously as law, when the Administration so clearly does not?", "twitter": {"site": "@humanevents", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/archdiocese_ny-480x319.jpg", "description": "Why should courts take the Affordable Care Act seriously as law, when the Administration so clearly does not?", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@Doc_0"}}, "article_summary": "Churches are already exempt from the mandate to provide contraceptive care.\nThe Archdiocese of New York, which sued along with the schools and hospitals, hailed the decision as a victory.\nThe idea was that the Archdiocese would sign off on the benefits, but wouldn\u2019t directly pay for them.\nA temporary injunction was issued in favor of a nonprofit Catholic organization in Pennsylvania.\nThey were essentially trying to construct a system that would obscure the financial connection between health care provided by the plaintiffs, and the contraceptive benefits mandated under ObamaCare."}
