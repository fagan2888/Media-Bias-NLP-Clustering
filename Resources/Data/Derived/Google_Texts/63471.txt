On “Morning Joe” today, Willie Geist asked if the North Koreans were capable of organizing a 9/11-style attack.

“North Korea never carries out its threats—except when it does,” said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation who focuses on North Korea.

Klingner detailed attacks orchestrated by the North Koreans, mostly on South Korea, such as jamming the signals of planes flying in and out of Seoul, blowing up an airliner, and assassination attempts on the South Korean president and defectors from the North Korean regime. They also have hacked into U.S. government agencies.

According to Klingner, an attack on U.S. soil is “far, far less likely,” but not impossible.

Steve Bucci, director of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign and National Security Policy at The Heritage Foundation, also appeared on the program to discuss cybersecurity.

“All Americans should be concerned about this,” said Bucci. “Everybody in the West should be concerned about their personal cyber security status and the status of their organizations. They have to take the right steps. If you don’t make the investment, somebody like North Korea could come in and get all of your information.”
