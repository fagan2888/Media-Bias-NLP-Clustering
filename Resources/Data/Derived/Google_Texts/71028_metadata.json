Republicans distanced themselves from Romney almost as quickly as they\u2019d turned away from former President George W. Bush.\n\nRelated: Romney: Lewinsky Affair is Bill\u2019s Failure, Not Hillary\u2019s\n\nRomney hoped at best to assume the role of elder statesman \u2013 a seasoned politician and businessman who could advise a fresh crop of GOP presidential wannabes. Just as he was being airbrushed from view by Republican strategists, former Secretary of State and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton seemingly donned the mantle of invincibility \u2013 and inevitability \u2013 as Obama\u2019s successor.\n\nWith her new book, Hard Choices, a sky-high public approval rating and the early semblance of a strong campaign apparatus, Clinton eclipsed Vice President Joe Biden and other Democrats with the temerity to think about challenging her for their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nLast week, Clinton stumbled badly out of the gate as she mounted her book tour and media blitz and even saw a dip in her overall popularity, while Romney savored a whiff of interest in a possible new candidacy.\n\nA new Bloomberg News poll indicates Clinton\u2019s once-overwhelming lead is beginning to shrink. The poll says 52 percent of Americans view her favorably, down from 56 percent in March and 70 percent at the end of 2012, as she was preparing to leave the State Dept.\n\nRomney, meanwhile, enjoyed a sudden surge in popularity \u2013 even blandishments from some establishment Republicans and business leaders to consider making another bid for the White House.\n\nRelated: 9 Takeaways from Hillary Clinton\u2019s New Memoir\n\nWhile a third Romney campaign must be treated as the longest of long shots, former GOP presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan proved that it sometimes takes multiple tries to win the highest office.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a remote chance, sure,\u201d that Romney might run again, University of Virginia political scientist Larry J. Sabato said in an interview. \u201cYou can conjure up wild scenarios that might produce a GOP deadlock, and the leadership grabs the only guy around who could quickly raise money and knows the ropes. But it\u2019s a tiny chance.\u201d\n\nRenewed interest in Romney may have begun with the Sundance Film Festival\u2019s screening last January of \u201cMitt,\u201d a sympathetic documentary that showed a much more human and introspective man than was seen during the campaign. Then, last week, Romney hosted a GOP summit and retreat in Park City, Utah, to help political leaders and conservative thinkers carve a winning path to the 2016 presidential election and beyond.\n\nRelated: Why Hillary Clinton Must Run in 2016\n\nThe summit drew party activists, business leaders and six GOP presidential aspirants, including N.J. Gov. Chris Christie, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rob Portman of Ohio, and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012. Romney waved off any suggestion he might consider running again and insisted others were just trying to make him feel good. \u201cI\u2019m not running and they know it,\u201d he told The LA Times.\n\nHowever, he could\u2019ve fooled a lot of people, according to The Washington Post. He sparked speculation with a \u201csweeping, campaign-style speech\u201d that skewered Obama\u2019s foreign policy decision-making and took Clinton to task as well. \u201cThe Obama-Biden-Hillary Clinton foreign policy is a monumental bust,\u201d Romney told a cheering throng.\n\nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough said during a private dinner during the conference that Romney \u201cis the only person that can fill the stage,\u201d according to The Post.\n\nFormer Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer, a maverick Democrat who befriended Romney when the two men were governors, also old reporters Romney would be \u201ca giant in a field of midgets\u201d if he were to run again.\n\nRelated: This Former Governor Wants Hillary\u2019s Spot in 2016\n\nSchweitzer, though, contemplating his own presidential bid, told Business Insider Monday, \u201cMitt Romney is not running for president or anything else,\u201d adding, \u201cIf I were a betting man, I\u2019d give you 4-to-1 odds.\u201d\n\nAs memories begin to fade about Romney\u2019s flaws as a politician and campaigner in the 2012 race, his strengths as a political leader, strategist, debater and business and government official may begin to appeal more to the rank and file. Last March, 34 percent of Republicans said in a Washington Post-ABC News poll they could definitely back him in the 2016 GOP primary.\n\nThat was the highest number recorded for any Republican. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee tied for second at 15 percent each.\n\nRoss Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University, calls the renewed interest in Romney among some as choosing \u201cany port in the storm.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a storm going on in the Republican Party right now and they\u2019re looking for a figure who represents stability, sanity in a sense \u2013 someone who the party has rallied around in the past,\u201d Baker said in an interview on Monday. \u201cI think they\u2019re groping for someone who has those qualities. There are not that many people around.\n\n\u201cRomney has a very soothing manner, he doesn\u2019t go out of his way to pick fights, and I think he\u2019s kind of a mediator \u2013 the kind of person you look for in a debate who is going to call it fair for both sides,\u201d Baker added.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Here\u2019s a 2016 presidential matchup that nobody seriously contemplated until now: Clint", "title": "How About This 2016 Matchup?
