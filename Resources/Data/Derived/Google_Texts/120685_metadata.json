In addition to regurgitating tired myths disseminated by extreme groups bent on eradicating all fossil fuels, it blatantly ignores proven scientific facts.\n\nIronically, however, ignorance is why CRED was formed and has continued to engage in a multi-year education effort. Although fracking has been around since 1947, many Coloradans admit they don\u2019t understand the process.\n\nCRED\u2019s mission is simple: Provide Coloradans the facts about fracking so they can make up their own mind.\n\nThe writer tries to characterize Colorado as the unregulated Wild West of fracking. Fortunately, that is another myth.\n\nColorado\u2019s stringent regulations have been called a model for the nation. Through collaborative efforts by environmentalists, regulators and the energy industry, Colorado was the first state in the country to pass groundbreaking methane regulations, require water sampling both before and after drilling and publicly disclose all chemicals \u2014 and their concentrations \u2014 in fracking fluid.\n\nThat information is available to anyone on FracFocus.org.\n\nAs to allegati0ns that water, land and air are being polluted and oil spills are rampant, the facts again prove otherwise.\n\nNot only is Colorado cutting carbon dioxide emissions, the state also has the most comprehensive leak detection and repair program for oil and natural gas production in the country.\n\nColorado is also producing more energy with less land disturbance, which is better for the environment.\n\nThanks to advancements in fracking technology and horizontal drilling, wells sites are 30 percent smaller today but produce 60 times more energy. And while oil production in Colorado is up, total oil spills are down.\n\nThis is true even as the legislature lowered the threshold for reporting spills.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency recently published a landmark report finding that fracking has had no \u201cwidespread, systemic impacts\u201d on the country\u2019s drinking water.\n\nIn Colorado, the EPA has never found an instance of hydraulic fracturing contaminating groundwater.\n\nTechnology is making drilling for oil and natural gas more efficient and safer than ever before. That fact ought to be celebrated, not twisted and distorted in order to scare Coloradans.\n\nKaren Crummy is communications adviser for Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Technology making oil and gas drilling safer than ever", "title": "Guest Commentary: Technology making oil and gas drilling safer than ever", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/02/guest-commentary-technology-making-oil-and-gas-drilling-safer-than-ever/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150702__20150705_Z00_OP05C_CRUMMYp1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150702__20150705_Z00_OP05C_CRUMMYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-02T11:22:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T15:22:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ad8\"", "article_summary": "Technology is making drilling for oil and natural gas more efficient and safer than ever before.\nThanks to advancements in fracking technology and horizontal drilling, wells sites are 30 percent smaller today but produce 60 times more energy.\nAnd while oil production in Colorado is up, total oil spills are down.\nAs to allegati0ns that water, land and air are being polluted and oil spills are rampant, the facts again prove otherwise.\nCRED\u2019s mission is simple: Provide Coloradans the facts about fracking so they can make up their own mind."}
