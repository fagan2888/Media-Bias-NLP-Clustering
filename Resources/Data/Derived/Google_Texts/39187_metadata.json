Middle schools are using them mostly in science classes and in some social studies classes.\n\nStudents at the district\u2019s two STEM magnet schools, including STEM Launch, where Lisa Meier teaches, have access beginning in fifth grade.\n\nSTEM Launch principal Kellie Lauth\n\nsaid the digital books are more versatile for teachers and also help save money.\n\n\u201cTechbooks, over the long term, are more cost-effective, especially in science, where you purchase a book and it\u2019s almost outdated in a year,\u201d Lauth said.\n\nAnd while the school doesn\u2019t have enough laptops to give one to every student, the Techbook is Web-based, which means students can access it from a variety of other devices, as well as from home.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never before been able to offer each student a single resource (like a textbook to take home),\u201d Lauth said. \u201cWith Techbooks, they each have their own log-in.\u201d\n\nAs a way to ignite some excitement around the new digital books, students also participated in an assembly Thursday with former teacher Patti Duncan, who now works with Discovery.\n\nEmphasizing that scientists must ask a lot of questions and make a lot of observations, Duncan set up some experiments and made students question how energy worked.\n\nTeachers are also receiving support from Discovery and are providing feedback to the company. Based on that, the book can be updated without a new purchase \u2014 another benefit of going digital.\n\nTechbooks, which were launched in 2011, are now used nationwide.\n\nLocally, Littleton Public Schools and the Thompson School District are among the many other districts using Techbooks. Douglas County Schools is working with the Denver-based Morgridge Family Foundation to get the digital books into one its schools.\n\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or twitter.com/yeseniarobles\n\nThis story has been corrected in this online archive.
