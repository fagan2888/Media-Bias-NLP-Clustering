That\u2019s cruel. That\u2019s inappropriate,\u201d Bevin said.\n\nBevin also criticized a recent study touted by Gov. Steve Beshear that said Medicaid expansion had created 12,000 more jobs in Kentucky and will create $40,000 new jobs and $30 billion to the state\u2019s economy through 2021.\n\nDuring a press conference after the forum, Bevin called the study \u201cgibberish\u201d and \u201cfaulty.\u201d\n\nBevin and Conway, who both live in Louisville, stressed their agricultural roots during the forum\u2014Bevin highlighted his experiences growing up on a farm and Conway talked about his family\u2019s roots in Union County.\n\nConway accused Bevin of not supporting farm subsidies, saying Bevin railed against the farm bill during his 2014 senate campaign.\n\nRelated Story A Kentucky Governor From Jefferson County?
