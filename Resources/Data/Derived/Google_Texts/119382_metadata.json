That brings the average cost of health insurance per employee to $42,770 in 2014. By comparison, Los Angeles paid an average of $13,889 per employee, while Beverly Hills averaged about $23,000.\n\nThe recipients of Industry\u2019s highest cost health benefits ranged from its top executives to its lowest assistants. Even two planning commissioners, who earned less than $9,000 a year in salary, received the costly benefit, according to a compensation report. Other employees with similar titles or even identical positions received lower contributions, sometimes less than half what their colleagues got.\n\nSome Industry employees also benefit from significantly below-market city housing. The revelations are the just latest in a series of news stories scrutinizing the city, whose $140 million in revenues serve about 400 residents.\n\nCity Manager Paul Philips, hired six months ago, offered little explanation for the high health insurance costs.\n\nHe said Industry doesn\u2019t cover anything unusual or exceptional in its benefits, which are provided through Aetna. City staff are in the process of reviewing the insurance costs, he added.\n\n\u201cWe are digging into it. I should know more in a month,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also questioned the accuracy of the numbers.\n\nLike it does for cities across the state, Transparent California directly requested the compensation and benefit information from Industry through a public records request.\n\nWhen Fellner saw Industry\u2019s numbers, he thought someone had made a mistake. He sent an email to Industry Deputy Clerk Cecelia Dunlap requesting confirmation. In a subsequent email exchange, which included Philips, Dunlap made minor adjustments to the numbers but confirmed their high amount.\n\nFellner said his organization found that Industry\u2019s spending topped every other city in the state \u2014 by a lot. The runner-up, Sonoma, had an average nearly $20,000 less than Industry\u2019s average, according to their ranking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCity of Industry is off the map,\u201d Fellner said.\n\nThe high cost left some experts scratching their heads, too.\n\nNadereh Pourat, director of research for UCLA\u2019s Center for Health Policy Research, called the benefits \u201cvery odd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt boggles the mind, I don\u2019t know what that money could be spent on,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said an employer\u2019s contribution increases when it doesn\u2019t split the cost with its employees, when the plan covers specialized services \u2014 such as fertility treatments \u2014 and when it reduces the out-of-pocket expenses for employees.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t pass on any of the cost to the employee, then the premium price will go up,\u201d she said.\n\nEven then, Industry\u2019s contributions were high, she said.\n\nNationally, the annual premiums for employer-sponsored health coverage cost an average of $16,834 in 2014, including both the employer and the employee\u2019s contributions, according to an annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The survey doesn\u2019t include dental and vision, but even when the average is doubled, it\u2019s still nearly $10,000 away from Industry\u2019s numbers.\n\nCalifornia Healthcare Foundation crunches the state\u2019s average through its own survey. In 2014, employers contributed an average of $13,109 per employee annually for family plans in California. Employees paid $4,499 of that cost.\n\n\u201cIt just seems like a lot for a city,\u201d said Robbin Gaines, senior program officer for the California Healthcare Foundation.\n\nLike Pourat, she said an employer\u2019s costs rise if they pick up more of the share. Other factors that could raise the price include having high-risk employees, having older employees and just offering better coverage, she said.\n\nAs part of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration pushed a \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on expensive healthcare plans, with the aim of discouraging employers from buying overpriced plans. It imposes a 40 percent excise tax on healthcare policies above a certain cap: $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for a family. The tax was expected to go into effect in 2018, however, the omnibus budget passed in December delayed the implementation until 2020.\n\nOther cities and government agencies in Southern California could also be subject to the tax, according to a recent report by Transparent California.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The City of Industry pays more than double the state average for health care benefits for many of its 33 employees.
