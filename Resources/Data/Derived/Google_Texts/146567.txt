Obamacare is working! That’s what Democrats and their media parrots keep saying. Except that it isn’t, and the same people who rammed through the law want to “fix” it:

With millions more covered, Democrats see high deductibles, copays as next health care issue. http://t.co/Ue7S344KSN — AP Politics (@AP_Politics) May 23, 2015

In that article, the AP didn’t seem too interested in pointing out the irony of the Democrats scrambling to fix problems they created.

It’s referred to as “skimpy insurance.” You know what that means the “solution” will be:

Ding! Ding! Unbelievable. The “Affordable” Care Act is unaffordable and short on “care”:

After paying premiums, many low- and middle-income patients still face high costs when trying to use their coverage. There’s growing concern that the value of a health insurance card is being eaten away by rising deductibles, the amount of actual medical costs that patients pay each year before coverage kicks in. “I think it’s going to be the next big problem,” said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., a congressional leader on health care. “We’ve got some 17 million more people covered … but they can’t access the care they seem to be entitled to,” McDermott said. “It costs too much to use the care. That’s the deceptive part about it.”

“Deceptive” is right — and that’s from a congressman who voted for it. But other than that, the law’s working great!

So who’s up for letting the same people who created the problem provide the “fix”?

Why is this a problem? It’s called the AFFORDABLE Care Act. https://t.co/kay8UvEklt — Jay Caruso (@JayCaruso) May 23, 2015

@AP_Politics @AP Jeez, you're not just carrying water for the left. You're changing their bedpans and wiping their asses too. Pathetic. — Gary Eaton (@garysteveneaton) May 23, 2015

@AP_Politics @AP as "next" issue? Our premiums doubled while our coverage shrank. Thanks! — Kyle Jordan (@kj_106) May 23, 2015

@AP_Politics @AP underinsurance? really? Dems & Obama had no idea what was in the law when they voted to pass, now won't admit we're screwed — David Gritts (@dlgritts) May 23, 2015

@AP_Politics @AP @TheDemocrats how about exorbitant premiums? — TB (@tbagnulo) May 23, 2015

But hey, if the government is too bloated and incompetent to handle part of the health care system, maybe they should be allowed to run the whole thing:
