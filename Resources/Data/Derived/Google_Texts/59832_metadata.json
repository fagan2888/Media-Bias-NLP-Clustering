However, these setbacks have not deterred Obama, and other gun grabbers, infringing on our right to keep and bear arms. All it has done is force them to change their tactics. Having failed to achieve those means through Congress, as well as repeated attempts through the ATF, they are now attempting to do so in small increments.\n\nAccording to the LA Times, his administration is looking to pushing to ban Social Security beneficiaries from owning guns if they \u201clack the mental capacity to manage their own affairs, a move that could affect millions whose monthly disability payments are handled by others.\u201d\n\nThe story reads:\n\n\u201cThe push is intended to bring the Social Security Administration in line with laws regulating who gets reported to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, which is used to prevent gun sales to felons, drug addicts, immigrants in the country illegally and others. \u2026. Though such a ban would keep at least some people who pose a danger to themselves or others from owning guns, the strategy undoubtedly would also include numerous people who may just have a bad memory or difficulty balancing a checkbook, the critics argue.\n\nThis is just one more blatant attempt to use a federal bureaucracy to carry out gun control measures through indirect means. As we\u2019ve repeatedly stated, thefeds have no business deciding who can and cannot keep and bear arms. TheSecond Amendment makes it clear.\n\nAdditionally, even if they had the authority, they lack the competency.\n\nDylann Roof, who is accused of the June 17 Charleston church shooting, wasonly able to purchase a firearm due to \u201clapses\u201d in the FBI database, as a previous drug crime would have made him ineligible. Federal gun control is not just unconstitutional, but it\u2019s based on a fairy tale assumption that those who fail them will not see other means of committing violence.\n\nYet, gun control advocates will press onward, and unless we are there to oppose them, they will eventually gain victories that will be hard to overturn.\n\nThe best way to prevent this is by having states pass their own Second Amendment Protection Act (SAPA), which would nullify any gun control measures they try to push through in D.C. Without the local law enforcement to enforce these \u201cdecrees,\u201d it will be on the feds to carry them out, which theydon\u2019t have the resources to do.\n\nLet\u2019s keep Obama \u201cfrustrated\u201d for the rest of his presidency by ensuring any gun control measures, whether effected during his tenure or a future president\u2019s, are dead on arrival (DOA).\n\nWhen tyrants are stymied, patriots rejoice.\n\nSign our petition, review our model legislation for states, and spread the word!\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "With all the inroads made by the federal government against liberty, sometimes it is easy to forget the small victories that show the battle is not lost", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center Blog", "description": "With all the inroads made by the federal government against liberty, sometimes it is easy to forget the small victories that show the battle is not lost.\u00a0 One such area is the right to keep and bear arms.
