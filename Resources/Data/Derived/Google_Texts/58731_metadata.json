Dannel P. Malloy has issued an executive order that could halt the proposed merger between Yale New Haven Health Services Corp. and the Lawrence + Memorial Corp. in New London.\n\nHe is asking that the Office of Health Care Access and the state Department of Social Services not make a final decision on any proposed consolidation of hospital systems until January 2017, after a new task force reviews whether changes are needed in the review process.\n\nThe specifics of the order appear to be applicable only to the Yale New Haven Health System and Hartford HealthCare, the largest in terms of operating revenues in the state.\n\nCharlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington announced Thursday that it was investigating an affiliation with Hartford HealthCare, which already has five hospitals within its orbit. The Yale system has Yale-New Haven Hospital, Bridgeport Hospital, Greenwich Hospital and the former Hospital of Saint Raphael.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe governor is concerned about the increasing number of proposed mergers or affiliations \u201cfor reasons other than significant financial distress.\u201d There has been much discussion in the legislature and nationally on the effect of mergers on competition, access and prices.\n\nIf OCHA legally is required to make a decision before next year, the order directs it to reject requests from hospital systems where consolidation would result in operating revenues in excess of 20 percent of the total operating revenues for the 28 hospitals in Connecticut.\n\nThe Yale New Haven Health System in 2014 already had operating revenues of $3.4 billion, according to OCHA, which was equal to more than 27 percent of the total for all the hospitals.\n\nHartford HealthCare\u2019s operating revenues were $2.5 billion that fiscal year, or just over 20 percent of the total.\n\nThe order not only took the hospitals by surprise, but also lawmakers, unions and health care advocates who have been working for more in-depth reviews of consolidations.\n\nNeither the office of Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven, nor that of Senate Minority Leader Leonard Fasano, R-North Haven, knew that the order was about to be posted. Looney and Fasano, who differ on many policies, have been on the same page on hospital issues.\n\nA study issued by union and health care advocates in December concluded that allowing the Yale New Haven system to merge with Lawrence + Memorial Health would put upward pressure on prices, a position that Yale has disputed.\n\nLooney said the data in the report suggest that the state\u2019s hospital markets are already concentrated and the purchase of Lawrence + Memorial would further that along the Shoreline.\n\nMalloy, in his order, said the certificate of need process overseen by OCHA has been piecemeal for too long and a comprehensive review was in order.\n\n\u201cWith continuing changes in the health care industry, it is critical that our state laws ensure that all hospitals continue to thrive, and that the deck is not stacked in favor of fewer than a handful that dominate the marketplace. We need balance. Fewer health care systems mean fewer choices for consumers, and that can dramatically affect both the quality of care and costs. It\u2019s time we take a holistic look at the acquisition process,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nMichele Sharp, a spokeswoman for the Connecticut Hospital Association, said it was examining the executive order, \u201cbut we have grave concerns about a blanket moratorium on acquisitions and conversions, including those already in process. Hospital integration is part of a shift to adjust to healthcare sector changes, including the impact of healthcare reform. Healthcare reform requires hospitals to find new strategies to reduce the cost of care by operating as efficiently as possible while providing excellent, integrated quality care.\u201d\n\nVincent Petrini, senior vice president for public affairs at Yale-New Haven Hospital, also said they are studying the executive order, but \u201cit seems to have a disproportional impact on Connecticut-based health systems.\u201d\n\nHe said these partnerships create efficiencies of scale necessary to respond to changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act and to survive increasing taxes and inadequate reimbursements by Medicaid.\n\nPetrini said they hoped OCHA would conclude its review of the Lawrence + Memorial affiliation by the summer. Putting a moratorium in place until January creates \u201ca much higher degree of uncertainty in the regulatory process,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his view, \u201cConnecticut is incredibly competitive,\u201d given the affiliations by a number of hospitals with larger out-of-state systems.\n\nBoth Looney and Fasano have asked OCHA to press the Yale New Haven system for pricing data after it brought three other hospitals under its aegis.\n\nHealth advocates and union leaders were happy with the governor\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cGovernor Malloy today took a vital step to protect Connecticut patients, health care workers and taxpayers. The Governor\u2019s Executive Order will open breathing room for a measured assessment of the impact of growing hospital and physician monopolies on communities across the state,\u201d said Laurie Kennington, Unite Here Local 34, which represents workers at the Yale School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cConnecticut\u2019s two largest hospital systems \u2014 Yale-New Haven Health System and Hartford HealthCare \u2014 are actively seeking to buy more hospitals and doctors\u2019 practices. This is the right moment to create a framework to ensure that expansion promotes appropriate competition, access to services and affordable health care,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is phenomenal,\u201d said Ellen Andrews, executive director of the Connecticut Health Policy Project.\n\n\u201cIt is a really good policy in terms of preventing market concentration and providing patient choice,\u201d Andrews said.\n\nJan Hochadel, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, Connecticut, which represents personnel at Lawrence + Memorial, weighed in with a similar observation.\n\n\u201cOne of the lessons learned from the recent gutting of services at Windham Hospital is that current patient and community protections are not always sufficient,\u201d Hochadel said.\n\nShe said the merger of Yale New Haven Health System with Lawrence + Memorial is \u201ccreating more questions than answers. The proposed task force is an opportunity to take an honest look at whether these and other consolidations are actually serving the needs of patients, caregivers and communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, New Haven Politics news, CT Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "Malloy order could halt Yale New Haven, Lawrence + Memorial merger", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/government-and-politics/20160225/malloy-order-could-halt-yale-new-haven-lawrence-memorial-merger", "image": {"width": "488px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160225/NEWS/160229690/AR/0/AR-160229690.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "325px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Malloy order could halt Yale New Haven, Lawrence + Memorial merger"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "HARTFORD >> Gov.
