The charitable writeoff is one of the largest, worth some $175 billion in tax year 2011, according to Internal Revenue Service data. (Americans give away far more than that, but only those who itemize on their tax returns are allowed to take the charitable deduction.)\n\nYet much of that is, like the Durdens' donation, cash gifts to religious institutions or other local nonprofits. And few of these donors pay much attention to the letters they receive (or don't) in return, simply setting them aside for their accountants to deal with later.\n\n\"The burden falls on the donor, and there's nothing to enforce it against the charity,\" says Ellen Aprill, a tax law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. \"It's because a lot of people were cheating and claiming that things they gave as quid pro quo were donations.\"\n\nHere are three charitable donation pitfalls to avoid.\n\n1. Vaguely worded thank-you notes\n\nThe wording of thank-you letters is important, and those who get receipts that leave out the magic words about no gifts or services being exchanged for the donation do not meet the IRS standard.\n\nRELATED: 13 TAX BREAKS YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF\n\n\"It's very common,\" Aprill says.\n\nBig donors may encounter this problem more often than others. While the small fry get boilerplate letters, perhaps drawn up by a lawyer who knows the ins and outs of the tax rules, big donors may get personalized letters from organization's executive directors that leave out the magic words.\n\nIn fact, Aprill's brother, as the executive director of a nonprofit in Chicago, once sent her a thank-you letter that wasn't exact enough for the tax rules, lacking the proper wording of \"no goods or services.\"\n\n2. Giving to individuals, not organizations\n\nRecord-keeping problems aren't all that can trip up efforts to get back a little on taxes for your generosity. Tax rules only allow you to take the writeoff for funds you give to a qualified nonprofit. If you give to an individual, no matter how worthy, that's a gift, and it's not deductible.\n\nIn the current landscape of immediate, emotionally charged giving - where many people's impulse after watching a tragedy unfold in real time on television or online is to help - it's easy to get tripped up.\n\nRELATED: WHY MORE AFFLUENT AMERICANS PAY NO TAXES\n\nGive money directly to the survivors or the Boston marathon bombing? Not deductible. Give it to an official nonprofit set up to help those survivors? Fine.\n\nIf you aren't sure whether a charity meets the tax standards, you can search the IRS's database of qualified groups here: www.irs.gov/Charities-&-Non-Profits/Exempt-Organizations-Select-Check .\n\n3. Donating property without an appraisal\n\nThings get more complicated with donations of property or artwork, where differences of opinion over what something is worth can amount of thousands (or millions) of dollars.\n\nAttorney Fromm says he has been seeing more issues with conservation easements, where someone grants an easement of their property and takes a deduction for its valuation in excess of what they may have been paid for it. \"The rub is, what is the value of the easement?\" he says. \"People get into arguments with the IRS.\"\n\nFor those who donate property, it's crucial to get an independent appraisal. As the Mohamed case showed, even if your donation is worth more than you claim, if you try to determine its value yourself, you could lose the writeoff. \"The IRS will go after procedural faults because valuation faults are so difficult to prove,\" Aprill says.\n\nRELATED: THE 10 WORST TAX MISTAKES YOU CAN MAKE\n\nFor smaller items, like cars - which have their own special rules - it can also get tricky. If you're donating your clunker, and it's worth more than $500, your deduction is limited to the amount the charity sells it for. You'll need documentation on that, too. \"Car donations are kind of a mess,\" says Robin Christian, a senior tax analyst at Thomson Reuters.\n\nThose unlucky enough to get audited stand to lose more than their charitable deduction. They can also be dinged for interest and penalties on the underpayment.\n\n\"If a client goes through an audit,\" says Fromm, who has handled many of them, \"they never want to do it again.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With U.S. income tax rates up this year, more Americans will likely be looking for charitable donations that can offset their higher tax bills.
