The defeat was not exactly unexpected, but now it\u2019s finally happened, and Rubio is out, and here we are.\n\nSo goodbye to Marco.\n\nNow let\u2019s dispel, once and for all, with this fiction that he was a moderate candidate or the candidate of the future or whatever other things Rubio was supposed to be for the Republican Party. He is a deeply conservative guy who was elected by the Tea Party and shares many policy positions with Trump.\n\nYou can argue that Trump came late to the conservative cause. And Rubio\u2019s rhetoric is definitely softer: Even as he dropped out, he spoke of a need for a politics based on ideas, \u201cnot on fear, not on anger, not on preying on people\u2019s frustrations.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest difference between the two in this campaign, beyond how they packaged their ideas, is that Republicans actually voted for Donald Trump and they didn\u2019t vote for Marco Rubio.\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump has pledged to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d along the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nSo has Rubio, though he was admittedly less focused on its aesthetic qualities. \u201cFirst, we must secure our border\u2014the physical border\u2014with a wall, absolutely,\u201d the Florida senator said during an early Republican debate last September.\n\nAnd while Rubio initially said that repealing President Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would be \u201cdisruptive,\u201d he later pledged to repeal it on his first day in office, a move that would put hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the U.S. as children at risk for deportation. In terms of changing the immigration system already in place, Rubio has acknowledged that his self-described merit system would probably prevent men and women like his own parents from entering the United States.\n\nTrump, for what it\u2019s worth, has also said he\u2019s into this kind of merit system even as he\u2019s pledged to deport 11 million people.\n\nClimate change\n\nTrump has said it was a \u201cjoke\u201d when he tweeted that climate change was a hoax being perpetrated by China, but was not joking when he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, back in September, that he was \u201cnot a believer\u201d in manmade climate change.\n\n\u201cUnless somebody can prove something to me, I believe there\u2019s weather,\u201d he continued. \u201cI believe there\u2019s change, and I believe it goes up and it goes down, and it goes up again. And it changes depending on years and centuries, but I am not a believer, and we have much bigger problems.\u201d\n\nCompare that with Rubio\u2019s remarks from the last Republican debate, when he declined to acknowledge the scientific consensus on manmade climate change:\n\nThere\u2019s never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policymaker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing, and, if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it? So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it\u2019s caused by two things. Number one, South Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation. And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there\u2019s no such thing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a time when the climate has not changed\u201d is a slightly more coherent version of \u201cI believe there\u2019s change, and I believe it goes up and it goes down.\u201d Both are outright rejections of scientific consensus.\n\nReproductive health\n\nDonald Trump has called himself \u201cvery pro-life,\u201d and pledged to defund Planned Parenthood\u2014just like every other Republican running for president. Including Marco Rubio.\n\nRubio also distinguished himself early in the primary by staking out a position against abortion in all cases, including rape and incest. He reiterated the point as recently as February. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation,\u201d Rubio said in an interview on ABC News. \u201cI mean, a crisis pregnancy, especially as a result of something as horrifying as [rape], I\u2019m not telling you it\u2019s easy. I\u2019m not here saying it\u2019s an easy choice. It\u2019s a horrifying thing that you\u2019ve just described.\u201d\n\nRelated Who's still standing after Tuesday's primaries\u2014and who might have just joined the race\n\n\u201cI get it,\u201d he added. \u201cI really do. And that\u2019s why this issue is so difficult. But I believe a human being, an unborn child, has a right to live, irrespective of the circumstances of which they were conceived.\u201d\n\nRubio was also the sponsor of a bill that would have allowed employers to deny contraceptive coverage to employees if they claimed a religious objection. It was basically the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling before there was the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\nRefugees\n\nDonald Trump is succinct about his position on letting Syrian refugees fleeing war and death into the United States: \u201cWe cannot let them into this country, period. Our country has tremendous problems. We can\u2019t have another problem.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio needs a few more words to reach essentially the same point: \u201cMy argument is that we can\u2019t allow anyone into this country that we can\u2019t vet,\u201d Rubio said back in November. \u201cAnd I believe that the vast majority of refugees that are trying to come here are people we will not be able to vet.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated on the point on his website, repeating his claim about background checks (that are already in place): \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to take more refugees. It\u2019s not that we aren\u2019t compassionate. But we can\u2019t. There\u2019s no way to background check them.\u201d\n\nMinimum wage\n\nDonald Trump says the minimum wage is too high.\n\nMarco Rubio acknowledged that it was so low that people couldn\u2019t live on it, then said he still wouldn\u2019t raise it.\n\nRubio, like Trump, holds a lot of positions that are popular in the Republican Party. That does\u2019t make him moderate, it makes him representative of his party\u2019s basic platform.\n\nBut Republican voters preferred Trump\u2019s platform of constructing a border wall, repealing the Affordable Care Act, defunding Planned Parenthood, cutting taxes for the wealthy, and denying the scientific consensus on climate change to Rubio\u2019s platform of constructing a border wall, repealing the Affordable Care Act, defunding Planned Parenthood, cutting taxes for the wealthy, and denying the scientific consensus on climate change.\n\nYou win some, you lose some.
