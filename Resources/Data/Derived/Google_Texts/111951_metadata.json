It comforts me to believe that the person who typed that sentence may have winced just a little.\n\nBut, as you\u2019ve no doubt have heard, Obama has been on a roll since the midterms. After the president announced that he would restore a full diplomatic relationship between Cuba and United States, Al Hunt claimed that no president in history had ever \u201cexperienced as severe an election drubbing as Barack Obama did in November and followed it with such a politically triumphant six weeks.\u201d (Gloria Borger just goes ahead and compares him to Superman.)\n\nTo be fair, there is a rather narrow sample size for that kind of declaration. But what exactly does triumph looked like? The Cuba issue, while a good talker, probably isn\u2019t the kind issue that most Americans are exceedingly concerned about. As we see how that shakes out, there are other wins that exist only in the imagination.\n\nHunt and Politico both tout the fact that 2.5 million Americans recently signed up in Obamacare marketplaces. For starters, meeting self-declared enrollment expectations for a program that is both coerced and subsidized is probably a lot less impressive as a policy achievement than the DC media might imagine. As for voters, it\u2019s just as plausible that those who oppose Obamacare \u2013 still a majority of Americans \u2013 look at the solidifying of bad policy as a negative development rather than a win.\n\nAnother hopeful comeback storyline hinges on the idea that the president is finally going be credited for the longest job growth streak since the 1990s. That seems to lack a certain context. Though there are sycophantic partisans ready to put Obama on the $20 bill, the fact remains we are living through one the most brittle and stagnant recoveries in the history of the United States \u2013 a recovery that is, in part, being driven by the kind of low energy prices Obama has opposed and worked against. Perhaps a rare example of the wisdom of crowds, voters have probably hit a point where they believe the economy is recovering despite the help of Washington. Certainly an improving economy is bound to alleviate some of the electorate\u2019s anxiety. But the idea that Obama\u2019s tenure will be remembered fondly for a time of economic growth seems to be a longshot.\n\nOtherwise, there is even less than meets the eye.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s done more on environmental protections than any previous president,\u201d Politico says. Part of this is the new EPA standards and part of this can be attributed to new international climate deals.\n\nThough I imagine the people who passed the Clean Water Act or the Clean Air Act might disagree with this assertion, I\u2019m told that huge things are going on. Though executive fiat is no way to run a country, we should probably wait to see the economic consequences of the EPA crackdown on modern energy production before we judge it\u2019s political worth. And, though in theory, most people support climate deals, the media\u2019s exhilaration over a non-binding climate deal that demands the Chinese do nothing until 2030 \u2013 perhaps ever \u2013 wasn\u2019t exactly shared by the public. I imagine there will be similar contrived enthusiasm generated about the feeble climate deal being worked out in Peru. It is unlikely that the deal will ever be ratified by the United States Senate. But even if Obama worked his executive magic and bypassed the process, and even if by some miracle emerging economic powers took the deal seriously, as it stands now, the deal isn\u2019t even a victory for liberals.\n\nWe can also argue on what immigration policy should look like, but there is little evidence that Obama\u2019s executive action shielding up to 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation is a political win. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released before Obama\u2019s speech, 48 percent opposed Obama\u2019s plan to unilaterally legislate immigration reform, while 38 percent support such action. Fourteen percent had no opinion or were unsure. And since then, most polls have shown \u2013depending on how you ask the question \u2013that this is deeply divisive issue. When you specifically ask about unilateral nature of the action, polling is negative.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 12:31:17 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "There's a big story emerging in D.C.: Barack Obama is making a comeback.
