But it does give them health insurance.\n\nSome high-profile Republicans are outraged (on the outside but probably turning cartwheels on the inside) about the conclusion by the Congressional Budget Office that a few million Americans will decide to quit their jobs or work fewer hours because they\u2019ll be getting subsidized health insurance from the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nWhy would the supply of labor fall by the equivalent of 2 million full-time jobs? Because the subsidies are means-tested and phase out as family income rises. At some point, making one extra dollar could mean losing a subsidy worth thousands of dollars. Families would face a high implicit marginal tax.\n\nFor instance, consider a single mom with one child. If she earns $23,419 a year, 150% of the poverty rate, she\u2019d get a subsidy of $3,198 for health insurance. But if she makes one dollar more, her subsidy would be reduced by a dollar. Together with payroll taxes and income taxes she\u2019d owe, that\u2019s more than a 100% marginal tax rate on that extra dollar of earnings.\n\nSome people will rationally decide that it doesn\u2019t pay to work more hours, or at all. Economist Casey Mulligan has figured that some people would actually be better off financially working 29 hours a week rather than 40 hours because of the high implicit marginal tax as the subsidy goes away.\n\nFor some people, the ACA provides a powerful disincentive to work, the CBO said.\n\nThis is not a surprise. It\u2019s part of the design of Obamacare. It was a sop to fiscal conservatives, a trade-off designed to ensure that the ACA doesn\u2019t bust the budget. The Republican alternative to Obamacare that was recently rolled out has the same work disincentives.\n\nMeans-testing Obamacare was done for fiscal reasons, but liberals had other reasons to think a few disincentives might be a good thing: Some people SHOULD work less, not only for their own sake but for ours as well.\n\nInsurers face pressure over limited doctor choice (2:36) WSJ's Christopher Weaver discusses insurers facing pressure from regulators and lawmakers about plans offering limited choices of doctors, a tactic the industry said is vital to keep down coverage prices in the new marketplaces.\n\nFor instance, giving a 62-year-old cancer patient an incentive to retire now instead of waiting until 65 when Medicare kicks in is a good thing, for him and for the person who will get his job. In the same vein, giving a single mom an incentive to spend more time raising the kids rather than putting in 40 or 60 or 80 hours a week at work is also good for her, for her kids and for society.\n\nPaid work isn\u2019t the only virtue.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing missing from the furor abut the CBO report: Lots of things provide a disincentive to work: Low pay, lousy working conditions, lack of health-insurance coverage, long commutes, high child-care costs, higher effective tax rates. Not to mention the loss of government benefits as earned income rises.\n\nIn Europe, most social welfare benefits are provided universally to all, regardless of income or wealth. Health insurance, pensions, child-care subsidies, and public education are available to all. Universal coverage requires high taxes, however, because it\u2019s expensive to subsidize everyone\u2019s health care, child care and education. But they\u2019ve decided that living in a civilized society is worth the cost.\n\nIn the low-tax United States, policy makers have generally decided to means-test most benefits as a way of reducing costs to the taxpayer. Only the poor or near-poor are eligible for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, the earned income tax credit, child tax credits, and so forth.\n\nThere\u2019s a trade-off. Means-testing creates very high implicit marginal tax rates as a family\u2019s income rises and pushes them out of the programs. The structure of the programs creates an incentive to stay. In some states, the implicit marginal tax rate can be as high as 100% at some income points.\n\nA family that could earn thousands of dollars more by putting in more effort will do so, but one that could conceivably earn only a little more might restrict their work hours to avoid going over the limit. The majority would work as hard as they can, but a few would do the math and opt out.\n\nSome have argued that these implicit marginal tax rates create a kind of \u201cpoverty trap\u201d for the working poor, who get very little extra disposable income from putting in many extra hours of work. Instead of working to get themselves ahead, these families withhold their labor and keep receiving government benefits.\n\nThat trap hasn\u2019t stopped others from advocating even more means-testing as a way of controlling the budget deficits.\n\nRight now, Social Security and Medicare are predominantly universal programs (each has some elements of means-testing), but Rep. Paul Ryan, the Heritage Foundation and other fiscal conservative groups are pushing for greater means-testing. After all, as Charles Krauthammer has wondered: Why should Warren Buffett get a check from the government?\n\nLiberals counter by pointing out that there just aren\u2019t enough truly rich people to justify means-testing Medicare or Social Security. To save significant amounts of money, we\u2019d need to cut benefits or raise premiums for a large numbers of middle-class people. That probably wouldn\u2019t be too popular with voters.\n\nCertainly underneath the drama over the CBO report is hostility toward Obamacare and the idea that someone can get decent health care even if they don\u2019t work.\n\nBut there\u2019s something more here. At the core of the concern is a moralistic attitude about work. It is true, as my elders loved to say, that the world doesn\u2019t owe you a living. Everyone should take care of his or her own needs, as much as possible. Work builds character and healthy societies. And of course the cow isn\u2019t going to milk herself.\n\nEveryone should work, yes. But what happens in a society, like ours, that cannot create enough work to go around? Our economy has become so productive that all of our needs can be met in a fraction of the time it once took. Millions of people are unemployed, not because they don\u2019t want to work but because there is no paid work for them to do.\n\nWhat happens to our work ethic then? Do we still insist that everyone \u2014 the young, the old, the sick, the dying \u2014 hold down a 40-hour a week job until the day they die?\n\nThe world doesn\u2019t owe us a living, but do we owe it to the world to work until we\u2019re all used up? Even a plough horse gets put to pasture eventually.\n\nAlso read these stories from MarketWatch:\n\n\u2018Job lock\u2019 and the continued controversy over the CBO Obamacare report\n\nSenate fails to advance jobless benefits bill\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Obamacare does discourage some people from working by imposing high implicit marginal tax rates, but that\u2019s actually a good thing because some people should work less, writes Rex Nutting.", "creator": "@RexNutting", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU153_obamac_MG_20140206154118.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Rex Nutting", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Obamacare does discourage some people from working by imposing high implicit marginal tax rates, but that\u2019s actually a good thing because some people should work less, writes Rex Nutting.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-discourages-some-from-working-and-thats-ok-2014-02-07", "author": "Rex Nutting", "parsely-title": "Obamacare discourages some from working, and that\u2019s OK", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-07T06:00:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Obamacare does discourage some people from working by imposing high implicit marginal tax rates, but that\u2019s actually a good thing because some people should work less, writes Rex Nutting.", "title": "Obamacare discourages some from working, and that\u2019s OK", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/obamacare-discourages-some-from-working-and-thats-ok-2014-02-07", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU153_obamac_MG_20140206154118.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU153_obamac_MG_20140206154118.jpg"}, "article.id": "7BF9F9B4-8F5D-11E3-B6D9-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "Obamacare adds to already high implicit marginal tax rates for working people, according to Casey Mulligan\u2019s calculation.\nFamilies would face a high implicit marginal tax.\nMeans-testing creates very high implicit marginal tax rates as a family\u2019s income rises and pushes them out of the programs.\nTogether with payroll taxes and income taxes she\u2019d owe, that\u2019s more than a 100% marginal tax rate on that extra dollar of earnings.\nOnly the poor or near-poor are eligible for welfare, food stamps, Medicaid, the earned income tax credit, child tax credits, and so forth."}
