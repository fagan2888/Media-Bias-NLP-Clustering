Ted Cruz, R-Texas, speaks to supporters at the Crossroads Shooting Sports gun shop on Dec. 4 in Johnston, Iowa. (Photo: Bryon Houlgrave, The Des Moines)\n\nAfter the slaughter of 14 Americans in San Bernardino, Calif., when two people armed with high-powered rifles and handguns ambushed unsuspecting Americans in a conference room, United States senator and Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz held a press conference to issue a familiar refrain we hear after every major gun tragedy:\n\nIf only there had been a \u201cgood guy\u201d with a gun there. Or, as Sen. Cruz put it: \u201cYou stop bad guys by using our guns.\u201d\n\nWe heard the same call after the recent tragedy at a medical clinic in Colorado Springs and after attacks in Paris, where 129 people were murdered in a theater by terrorists armed with guns and explosives. That\u2019s when former presidential candidate and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich took to Twitter to issue his call to arms: \u201cImagine a theater with 10 or 15 citizens with concealed carry permits.\u201d\n\nI know that the political advocates for this \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d mantra like Sen. Cruz and many of the other politicians and lobbyists think that this is a politically expedient catch-phrase to support their own interests.\n\nI doubt career politicians like Sen. Cruz and the rest of the Washington operators have had much experience with gunfights.\n\nIn my experience, being the good guy when the bullets start flying is very difficult.\n\nI say that as someone who spent 25 years serving our military. For many of those 25 years, I was a member of a Special Missions Unit.\n\nI\u2019ve been in dark rooms with \u201cgood-guys and bad guys\u201d going at it with guns, and let me tell you something:\n\nGunfights are crazy.\n\nGunfights are hard.\n\nOn my final combat mission, I was shot in the leg with an AK-47 from about 30 feet away, and it blew my femur in half.\n\nI hope that was my last gunfight.\n\nHere at home, there are almost 13 million Americans who have a license to carry a concealed weapon. The vast majority of them are responsible, law-abiding and good-hearted people. Many of them want to be prepared to be the good guy, to do the right thing and to save lives.\n\nI hope they never have to face being the target of a dangerous person with a gun. Because it\u2019s hard to make the right decisions.\n\nThere are groups of individuals, like me and my fellow Special Operators, both military and law enforcement, who train for years to be good at close quarters shooting: shooting with discernment, keeping your head clear and making snap decisions before you pull the trigger \u2014 all while being shot at by the enemy.\n\nAnd after dedicating their lives to being good operators in those extreme circumstances, even those professionals make mistakes.\n\nThen consider that people like us trained for firefights for years and that in many states there is virtually no training required for someone to legally carry a loaded, hidden gun.\n\nSo think about 10 or 15 people, who are weekend shooters with limited tactical training, deciding to shoot it out with a criminal in a crowded office holiday party, a medical clinic or a darkened theater, while people are screaming and running, and no one knows who or how many of the people shooting are the \u201cgood guys\u201d and how many of them are the \u201cbad guys.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, can a \u201cgood guy\u201d with a gun neutralize the threat and help save lives? Absolutely. But it doesn\u2019t happen very often. It is, for the most part, a myth perpetuated by people who\u2019ve never been shot at.\n\nI am a proud Navy combat veteran. I risked and nearly gave my life in dozens of combat situations in defense of our Constitution. I value the Second Amendment and the right of responsible Americans to own guns for self-defense.\n\nBut people need to know that it is a fallacy to believe that the everyday gun owner can be expected to make all the right choices in a dangerous, fast-moving situation like a mass shooting with high-powered weapons.\n\nWhen the bullets are flying, determining \u201cwho's who in the zoo\u201d is hard.\n\nIf the scenario that Sen. Cruz envisions were to ever unfold, we\u2019d have a lot more dead innocents. And it would probably include some of the \u201cgood guys.\u201d\n\nSenior Chief Petty Officer James Hatch (USN, Ret.) is the founder of Spikes K9 Fund and a member of Veterans for Responsible Solutions.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1QDopGi", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Expecting untrained civilians to shoot down terrorists is a recipe for more dead innocents.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Expecting untrained civilians to shoot down terrorists is a recipe for more dead innocents.", "title": "The 'good guy with a gun' myth", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/12/12/good-guy-gun-myth/77158910/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Expecting untrained civilians to shoot down terrorists is a recipe for more dead innocents.", "title": "The 'good guy with a gun' myth", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e0f09b659f0d880030fa17f621df382b0d79e1d9/c=936-0-4335-3399&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/11/WIGroup/Wausau/635854395598418194-MONBrd-12-11-2015-NewsStar-1-A002-2015-12-10-IMG-AP-GOP-CRUZ-2016-A-E-6-1-0ACQRUBN-L725359378-IMG-AP-GOP-CRUZ-2016-A-E-6-1-0ACQRUBN.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Second Amendment, Ted Cruz, guns, san bernardino, paris, terrorist, california,"}, "article_summary": "In my experience, being the good guy when the bullets start flying is very difficult.\nMany of them want to be prepared to be the good guy, to do the right thing and to save lives.\nI doubt career politicians like Sen.
