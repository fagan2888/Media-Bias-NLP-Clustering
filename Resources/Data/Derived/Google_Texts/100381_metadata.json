She's an animal advocate and bestselling author of a book about living alongside creatures great and small.\n\nMembers of Farm Sanctuary notified them about the animal's plight, said Sylvia Moskovitz with the Watkins Glen shelter in New York. The organization negotiated a voluntary release for the bull.\n\nThe Stewarts drove up from their Bufflehead Farm in New Jersey to meet Frank in Brooklyn. A Facebook post by Farm Sanctuary shows Jon Stewart feeding Frank and saying \"everyone likes hay.\"\n\nHis next ride will be to Bufflehead Farm -- a 12-acre piece of land in Middletown Township.\n\nBut with freedom comes a price.\n\nAfter spending the weekend at the Stewart family farm, Frank will be transported to Cornell University Hospital for Animals. His routine checkup will end in castration, according to Moskovitz. The bull will become a steer.\n\nAnd his new life will be no joke. The Watkins Glen facility has 175 acres of rolling pastures and at least 50 other bovines on the premises\n\nFrank will have plenty of room to live out his days grazing and under protection.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The fate of Frank Lee the bull has gone from dinner plate to sanctuary -- thanks to comedian Jon Stewart and his wife.", "language": "english", "author": "CNN", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/news/offbeat/headlines/Comedian-Jon-Stewart-rescues-runaway-bull-374371901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/jon+stewart+bull.png", "type": "article", "description": "The fate of Frank Lee the bull has gone from dinner plate to sanctuary -- thanks to comedian Jon Stewart and his wife.", "title": "Comedian Jon Stewart rescues runaway bull"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The fate of Frank Lee the bull has gone from dinner plate to sanctuary -- thanks to comedian Jon Stewart and his wife.", "title": "Comedian Jon Stewart rescues runaway bull", "url": "http://www.kake.com/news/offbeat/headlines/Comedian-Jon-Stewart-rescues-runaway-bull-374371901.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/jon+stewart+bull.png", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Comedian Jon Stewart rescues runaway bull", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Comedian Jon Stewart rescues runaway"}, "article_summary": "The fate of Frank Lee the bull has gone from dinner plate to sanctuary -- thanks to comedian Jon Stewart and his wife.\nHis daring dash to freedom caught the attention of the former \"Daily Show\" comedian Jon Stewart and his wife, Tracey.\nA Facebook post by Farm Sanctuary shows Jon Stewart feeding Frank and saying \"everyone likes hay.\"\nAfter spending the weekend at the Stewart family farm, Frank will be transported to Cornell University Hospital for Animals.\nMembers of Farm Sanctuary notified them about the animal's plight, said Sylvia Moskovitz with the Watkins Glen shelter in New York."}
