El Paso County authorities jailed one person, let one go and are looking for others after an armed home invasion west of Colorado Springs Sunday morning that led to a hostage situation.

Eli Carlos Hahn, 28, was booked into jail and faces charges of burglary, robbery, kidnapping, felony menacing, possession of a firearm and child abuse.

Seven residents of the home west of Manitou Springs in Cascade were safe and unharmed, sheriff department spokeswoman Jacqueline Kirby said.

When the invaders entered Sunday morning, at least one of the residents had a cell phone. Four were in the home and three were in a detached garage, Kirby said.

Sheriff’s dispatchers received multiple 911 calls and hang-ups about 8:30 a.m. from the home off U.S. 24, she said. Deputies went to the scene and determined there were possibly two armed suspects inside with an unknown number of victims.

A SWAT team cleared the house.

The motive wasn’t clear. One man involved in the invasion apparently left the scene. One suspect initially detained by deputies “had nothing to do with it” and was released, Kirby said.

Sunday night, deputies were seeking a third suspect. “We don’t know when the suspect left the residence.”

The Colorado State Patrol closed U.S. 24 for several hours and re-opened it shortly after sunset.

Hahn wasn’t injured “but needed medical attention” and received it before he was booked, Kirby said. Late Sunday, deputies were seeking information related to the case, urging calls to the sheriff’s office at 719-390-5555.
