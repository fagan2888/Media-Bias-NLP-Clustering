Eight of the 10 states with the highest rates of HIV \u2014 Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Tennessee \u2014 are in the region.\n\nThe CDC notes Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina are among the states with the highest rates of AIDS diagnoses.\n\nHiers said the statistics are slightly lower in Alabama because her organization has partnered with all of the state\u2019s HIV/AIDS service organizations and works within all of its 67 counties.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a pretty cohesive network,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very different than the other Southern states where you go to Atlanta and there\u2019s a good bit, but you get outside Atlanta and there\u2019s nothing. The same in Louisiana with New Orleans and so on.\u201d\n\nHiers further noted the 1917 Clinic where a number of groundbreaking discoveries around HIV/AIDS have taken place is located at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always very connected to clinical trials and so on,\u201d she said. \u201cThose two things have helped Alabama.\u201d\n\nThe Duke Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research in 2011 noted Mississippi had the highest number of deaths from HIV of any state. Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee were among the top 10.\n\nThe U.S. Census also indicates that Mississippi is the poorest state in the country, with 22.3 percent of residents living below the poverty line between 2008-2012. Louisiana and Alabama have the second and fourth highest rates of poverty in the country respectively.\n\nStatistics also indicate that people of color are more likely to live in poverty than whites.\n\n\u201cPart of what happens with people who are poor is they don\u2019t go to the doctor,\u201d Kathryn Garner, executive director of AIDS Service Coalition, an HIV/AIDS service organization in Hattiesburg, Miss., that serves people with the virus who live in 71 of the state\u2019s 82 counties, told the Blade during a recent telephone interview. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go to the doctor, you don\u2019t know you\u2019re HIV positive until you go to the doctor when you\u2019re really sick and then you\u2019re AIDS-defined.\u201d\n\nCharlotte \u201cDot\u201d Norwood, a prevention counselor at Open Arms Healthcare Center, an HIV/AIDS clinic in Jackson, Miss., that My Brother\u2019s Keeper, an organization based in nearby Ridgeland, Miss., that seeks to reduce health disparities among minority groups, is known affectionately as the \u201cAIDS Lady.\u201d\n\nShe told the Blade during a July 11 interview at the clinic that patients with the virus are often unable to get a job.\n\n\u201c[They] go for an interview, don\u2019t get hired and it could be for many reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s because you know maybe they go in and the person\u2019s first perception\u2026 masculine, things like that.\u201d\n\nPeople with HIV/AIDS fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act. It also bans all public entities and private companies that employ more than 15 people from discriminating against their employees based on their status.\n\nNo Southern state bans anti-LGBT employment discrimination. Louisiana, Tennessee and Florida include sexual orientation in their anti-hate crimes statutes, but not gender identity and expression.\n\nCarl Green, a gay white man who has lived at Belle Reve, a residence in the Fraubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans for people with HIV/AIDS since May, told the Blade during a July 14 interview that he lost his job when he told his then-manager he was living with HIV after several hospitalizations.\n\nGreen said he eventually lost his home and lived in his car until a bank repossessed it.\n\nThe New Orleans AIDS Task Force, an HIV/AIDS service organization that serves people with the virus in the Crescent City and throughout southeastern Louisiana, referred Green to Belle Reve.\n\n\u201cIt was the universe saying you need to go back to square one and get your health together,\u201d said Green.\n\nPeople with HIV struggle to find housing, food\n\nThe Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 bans discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS and other disabilities.\n\nIn spite of this federal law, a lack of housing remains an acute problem for low-income people with HIV/AIDS in the South.\n\nFifteen people currently live in two group homes in Belle Reve \u2014 including one called Belle Grace that Executive Director Vicki Weeks joked opened because of the \u201cgrace of God.\u201d A third building \u2014 Belle Esprit \u2014 has four apartments for couples and families that can accommodate between seven to 10 people with children at any given time.\n\nBelle Reve was able to renovate all three of its buildings several years ago after it received $1,189,000 in funds from Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS (HOPWA) from the New Orleans Office of Community Development, $300,000 from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, grants from the National AIDS Fund and other groups and money from the Qatari government.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy until I can get on my own and start over again,\u201d a Belle Reve resident of color who describes himself as \u201cvery-much gay,\u201d but asked to remain anonymous told the Blade. He worked at Tulane Hospital in New Orleans for four years before he tested positive in May 2013. \u201cI\u2019m looking for another job, but I\u2019ve been having a little problem with that because I guess I\u2019m gay. They look at you and they judge you.\u201d\n\nMiss Eddie, a 58-year-old transgender woman who has lived with HIV since the 1980s, moved from the New Orleans suburb of Kenner to Belle Reve in late May after her former lover died.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great blessing being here,\u201d she told the Blade.\n\nThirty-two people with HIV/AIDS currently live at Grace House, a residence in Jackson, Miss.\n\nAIDS Services Coalition runs two residences in Hattiesburg for people living with the virus.\n\nEight men live in 121 Haven House, a Victorian home built in the 1880s that serves as a transitional shelter. More than a dozen women with HIV and a family live in a second facility \u2014 227 Place \u2014 with nine two-bedroom apartments.\n\nAIDS Service Coalition last month bought a 16-unit apartment complex with four fourplexes.\n\nGarner said they should be renovated by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cOur goal of course if someone\u2019s able to work or able to function out in the world,\u201d she told the Blade. \u201cWe do everything we can to get them away so they can be out in the world and do the things everything they want to do.\u201d\n\nThe South Mississippi AIDS Task Force in Biloxi, Miss., operates a transitional housing facility for people with HIV/AIDS on the state\u2019s Gulf Coast.\n\n\u201cEveryone we have in any of our shelters either have no income or have disability or a low-paying job,\u201d said Garner. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult if you\u2019re making $790 a month when a one-bedroom apartment in Hattiesburg is $550 to $600 a month. The math on that just doesn\u2019t work and there\u2019s not enough public housing and there\u2019s not enough housing choice vouchers.\u201d\n\nAIDS Alabama has one of the largest housing programs of any HIV/AIDS service provider in the South with roughly 150 units throughout the state. The majority of these are in Birmingham, the state\u2019s largest city.\n\nAIDS Alabama also offers rental assistance to people living with HIV across the state through HOPWA.\n\n\u201cEven so we always have waiting lists,\u201d Hiers told the Blade. \u201cHousing is just a huge need for people with HIV.\u201d\n\nHIV/AIDS service providers with whom the Blade spoke in Mississippi and Alabama said access to transportation and even food can adversely affect the health of people living with the virus \u2014 especially those who live in rural areas.\n\nDr. Laura Beauchamps, an infectious disease practitioner at Open Arms, told the Blade as she prepared to administer pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that many people with HIV/AIDS who live in rural areas are simply unable to travel to Jackson \u201cto get checked on a regular basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey just don\u2019t take care of themselves and they keep on spreading [the virus,]\u201d she said as Norwood listened. \u201cIt is just very sad to see. In other states it\u2019s not the same because they have a better transportation situation or ways to get them to the clinics and continue [with their treatment.]\u201d\n\nGarner told the Blade one of her organization\u2019s clients who lives in a shelter in Columbus, Miss., travels to the state capital, which is nearly two hours away, to receive health care and HIV treatments. AIDS Service Coalition also provides her with support network, even though its offices are a 4-hour drive away from where she currently lives.\n\n\u201cShe calls once a month and we visit,\u201d said Garner. \u201cWe do what we can do.\u201d\n\nHiers said the majority of AIDS Alabama\u2019s clients in the Birmingham metropolitan area do not own cars. The agency has three vans that \u201crun full time\u201d to bring clients to their appointments and other commitments, but Hiers said \u201cit\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nHiers described the city\u2019s public transportation system as \u201cpitiful,\u201d noting an AIDS Alabama client who takes a 5:30 a.m. bus from his home to get to his job at 9:30 a.m. was almost fired because he was late.\n\nUp to 170 families each month receive food assistance from Open Arms.\n\nNorwood noted the food pantry in the back of the clinic that her son helps stock with donations was \u201ca little bare\u201d because the next delivery had yet to arrive from a local food bank. She told the Blade she personally delivers food to her clients who are hungry and are unable to travel to the clinic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll step out of pocket and go get them myself, or take food,\u201d said Norwood. \u201cSometimes I have my people who haven\u2019t ate in a few days and they\u2019ll call one of my guys. And my guys will call me and say \u2018hey Dot, honey can you help me Dot?\u2019 Oh yeah, that\u2019s not even to be asked.\u201d\n\nLack of education, stigma spread virus\n\nAnti-HIV stigma also remains a serious problem for those living with the virus in the South.\n\nTimothy Thompson, a peer educator with the New Orleans AIDS Task Force, told the Blade over dinner in the French Quarter on July 13 that many people who are disproportionately at risk for HIV in the city do not get tested because of the stigma attached to the virus.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest things is that there is the idea if I go and I test positive I\u2019ll be alienized from my people, from my family or the people that I hang out with or things that I\u2019m able to do I won\u2019t be able to do anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a level of truth to that because of the ongoing problems that are faced because of the ignorance that is around the disease itself.\u201d\n\nThompson said people with HIV/AIDS with whom he has worked in New Orleans have told him that people did not want to have someone who is positive eat in their home because they think the virus spreads through saliva.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not aware of the different things that really transmit the disease as well as the different things that you can do to make sure that the people you are around that are affected about it still feel like they are normal human beings,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cYou\u2019re aware that this does not transmit this way and most people aren\u2019t aware and they tend to offend people by their lack of education.\u201d\n\nThe Blade heard similar stories from service providers and LGBT rights activists in Mississippi.\n\n\u201cWe have folks \u2014 and this is 2014 \u2014 who are being asked in their family homes to eat off of paper plates,\u201d said Garner.\n\nAntwan Matthews, a gay man of color from Meridian, Miss., living with HIV, officially learned his status on April 24, 2013, the day before his 20th birthday.\n\nHe told the Blade during a July 11 interview at Open Arms where he will begin to receive care next month that his mother told him that his father, who is a Pentecostal minister, took out a life insurance policy on him after he found out he was positive.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s almost gambling with my life,\u201d said Matthews. \u201cHe\u2019s just waiting for me to die or something.\u201d\n\nMatthews said his mother was initially supportive of him, but he said she pointed out his HIV status after they argued about his sister wanting to move out of the house once she had turned 18.\n\n\u201cShe texts me and said \u2018you wouldn\u2019t listen, so look at you, you\u2019re living with HIV now so you don\u2019t have anything to say to me,\u2019\u201d said Matthews. \u201cI was like OK. It kind of bothered me because you just don\u2019t expect that to be said from your mom or your parents and stuff like that.\u201d\n\nThe Belle Reve resident who asked to remain anonymous told the Blade he initially did not want to \u201cintroduce\u201d his family in Lafayette, La., to \u201cmy HIV\u201d because he thought they were not \u201cgoing to accept it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey did,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I came here just to get myself together, for myself. So I came here and now they accept everything.\u201d\n\nKatrina disrupted HIV care, damaged facilities\n\nWeeks said eight of 12 people who were living at Belle Reve when Hurricane Katrina approached New Orleans in 2005 could not evacuate on their own because they \u2014 or their relatives \u2014 did not have access to transportation.\n\nShe and three other Belle Reve staffers used private vehicles to evacuate their residents to a campground in Alexandria, La., a city roughly 200 miles northwest of New Orleans.\n\nThe trip that normally takes less than four hours took 16 hours because of massive traffic jams.\n\nWeeks, her residents and staff spent nearly three weeks at the campground before an HIV/AIDS service organization in Anniston, Ala., offered them housing and a place to work.\n\nThey remained in Alabama for seven months before returning to New Orleans.\n\n\u201cThe city did not have an evacuation plan for people with no vehicles, and that\u2019s why so many people stayed,\u201d said Weeks, who lives in the Gentilly Terrace neighborhood of New Orleans that Katrina inundated with six feet of water. \u201cThat\u2019s why they had so many people here because there was no transportation out of this city other than your own vehicle or a vehicle of a relative. We tried to get our residents to go with relatives or with churches, but we still have eight out of 12 that had no way to get out of town.\u201d\n\nKatrina damaged the roof of AIDS Service Coalition\u2019s shelter.\n\nGarner told the Blade a man living with HIV from New Orleans approached her after she arrived to survey the damage and said he only had two days worth of his antiretrovirals.\n\n\u201cThat story replicated itself,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically what we did for several months was triage.\u201d\n\nGarner added an additional problem that people living with HIV/AIDS from other states who fled to Mississippi after Katrina is the state\u2019s Medicaid program offered less generous benefits than they had been accustomed.\n\n\u201cIf they were getting psychotropic medicines or if they were getting pain medicines or fill in the blank, they came to Mississippi and that wasn\u2019t covered,\u201d she said.\n\nService providers criticize governors for not expanding Medicaid\n\nA Gallup survey noted Texas had the highest rate of uninsured residents, with 27 percent of people without health insurance. Arkansas, Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana, Georgia and North Carolina were among the other states with the highest rates of uninsured residents.\n\nTexas Gov. Rick Perry, Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory have all refused to expand their state\u2019s Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHiers told the Blade the majority of the 13,000 Alabamians living with HIV are \u201cextremely poor,\u201d yet the state\u2019s Medicaid program requires potential recipients to be disabled and have a monthly income of 13 percent of poverty level. She said this figure works out to around $111 a month.\n\nHiers added 76 percent of those who are on the Alabama AIDS Drug Assistance Program would become eligible for Medicaid if Gov. Robert Bentley and the Republican-controlled Legislature expanded it.\n\n\u201cI get so frustrated at our Southern states who need the health care the most not expanding Medicaid here,\u201d said Hiers. \u201cIt\u2019s just colossally stupid. We\u2019re turning down billions and billions in health care for Alabamians and Southerners just because of the ideological differences between the parties. And I think that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d\n\nAdvocates and HIV/AIDS service providers with whom the Blade spoke in Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama all said the vast majority of their funding comes from the federal government and private grants.\n\nEighty-five percent of AIDS Alabama\u2019s annual budget of $7.9 million comes from federal sources, with HUD providing the majority of this money. The organization also receives financial support from the Ford Foundation, the Elton John Foundation, the Tide Foundation and other foundations.\n\nHOPWA funds comprise 80 percent of Belle Reve\u2019s $1 million annual budget.\n\n\u201cIf we lose that there\u2019s nothing else that we can do to keep the doors open,\u201d Weeks told the Blade. \u201cWe have got to prepare for that.\u201d\n\nThe Mississippi Department of Health runs a free STD clinic in Jackson where Beauchamps also works.\n\nShe told the Blade that she and her colleagues are able to find \u201ca lot of people\u201d there who are positive.\n\nBeauchamps nevertheless stressed the state does not extend enough resources to her and other HIV/AIDS service providers to fight the epidemic.\n\n\u201cWe need more grants,\u201d said Beauchamps. \u201cWe need more support to do more testing and then to reach out in communities that don\u2019t have a way to come all the way down to the metro area.\u201d\n\nWeeks criticized Louisiana lawmakers and Jindal for cutting state education and health care funding.\n\nShe noted the closest mental health clinic to Belle Reve is in Hammond, a city about an hour northwest of New Orleans, because Jindal closed the facility that had been in the Crescent City.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that we\u2019re not happy with some of the issues or some of the things that our governor, Bobby Jindal, has done,\u201d said Weeks. \u201cWe all get upset when he cuts funding for education or health care, but the state\u2019s budget is in state law that they can\u2019t touch any of this other stuff. That only leaves education and health care. So whoever set our government up did a very poor job.\u201d\n\n\u2019I\u2019m doing a 100 percent better\u2019\n\nIn spite of the steep challenges, people living with HIV/AIDS and those who support them remain optimistic.\n\nMatthews has begun speaking with teenage boys about the virus. He is also fighting to include HIV/AIDS in school curricula.\n\n\u201cThey need to be taught,\u201d he told the Blade. \u201cIt\u2019s just like anything else: English, history, math, anything else that they learn. They should learn about this.\u201d\n\nGreen has once again began taking antiretrovirals after a three year lapse.\n\nHe also had surgery last month to remove a cancerous tumor from his rectum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a 100 percent better,\u201d said Green. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m getting back in touch with me and getting my priorities back together. I just don\u2019t think I would have still been on this earth. I really don\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "People living with HIV in the South continue to struggle against poverty and a lack of access to health care and other treatment.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "People living with HIV in the South continue to struggle against poverty and a lack of access to health care and other treatment.", "title": "People with HIV in the South face uphill struggle", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/08/Antwan_Matthews_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2014-08-08T07:24:09-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/08/07/people-hiv-south-face-uphill-battle/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People living with HIV in the South continue to struggle against poverty and a lack of access to health care and other treatment.", "creator": "@mklavers81", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/08/Antwan_Matthews_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "People with HIV in the South face uphill struggle", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "Vicki Weeks", "published_time": "2014-08-07T15:08:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-08T07:24:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "#LGBTSouth, 1917 Clinic, Affordable Care Act, AIDS, AIDS Alabama, AIDS Service Coalition, Alabama, Americans with Disabilities Act, Belle Reve, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "article_summary": "Beauchamps nevertheless stressed the state does not extend enough resources to her and other HIV/AIDS service providers to fight the epidemic.\nAIDS Service Coalition also provides her with support network, even though its offices are a 4-hour drive away from where she currently lives.\nPeople with HIV struggle to find housing, foodThe Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 bans discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS and other disabilities.\nHiers said the statistics are slightly lower in Alabama because her organization has partnered with all of the state\u2019s HIV/AIDS service organizations and works within all of its 67 counties.\nAIDS Service Coalition last month bought a 16-unit apartment complex with four fourplexes."}
