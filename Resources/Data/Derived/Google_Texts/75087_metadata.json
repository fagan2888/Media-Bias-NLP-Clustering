Attkisson is not known for shying away from either her personal convictions or the direction in which her work commitments take her, controversial as they may be.\n\nSo it\u2019s perhaps fitting that when her half-hour show, dedicated to covering topics she says other news outlets won\u2019t, debuts this weekend on 170 ABC, NBC, Fox, and The CW affiliates in 38 percent of the country, Donald Trump will make an appearance.\n\n>>> Find out when and where you can watch \u201cFull Measure\u201d\n\nThe debut episode will look at the effect an influx of legal immigrants can have on a community\u2014in this case, a small town in Maine.\n\n\u201cThese legal refugees, legal asylum seekers, are a deserving, well-meaning, great people who often become great citizens,\u201d Attkisson said of the episode at the launch party.\n\n\u201cBut the dilemma is that they come to these towns that really can\u2019t afford the influx at times, and they have to grapple with scarce resources,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is something that more American towns are going to be dealing with.\u201d\n\nAccountability Reporting\n\nThroughout her career, Attkisson has been critical of both Republicans and Democrats.\n\n\u201cMost of my reporting has nothing to do with politics,\u201d Attkisson says. \u201cBut I guess that\u2019s what has gotten the most attention in the last couple years, is reporting that does. But most of it, I see, is looking at taxpayer issues, whoever is in charge, Republicans or Democrats.\u201d\n\nSharyl Attkisson says she\u2019s dedicated to \u201caccountability reporting.\u201d\n\nAttkisson\u2019s agenda, she says, lies in the best interests of her viewers.\n\nThe name for her show, \u201cFull Measure,\u201d comes from President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address, and refers to soldiers who gave their all\u2014their \u201cfull measure.\u201d It\u2019s how she approaches reporting, she says.\n\nAnd while that approach has created critics, she also has a loyal base of fans.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate to meet Sharyl through my role as chairman of the Congressional Media Fairness Caucus, which encourages the media to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly,\u201d says Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas. \u201cAt a time when many Americans have lost confidence in the news they receive, Sharyl exemplifies accuracy and fairness.\u201d\n\nThis dedication to \u201caccountability reporting,\u201d as Attkisson calls it, has led to heated debates and, ultimately, her resignation from CBS News.\n\nIn her 2014 book, \u201cStonewalled,\u201d Attkisson alleges that editorial interference from upper-level management at CBS News prevented her from pursuing leads and reporting in a manner she perceived to be fair on topics like the 2012 terrorist attacks on a U.S. compound in Benghazi. Attkisson claims that the federal government hacked her computer with spyware; after admitting to being \u201coutraged\u201d on air, Attkisson filed a lawsuit that is ongoing.\n\nLife After Network News\n\nAfter Attkisson resigned from CBS News, she says, she got \u201ca lot of offers to continue to do journalism in various facets\u201d but feared jumping into a long-term commitment too quickly.\n\nIn that interim period, she contributed to The Daily Signal, among other outlets.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Sinclair approached her roughly a year after her CBS News resignation that she really felt she was being presented with a unique opportunity to do what she says she does best: investigative reporting.\n\nAttkisson says her stories will focus on whistleblowers; government waste, fraud, and abuse; and taxpayer waste, among other things. She plans to tell stories, she says, without \u201ctrying to steer [them] in a direction just to prove a point.\u201d\n\nDespite Attkisson\u2019s exit from CBS News, she now finds herself surrounded with colleagues from her time at the network. Two producers at \u201cFull Measure,\u201d Batt Humphreys and Kim Skeen, are former CBS News producers.\n\n\u201cSharyl and I have been friends for 20 years,\u201d says Humphreys. \u201cI\u2019ve known and I\u2019ve worked with a lot of people and talent in this business over 30 years and 20 years at networks and believe me, I\u2019ve worked with plenty of monsters. And she is as far from that as you can imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s one of the smartest people I know, and that\u2019s the level of engagement I like playing in,\u201d he adds. \u201cShe\u2019s a great storyteller.\u201d\n\nA Different Kind of Sunday Show\n\n\u201cFull Measure,\u201d Humphreys says, will differentiate itself from the Sunday morning competition by not playing into the Washington media status quo.\n\n\u201cThere are at least five networks that are doing specific, political chats on Sunday mornings and it\u2019s never been my intent, nor would it be, to create another show to offer the same four or six legislators on a panel or the same experts every week to just talk about things ad nauseam,\u201d Humphreys says. \u201cWe\u2019re developing a broadcast that is new that has a chance to tell stories in a long-format, magazine style.\u201d\n\nThe name for Attkisson\u2019s show, \u201cFull Measure,\u201d comes from Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address.\n\nLegal immigration is one of the taxpayer issues that Attkisson and Humphreys plan to tackle in this long-format style. They refer to it as an \u201cuntouchable topic.\u201d\n\nAttkisson argues she probably could not have reported on it during the latter half of her 20-year term as a reporter with CBS News\u2019 Washington bureau.\n\n\u201cMany topics in the media today, it\u2019s almost as if the media picks a right and a wrong side, and only shows you one facet,\u201d Attkisson says. \u201cThere are plenty of stories about the positive aspects of [legal and illegal immigration]. I also argue we should be covering the costs and some of the problems that come with that as well.\u201d\n\nFor all its virtue, the show has, perhaps, an uphill climb against better-known competition. Sinclair, meanwhile, reportedly hopes the program will help to increase its profile in addition to Attkisson\u2019s.\n\nFor now, it seems the relationship is mutually beneficial.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been promised that [editorial interference] won\u2019t be an issue,\u201d Attkisson says. \u201cI\u2019ve already gone through very rigorous editorial processes for the stories that I\u2019ve worked on so far, and haven\u2019t had any of it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Sunday morning, Sharyl Attkisson, former CBS news anchor and investigative correspondent, debuts her new show 'Full Measure.'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On Sunday morning, Sharyl Attkisson, former CBS news anchor and investigative correspondent, debuts her new show 'Full Measure.'", "title": "Sharyl Attkisson Takes on Sunday Shows With 'Full Measure'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151001_SharylAttkisson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-02T19:17:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1YS7jbA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "On Sunday morning, Sharyl Attkisson, former CBS news anchor and investigative correspondent, debuts her new show 'Full Measure.'", "title": "Sharyl Attkisson Takes on Sunday Shows With 'Full Measure'", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151001_SharylAttkisson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "media", "published_time": "2015-10-01T23:00:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T19:17:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sharyl Attkisson, news, Sinclair Broadcast Group, Full Measure, CBS"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve known and I\u2019ve worked with a lot of people and talent in this business over 30 years and 20 years at networks and believe me, I\u2019ve worked with plenty of monsters.\n\u201cI\u2019ve already gone through very rigorous editorial processes for the stories that I\u2019ve worked on so far, and haven\u2019t had any of it.\u201d\nLegal immigration is one of the taxpayer issues that Attkisson and Humphreys plan to tackle in this long-format style.\n\u201cThese legal refugees, legal asylum seekers, are a deserving, well-meaning, great people who often become great citizens,\u201d Attkisson said of the episode at the launch party.\n\u201cMany topics in the media today, it\u2019s almost as if the media picks a right and a wrong side, and only shows you one facet,\u201d Attkisson says."}
