Between family and business, we were busy 24 hours per day,\u201d said Corman, who attended a forum Thursday at the Holiday Inn by the Bay in Portland about how to navigate Affordable Care Act insurance geared toward small businesses.\n\nBusinesses have from Nov. 15 through Feb. 15 to enroll in 2015 health insurance through the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. The Maine Health Access Foundation hosted Thursday\u2019s forum so that small-business owners could learn about their options.\n\nVena\u2019s business outlook has improved, and now that the Cormans are looking to hire their first full-time employee, they wanted to learn what options were available.\n\n\u201cThe employee we want to hire, I told her we would offer her benefits, that we would take care of her,\u201d Corman said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get the ball rolling.\u201d\n\nIndividuals and families could purchase insurance through the ACA starting last year, but the Obama administration delayed implementation of the law\u2019s small-business component until 2015 because of the glitch-filled launch of healthcare.gov.\n\nThe ACA does not mandate that businesses with fewer than 50 employees offer insurance to workers. As an incentive, however, the law provides tax credits for those small businesses with the equivalent of fewer than 25 full-time employees.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how many Maine businesses could qualify for those tax credits, but certainly a large majority would. According to one legislative report, as many as 80 percent of Maine businesses have fewer than 10 employees.\n\nRoger Prince, a senior manager at BerryDunn accountants who spoke at the forum, said the tax credits could return up to 50 percent of insurance premium costs to small-business owners who qualify.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cutting your insurance costs in half,\u201d Prince said. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big deal to a small-business owner.\u201d\n\nEmployers offering insurance for the first time would be adding a new expense but may be able to attract a better workforce at a relatively reasonable cost, Prince said.\n\nMitchell Stein, an independent health policy analyst who also was a speaker at the forum, said the tax credits can represent between about $10,000 and $30,000 in savings for small-business owners who have been offering insurance, and that helps with razor-thin profit margins.\n\nStein said there are many variables that determine how lucrative the tax credits can be, including the wages that employees earn and how many are on the payroll. He recommended that business owners see a tax expert or accountant to figure out what best fits their business.\n\nCamp Ketcha in Scarborough has eight full-time employees, and Executive Director Tom Doherty was curious to see what options the federal marketplace offered the nonprofit.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance makes my head hurt,\u201d Doherty said. \u201cThese are always tough decisions that affect everyone who works for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many owners would qualify for tax credits or could attract better workers under the coverage that begins in 2015.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Many owners would qualify for tax credits or could attract better workers under the coverage that begins in 2015.", "title": "Small businesses in Maine weigh new insurance options under Affordable Care Act - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/516681_883071-20141009_ACAOptions_.jpg", "height": 668}, "updated_time": "2014-10-09T23:53:29-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/10/small-businesses-in-maine-weigh-new-health-insurance-options-under-aca/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many owners would qualify for tax credits or could attract better workers under the coverage that begins in 2015.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/516681_883071-20141009_ACAOptions_.jpg", "title": "Small businesses in Maine weigh new insurance options under Affordable Care Act - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-10-10T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T23:53:29-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7ac\"", "article_summary": "Additional Images Dr. Wendy Wolf of the Maine Health Access Foundation moderates an event in Portland on Thursday on options for small businesses next year under the Affordable Care Act.\nWhen Steve Corman opened Vena\u2019s Fizz House in the Old Port last year, he didn\u2019t give health insurance much thought.\nBusinesses have from Nov. 15 through Feb. 15 to enroll in 2015 health insurance through the federal marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act.\nAccording to one legislative report, as many as 80 percent of Maine businesses have fewer than 10 employees.\nIt\u2019s hard to say exactly how many Maine businesses could qualify for those tax credits, but certainly a large majority would."}
