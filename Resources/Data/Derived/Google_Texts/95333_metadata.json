Remember back in the summer of 2008, at the zenith of Obamamania, when a German reporter claimed she watched him curl 32-kilogram, a.k.a. 70-pound, dumbbells? Either that was part of the Hopenchange hype or he\u2019s lost a lot of mass since, so much so that this practically serves as a metaphor for how far he\u2019s fallen. Don\u2019t be too judge-y, though: In his defense, he\u2019s going to be 53 this year and has a job that keeps him pretty busy, what with all the celebrity dinners and golfing and horrendously bad prisoner swaps and all.\n\nI think Allahpundit's main point\u2014that the mere existence of this sort of unflattering material is a marker of how much the bloom is off the rose with regard to Lord Obama\u2014is a sound one.\n\nI always find it disturbing when (mostly conservative) commenters fixate on perceived masculinity as a major topic of discussion (this is not what Allahpundit is doing here). As with the pajama boy reactions, there's a certain amount of uncomfortable...latency that bleeds through such commentary.\n\nBut there's a real question of whether Obama is sliding into Carteresque \"Killer Rabbit\" territory or H.W. Bush-level \"wimp factor\"or Mr. Creosote-style vomiting (god, wouldn't that be AWESOME?).\n\nHe's had a string of really awful micro-fuckups and mini-scandals of late and he's already a lame duck long before his last two years in office kick in.
