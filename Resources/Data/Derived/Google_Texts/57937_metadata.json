The penalty continues to increase exponentially as a person continues to skip coverage and hits 2.5% of annual income by 2016.\n\nThe administration has said they are aiming to have 2.7 million young and healthy enrollees get coverage of a total seven million enrollees on the exchanges in year one in order to balance out the pool of policyholders and keep a lid on premium costs.\n\nBut if recent numbers out of Kentucky\u2019s state-run exchange are any indication, young people aren\u2019t eager to get coverage, meaning the pool of policyholders are older, less healthy, and more expensive to insure. This trend could potentially increase premiums across the board, experts say, as the law continues its troubled rollout.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, data from Kentucky\u2019s state-run exchange shows 24% of its 4,631 enrollees as of Nov. 1 were ages 0 to 34, 37% were ages 35 to 54 and 39% were 55 and up.\n\nMorningstar insurance analyst Vishnu Lekraj says premiums will likely increase over the next several years due to \u201cadverse selection issues.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf young people do not sign up for these plans, premiums will have to go up because the risk pool becomes more risky,\u201d Lekraj says. \u201cBut because of the way the ACA is written, there is a cap in place by the government on what percent of household income can be spent on premiums. If a household goes over those limits, that is where subsidies kick in.\u201d\n\nSubsidies are currently available for those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level, about $45,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four.\n\nPremium increases likely won\u2019t kick in immediately, according to Lekraj, and instead will occur within two to three years.\n\n\u201cPolitically, that is damaging to the administration and for the success of the ACA, if premiums go up double digits year to year,\u201d he says.\n\nBut to keep up with health-care costs in general, it\u2019s likely premiums would have ticked up anyway, Lekraj says, regardless of the age of enrollees. He adds it\u2019s too early to know exactly how much higher costs consumers can expect.\n\nNational Center for Policy Analysis senior analyst Devon Herrick isn\u2019t surprised about younger enrollees being MIA. He points to New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts which befo re the ACA was signed into law already faced \u201cadverse selection death spiral\u201d issues, meaning older and sick people could not be charged more for coverage than younger and healthy people. In all three states, young people opted out of the system as a whole because of high prices.\n\n\u201cAs premiums rose, healthy people dropped out meaning the risk pool was high,\u201d Herrick says. \u201cPremiums rose again, and more healthy people dropped out. The costs for individual insurance were double and triple the national average.\u201d\n\nHerrick says insurers wanted to have the average age of enrollees around 40-41 years old, but in states like Kentucky, the average age is trending a decade higher, the WSJ reports.\n\n\u201cIf the average age of enrollees is a decade older, and the health status is worse than expected, that will cause premiums to skyrocket,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-10 10:05:44 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The latest enrollment numbers for Kentucky\u2019s state-run exchange show that young people aren\u2019t flocking to sign up for health insurance, and that can be a big problem for the president\u2019s signature legislation.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/11/05/what-happens-if-young-people-dont-sign-up-for-obamacare.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2013/11/05/what-happens-if-young-people-dont-sign-up-for-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452436061808.jpg?ve=1", "description": "The latest enrollment numbers for Kentucky\u2019s state-run exchange show that young people aren\u2019t flocking to sign up for health insurance, and that can be a big problem for the president\u2019s signature legislation.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What Happens if Young People Don\u2019t Sign Up for ObamaCare?"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS\"],\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"What Happens if Young People Don\\u2019t Sign Up for ObamaCare?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2013/11/05/what-happens-if-young-people-dont-sign-up-for-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452436061808.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-05T19:40:44Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/11/05/what-happens-if-young-people-dont-sign-up-for-obamacare.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"b42618ee-08e0-456f-80c9-17bc20d609fe\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "The latest enrollment numbers for Kentucky\u2019s state-run exchange show that young people aren\u2019t flocking to sign up for health insurance, and that can be a big problem for the president\u2019s signature legislation.", "dc.identifier": "b42618ee-08e0-456f-80c9-17bc20d609fe", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "description": "The latest enrollment numbers for Kentucky\u2019s state-run exchange show that young people aren\u2019t flocking to sign up for health insurance, and that can be a big problem for the president\u2019s signature legislation.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "What Happens If Young People Don\u2019t Sign Up For Obamacare?", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-10 10:05:44 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "The latest enrollment numbers for Kentucky\u2019s state-run exchange show that young people aren\u2019t flocking to sign up for health insurance, and that can be a big problem for the president\u2019s signature legislation.", "title": "What Happens if Young People Don\u2019t Sign Up for ObamaCare?
