"article_text": "A notorious computer hacker who goes by \u201cWeev\u201d has taken credit for a flurry of anti-Semitic and racist fliers that have been mysteriously appearing on printers at over a dozen colleges.\n\nWeev, whose real name is Andrew Auernheimer, told The New York Times that he sent the fliers to every publicly accessible printer in North America and was not intending to target college campuses.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the fliers caused a stir in the higher education world, which has been embroiled in debates over racial sensitivity and racially motivated incidents.\n\nAuernheimer\u2019s fliers fed into these tensions, as they were covered in swastikas and mentioned \u201cthe struggle for global white supremacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite man, are you sick and tired of the Jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneracy?\u201d the poster declared.\n\nThe flier then directed people to the The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website.\n\nAuernheimer told the Times that free speech concerns had driven his act of protest.\n\n\u201cMy motivation is this: White cultures and only white cultures are subject to an invasion of foreigners,\u201d he said.\n\nThe printings, which occurred at campuses across the country, came at difficult times for several of the schools.\n\nPrinceton University received the fliers only months after the Black Justice League, an activist group, led a sit-in that called for former President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s name to be removed from campus buildings because of his racist views and policies.\n\nThe posters also appeared at Smith College, Mount Holyoke College, Northeastern University, DePaul University, the University of Southern California, the University of Massachusetts and the University of California, Berkeley, among others.\n\nAuernheimer gained notoriety in 2010, when he was part of a group of hackers that cracked into AT&T\u2019s servers and accessed 114,000 customers\u2019 data.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"Weev\" sent the neo-Nazi fliers to all publicly accissible printers in North America.", "description": "\"Weev\" sent the
