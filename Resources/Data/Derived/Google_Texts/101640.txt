Faith-based organizations went to federal court Monday to argue that an exemption to the Affordable Care Act meant to keep them from being forced to pay for contraceptives doesn't go far enough in protecting their freedom of religion.

According to a story from The Associated Press, the plaintiffs argued Monday in the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that because they have to pass on the coverage to another party they are complicit in providing contraceptives including the morning-after pill.

The groups with exemptions are not required to provide contraceptives to their employees, but they must inform the federal government who then has a third-party provide the birth control measures. Other companies must provide contraception to women free of charge under the Affordable Care Act.

Greg Baylor, a lawyer for Southern Nazarene University in Bethany, Oklahoma, told The AP that, "It is morally problematic" to sign the forms that pass the responsibility for prescribing the contraceptives along to another entity.

"There are plenty of other ways the government could put (emergency contraception) in the hands of the people without us," Baylor said.

Plaintiffs bringing suit include a group of Catholic nuns from Colorado and four Christian colleges in Oklahoma, according to a Colorado Public Radio story.

According to the AP story, Judge Bobby Baldock asked why the exemption process burdens religious groups when the form essentially tells the government, "You can go pound sand because we don't condone it, we don't agree with it."
