They are sometimes called halfway houses.\n\nThe board appointed six people from 11 candidates who applied.\n\nThose appointed include Cobea Becker, a Pueblo attorney; Pamela Cress, a previous board member; Melissa Michaelis, a public defender; and Patricia Tripp, a former Department of Corrections employee.\n\nOthers include Robert Cannon, community service coordinator at the Pueblo Municipal Courts and Amiel Markenson.\n\nCommissioner Terry Hart said it is critical to have a solid balance on the new board between the defense (of criminals) side, the law enforcement side and the general community side.\n\n\u201cThat balance is what delivers the best services that we can get to the community and also to the clientele coming from a diversionary or a transitional perspective,\u201d Hart said.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled that we are going back to doing this.\u201d\n\nThe board already had seven standing members representing the district attorney, Pueblo chief of police, Pueblo County sheriff, chief district judge, chief probation officer, public defender and the DOC.\n\nThose appointees include Karl Kuenhold, 10th Judicial District DA; Capt. Eric Bravo, city of Pueblo chief of police; and Bureau Chief Darlene Alcala, Pueblo County sheriff.\n\nOthers include Chief Judge Deborah Eyler, 10th Judicial District; Chief Probation Officer David Simental, 10th Judicial District; David Lipka, Colorado State Pueblo Defender-Pueblo Regional Office; and Deborah Duran, DOC.\n\nThese members serve a three-year term as ex officio members.\n\nThe commissioners in 1999 set up a community corrections board to provide fairness in screening offenders for placement in two community corrections centers. In 2010, the county commissioners repealed that resolution and recreated a structure with the commissioners serving as the community corrections board, along with revised screening criteria.\n\nThe process to revise community corrections started two years ago, when there were three agencies providing the service.\n\nA 2012 state audit ranked Pueblo facilities as the least safe in the state, a finding that was disputed by community corrections operators at the time.\n\nanthonym@chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/politics/2957879-120/community-pueblo-board-corrections", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://www.chieftain.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=w1z0m1OrVkx1edjekxD1Ys$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYtAFSpiZuqr79UdYsas06zoWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "Six named to halfway house board"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "article_summary": "correctionsIt will oversee transition of prison inmates into communityby anthony a. mestas the pueblo chieftainThe Pueblo County Board of Commissioners appointed six citizen members Monday to the Pueblo County Community Corrections Board.\nTerry HartThe board will oversee community corrections, undoing a 2010 resolution that set up the Board of County Commissioners as the primary authority.\nThe commissioners in 1999 set up a community corrections board to provide fairness in screening offenders for placement in two community corrections centers.\nEric Bravo, city of Pueblo chief of police; and Bureau Chief Darlene Alcala, Pueblo County sheriff.\nIn 2010, the county commissioners repealed that resolution and recreated a structure with the commissioners serving as the community corrections board, along with revised screening criteria."}
