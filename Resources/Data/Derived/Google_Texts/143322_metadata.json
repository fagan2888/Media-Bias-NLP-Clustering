Though next year\u2019s red ink could be slightly smaller, CBO projects a $556 billion deficit in 2016, rising toward $1 trillion in 2024 amid soaring entitlement and debt-service costs.\n\nFrom a big-picture perspective, the deficit has shrunk because tax revenue has surged \u2014 more due to economic recovery than tax hikes \u2014 as spending has been held in check.\n\nTax receipts rose an estimated $239 billion, or 8.6%, in 2014, while total outlays rose by $44 billion, or 1.3%.\n\nThe progress in erasing the trillion-dollar deficits of President Obama\u2019s first term has been aided by financial-crisis interventions and Federal Reserve quantitative easing \u2014 to the tune of about $150 billion last year.\n\nGovernment-seized mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac sent $74 billion to the Treasury in fiscal 2014. The Fed chipped in about $100 billion in its interest earnings to Treasury, or about $75 billion more than in pre-crisis times. Those payments are set to shrink in coming years.\n\nThe falling budget deficit also reflects efforts to rein in discretionary outlays \u2014 military spending fell by $30 billion, or 4.9%, last year. Meanwhile, an improving job market and the end of emergency jobless benefits cut unemployment insurance spending by $24 billion, or 34%.\n\nYet despite sequestration\u2019s spending restrictions and continued recovery in tax revenue, budget progress is about to grind to a halt and gradually reverse.\n\nOne reason is the ramping up of spending on ObamaCare. Exchange subsidies cost the government just $13 billion with the troubled launch that occurred in the second quarter of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2015, that\u2019s projected to rise to $50 billion.\n\nThe cost of Social Security and the major health entitlements (Medicare, Medicaid and ObamaCare) are expected to rise from 10% of GDP in 2013 (pre-ObamaCare) to 12.2% in 2024.\n\nOver the same period, as interest rates normalize, the cost of servicing that debt will soar from 1.3% of GDP in 2014 to 3% in a decade, according to CBO.\n\nThe CBO assumes discretionary spending will fall to a decades-low 5.2% of GDP in 2024 from 7.2% in 2013.\n\nGiven the long-awaited entitlement spending storm that is brewing, an extra fiscal burden from surging debt-service costs won\u2019t be sustainable for long.\n\nThat\u2019s why the easing of the budget deficit to 2.8% of GDP in 2014 isn\u2019t cause for relief. It\u2019s only enough progress to stabilize debt levels at about 74% of the economy, not enough for bloated debt levels from the financial crisis to begin to recede.\n\nIn 2024, net interest outlays are expected to reach $799 billion, easily exceeding defense outlays of $716 billion.\n\nFrom there, the budget debacle would accelerate, according to CBO\u2019s Long-Term Budget Outlook. From 2024 to 2034, public debt would surge from 78% of GDP to 96% of GDP as the deficit hits 6.2% of GDP and interest spending rises to 4.4% of GDP.\n\nThe fiscal outlook isn\u2019t as grim as it once was because the projected rate of health care spending growth has slowed markedly due to some hard-to-gauge combination of the weak recovery and ObamaCare\u2019s influence.
