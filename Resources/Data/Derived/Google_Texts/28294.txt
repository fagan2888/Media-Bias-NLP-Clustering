KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Britain’s Prince Harry on Sunday visited with families living at a camp in Nepal for people made homeless by last April’s devastating earthquake as he continued a trip that many hope will draw attention to Nepal’s struggle to recover from the disaster.

Harry talked to families living in the camp at Bhaktapur, just east of the capital, Kathmandu, inquiring about the living conditions. He also spent part of the second day of his five-day official visit to the Himalayan nation at palace and temple areas damaged in the quake.

About 60 families have been living in tents at the Bhaktapur camp for nearly a year and remain uncertain about when they’ll receive government assistance to rebuild their houses.

It’s just one of the camps scattered around Nepal where people have been forced to live since the earthquake struck, killing nearly 9,000 people and destroying about 1 million homes.

Authorities have been slow to push ahead with quake rebuilding efforts. A government reconstruction agency was finally appointed in December, but has yet to provide promised aid money to displaced families and guidelines to build new houses and structures.

Purushottam Suwal, 14, who guided Harry around the camp, said the prince asked about the living conditions and the traditions of the families.

Earlier on Sunday, Harry traveled to Patan, south of Kathmandu, visiting the city’s old palace and Golden Temple areas, which suffered major damage in the earthquake.
