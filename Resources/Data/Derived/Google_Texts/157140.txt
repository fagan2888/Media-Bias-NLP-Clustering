Officials say a school bus driver was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving while taking 28 students home in Napa County.

California Highway Patrol Officer Marc Respurger tells the Oakland Tribune that Jaquida Parker of Vallejo is facing charges of driving under the influence and child endangerment.

Respurger says officers arrested Parker after receiving reports of a bus blocking a road in unincorporated Napa County. He says Parker tried to turn the bus around, but it got stuck, blocking both lanes.

He says the 24-year-old driver failed sobriety tests.

Napa Valley Unified School District officials say students were not injured.
