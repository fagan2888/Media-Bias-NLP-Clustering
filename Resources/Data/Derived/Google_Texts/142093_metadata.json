Particular thanks has to be given to the great network of diocesan and other partner agencies and the support of countless individuals and institutions across the country doing heroic work to save and rebuild lives. Only in collaboration with these organizations and individuals is the Church able to amplify its voice in defense of the voiceless and the marginalized.\n\nAccording to MRS, \u201cupwards of 90,000\u201d young illegal immigrants were projected to arrive between October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014.\n\nAdditionally, MRS shows a total budget of approximately $71 million, of which nearly $66 million \u2013 or about 93% \u2013 has come from federal grants and contracts.\n\nA statement from the U.S. bishops\u2019 conference, however, says Obama\u2019s executive order barring federal contract recipients from any form of discrimination against LGBT employees \u201cshould be opposed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a result, even contractors that disregard sexual inclination in employment face the possibility of exclusion from federal contracting if their employment policies or practices reflect religious or moral objections to extramarital sexual conduct,\u201d the bishops articulate, and they add that the executive order \u201calso needlessly prefers conflict and exclusion over coexistence and cooperation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in his now customary dictatorial fashion, Barack Obama\u2019s executive order established a policy that Congress would likely not have approved. Even when the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) passed in the U.S. Senate last year, the bill still included a provision that exempted religious employers.\n\nThis religious exemption was denounced several weeks ago by LGBT rights groups such as the ACLU, GLAD, and Lambda who clearly wanted faith groups to be subjugated to such a law.\n\nIn fact, LGBT activists withdrew their support of ENDA, stating:\n\nGiven the types of workplace discrimination we see increasingly against LGBT people, together with the calls for greater permission to discriminate on religious grounds that followed immediately upon the Supreme Court\u2019s decision last week in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, it has become clear that the inclusion of this provision is no longer tenable.\n\nNevertheless, the bishops show no inclination to address whether they should be \u201ccoexisting\u201d and \u201ccooperating\u201d with the federal government in the first place.\n\nPhil Lawler, editor of Catholic World News (CWN), wonders what good the bishops\u2019 call to \u201coppose\u201d the executive order will do.\n\n\u201c[T]here is no point in a lobbying campaign,\u201d he writes. \u201cMaybe the bishops could organize a letter-writing campaign, hoping to change the President\u2019s mind, but anyone who has been watching this show for the past six years realizes that would be a waste of time and energy.\u201d\n\nInstead, Lawler suggests to the bishops, \u201cStop taking federal contracts. President Obama doesn\u2019t want help from the Catholic Church. Say it\u2019s a deal; don\u2019t give him any.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not likely, however, that the bishops will take the hint, even though the President has shown that he has been paying back the LGBT activists who bundled for him in his re-election campaign on an almost continual basis. In fact, the bishops seem to have gone along with the plan to some extent.\n\nIn November of last year, for example, Breitbart News reported that the bishops\u2019 MRS had revised and expanded its training to workers in federally funded refugee resettlement programs to \u201caddress the needs of particularly vulnerable groups of children, including youth who may be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.\u201d\n\nUpdated Bridging Refugee Youth and Children\u2019s Services (BRYCS) training manuals, published by the U.S. Catholic bishops and funded with a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services (HHS), advise staff members on how to be sensitive to the sexual needs of LGBT young migrants while they make \u201cno reference to moral law or the practice of virtue,\u201d as CWN observed.\n\nWhile Obama\u2019s LGBT executive order currently applies only to federal contracts, and not grants, it\u2019s likely, given how the current administration operates, that extension will be made soon, especially with LGBT activists pressuring a president who has been threatened with impeachment.\n\nWhat would happen if the bishops told Obama, \u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d during the current flooding of the U.S. border with illegal young immigrants?\n\n\u201cImagine the chaos that would ensue if \u2018the largest resettlement agency in the United States\u2019 \u2013 the bishops\u2019 MRS office \u2013 withdrew from that effort,\u201d Lawler writes. \u201cFor decades, some concerned Catholics have warned that by accepting (and, more important, energetically lobbying for) government support, Catholic charities have compromised their independence. President Obama has now illustrated that point.\u201d\n\nGiven that, from its annual report, the bishops\u2019 MRS program would shrink down to almost nothing without federal grants, Lawler concludes, \u201cWhat would be left would be a recognizably Catholic charity, not a federal program administered through the bishops\u2019 conference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to President Obama's executive order last week banning", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "In response to President Obama's executive order last week banning", "title": "U.S. Catholic Bishops' Partnership with Feds on Immigration Belies Deeper Conflicts - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/catholic-immigration-march-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/27/u-s-catholic-bishops-ignore-danger-of-reliance-on-federal-government-for-migrant-services/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In response to President Obama's executive order last week banning", "title": "U.S. Catholic Bishops' Partnership with Feds on Immigration Belies Deeper Conflicts - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/catholic-immigration-march-ap.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Executive Order, Senate, Twitter,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-07-27T16:47:04-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18be\"", "article_summary": "\u201cImagine the chaos that would ensue if \u2018the largest resettlement agency in the United States\u2019 \u2013 the bishops\u2019 MRS office \u2013 withdrew from that effort,\u201d Lawler writes.\nPhil Lawler, editor of Catholic World News (CWN), wonders what good the bishops\u2019 call to \u201coppose\u201d the executive order will do.\nNevertheless, the bishops show no inclination to address whether they should be \u201ccoexisting\u201d and \u201ccooperating\u201d with the federal government in the first place.\n\u201cFor decades, some concerned Catholics have warned that by accepting (and, more important, energetically lobbying for) government support, Catholic charities have compromised their independence.\nWhat would happen if the bishops told Obama, \u201cWe\u2019re done,\u201d during the current flooding of the U.S. border with illegal young immigrants?"}
