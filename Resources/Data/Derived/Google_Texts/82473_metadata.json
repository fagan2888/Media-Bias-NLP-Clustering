Because of hit squads, they fear to enter U.N. refugee camps and, as a result, are then often excluded from immigration to the West,\u201d Supreme Knight Carl Anderson said in a formal statement, adding:\n\nAfter all of this, these people deserve to have the U.S. State Department call what has happened to them by its rightful name: genocide\u2014just as the European Parliament, Pope Francis, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom and so many other prominent individuals and institutions have already done.\n\nAmong those who signed the petition to include Christians as victims of ISIS in a formal genocide declaration are Mark Burnett, producer of hit television programs such as \u201cShark Tank,\u201d \u201cSurvivor,\u201d and \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d; his wife, producer and actress Roma Downey, a star of \u201cTouched by an Angel\u201d; Steve Forbes, chairman and editor-in-chief of Forbes Media; and evangelist Ravi Zacharias, founder and president of Ravi Zacharias International Ministries.\n\nThe petition, called \u201cStop the Christian Genocide,\u201d cites the United Nations\u2019 definition of \u201cgenocide\u201d as killing as well as certain acts \u201ccommitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\u201d\n\nISIS has just such an intent to destroy Christians, the petition contends:\n\nISIS\u2019s own public statements take \u2018credit\u2019 for the murder of Christians precisely because they are Christian and express its intent to wholly eradicate Christian and other minority communities from its \u2018Islamic State.\u2019\n\nISIS has declared publicly its intent to \u201cgo forth for jihad\u201d against \u201cthe Jews, the Christians \u2026 and the proponents of democracy,\u201d according to a fact sheet released in January by Alliance Defending Freedom International, a legal organization that advocates religious freedom.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom points out that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, created by the U.N. Security Council, declared a formal genocide when 20 percent of the Muslim population of the Bosnian town of Srebrenica was killed by Radislav Krstic, a Bosnian Serb general.\n\nAs many as 81 percent of the Christian population in Iraq has \u201cdisappeared either by killings or forced migration because of the ongoing persecution,\u201d according to the fact sheet, yet no genocide has been declared.\n\nKerry noted in a formal statement on Iraq in August 2014 that \u201c[ISIS\u2019] campaign of terror against the innocent, including Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque and targeted acts of violence bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide.\u201d\n\nLike Christians, the Yazidi people\u2014a small religious minority that practices the ancient religion Yazidism\u2014have been persecuted by ISIS for their non-Muslim faith.\n\n\u201cThe distinction matters for the legal rights of these people, but also to do justice to what has been happening to them,\u201d Andrew Walther, vice president for media, research, and development for the Knights of Columbus, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cTo say this is bad but not that bad doesn\u2019t give this situation full weight,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\n\nKerry has until March 17 to decide whether to make a declaration, according to a provision in the omnibus spending bill passed by Congress.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A petition asks the secretary of state to end America\u2019s silence on ISIS\u2019s \u201congoing genocide against Christians and other minority groups in Iraq and Syria.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A petition asks the secretary of state to end America\u2019s silence on ISIS\u2019s \u201congoing genocide against Christians and other minority groups in Iraq and Syria.\u201d", "title": "Kerry Urged to Accuse ISIS of Genocide Against Christians", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160225_StopChristianGenocide_Mork_SS.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-02T23:48:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QsfHYm"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A petition asks the secretary of state to end America\u2019s silence on ISIS\u2019s \u201congoing genocide against Christians and other minority groups in Iraq and Syria.\u201d", "title": "Kerry Urged to Accuse ISIS of Genocide Against Christians", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160225_StopChristianGenocide_Mork_SS.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "middle east,terrorism", "published_time": "2016-03-02T16:18:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-02T23:48:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Stop the Christian Genocide, petition, Knights of Columbus, In Defense of Christians, ISIS, Islamic State, Middle East, John Kerry, State Department"}, "article_summary": "Pressure is building for Secretary of State John Kerry to include Christians in a declaration of genocide against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\nAn online petition asking Kerry to end U.S. silence about the \u201congoing genocide against Christians and other minority groups in Iraq and Syria\u201d had over 42,500 signatures as of Tuesday.\nKerry has until March 17 to decide whether to make a declaration, according to a provision in the omnibus spending bill passed by Congress.\n\u201cTo say this is bad but not that bad doesn\u2019t give this situation full weight,\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\n\u201cChristians in Iraq and Syria have suffered injustice after injustice by being kidnapped [or] killed, having their homes and churches confiscated or destroyed, and being forced to flee for their lives."}
