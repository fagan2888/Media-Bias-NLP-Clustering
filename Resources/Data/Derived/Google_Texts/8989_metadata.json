If they had just gotten out of their own way, they could have kept up the media glare on the embarrassing presidential imagery of the Syria episode, swiftly followed by the massively uncool cock-up of the health-care rollout. They wouldn\u2019t have had to lift a finger. Instead they redirected all that lovely negative karma at themselves.\n\nElaine Thompson/AP\n\nPerhaps the most damaging aspect of the Obamacare tech nightmare is how wholly predictable it all was. Anyone who has been involved in building the most rudimentary of web operations knows nothing ever works as it\u2019s supposed to. Even awesome Apple, mighty Microsoft, and gargantuan Google miss deadlines.\n\nNot only is the tech itself full of glitches and gremlins, but the \u201ccontent\u201d it conveys requires very different species of people to collaborate in ways they never will. Techies know they hold all the cards to the obscure and procrastinate on the grounds of engineering mysteries. The information or editorial people feel so pass\u00e9 and irrelevant that they never voice their secret fears that what is moving inexorably forward makes no discernible sense. When panic sets in, they regress completely and start ordering up things that are technical flops, too. Then everyone braces for this car crash they hope won\u2019t metastasize into a train wreck.\n\nThat the capable, silvery Kathleen Sebelius is the face of Obamacare makes me want to weep. She brings to mind every legacy media company editor in chief in 2009 pluckily defending some doomed new digital enhancement that will later be scrapped and paid for with newsroom layoffs.\n\nThere is an even more doleful cultural signifier in all this: the mess that invariably follows the big announcement. It\u2019s been going on a long time, this high-flying inattention to detail in American life.\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis is usually attributed to vampire squid greed. There was certainly a lot of that. But it was also just as likely to have been caused by the chaos of process created by those big, sexy bank mergers when, in the name of \u201ceconomies of scale,\u201d critical members of the trust and responsibility chain were cavalierly eliminated.\n\nIn today\u2019s gig economy, where jobs have been replaced by \u201cportfolios of projects,\u201d most people find themselves doing more things less well for two-thirds of the money. They\u2014we\u2014text each other we\u2019re \u201ccrazed.\u201d Then comes a frenzy of activity accomplishing nothing much. Much of the working day is spent papering over a job half done from the day before. Voicemails vanish into the void. Messages from colleagues, to say nothing of friends, are buried forever under the email avalanche. Everywhere you turn, people feel stranded by holes in the chain of command. No one has time, in all the hyper-connectivity, to talk about the details, the structure, the unglamorous granularity of how things get done.\n\nThe best shoe-leather reporting I have seen on the health-care rollout was on Hollywood Boulevard\u2014of all places\u2014earlier this month, when Jimmy Kimmel Live stopped pedestrians to ask, \u201cWhat would you rather have? Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act?\u201d Respondents robustly scorned Obamacare as \u201cun-American\u201d or worthless, while conceding that the Affordable Care Act had a lot to recommend it.
