Marco Rubio for president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been fighting for a lot of things I believe in and look he\u2019s not afraid to engage on the hottest subjects,\u201d Issa said during an interview on Fox News this morning about his endorsement, calling the Florida Senator an \u201cexciting candidate.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAs Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Issa fought many battles with the Obama administration over Obamacare, the IRS scandals, and the truth about what happened during the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi. Issa cited Rubio\u2019s effort to stop Obamacare bailouts from taxpayers as one reason he supported him for president.\n\nIssa is not completely in line with Rubio on all issues, especially on intelligence reforms in the USA Freedom Act that Rubio opposed. Rubio\u2019s campaign has criticized Sen. Ted Cruz for supporting the USA Freedom act, suggesting he is weak on national security.\n\nIssa said that bulk collection of meta-data by the National Security was concerning, which is why he decided to vote for reform.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to be wrong on this but the act as we amended it has monitoring, so if we need to do something different, obviously, Congress will,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa is endorsing Sen.
