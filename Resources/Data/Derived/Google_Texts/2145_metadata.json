The list goes on and on, further supporting the variety of accusations and reports that say Facebook does far more harm than good. People living with diabetes, Facebook is anything but evil, as those living with the two most common forms of the disease will argue that Facebook has become an immense source of support and much-needed connection in their daily lives.\n\nBut more, first, on the evils of Facebook: studies have actually documented that seeing posts about the lives of your friends can actually cause a person to feel worse about their own lives. Those most prone to this type of depression are teens, reports the American Academy of Pediatrics: \u201cResearchers have proposed a new phenomenon called \u2018Facebook depression\u2019 that develops when preteens and teens spend a great deal of time on social media sites, such as Facebook, and then begin to exhibit classic symptoms of depression.\u201d\n\nWhile it can\u2019t be denied that having friendships which revolve primarily through the internet could absolutely be detrimental to a person\u2019s social skills for real-life interactions, and the reality that people are far more likely to be criticized and harassed for what they post and say on Facebook when abusers can hide behind a computer screen, Facebook is not all evil.\n\nFor people with diabetes, Facebook can be the source of immense comfort, support, kindness, generosity, and empowerment.\n\nDue to the privacy laws of HIPAA, people with diabetes cannot rely on healthcare professionals to inform them of others in their community living with the disease. In the diabetes online community, Facebook has become a source of connection for thousands of people across the globe. Thousands. Some of these connections start through adults or teens living with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, others start through the parents of children with type 1 diabetes connecting with other parents. In general, however, the groups appear to have mixed themselves together, with a larger group of thousands that consists of type 1s, type 2s, teenagers and adults, and parents of children with type 1 diabetes.\n\nLiterally, thousands of people with diabetes are connected to each other personally, have met in real life thanks to their relationship on Facebook, and work together to increase the amount of support and advocacy available to those living with diabetes across the globe with events such as #DSMA Twitter Chat (which stands for Diabetes Social Media Advocacy) every Wednesday night at 9 p.m. EST, or DiabetesAdvocates\u2013both of which were born largely due to relationships that evolved through Facebook.\n\nWhy is this online social community such a profoundly positive resource for a disease like diabetes? While each type of diabetes has its differences, the varieties of the disease have enough similarities and challenges to bring them together, but the community doesn\u2019t exist just in specified diabetes \u201cgroups\u201d or \u201cpages,\u201d they exist through straightforward friendships on Facebook.\n\nUnderstanding the basics of diabetes is also important:\n\nType 1 diabetes, for instance, is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system will, at any age between birth and as high as age 50, attack the cells of the pancreas responsible for producing insulin. Insulin is a hormone essential to life in all mammals, as it is the only way glucose from the food we eat can be taken into the cells throughout the body that need that glucose for energy. Without insulin, any human being would eventually die.\n\nType 2 diabetes, albeit distorted greatly throughout greater mainstream media as pertaining primarily to obesity and eating \u201ctoo much sugar,\u201d is characterized most commonly in science by a dysfunction in the body\u2019s ability to either produce or utilize insulin; however, it can also be the result of the liver\u2019s overproduction of glycogen, too. In other words, while there is absolutely a correlation with excess body fat and insulin resistance which can lead to higher blood sugars and diabetes, the cause of type 2 diabetes is not simply about sugar and obesity. (If it were that simple, everyone who is overweight or obese would have diabetes and this is not the case.) Some forms of type 2 diabetes can be managed through changes in diet and exercise, while others require oral medications or insulin injections.\n\nToday, there is no cure for either type of diabetes\u2013and no, losing weight will not \u201ccure\u201d diabetes, it simply causes the symptoms of that person\u2019s diabetes to subside, therefore making weight-loss one form of successful treatment for diabetes for some, not all.\n\nOne of the largest benefits of Facebook for those with diabetes are the lifestyle lessons and simple support that is shared around actual management of the disease. Gene Bertram, living with diabetes explains, \u201cIt\u2019s put me in communication with other diabetics to find out how they are controlling their disease and improving their health.\u201d\n\nRichard Vaughn, who was diagnosed with diabetes in 1945 and continues to thrive today, says, \u201cI did not know about diabetes online until 2006, so that was 61 years before my online experience. After consulting with other type 1 diabetics in the diabetes website support groups, I realized that I had much more to learn. At least 75% of my current knowledge about type 1 diabetes has been learned in the diabetes online community.\u201d\n\nAs for the accusations that Facebook actually induces depression, those in the diabetes community have a different perspective:\n\nLauren Walsh, living with diabetes, explains, \u201cI was diagnosed just over 2 years ago, I was 43 years with 3 kids and a granddaughter. This came out of nowhere, totally unexpected. I have truly found a wonderful community of others with diabetes that I can actually connect with and have even learned from! I love the diabetes online community!\u201d\n\nMichael Kenney, living with diabetes, explains that through Facebook he has been, \u201cencouraged by others and been able to help others get answers to the same questions I had early on in my diagnosis.\u201d\n\nDonna Shuford, married to a man living with diabetes, explains, \u201cIt has made me realize I\u2019m not alone. It has allowed me to reach out to other parents with diabetes with multiple children. I would be more depressed about my life without Facebook.\u201d\n\nAccording to clinical psychologist Dr. Jen Nash of PositiveDiabetes who specializes in treating people with diabetes, depression has proven to be two to three times more prevalent in people with diabetes. If having access to a free, simple resource like Facebook can alleviate some or a great deal of that depression, that\u2019s a very good thing.\n\nSue Lebarron, living with diabetes, adds, \u201cIt helps me keep in touch with people that truly understand the frustrations of diabetes because they have those frustrations, too!.\u201d\n\nShana Hammer, a mom of children with diabetes, says, \u201cI was able to connect and contact other moms of multiple kids with type 1 diabetes\u2013there are none in my area.\u201d\n\nTodd Williamson, living with diabetes, explains, \u201cThrough Facebook, I\u2019ve been able to connect with other people with type 1 diabetes, which is a good thing. As many people as there are with diabetes, I\u2019ve literally yet to meet another person with type 1 in my city. Nobody.\u201d\n\nJess Buchanan, living with diabetes, adds, \u201cIt gives me a place to vent about diabetes and this is dually beneficial: First, friends who also have diabetes comment with things that make me feel better. Secondly, my friends without diabetes often follow up with questions. So basically it\u2019s a chance to both empathize and educate. A win-win!\u201d\n\nIn the end, though, both type 1 and type 2 forms of diabetes are constantly ostracized, mocked, and lectured by the general community. Accused of eating too much, being too lazy, being too fat, having given it to themselves or to their children for \u201ceating too much sugar.\u201d And of course, the constant lectures and inaccurate statements about diabetes in the media only adds to the lectures and scolding people with diabetes receive from the world around them.\n\nWhile people with diabetes find themselves constantly being told by strangers and overly policing friends and family that they need to \u201ceat less sugar, lose weight, and take better care of themselves,\u201d through Facebook these people with diabetes can surround themselves with a community who understands the lesser known aspects of life that make this disease so challenging.\n\nCommon phrases and questions those in the Facebook community of diabetes hear include: \u201cWhy did you feed your child so much candy? You gave them diabetes!\u201d or \u201cMy grandmother had diabetes\u2026she lost both legs, and then she died\u201d or \u201cYou have diabetes? You don\u2019t look that fat!\u201d or \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just cure it by exercising more?\u201d or Oh, you have diabetes? That sucks!\u201d or \u201cWell, it\u2019s your fault for eating too much candy.\u201d\n\nNone of the above statements are actually scientifically accurate observations about life with diabetes or how to treat it. Instead, they are merely misconceptions about diabetes perpetuated by mainstream media.\n\nIn reality, there is no one-size-fits all treatment for diabetes. Everyone\u2019s insulin needs and oral medication needs vary and can change easily throughout their entire lives. The constant order to \u201cexercise more often\u201d comes with the overwhelming challenge of actually balancing one\u2019s blood sugar levels during exercise, because exercise can easily cause dangerous drops in blood sugar if not carefully monitored, making exercise one of the hardest things to do more of safely.\n\nThrough Facebook, the people in this community have found allies in the daily challenge of balancing their blood sugars around insulin injections, exercise, nutrition, and the daily stressors of life. In life with diabetes, even an adrenaline-rushing ride on a roller coaster or white-water rafting can cause a significant spike in blood sugar.\n\nEven Charlie Kimball, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2007 and recently won the IZOD IndyCar series in Ohio in early August, said about the growing diabetes community online, \u201cI was blown away by the amount of support and outreach. I know there are many people out there with diabetes, and I have met so many, but it still caught me by surprise how impressive and how significant the response was. It meant so much to me to hear from them.\u201d\n\nKimball continues, \u201cThe coolest thing about the diabetes community is that you are now part of this tight-knit community that inspires, shares, and helps one another. If you can help someone with their diabetes, then you help them with their whole life.\u201d\n\nThe best part about this online community? Facebook doesn\u2019t require appointments or any 8 to 5 limitations\u2013it\u2019s always there. Thanks to Facebook, says Jennifer Davis, who lives with diabetes, \u201cI know that I am not alone in my struggles with diabetes. I can go online at any time of day and get support.\u201d\n\nLisa Stoler may have encompassed every benefit of Facebook for people with diabetes in her story, explaining that, \u201cBefore I found the diabetes online community in Facebook, I had been completely alone in my diabetes. I never knew anyone else that was like me and felt misunderstood all the time. Now I know there is always someone just a tap away that know what I\u2019m going through.\u201d\n\nStoler adds, \u201cIn the middle of the darkest nights when I\u2019m dragging myself to the kitchen with a low blood sugar, using all my strength to get food, sit in a chair, and stay alive while waiting for my blood sugar to come up, I know I am not alone because of the community on Facebook. There are always at least 10 type 1 diabetes right at my fingertips. And after 42 years as a type 1 diabetic, I thought I know everything but realized I didn\u2019t\u2013I have learned so much from my online friends in the diabetes community, enabling me to take better care of myself and live a healthier, fuller life.\u201d\n\nWhile emotional \u201csupport\u201d gained through chatting back and forth on Facebook may not seem like a vital ingredient to one\u2019s health for most people, for those living with diabetes who know that every day comes with a variety of challenges impacting every aspect of life from breakfast to work to school to relationships to Christmas parties, it is beyond valuable. For this community, Facebook serves as an endless source of support, education, and empowerment in their lives that are impacted 24/7 by life with diabetes.\n\n<OpEd>\n\nWritten by Ginger Vieira\n\nSource 1\n\nSource 2\n\nSource 3\n\nSource 4\n\nSource 5\n\nSource 6\n\nSource 7\n\nSource 8\n\nSource 9\n\nSource 10\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "Facebook has been demonized tremendously throughout media, with claims that it causes depression, impairs social skills, creates isolation, feeds addictive behaviors, lowers self-esteem, and last b\u2026", "title": "Facebook is Not Evil Proves People with Diabetes", "url": "http://guardianlv.com/2013/09/facebook-is-not-evil-proves-people-with-diabetes/", "image": {"width": 450, "identifier": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/maxresdefault2-e1378041367857.jpg", "height": 255}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-01T15:50:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-03T22:24:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://guardianlv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/maxresdefault2-e1378041367857.jpg?w=640", "site": "@ifrackle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94b5\"", "article_summary": "In the diabetes online community, Facebook has become a source of connection for thousands of people across the globe.\nI can go online at any time of day and get support.\u201dLisa Stoler may have encompassed every benefit of Facebook for people with diabetes in her story, explaining that, \u201cBefore I found the diabetes online community in Facebook, I had been completely alone in my diabetes.\nCommon phrases and questions those in the Facebook community of diabetes hear include: \u201cWhy did you feed your child so much candy?\nFor people with diabetes, Facebook can be the source of immense comfort, support, kindness, generosity, and empowerment.\nThanks to Facebook, says Jennifer Davis, who lives with diabetes, \u201cI know that I am not alone in my struggles with diabetes."}
