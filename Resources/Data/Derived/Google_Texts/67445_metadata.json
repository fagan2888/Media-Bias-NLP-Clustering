Think segregated restaurants in the Deep South prior to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and you\u2019re drawing a mental picture of what the Christian Right hoped to achieve in Kansas. The language of the bill would have allowed restaurants, for instance, to deny service to \u201cany marriage, domestic partnership,\u201d or \u201ccivil union\u201d that \u201cwould be contrary to the sincerely held religious beliefs of the individual or religious entity regarding sex or gender.\u201d Thankfully, the bill was killed in the Senate. But Kansas was merely the opening salvo.\n\nRepublicans in Arizona, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Idaho, Ohio, Mississippi, and Oklahoma have now introduced bills that would also grant religious zealots the right the segregate their businesses against LGBT Americans. Significantly, all of these bills were introduced this year.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Arizona Senate passed a bill allowing religious-based discrimination. The bill now travels to the House where it\u2019s expected to pass. \u201cSB 1062 permits discrimination under the guise of religious freedom,\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Anna Tovar said in a statement. \u201cWith the express consent of Republicans in this Legislature, many Arizonans will find themselves members of a separate and unequal class under this law because of their sexual orientation. This bill may also open the door to discriminate based on race, familial status, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a deliberate strategy as gay people are getting greater rights, to take away those rights and be able to discriminate,\u201d says Eunice Rho of the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cYou can have marriage, but you have no right to the privileges that come with that.\u201d\n\nEvan Hurst, associate director of Truth Wins Out, a Chicago-based nonprofit that promotes gay rights, warns, \u201cThis is a concerted campaign that the religious right has been hinting at for a couple of years now. The fact that they\u2019re doing it Jim Crow-style is remarkable, considering the fact that one would think the GOP would like to be electable among people under 50 sometime in the near future.\u201d\n\nWhile pushed by Republican lawmakers, a network of Christian Right advocate groups has handcrafted these discriminatory bills. Brian Walsh, executive director of the American Religious Freedom Program said in an interview with the Wichita Eagle, \u201cWe gave them [GOP lawmakers] suggestions and they took some of them.\u201d Julie Lynde, executive director of Cornerstone Family Council, told Al Jazeera America, \u201cWe have been involved in working on the language of the Idaho bill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nine states have proposed bills that would allow Christian businesses the right to refuse service to LGBT customers", "author": "CJ Werleman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nine states have proposed bills that would allow Christian businesses the right to refuse service to LGBT customers", "title": "Kansas, Arizona and the GOP\u2019s terrible new Jim Crow-style laws", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/26/kansas_arizona_and_the_gops_new_jim_crow_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/AP367890279153-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nine states have proposed bills that would allow Christian businesses the right to refuse service to LGBT customers", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/AP367890279153-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Kansas, Arizona and the GOP\u2019s terrible new Jim Crow-style laws", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Kansas, Arizona and the GOP\u2019s terrible new Jim Crow-style laws", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Discrimination, GOP, laws, LGBT Rights, New jim crow, Politics", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcecfa\"", "article_summary": "Think segregated restaurants in the Deep South prior to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and you\u2019re drawing a mental picture of what the Christian Right hoped to achieve in Kansas.\n\u201cSB 1062 permits discrimination under the guise of religious freedom,\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Anna Tovar said in a statement.\nLast week, Republicans in Kansas\u2019 lower house passed a bill that would have effectively allowed Christian business owners or employees the right to deny service to same-sex couples.\nTopics: AlterNet, Discrimination, GOP, laws, LGBT Rights, New jim crow, Politics, Life News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on AlternetWith LGBT rights activists winning court victories in state after state, the Christian Right has opened a new battlefield in the nation\u2019s cultural war, and they\u2019re leaving nothing behind in their effort to enact Jim Crow-era laws against gay Americans.\nOn Wednesday, the Arizona Senate passed a bill allowing religious-based discrimination."}
