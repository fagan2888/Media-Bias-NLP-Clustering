I hope 2015 finds you well and deep in the winnings of your fantasy football championship. Or at least deep in some kind of [sexual imagery].\n\nAnyway, I hope you all enjoy the disappointing slate of Wild Card games this weekend. Until then, enjoy these people\u2019s problems and my harebrained advice to them. And as always, if you have a question for next week\u2019s Mailbag, email us.\n\nDear Captain,\n\nFootball first: I\u2019m in a one-man keeper league and my options to keep are totally ass. Also, the way that this league works is that you give up your first round pick no matter who you keep, so where you picked the guy doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nThat is \u2026 sub-optimal.\n\nAnyway, my keeper from last year, for the third year in a row, was Adrian Peterson. In a related story, I finished in last. Looking at my roster, the only other keepers would be Dez Bryant or Cam Newton. Do any of those guys seem worth giving up what would be the first overall pick next year?\n\nI could see Peterson and Dez both being first-rounders, but first overall? Even with your league-mates\u2019 keepers taking some of the best names off the board, that\u2019s a tough pill to swallow.\n\nThat said, Dez and AP will both be gone by the time you pick again at 24, so all you have to do is (a) figure out who you\u2019d rather keep \u2014 personally, I\u2019d take Dez \u2014 and (b) figure out whether that player is better than anyone who will be available with the first pick. I\u2019m assuming that you have no knowledge of who\u2019s being kept until after you make your decision, so you\u2019ll have to go through every roster in the league and do some guesswork about who will be available.\n\nIf one of your opponents has, say, Aaron Rodgers and DeMarco Murray, or Jamaal Charles and Demaryius Thomas, then you can surmise that there will be viable options come the draft. It just depends on whether you think that option will be better than AP/Dez. (SPOILER: I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s letting go of an obvious #1 overall pick.)\n\nAdvice: Remember how you said that when you turned 30 that you just wanted someone who was nice like a teacher or a nurse?\n\nYes. It\u2019s a nice shortcut for weeding out bad apples if you\u2019ve dated a lot of, say, PR reps and aspiring actresses. Not that there aren\u2019t perfectly good people who are PR reps and actresses (and lawyers and financiers and whatnot), but the baseline of \u201cOh, this is a good human being\u201d tends to be higher among those who choose more altruistic careers.\n\nWell I did that!\n\nYay!\n\nI found a wonderful former teacher studying to be a nurse\n\nDang! Checking off BOTH boxes! You\u2019re an early frontrunner for KSK Mailbag Gold Star Reader of the Month.\n\nwho brightens every day that I\u2019m around her. We\u2019ve been together for nine months and we\u2019ve started talking about moving in together. She said that she\u2019d want to be engaged before she moved in with someone, even if the wedding weren\u2019t planned right away. Now, I\u2019d love to move in with her because I\u2019d love to see her every day. But being engaged after 9 months seems a little rushed to me, even if it\u2019s just a word and a ring and there\u2019s no wedding in sight. I think I\u2019d be more comfortable once we pass the year mark, but is it weird or wrong to think like this about getting engaged? I just want to do it when I\u2019m comfortable, but I also realize that an arbitrary cutoff for when I\u2019d feel comfortable seems kinda bullshit.\n\n-Want That Sweet Apartment\n\nFirst of all, this is a great problem to have: worrying about the appropriate order of cohabitation and engagement is common among thirty-ish professionals, and it\u2019s a good sign that the two of you are addressing expectations for the relationship up front. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re a Republican looking at the Affordable Care Act: you two can find a middle ground that will ultimately satisfy both of you.\n\nHow you find that middle ground, of course, will hinge on communication, willingness to compromise, and perhaps patience. You\u2019re perfectly justified in thinking that nine months into the relationship feels too early for engagement; similarly, she\u2019s well within her rights to want a commitment before moving in with a man \u2014 I\u2019ve seen too many grown women twist in the wind for years while their live-in boyfriends feel no urge to move forward with engagement or marriage.\n\nIn the meantime, I recommend a regular re-assessment of your feelings and an ongoing discussion with your girlfriend. Personally speaking, the revelation that I\u2019d found the person I wanted to spend my life with didn\u2019t immediately acclimate my brain to lifelong monogamy. Even as I rode the wave of \u201cYes! I found my future wife!\u201d there was an undertow of \u201cAw man, my awesome single life is over,\u201d which was a silly thing to happen in my brain after a year of happily dating the same person, but it happened nonetheless.\n\nI can\u2019t know if you feel the same way \u2014 or even a similar way \u2014 but it\u2019s best to have all that sorted out before you move in with a woman OR get engaged to her, whichever comes first.\n\n**********\n\nHey Captain,\n\nFantasy: I placed 3rd in my league thanks to your advice and Antonio Brown and no thanks to LeSean McCoy and Philip Rivers\u2019 rapidly degrading health. So thank you.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome! And also sorry for being so high on LeSean this year. I had no idea Chip Kelly would become a nigh-Belichickian Enemy of Fantasy Football.\n\nSex/Life: Kind of a long story so I apologize in advance. I\u2019m 29 years old and still live at home due to never being able to get a well-paying job out of college combined with $60k in student loan debt.\n\nYeah, that\u2019ll do it.\n\nAbout a month ago I was able to weasel my way into a job (100% nepotism-assisted) that finally has my life on a decent track. I\u2019ll be going from making $14/hour to close to $70k/year and now I can finally join the adult world. My plan is to live at home for maybe another year, pay off as much of my loan as I can, all the while saving everything else for an eventual apartment. Of course anything can change, but how does that sound?\n\nThat sounds like a reasonable plan towards a much better life.\n\nMy love/sex life is infinitely more sad than my living situation, so I\u2019ll break it down in easy to read list format:\n\n\u2013 I\u2019ve had sex with only 2 girls in my entire life, one when I was 18 and another about 3 years ago (neither were long-term relationships, they only lasted 3-4 months each). In between those gaps I haven\u2019t done so much as talk to a girl. The sex was infrequent and I\u2019ll freely admit to being terrible at it with both of them.\n\n\u2013 I\u2019m literally the last single person out of my group of friends who are already in the engaged/married/house & kids phases of their lives, so I\u2019m used to playing the role of 3rd/5th/7th/9th/11th wheel when we get together.\n\n\u2013 This all boils down to my horrifically low self-esteem and fear of rejection. I\u2019m only about 5\u20193\u2033 so it\u2019s tough to feel confident when you\u2019re at a bar and look like a lost 12 year old. I\u2019ve never been able to approach a girl in public but I\u2019m at least a decent conversationalist when I need to be. Not unlike how I got my current job, those two girls I slept with were a result of pure dumb luck.\n\nNot to go all inspirational-quote-a-day-calendar on you, but you make your own luck. It\u2019s no coincidence that the people who work the hardest at a particular thing also happen to be the luckiest in that regard. Yes, luck can help out any ol\u2019 Joe Schmuckatelli, but it definitely favors the person who creates more opportunities for himself.\n\nSince this is a football/sex mailbag, think of \u201cluck\u201d with women like fumbles. Due to the unpredictable nature of a fumbled football, it really is a 50-50 chance whether a team or its opponent recovers the ball. Bad teams can have good fumble luck and vice versa, but do you think any team is just like, \u201cWell, our luck will revert to the mean over a long enough arc\u201d? No. They hustle and go after every loose ball.\n\nEven more importantly, good defenses recognize that it\u2019s not the percentage of fumbles recovered that matters, it\u2019s the number of them. Would you rather have an aggressive, unlucky defense that recovers 40% of 25 forced fumbles over the course of a season, or a shitty but lucky one that recovers 70% of ten fumbles?\n\nSorry, I know you didn\u2019t sign up for word problems and football metaphors, but the point is this: don\u2019t settle for a stroke of good luck once every five years. Go out and make more of it.\n\nThe job lets me work from home a few days a week if I want to and they have an office in NYC (I live in NJ), so I\u2019m thinking I can maybe move to the city when the time is right and then try my hand at online dating? I hate to say it but I think I\u2019m too old for something like Tinder, but then again I have no idea. The lack of sexual experience is really a bummer for me right now and unfortunately I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon with me being almost 30 and living at home.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks and have a happy new year!\n\n\u2013 JK\n\nSo you\u2019ve got a late start on adulthood, and you the sex gods dealt you a less than ideal hand with your stature. You\u2019re certainly not in an advantageous position, but it\u2019s also no reason to feel sorry for yourself. People who feel sorry for themselves don\u2019t generate their own luck; confident people with joie de vivre do.\n\nI have two good friends from the Marines who are short dudes (5-3 to 5-5) that have done well in life and love. One is relentlessly positive and outgoing; the other gets by on wit and withering sarcasm (he\u2019d respond to short jokes with, \u201cOh? Is that about my height? Never heard anything like that before. Clever.\u201d Then he\u2019d roll his eyes and take a swig of beer with such disdain that you\u2019d want to crawl into a hole and die). While they have different tacks to success, their power source is the same: confidence.\n\nConfidence, as I\u2019ve written before, is a combination of experience and lies. And if you lack the experience to give you that confidence, then you do what every person who appears confident has done: you fake the fuck out of it. Fake it \u2019til you make it. You tell yourself that you\u2019re confident until you actually act confident, which makes you appear confident, which people interpret as confidence. Confidence is a con game, and the only other option is fear and regret about missed opportunities.\n\nOnce you move to New York, you will be no different than hundreds of thousands of other young-ish people paying off debt and looking for a mate in this metropolitan ratbox. Instead of fretting about your liabilities (height, lack of experience), focus on your assets:\n\ngainfully employed\n\nno clingy ex-girlfriends\n\nno history of STDs (I assume)\n\nnothing to lose\n\ntotally jacked\n\np.s. If you\u2019re not totally jacked, start going to the gym. You\u2019ve got a good frame for squats and pull-ups.\n\n**********\n\nDear KSK,\n\nTwo parter: 1. My fianc\u00e9e doesn\u2019t mind, but certainly doesn\u2019t enjoy my gas \u2013 do I owe it to her to keep it in until the wedding? I assume after the wedding is free game right?\n\nThat depends on your fianc\u00e9e. Some women think farts are hilarious \u2014 which, let\u2019s be real, they totally are \u2014 but others don\u2019t want the men they fuck to sound like a Kevin James movie. I think that\u2019s fair.\n\nSo go ahead and fart away away after the wedding if you want, but you may want to lower your expectations for the honeymoon, as well.\n\n2. She is already locked in to marry me \u2013 I\u2019ve given her a bankroll to bet with my bookie (hates football but loves money) to try and increase her interest in watching the bowl games. Fair or foul?\n\n\u2013 SWV\n\nIt\u2019s your money, you can throw it away however you want. Personally, I have a hard time imagining anyone without direct ties to Iowa or Tennessee getting too excited about the Taxslayer Bowl without a significant wager on the game. Do what you gotta do.\n\n**********\n\nHey Cap,\n\nFantasy: No championships here, but I made the playoffs with AP as my first round pick. I feel pretty okay about this.\n\nRelationships: I\u2019m currently reveling in Step #2 of the Post Breakup Plan.\n\nFor new readers unfamiliar with the Official Matt Ufford Post Breakup Plan:\n\nCut off all contact with the ex. He or she is effectively dead. I repeat: NO CONTACT. Mourn the relationship. Drink and cry and be angry, but not for longer than a month. Pour your heartbreak into improving yourself as an individual: your job, volunteering, school, the gym, anything productive that makes you a better, more fully realized person.\n\nThere\u2019s also the unofficial fourth step of \u201cREVENGE, SWEET REVENGE,\u201d but that comes from you dating someone smarter and better-looking.\n\nWhile my ex and I were dating I applied to grad school in a different city. He then moved to that city for work. We didn\u2019t do an official LDR, as that seemed unreasonable if I didn\u2019t get into school. If I got in, we agreed to pick things back up where we left off.\n\nAfter he moved, I visited and it was lovely. We stayed in close, affectionate contact during the 3 month separation. I got into school in October; he was ecstatic, I was ecstatic. We could date again! When I planned my trip to look for apartments a month ago, he insisted I stay with him for the duration.\n\nThat all seems very good and reasonable, and reads very much like the first page of a modern take on a Shakespearean tragedy.\n\nHe picks me up from the airport and then tells me \u201cI met someone two weeks ago and I want to see where this attraction takes me.\u201d So I\u2019m stuck at his house for 10 days (getting a hotel at that point was prohibitively expensive. In retrospect I still should have done it). I look for an apartment, he backtracks and says he wants to work on things (we sleep together and act like everything\u2019s fine for most of the week). Finally, he takes me to a party hosted by a female friend who made it abundantly clear she also is/was sleeping with him. He and I have a huge drunken blowout afterward because DUH.\n\nThat really is a spectacular vintage of breakup. I mean, I know it\u2019s the source of immeasurable pain for you right now, but if I could bottle your breakup and sell it to the thirsty masses, it would fetch a hefty price. Not like a Pappy Van Winkle price, but, y\u2019know, Blanton\u2019s for sure. Rest easy knowing that you have Grade-A, quality heartbreak.\n\nIt took about a week for me to execute Step #1, as I was both jilted and heartbroken (been there) and he was actively pushing the \u201cyou\u2019re my best friend\u201d angle (have not been there).\n\nWhat a fuckface.\n\nAfter Christmas I unfollowed/blocked/what have you. So here we are. It\u2019s the holidays, so drinking a ton is socially acceptable. I\u2019ve lost about 10 pounds because I have no appetite when stressed, so I have a jump on Step #2. Because I\u2019m moving, the days have been filled with my friends throwing farewell parties and generally making me feel loved and awesome, so my rational self can see past this breakup.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m leaving that support system in a few days to move 1500 miles away. I\u2019ll be in school, I\u2019m reasonably social, I bathe; making friends is theoretically easy. But I\u2019m terrified I\u2019ll end up talking to this guy again. My defenses are weak, I\u2019m feeling incredibly vulnerable, and he very much wants to stay in contact. He\u2019ll keep trying to contact me, I\u2019ll finally respond, we\u2019ll hang out, and we\u2019ll sleep together with zero consequence for him and renewed devastation for me.\n\nHe was (I thought) a very thoughtful, sweet guy. He is not: he literally told me he\u2019d never actually loved me, but dated me for so long because I am \u201cperfect on paper and everyone thought you were great for me, so\u2026\u201d He\u2019s obviously not who I thought he was, so beyond the hurt of being dumped, I\u2019m doubting my own judgment and self-worth. I don\u2019t want to confirm those doubts by letting this guy back into my life.\n\nIf you or the Kommentariat have any advice on how to stay strong once I move, I would appreciate it. Also, if you or the Kommentariat want to reaffirm that this dude is an absolute garbage person, that would be nice too.\n\nThanks Internet strangers!\n\nRest assured: he was an absolute garbage person to you. He may eventually grow and mature and become a good boyfriend/husband to a different woman down the road \u2014 which is totally unfair to you, of course \u2014 but for our intents and purposes, he is garbage. Don\u2019t even in nibble at that \u201cbest friend\u201d bait: best friends don\u2019t royally fuck each other over like he did to you. Use his assholedom to move on; you may even one day realize that him being such an inconsiderate shit was the best thing for you to cut the cord.\n\nNow, I obviously don\u2019t know where it is you\u2019re moving to, but most reasonably-sized places don\u2019t have a ton of overlap between grad students and working professionals. You are, I\u2019d wager, relatively safe from chance encounters with him.\n\nThat means any contact will come from him via text, because no one calls anyone any more. And giving him a straight-arm via text is easy: the first time he texts you, tell him, \u201cI don\u2019t want you in my life. Please don\u2019t contact me for any reason.\u201d That is firm, polite, and unequivocal in its meaning. If he follows up with anything else besides some version of \u201cI\u2019ll respect that, goodbye\u201d then your response should be \u201cFUCK OFF.\u201d No dialogue, no questions answered, just him fucking off forever until his dick rots off.\n\nWhat an asshole.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Happy New Year, dear readers and twisted Kommentariat.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"KSK Mailbag: Celebrating the New Year with New Problems\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/uproxx.com\\/ksk\\/ksk-mailbag-new-year-new-problems\\/\",\"image_url\":\"https:\\/\\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\\/2015\\/01\\/newyear.jpg?quality=90&w=600\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"UP-923381\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-02T21:06:38Z\",\"author\":\"karmicpaybackgmailcom\",\"section\":\"KSK\"}", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@UPROXX", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@KissMeSuzy"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News and Culture for the Digital Generation", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\": \"story\"}", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109605093", "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "page_id": 116548701336, "app_id": 117400151618132}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://uproxx.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bae760df0e3bd64e122a0b36facaee58?s=16", "application-name": "UPROXX", "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "keywords": "ksk, captain caveman, mailbag", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX", "published_time": "2015-01-02T21:06:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T21:06:38+00:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "UPROXX", "description": "Happy New Year, dear readers and twisted Kommentariat.", "title": "KSK Mailbag: Celebrating the New Year with New Problems", "url": "http://uproxx.com/ksk/ksk-mailbag-new-year-new-problems/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/newyear.jpg?quality=90&w=600", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4c33\"", "article_summary": "Sorry, I know you didn\u2019t sign up for word problems and football metaphors, but the point is this: don\u2019t settle for a stroke of good luck once every five years.\nI hate to say it but I think I\u2019m too old for something like Tinder, but then again I have no idea.\n(SPOILER: I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s letting go of an obvious #1 overall pick.)\nUntil then, enjoy these people\u2019s problems and my harebrained advice to them.\nPeople who feel sorry for themselves don\u2019t generate their own luck; confident people with joie de vivre do."}
