Now, the Pentagon\u2019s chief is arranging for the soldier to get free treatment for the gender dilemma.\n\nYou will pay.\n\nAnd New York City\u2019s foster-care honchos have awarded sex-change treatments to four young adults since 2010. Three individuals who believed they were saddled with the wrong genitals underwent surgeries, at a cost to taxpayers of up to $50,000 each. One received hormone treatments at a price of up to $265 a year.\n\nAll it takes is a diagnosis of gender dysphoria \u2014 previously known as gender-identity disorder. Judges go limp and government officials, terrified of being accused of denying what advocates call necessary medical treatments, are starting to dole out sex changes like candy.\n\nMichelle Kosilek, now 65, previously known as Robert, was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole for murdering wife Cheryl while living as a man in 1990 \u2014 nearly decapitating her with piano wire and leaving her in a mall parking lot in a Boston suburb.\n\nA federal judge ordered prison officials in 2012 to pay for Kosilek\u2019s sex-change surgeries, a decision affirmed by an appeals court panel. In a last-ditch attempt to stop the madness, prison officials in the Bay State argued last month that the operations aren\u2019t necessary \u2014 jailers have already bent over backward for the killer, giving Kosilek female hormones, laser hair removal and psychotherapy. Kosilek could become the nation\u2019s first inmate to get a taxpayer-paid sex change, but won\u2019t be the last.\n\nArmy Pvt. Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Bradley, is getting nothing but hugs from military brass. The former intelligence analyst, 26, is serving a 35-year sentence at a men\u2019s military lockup after being convicted last August of sending some 700,000 classified US military and State Department documents and battlefield videos to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks while working in Iraq in 2009 and \u201910. There\u2019s a problem.\n\nTransgenders are forbidden from serving in the US military, and the Defense Department does not provide trans-related medical care. But Manning can\u2019t be discharged from the service while doing time. So last month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel gave the Army approval to try to work out a plan to transfer the convict to a civilian facility, where Manning can be treated for gender dysphoria. Manning is the first military inmate to ask for hormone therapy and to be allowed to live as a woman rather than a man \u2014 but has yet to identify the treatments desired. Don\u2019t expect them to come cheap.\n\nSince it began handing out transgender-related treatments four years ago, the Administration for Children\u2019s Services, which runs the city\u2019s foster-care system, has granted four \u2014 two this year alone. A 21-year-old traveled to Pennsylvania in January for male-to-female sex-change operations, which were approved by ACS before the individual aged out of foster care at 21.\n\nIn April, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Peter Moulton ordered that a 20-year-old in foster care get $46,000 in treatments, including a full genital \u201creassignment\u2019\u2019 and \u201cfacial feminization, tracheal shaving, breast augmentation and laser-hair removal.\u2019\u2019 ACS agreed to pay the bill. That means you pay. The agency is now considering forcing you to empty your pockets to finance two more cases.\n\nHow you pay for your own sex change depends upon where you live. While many private insurance companies don\u2019t cover the surgeries, the District of Columbia and five states \u2014 California, Colorado, Oregon, Vermont and Connecticut \u2014 mandate that insurers pay for transgender treatments. (These aren\u2019t covered under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 ObamaCare \u2014 or Medicaid and Medicare.)\n\nI think it\u2019s an outrage that the public must finance expensive operations for people who may be confused, distressed \u2014 or gaming the system. The trend will only get worse.\n\nFurious over adding insult to Hillary\u2019s injury\n\nFormer Mayor Mike Bloomberg really likes Hillary Rodham Clinton. He joined a host of Democrats and former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich in defending the former secretary of state last weekend against suggestions by GOP strategist Karl Rove that she suffered traumatic brain injury when she fainted, fell and sustained a concussion in 2012.\n\n\u201cI thought it was about as inappropriate a thing as you could say,\u201d said Bloomberg, an independent, on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d calling avowed Democrat Clinton \u201ca spectacular candidate.\u201d\n\nClinton, who\u2019ll be 69 in early 2017, would be the second-oldest person, after Ronald Reagan, to be sworn in as the nation\u2019s commander-in-chief if she\u2019s elected in 2016. She\u2019ll need energy if she is to chase after her rascally husband, former President Bill Clinton, should he become the nation\u2019s first first man.\n\nThe date debate\n\nBronx substitute teacher Cassandra Fiering, 45, was fired, said school investigators, after she asked four of her fourth-graders last year to role-play her boyfriends while she played herself \u2014 then asked the kids to help her choose between two guys in their 30s. The smarties picked the older of the men, who actually returned Fiering\u2019s phone calls.\n\nFiering told The Post that she merely had a G-rated chat with kids about \u201crelationships,\u2019\u2019 and she\u2019s appealing the firing.\n\nDon\u2019t overshare with kids. Tell your problems to a licensed therapist.\n\nGift shop \u2018imported\u2019\n\nVisiting the gift shop in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, I was struck by the number of tacky items for sale that were manufactured outside the United States.\n\nA small $16 plate adorned with the American flag was made in China.
