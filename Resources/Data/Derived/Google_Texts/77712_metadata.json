John Kasich holds a meeting with volunteers at a Laconia, N.H., restaurant on Thursday. The Republican candidate has events scheduled in the state until Sunday.\n\nPublished: Saturday, 1/23/2016 - Updated: 4 months ago\n\n\n\nKasich, Bush trade blows in fight for N.H. Ohio governor\u2019s super PAC fights fire with \u2018Mud,\u2019 lays out S.C. strategy\n\nWith his viability rising as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, Ohio Gov. John Kasich parried attacks Friday from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, slamming Mr. Bush for taking a salary as a board member of an insurance company that lobbied for Obamacare.\n\nAnd on Friday the super PAC that supports Mr. Kasich\u2019s campaign announced his strategy for the next venue after New Hampshire, which is South Carolina.\n\nThe flurry of attacks occurs as Mr. Kasich now occupies second place in New Hampshire primary polls, making him the prime candidate of the so-called establishment of the GOP against billionaire Donald Trump, who leads in the state.\n\nThe first-in-the-nation primary is Feb. 9. The outcome is expected to narrow the field ahead of the next primary states \u2014 South Carolina on Feb. 20, Nevada on Feb. 23, and the 13 states that vote on Super Tuesday, March 1.\n\nThe Bush ads portray Mr. Kasich as not conservative, using votes from his 18 years as congressman and his decisions as governor, including to expand Medicaid coverage in Ohio under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.\n\nThe Bush campaign\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise, launched four negative mailings against Mr. Kasich in New Hampshire and one negative TV ad. The TV ad accuses Mr. Kasich of having \u201cforced Obamacare expansion in Ohio,\u201d voted for massive defense cuts as a congressman, and had the \u201cworst rating for spending of any governor in the country, Democrat or Republican.\u201d\n\nIn response, the Kasich campaign blasted Mr. Bush for accepting $2.4 million in pay as a board member for an insurance company that lobbied for Obamacare. And he blasted Mr. Bush for claiming to have not raised taxes while raising fees at the same time.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush couldn\u2019t fix Florida, so he played budget games and made everyone else pay more,\u201d the Kasich campaign said in a mailing. The ad alludes to $150 million in fees raised by then-Governor Bush, in a state with a $28 billion general fund budget.\n\nKasich super PAC New Day for America aired its own ad, called \u201cMud,\u201d on New Hampshire televisions.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush once stood tall, before his campaign sank like a rock and he started desperately slinging mud on fellow Republicans. That\u2019s not presidential, Jeb,\u201d the ad says.\n\nNew Day for America spokesman Connie Wehrkamp said, \u201cWhile Governor Kasich was putting Ohioans back to work and getting his state\u2019s economy back on track, Governor Bush was filling his back pocket with $2.4 million as a board member of Tenet Healthcare, a national hospital system that lobbied for the passage of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBush campaign spokeswoman Allie Brandenburger said Mr. Bush\u2019s record compares well with Mr. Kasich\u2019s \u201csupport for higher taxes, record of increasing Ohio\u2019s state spending by 40 percent, and his enthusiastic expansion of Medicaid.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder Jeb\u2019s leadership, Florida led the nation in job creation, cut taxes by $19 billion, and increased reserves to $9 billion. John Kasich is a career politician that would bring more of the same to Washington,\u201d Ms. Brandenburger said.\n\nMr. Kasich had events scheduled in New Hampshire through Sunday.\n\nThe Kasich super PAC, which by law is prohibited from coordinating campaign strategy with the candidate to preserve its right to spend unrestricted amounts of money, announced its plans to take the Kasich bandwagon to South Carolina.\n\nNew Day for America is targeting black and Democratic-leaning voters in the 6th Congressional District, a majority black district in and around Charleston, because South Carolina allows Democrats and independents to pull a Republican ballot.\n\n\u201cGov. Kasich\u2019s record and message of economic opportunity and inclusion resonates across the state, including the 6th Congressional District, and this program seeks to capitalize on that,\u201d New Day\u2019s announcement of its Majority-Minority Project said.\n\nThe organization said it has an operation in South Carolina that includes a full-time staff of eight people in six offices.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve built one of the strongest operations in South Carolina and our team is ready to step up when John Kasich comes roaring out of New Hampshire\u2019s first-in-the-nation primary,\u201d said Matt David, New Day For America\u2019s chief strategist.\n\nContact Tom Troy: tomtroy@theblade.com or 419-724-6058 or on Twitter @TomFTroy.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.toledoblade.com/image/2016/01/22/75x_b1_a4-4_cC_z/n7kasich-6.jpg", "sailthru.author": "BY TOM TROY <br>BLADE POLITICS WRITER", "description": "With his viability rising as a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, Ohio Gov.
