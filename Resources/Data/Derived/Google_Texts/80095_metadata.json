Not a bountiful bouquet to choose from, but Redskins quarterback Robert Griffin III was pleased nonetheless.\n\nLooking back at Thursday\u2019s 23-6 preseason win against the New England Patriots, Griffin was left to assess his teammates more than himself. The starting offense played just the opening drive, which ended with a 39-yard field goal from Kai Forbath. Not scoring a touchdown was Griffin\u2019s only regret from the drive.\n\n\u201cWe executed well,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cPlayed well in situational football. Third downs; in the red zone. Moved the ball up and down the field. I know the 1s only got 10 plays of that, but it trickled on down. Everyone did well.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Redskins welcome Jason Hatcher to practice, cut CB Peyton Thompson\n\nThe Redskins were without wide receivers DeSean Jackson (ankle) and Pierre Garcon (hamstring) in that game. Jackson participated in light individual drills at the start of practice Saturday. Garcon took part in most of practice \u2014 then stopped to catch more balls from the Jugs machine after practice \u2014 giving Griffin his top target back.\n\n\u201cGradually do more and more as the week goes on,\u201d Garcon said. \u201cJust making sure there are no setbacks.\u201d\n\nJackson and Garcon were not the only players limited Saturday. Tight end Jordan Reed was out with what coach Jay Gruden called a \u201c24-hour virus.\u201d Fellow tight end Mike Caussin has a sore knee. Running back Chris Thompson sprained his ankle in the preseason game. Roy Helu Jr. has a mild knee sprain, and Gruden said Helu is day-to-day. None of them practiced.\n\nPHOTOS: Redskins-Patriots preseason opener\n\nCornerback Tracy Porter (shoulder) didn\u2019t play in the preseason opener and is unlikely to play in the second preseason game, as well, though Gruden said, \u201cI think he\u2019s ready to play.\u201d\n\nAs the Redskins head toward the end of their time in Richmond \u2014 things wrap up here Tuesday \u2014 Griffin said having the New England Patriots in town last week was beneficial.\n\n\u201cPracticing against a different team was a new experience,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI think it breaks up camp. I know the team really liked it. Come back out here again (Saturday) and got to go against our guys again. It kind of just keeps you on your toes, go through your playbook; know how to go against different defenses. The Pats play a totally different style than we do.\u201d\n\nFacing his teammates Saturday, Griffin at one point completed a deep touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson, who beat DeAngelo Hall.\n\nBacarri Rambo and Brandon Meriweather were at safety because Ryan Clark (hamstring) remained out. Gruden said he wasn\u2019t sure how much longer Clark will be out.\n\nGruden also went on to match Griffin\u2019s upbeat analysis from the limited sample for the first-string offense Thursday. The Redskins were run-heavy in their play selections. They ran 44 times and passed just 26.\n\n\u201cI liked the way our backs were finishing runs,\u201d Gruden said. \u201d I liked the way our receivers were blocking.\u201d\n\nDefensively, he was equally pleased. That\u2019s not a surprise following an easy preseason win with camp just more than two weeks old. Optimism is free and readily available.\n\n\u201cI was impressed with the way we ran around (on defense),\u201d Gruden said. \u201cFlew around the football and we played some good situations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to adopt a physical style of play, obviously. Offense and defense, protect the quarterback, dominant run blocking, and obviously stopping the run and getting after the passer are key elements.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Redskins' first-string offense played just 10 plays in the preseason opener, leaving quarterback Robert Griffin III happy with the offense and wanting more.
