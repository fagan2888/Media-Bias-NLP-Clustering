John McCain of Arizona and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire have sought to steer their re-election campaigns away from party standard-bearer Donald Trump by emphasizing local issues and their opponents. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)\n\nRon Johnson had a three-pronged plan to retake the initiative in his Wisconsin Senate race : Barnstorm the state, focus on local issues, and launch a biting new ad against his opponent.\n\nBy Monday, his rhetorical contortions about Donald Trump were driving the news instead.\n\nThe first-term Republican senator, in an interview with a local Wisconsin radio show , said he intends to support the presumptive GOP nominee but declined to say he endorsed him. That raised the hackles of his critics.\n\n\"To me, support versus endorse are two totally different things,\" Johnson said.\n\nA spokesman for the senator said the incumbent\u2019s stance toward Trump had not changed \u2014 he has always intended to support the GOP nominee \u2014 and that the hubbub over his comments was exclusive to Washington, away from actual Wisconsin voters.\n\n[What's a Vulnerable Republican to Do?] But it nonetheless underscored the challenge now facing many Senate Republican candidates , as they try to steer their campaigns away from Trump but often find themselves caught in the billionaire mogul\u2019s media-driven vortex.\n\nFor many of these Republicans, their ability to win may depend on making their campaigns about anything other than the party\u2019s new standard-bearer .\n\nPolls show that Trump\u2019s unpopularity is pervasive, and Democrats have embarked on a sustained effort to link down-ballot GOP candidates to him.\n\n[How Senate Republican Campaigns Will Handle Trump] One thing is clear: the GOP campaigns won\u2019t suffer for a lack of trying. This week alone, Senate Republicans have undertaken a strong effort to push Trump out of their races.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, Sen. Patrick J. Toomey holds press conferences to condemn his opponent\u2019s support of \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d In New Hampshire, Kelly Ayotte\u2019s campaign has attacked her opponent for holding another Washington fundraiser.\n\nAnd in Arizona, John McCain\u2019s campaign has targeted his likely Democratic foe, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, in a hard-hitting ad that focuses on President Barack Obama's health care law. It was the first ad from the McCain campaign aimed at the general election.\n\n\u201cWhile Kirkpatrick is proud to put us at risk, John McCain is leading the fight to stop Obamacare,\u201d the ad says .\n\n[Senate GOP Campaigns Prepare for the Worst: Trump] Republicans say these initiatives fulfill their strategic mantra: keep it local, and keep it focused on their opponent. Johnson, for example, has made campaign stops across Wisconsin for weeks to highlight local issues that intersect with national policy, like a charter-school program in Milwaukee.\n\n\"Most of the time that we\u2019re traveling the state,\" said a battleground Republican operative. \"We\u2019re not swept over by Trump questions like we are in the national media.\"\n\nA national strategy\n\nNational Republicans are also entering the fray with a more nationally minded strategy. They\u2019re trying to prove that, when it comes to the presidential race, turnabout is fair play.\n\n[Hillary Clinton is Too Big to Fail] The National Republican Senatorial Committee this week will launch a new ad in the District of Columbia media market, attacking Hillary Clinton as untrustworthy and the face of dysfunctional Washington. (The ad is backed by a small $50,000 buy.)\n\nThe move is part of an emerging strategy from the GOP, in which Republicans link Democrats to their own likely presidential nominee. Polls indicate that Clinton, if better regarded than Trump , is still deeply unpopular.\n\nGOP strategists say they hope that because Clinton \u2014 unlike Trump \u2014 is such a conventional nominee for her party , voters will be more likely to care about her links to down-ballot Democratic candidates.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see a lot more of us tying Democratic candidates to Hillary,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the NRSC. \u201cHer numbers in these states is the most unreported story of the last month \u2014 how toxic she is.\u201d\n\n[Republicans Couldn't Muster the Honor to Fight Trump] Republicans concede that shifting the conversation away from Trump won\u2019t be easy. A GOP operative says that five reporters from the same news outlet recently asked her questions about Trump\u2019s effect on Senate candidates on the same day.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to avoid questions, but Republicans say they have been dealing with Trump\u2019s intrusion into their races since the fall. That might not be ideal, but it has given their campaigns plenty of time to learn how to deflect questions about the presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in the preseason on this for a long time,\u201d said one operative working on a battleground Senate race. \u201cSo now we\u2019ve just suited up for the game.\u201d\n\nDemocrats not worried\n\nFor months, Democrats have built their campaigns on tying Republican candidates to Trump. And the party\u2019s strategists laugh off suggestions that Republicans will find a way to ignore Trump.\n\nKirkpatrick\u2019s own campaign released a new digital, bilingual ad Tuesday as a de facto rebuttal to the McCain attack. In it, the longtime Arizona Republican\u2019s rhetoric on immigration and Latinos was compared unfavorably to Trump\u2019s.\n\n[Why Trump Could Do Lasting Damage to the GOP With Latinos] Democrats say that their own campaigns will not be focused entirely on Trump. But the likely GOP nominee does attract a lot of attention, they say, and gives their party a golden opportunity on favorable key issues.\n\n\u201cEvery little thing that Trump says, everything he does, every position he takes, it\u2019s just going to shine a light on the out-of-touch position that Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, and Pat Toomey have,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nContact Roarty at alexroarty@cqrollcall.com and follow him on Twitter @Alex_Roarty Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call on your iPhone or your Android.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ron Johnson had a three-pronged plan to retake the initiative in his Wisconsin Senate race : Barnstorm the state, focus on local issues, and launch a biting new ad against his opponent.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "Ron Johnson had a three-pronged plan to retake the initiative in his Wisconsin Senate race : Barnstorm the state, focus on local issues, and launch a biting new ad against his opponent.", "title": "Senate Republicans Try Escaping Trump Vortex", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/senate-republicans-try-escaping-trump-vortex", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/author/2016/05/17193623/gitmo_presser007_011315-1024x681.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2016-05-18T13:00:47Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "Ron Johnson had a three-pronged plan to retake the initiative in his Wisconsin Senate race : Barnstorm the state, focus on local issues, and launch a biting new ad against his opponent.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,category,author,category,category,category,category,category,RC-Tags,RC-Tags,RC-Tags,RC-Tags,RC-Tags,Post Type,2016,democrats,elections,politics,republicans,senate,Ann Kirkpatrick,Donald Trump,John McCain,Kelly Ayotte,Pat Toomey,POLI", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2016-05-18T13:00:47Z", "modified_time": "2016-05-18T13:00:47Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ron Johnson had a three-pronged plan to retake the initiative in his Wisconsin Senate race : Barnstorm the state, focus on local issues, and launch a biting new ad against his opponent.", "title": "Senate Republicans Try Escaping Trump Vortex", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/senate-republicans-try-escaping-trump-vortex", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.images.rollcall.com/image/1ed71e81ff466910ac598f06d393a96c/author/2016/05/17193623/gitmo_presser007_011315-1024x681.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "[How Senate Republican Campaigns Will Handle Trump] One thing is clear: the GOP campaigns won\u2019t suffer for a lack of trying.\n[Senate GOP Campaigns Prepare for the Worst: Trump] Republicans say these initiatives fulfill their strategic mantra: keep it local, and keep it focused on their opponent.\nThis week alone, Senate Republicans have undertaken a strong effort to push Trump out of their races.\nIt\u2019s hard to avoid questions, but Republicans say they have been dealing with Trump\u2019s intrusion into their races since the fall.\nBut it nonetheless underscored the challenge now facing many Senate Republican candidates , as they try to steer their campaigns away from Trump but often find themselves caught in the billionaire mogul\u2019s media-driven vortex."}
