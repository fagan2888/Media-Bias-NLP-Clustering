The new wipe is gentle for staff, patients and surfaces, and enables employees to clean and disinfect larger areas with fewer wipes. The hydrogen-peroxide-based disinfectant, powered by AHP\u00ae technology, can disinfect against most common healthcare-associated pathogens in just 60 seconds.\n\nThe wipe\u2019s 11-inch by 12-inch size is ideal for larger area cleaning and disinfection in operating rooms, emergency departments and patient rooms. Like all members of the Oxivir disinfectant family, it provides excellent cleaning results and fast disinfection without irritating skin and eyes.\n\n\u201cOxivir is the responsible choice when considering patient and staff comfort, surface compatibility and the environment,\u201d says Carolyn Cooke, vice president of Diversey Care Healthcare. \u201cThe new, larger wipe supports our healthcare customers\u2019 need for speed and efficiency by delivering broad efficacy and one-minute cleaning and disinfection without compromising safety.\u201d\n\nPathogens can harm patients, staff and an organization\u2019s reputation. Until recently, strong odors, skin irritants or unrealistic contact times were the norm with disinfectants. The Oxivir family of disinfectant cleaners is a proven technology that is friendly to staff and most surfaces. Oxivir Tb Wipes also offer superior cleaning performance when compared to most standard disinfectants.\n\nWith an HMIS rating of 0-0-0, Oxivir Tb Wipes fall into the lowest hazard category, requiring no safety warnings or personal protective equipment, and its unique chemistry allows it to break down to oxygen and water after use. The wipe is available in a 160-count bucket.\n\nSource: Diversey Care Healthcare\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"vpi-date": "2013-12-12", "description": "Sealed Air\u2019s Diversey Care Division introduces the new large Oxivir Tb Wipe to its leading Oxivir disinfectant line for the North America market.
