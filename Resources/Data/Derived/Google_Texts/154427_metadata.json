Washburn announced the Pamunkey Indian Tribe is one step closer to becoming the first tribe from Virginia to be federally recognized. Though this announcement is a good sign for the Pamunkey, there are still a few more steps for the Pamunkey to take and Federal Recognition for the tribe is not 100 percent guaranteed.\n\nRELATED: Pamunkey Indian Tribe One Step Closer to Federal Recognition\n\nAfter last week\u2019s announcement from the U.S. Department of the Interior that the Pamunkey Indian Tribe was acknowledged as a federally recognized tribe, the Pamunkey now has to play a waiting game. Currently, a public comment period will now be open for 180 days after which the Pamunkey tribe has an additional 60 days to respond to any comments.\n\nAccording to the Pamunkey Chief Kevin Brown, no comments are the best comments. \u201cWe do not want anyone to write letters or give any comments at all,\u201d Brown says.\n\n\u201cWe are now in the public comment period and a lot of people have been calling me because I guess they have heard the news through Indian country and they ask me what they can do or if they can write letters of support.\u201d\n\nBrown says the time for positive remarks were two years ago. He said that if anyone comments now, it would only delay the process because they would have to wait an additional 60 days.\n\n\u201cThe reason I say this is because after this 180 day waiting period, we have a 60 day response. We can waive this response period of 60 days if there are no comments. Even If someone writes a positive letter, we still have to respond and we will not be able to waive the response period. We are keeping our fingers crossed that we receive no comments positive or negative. That will move up our final report 60 days sooner,\u201d Brown says.\n\nMark Tilden (Navajo) of Tilden McCoy + Dilweg LLP is the tribal attorney for the Pamunkey. According to Tilden, with all of the waiting periods and possible responses from third parties, the Pamunkey will probably see Federal Recognition in about one years\u2019 time.\n\nTilden has seen and helped other tribes in their bid to be recognized and says the Pamunkey stand a good chance. \u201cI think there is a strong likelihood. Yet having said that I think we need to wait and see If there are any third-party comments to the proposed findings and what those proposed comments entail.\n\n\u201cUnlike other tribes, the Pamunkey Tribe was able to go through this process relatively quicker than others. They filed their petition in 2010. It has been a good 3 1/2 years for the Pamunkey, Where other tribes have reached this point after decades,\u201d Tilden said. \u201cWe have gone through this relatively quickly in comparison to other tribes but I still think they have the burden of going through stringent standards combined with a very costly process.\u201d\n\nBrown says he remembers the long process to state and federal recognition and the associated costs.\n\n\u201cIt's been about 25 years,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe started back in 1981 and we dropped it because we ran out of money. Our paperwork sat in boxes for six or seven years. Then we began working with Mark Tilden. It's been a long haul.\n\n\u201cWe received some monies from grants back in the \u201990s, but we couldn't have done this without the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) \u2013 they spent money on us out of their general fund and a lot of people donated from all over the country through NARF to help with our federal recognition. They backed us the whole way. I know we've spent over $2 million dollars,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI've read that some tribes spent between $50 and $60 million and they still were denied.\u201d\n\nBrown says he is prepared to wait out and finish the process in which the tribe will still have to wait for a final decision by Washburn after the comments and rebuttal periods.\n\n\u201cRight now we are really happy and excited where we're at, but it really means nothing. We still have to get a final decision. There are tribes that have had a good and positive preliminary report but then for one reason or another they get a negative final decision,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is not a 100 percent guarantee right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pamunkey Chief Kevin Brown says any comment, positive or negative, will just slow the process of becoming Virginia\u2019s first federally recognized tribe.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/24/kevin-brown-pamunkey-indian-tribe-chief-courtesy-kevin-brown-153226", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/kevin_brown_pamunkey_indian_tribe_chief_-_courtesy_kevin_brown.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "With Fed Recognition In Sight, Pamunkey Chief Says \u2018No Comments, Please!\u2019"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "With Fed Recognition In Sight, Pamunkey Chief Says \u2018No Comments, Please!\u2019"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/24/kevin-brown-pamunkey-indian-tribe-chief-courtesy-kevin-brown-153226", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-24T12:00-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Federal Recognition, Pamunkey Indian Tribe, Kevin K.
