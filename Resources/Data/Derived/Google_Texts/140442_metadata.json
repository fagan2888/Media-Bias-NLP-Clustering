established health care services company plans to locate in downtown South Bend and create as many as 110 new high-paying jobs.\n\nAdvanced Centers for Cancer Care will move into space at One Michiana Square with help from the city in the form of $900,000 in new technology equipment.\n\nThe company plans to start with 35 employees and grow to 110 employees in five years, with an average wage of $25 per hour, according to a development agreement with the city.\n\n\u201cThese are good-paying jobs, high-tech jobs\u201d with benefits for the downtown economy, said Chris Fielding, assistance executive director of Community Investment for the city.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the company will spend $7 million to equip and improve the space, which it will lease for an initial term of no less than five years.\n\nThe city, in turn, will spend $900,000 on technology equipment, which it will then lease back to the company.\n\nAs with similar agreements, Advanced Centers for Cancer Care will pay $1 per year for the equipment, with an option to buy it for $1 at the end of five years.\n\nThe company has pledged not to seek tax abatement for the project.\n\nAn offshoot of Mishawaka-based Michiana Hematology Oncology, Advanced Centers for Cancer Care provides management and advisory services to other health-care providers nationwide.\n\nSpecifically, the company assists providers in compliance with the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cOur purpose is to improve the quality and lower the cost of cancer care through data and analytics,\u201d said Colin Chambers, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.\n\nChambers hinted the company likely will work with other analytics firms in the area, such as Data Realty or Aunalytics, graduates of Innovation Park at Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re based in a community, you do business with a lot of companies in the community,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company\u2019s move to One Michiana Square is expected to serve as a catalyst for future improvements to the 30-year-old building, which sits at the southeast corner of Michigan and Wayne streets.\n\nThe five-story glass and granite structure, which went through foreclosure in 2013, has suffered from low tenancy in recent years and currently is about 70 percent occupied.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re delighted to have this growing firm add to South Bend\u2019s tech sector,\u201d Mayor Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \u201cBringing new life to One Michiana Square will provide job opportunities for many people and is yet another shot in the arm for downtown.\u201d\n\nThe Redevelopment Commission will consider the development agreement with the company on Thursday.\n\neblasko@sbtinfo.com\n\n574-235-6187\n\n@ErinBlasko",
