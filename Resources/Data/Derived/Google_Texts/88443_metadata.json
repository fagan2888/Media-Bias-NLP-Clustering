As Mead notes, \u201cThere is a harsh conflict of interest between the city\u2019s employees and the city\u2019s voters. ... It is in the interests of public sector unions to shelter employees from oversight and threats to their job security, regardless of how well they perform.\u201d And, also like most large blue jurisdictions (and some red ones), Chicago is in financial trouble, not least because of the high pensions secured by those unionized workers, pensions that the city can\u2019t really afford to pay. In May, Moody\u2019s downgraded Chicago\u2019s credit rating to \u201cjunk,\u201d with a negative outlook, based on this and other problems. If Emanuel gives the Black Lives Matter protesters what they want, politically powerful police unions will be angry and, if it looks like crime will rise, more businesses and taxpayers will flee the city, making bankruptcy more likely. If he doesn\u2019t give in, then he\u2019ll face more protests and unrest, which will probably lead to more businesses and taxpayers fleeing the city, also making bankruptcy more likely.\n\nRead the whole thing.\n\nAt Reason, Ed Krayewski has been out front and loud in discussing the generally underappreciated role of unions in police-abuse scandals.
