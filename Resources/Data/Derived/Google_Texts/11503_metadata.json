REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files\n\n4537771\n\nAn Iowa high school is being accused of discriminating against a student who wanted to start a Students for Life group on the grounds that it would be too \u201ccontroversial.\u201d\n\nThis comes one week after two North Dakota schools were attacked for not recognizing student anti-abortion clubs.\n\nIsabell Akers, a senior at Hampton-Dumont High School in Hampton, Iowa, claims she spent two years trying to create a Students for Life group at her school, only to be repeatedly blocked by school officials. According to Students for Life of America and its law firm, the Thomas More Society, which sent a letter to the school on Akers\u2019 behalf, she is the victim of straightforward political discrimination.\n\nIn February 2013, the letter says, Akers\u2019 attempt to form a club was rebuffed on the grounds it would be too \u201ccontroversial.\u201d The following August, Akers tried again, and after sending a follow-up inquiry every two weeks for several months she was finally allowed to create a \u201ccommunity club,\u201d which was allowed to use a school meeting space but wasn\u2019t allowed to advertise or host events like an ordinary student club.\n\nIn 2015, the letter says, Akers made another push to be recognized, arguing that a Students for Life group was legally entitled to be treated as a student club just like any other.\n\n\u201cShe was rejected again,\u201d the letter claims. \u201cWith the explanation that the issue is so controversial that the school cannot \u2018support\u2019 the club.\u201d\n\nThe letter also says that school officials tried to claim the Students for Life group would be the first non-curricular club at the school, but SLA counters that this claim doesn\u2019t stand up to scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe pro-life students are simply asking for equal treatment,\u201d said Jocelyn Floyd, the Thomas More Society\u2019s associate counsel. \u201cThe school is trying to claim that its lesser treatment is justified because Isabell\u2019s club doesn\u2019t tie in with the school\u2019s curriculum\u2014but neither do most of the school\u2019s other clubs, such as the book club, mock trial, or SADD (Students Against Drunk Driving). By law, Hampton-Dumont High School administrators must give their pro-life students the same opportunities as they give all these other school clubs.\u201d\n\nSLA argues that under the federal Equal Access Act as well as the First Amendment, all student requests to form non-curricular student clubs must be treated equally, regardless of political or religious content.\n\n\u201cThere is no legally acceptable reason to classify Isabell\u2019s club differently from any of the multitude of other non-curricular, fully recognized clubs at Hampton-Dumont High School,\u201d the letter concludes. It demands immediate recognition.\n\nThe new letter comes just one week after SLA lodged against the public school system in Fargo, N.D. There, two high schools were accused of blocking the formation of anti-abortion clubs. Fargo Public Schools has claimed the clubs were actually stalled due to a lack of proper paperwork, although they had never cited such an alleged lack of paperwork before.\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
