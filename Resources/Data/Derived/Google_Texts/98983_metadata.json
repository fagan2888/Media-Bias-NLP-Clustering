Still, most adults aren\u2019t doing much to get ready.\n\nNearly one in 10 people age 40 and over are \u201csandwiched\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re supporting a child while providing regular care for an older loved one, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nAnother 8 percent may join the ranks of double-caregivers in the next five years, citing declining health of an older relative or close friend.\n\nDueling responsibilities can make some days feel like a tug-of-war.\n\n\u201cIf my mom needs something badly, I get pulled away from my kids a lot,\u201d said Kamila Al-Najjar of Santa Rosa, Calif., a lawyer with two children and self-described health advocate for her mother.\n\nShe visits her mother\u2019s assisted living facility at least twice a week and checks in daily by phone, to oversee a list of illnesses.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with someone who is aging, toward the end of their life; then you have to deal with a teenager. I hear from my mom and daughter that I\u2019m a nag. There\u2019s no winning in it,\u201d she said.\n\nAdding to the challenge, middle-aged adults tend to be at the heights of their careers \u2014 and need to hang onto their jobs despite difficulties of care-giving, said Susan Reinhard, who directs AARP\u2019s Public Policy Institute.\n\nEmployer flexibility is a top issue as the population ages, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just their own financial security, it\u2019s the financial security for their children and for the future,\u201d Ms. Reinhard said.\n\nAfter age 65, government figures show nearly seven in 10 Americans at some point will need long-term care from a relative, home aide, assisted living or nursing home.\n\nYet the AP-NORC Center poll found overall, most Americans 40 and older \u2014 54 percent \u2014 have done little or no planning to get ready for this often pricey reality.\n\nOnly a third say they have set aside money for those needs. That\u2019s even though Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for the most common types of long-term care, and a nursing home can cost more than $90,000 a year.\n\nDrill down to the 9 percent of this age group who make up the sandwich generation, and their experience leaves them far more concerned about their own senior years.\n\nAbout half worry about being able to pay for their future care needs, compared with just over a third of other adults, the poll found. Also, 44 percent of sandwichers fear leaving debts to family, compared with 28 percent of others polled.\n\nBut the poll found the sandwich generation no more likely than other middle-aged adults to be planning and saving, possibly because of time or resources.\n\nMs. Al-Najjar is glad her mother \u201csaved all her life \u2026 so she didn\u2019t have to stress out about stuff like that.\u201d Caring for her has changed how she spends and plans for the future.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a wake-up call,\u201d she said. There are \u201ca lot of seniors in the United States that don\u2019t have that money.\u201d\n\nThe squeeze isn\u2019t ending as children grow up. Among currently sandwiched parents, 29 percent have adult children living at home, the poll found; others are providing adult children with financial assistance, meaning some are sandwiched even after their children leave the nest.\n\nAnother challenge: Finding services to help seniors live out their days at home. AARP recently opened an online \u201clivability index\u201d to rank communities on such factors as accessible housing and transit options.\n\nAnd the National Association for Area Agencies on Aging runs an Eldercare Locator \u2014 at www.eldercare.gov and 1-800-677-1116 \u2014 to help people find local resources. Last year, the locator averaged more than 22,000 requests for assistance a month. A recent report found the top needs: transportation, mostly to get to doctor appointments; in-home services, such as meals and personal care; and finding affordable housing or making age-friendly home modifications.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t generally make these calls until they\u2019re in crisis,\u201d said Sandy Markwood, chief executive of the aging agencies association. \u201cIf Mom and Dad need this as they get older, you should prepare for that, too.\u201d\n\nCarroll Burnett of Whitesboro, Texas, cared for his 88-year-old father, who had suffered a stroke, for a year before he died in March.\n\n\u201cI felt good that I could take care of him,\u201d said Mr. Burnett, a retired tool and die maker who had help from his wife and one of his three grown children. But he\u2019s saving up: \u201cI don\u2019t want any of my kids to go through what I did.\u201d\n\nThe AP-NORC Center survey was conducted by telephone April 7 to May 15 among a random national sample of 1,735 adults age 40 or older, with funding from the SCAN Foundation. Results for the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Stacey A.
