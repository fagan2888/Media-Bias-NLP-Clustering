The rule will dramatically increase federal regulation of the nation\u2019s electric industry. It will impose devastating costs on working families across America \u2014 with hugely disparate impacts from one state to another. And if states comply with the CPP, the result will be a massive federal takeover of the state governments.\n\n\n\nThe assault on the dual sovereignty of the states \u2014 the federalism enshrined in our Tenth Amendment \u2014 is nothing new. Much of the battle over Obamacare turned on the attempt to force Medicaid expansion on the states, which the Supreme Court deemed a violation of the Tenth Amendment. However, with the CPP, the EPA is attempting to take federal control of states to a whole new level \u2014 perhaps hoping that the states will meekly comply rather than calling its bluff by challenging a rule based on very questionable statutory authority.\n\n\n\nWriting in The Atlantic, Mario Loyola and Richard Epstein describe the federal takeover of the states through \u201ccooperative federalism\u201d programs as an effort to \u201cturn states into mere field offices of the federal government.\u201d Already today, they point out,\n\nfederal officials exert enormous influence over state budgets and state regulators, often behind the scenes. The new federalism replaces the \u201claboratories of democracy\u201d with heavy-handed, once-size-fits-all solutions. Uniformity wins but diversity loses, along with innovation, local choice, and the Constitution\u2019s necessary limits on government power.\n\nOne such scheme is the Clean Air Act, which \u201callows the states to issue federal permits \u2014 but only under federally approved state implementation plans.\u201d The states can\u2019t be forced to take on this role, but Loyola and Epstein note that the EPA coerces states to do so by telling them, \u201cImplement our regulations for us, or we\u2019ll do it ourselves, and your constituents will be sorry.\u201d This is the hammer behind the CPP.\n\nMuch of the management of the electricity market in the United States is under the purview of the states. Either individually or collectively, states manage the market with the goal that citizens get a generally reliable \u2014 though not always affordable \u2014 supply of electricity. Public-utility commissions and, more recently, regional transmission organizations have been the means by which this is accomplished. States set retail prices, implement green-energy policies, and manage capacity as best they can to accomplish their policy goals.\n\nOf course, the federal government managed to force its way into the mix. Under the Federal Power Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has used the interstate transmission of electricity to claim jurisdiction over wholesale operations of this major sector of the U.S. economy. So while states generally have a free hand in the retail market, management of the wholesale market is a mishmash of state and federal oversight. In recent years, the Obama administration has tried to extend FERC\u2019s reach under the guise of maintaining reliability and promoting renewable energy. But in Electric Power Supply Association v. FERC, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reminded the administration that there are limits on what it can do under the law.\n\nThe states\u2019 lead role in electricity was clearly on display in the 1990s when many of them tried to introduce competition into the electricity market. At the time, utilities\u2019 revenue usually came through rates set by regulators that reimbursed them for whatever approved expenses they had incurred \u2014 plus a reasonable profit. Even liberals at the time realized that this inefficient rate-of-return regulation couldn\u2019t turn the cheap natural gas available then into cheap electricity. Many states ultimately failed, partly because, like California, they just couldn\u2019t bring themselves to actually allow competition. But in many cases, the problem was closely linked to FERC\u2019s regulation of the wholesale market.\n\nOnly Texas, which uniquely was able to regulate the entire market on its own, fully succeeded in creating a competitive electricity market. Over the years Texas had largely freed itself from significant FERC regulation by carefully isolating its electrical grid from the rest of the country, thereby eliminating the basis for federal \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d jurisdiction. When it adopted its competitive reforms, the results were astounding. Texas now has the most competitive, successful electricity market in the U.S., if not the world.\n\nThese reforms have allowed Texas to keep up with a massive increase in demand for electricity. Since competition started in 2002, demand for electricity in Texas has increased 80 percent faster than in the rest of the country. But Texas electricity prices have actually decreased by 14 percent in real dollars and by 57 percent relative to national prices.\n\nThis tremendous benefit to Texas consumers has been accomplished solely at the risk of investors and generators, who were allowed to invest more than $36 billion in new generation capacity to meet this demand. In every other state, much of the risk of investing in new generation is placed on consumers \u2014 they pay for the generation whether they need it or not.\n\nThis success was possible only because Texas\u2019s wholesale electricity market is not subject to FERC oversight. But if the CPP survives the many legal challenges it will face, Texas\u2019s electricity market will not be independent for long. At a workshop conducted by the Public Utility Commission of Texas on July 15, I joined a long list of witnesses in testifying that the CPP will result in the federal takeover of the Texas electricity market \u2014 and that of every other state as well.\n\nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly insisted that the federal government cannot require the states to regulate. Schemes such as the Clean Air Act therefore give states a \u201cchoice\u201d between implementing EPA programs, through a State Implementation Plan (SIP), or letting EPA do the implementing itself, through a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). The choice is coercive, because in a real \u201ccontractual\u201d or \u201ccooperative\u201d setting among equals, you can\u2019t be forced to choose the lesser of two evils. But the Court has looked the other way, on the theory that so long as an FIP doesn\u2019t dragoon state agencies into federal service, there is no commandeering problem.\n\nBut there is a commandeering problem with the CPP. In New York v. United States (1992), the Supreme Court struck down a law requiring states to \u201ctake title\u201d to low-level nuclear waste within their borders or dispose of it according to federal instructions. The Court ruled that states cannot be forced to choose between two schemes neither of which the federal government would be able to impose on them as a free-standing requirement. The CPP has a lot in common with the law that was struck down in New York, because whatever the state chooses to do, its agencies will be required to regulate in accordance with federal instructions.\n\nIf states decide to comply with the CPP by developing an SIP, they would have to restructure the jurisdictional relationships of their environmental and electrical regulating entities and make substantive changes to their electricity markets. Environmental regulators would become utility regulators, and vice versa. Renewable-energy and energy-efficiency mandates would have to be greatly expanded. The dispatch of electricity would be required to take into account environmental considerations \u2014 perhaps through the imposition of a carbon tax. Many of these changes would have to be made in the retail market, despite the D.C. Circuit Court\u2019s finding that Congress has specifically confined federal \u201cjurisdiction over the sale of electricity . . . to the wholesale market.\u201d The states can\u2019t be forced to do this in an SIP.\n\nIf states choose not to participate in the CPP, the EPA will implement it through an FIP. But since the federal government can\u2019t regulate the retail market, the EPA would have to require state regulators to implement the federal regulations \u2014 again stepping beyond the authority that Congress has granted to FERC. In either case, the states really have no choices at all \u2014 either by SIP or by FIP, the states are forced to implement the provisions of the CPP that neither FERC nor the EPA has the authority to demand individually.\n\nIt is quite likely that the EPA knows it has overstepped its bounds. But the EPA is taking this step because it knows that it has little hope of achieving its desired CO2-emission-reduction goals if it is forced to regulate on its own the only entities it actually has authority to regulate \u2014 the generators. So the EPA\u2019s greatest hope is that the states will voluntarily turn their utility regulators into an extension of the federal government, fearing that if they fail to comply, the EPA would turn up the heat on the industry in a recalcitrant state by making impossible demands, threatening huge fines, and essentially shutting down the permitting of existing generation. Either states comply or the feds may turn out the lights.\n\nWhile the potential of rolling blackouts is not an attractive option, the alternative is to take one more step down the road to a unified national bureaucracy. It might not be too long until state legislatures are no longer needed, except perhaps to tax their citizens to pay the state agency staff that will then regulate the economy under the direction of the federal government.\n\n\n\nThe Founders reserved to the states \u2014 and to the people \u2014 those powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government in order to protect the people from tyranny. While the CPP is purportedly about saving the world from the horrors of CO2 emissions, it will accomplish virtually nothing in that regard. Though the stakes are high, the states should force the EPA to show its hand in order to halt the creeping federal takeover of state governments, which continues to encroach on one of the most important protections in our Constitution \u2014 federalism, and the liberties it was meant to guarantee.\n\n\u2014 Bill Peacock is vice president for research and director of the Center for Economic Freedom at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.

Uniformity wins but diversity loses, along with innovation, local choice, and the Constitution\u2019s necessary limits on government power.\n\n\nOne such scheme is the Clean Air Act, which \u201callows the states to issue federal permits \u2014 but only under federally approved state implementation plans.\u201d The states can\u2019t be forced to take on this role, but Loyola and Epstein note that the EPA coerces states to do so by telling them, \u201cImplement our regulations for us, or we\u2019ll do it ourselves, and your constituents will be sorry.\u201d This is the hammer behind the CPP.\n\nMuch of the management of the electricity market in the United States is under the purview of the states. Either individually or collectively, states manage the market with the goal that citizens get a generally reliable \u2014 though not always affordable \u2014 supply of electricity. Public-utility commissions and, more recently, regional transmission organizations have been the means by which this is accomplished. States set retail prices, implement green-energy policies, and manage capacity as best they can to accomplish their policy goals.\n\nOf course, the federal government managed to force its way into the mix. Under the Federal Power Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has used the interstate transmission of electricity to claim jurisdiction over wholesale operations of this major sector of the U.S. economy. So while states generally have a free hand in the retail market, management of the wholesale market is a mishmash of state and federal oversight. In recent years, the Obama administration has tried to extend FERC\u2019s reach under the guise of maintaining reliability and promoting renewable energy. But in Electric Power Supply Association v. FERC, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reminded the administration that there are limits on what it can do under the law.\n\nThe states\u2019 lead role in electricity was clearly on display in the 1990s when many of them tried to introduce competition into the electricity market. At the time, utilities\u2019 revenue usually came through rates set by regulators that reimbursed them for whatever approved expenses they had incurred \u2014 plus a reasonable profit. Even liberals at the time realized that this inefficient rate-of-return regulation couldn\u2019t turn the cheap natural gas available then into cheap electricity. Many states ultimately failed, partly because, like California, they just couldn\u2019t bring themselves to actually allow competition. But in many cases, the problem was closely linked to FERC\u2019s regulation of the wholesale market.\n\nOnly Texas, which uniquely was able to regulate the entire market on its own, fully succeeded in creating a competitive electricity market. Over the years Texas had largely freed itself from significant FERC regulation by carefully isolating its electrical grid from the rest of the country, thereby eliminating the basis for federal \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d jurisdiction. When it adopted its competitive reforms, the results were astounding. Texas now has the most competitive, successful electricity market in the U.S., if not the world.\n\nThese reforms have allowed Texas to keep up with a massive increase in demand for electricity. Since competition started in 2002, demand for electricity in Texas has increased 80 percent faster than in the rest of the country. But Texas electricity prices have actually decreased by 14 percent in real dollars and by 57 percent relative to national prices.\n\n#page#This tremendous benefit to Texas consumers has been accomplished solely at the risk of investors and generators, who were allowed to invest more than $36 billion in new generation capacity to meet this demand. In every other state, much of the risk of investing in new generation is placed on consumers \u2014 they pay for the generation whether they need it or not.\n\nThis success was possible only because Texas\u2019s wholesale electricity market is not subject to FERC oversight. But if the CPP survives the many legal challenges it will face, Texas\u2019s electricity market will not be independent for long. At a workshop conducted by the Public Utility Commission of Texas on July 15, I joined a long list of witnesses in testifying that the CPP will result in the federal takeover of the Texas electricity market \u2014 and that of every other state as well.\n\n#ad#The Supreme Court has repeatedly insisted that the federal government cannot require the states to regulate. Schemes such as\u00a0the Clean Air Act therefore give states a \u201cchoice\u201d between implementing EPA programs, through a State Implementation Plan (SIP), or letting EPA do the implementing itself, through a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP). The choice is coercive, because in a real \u201ccontractual\u201d or \u201ccooperative\u201d setting among equals, you can\u2019t be forced to choose the lesser of two evils. But the Court has looked the other way, on the theory that so long as an FIP doesn\u2019t dragoon state agencies into federal service, there is no commandeering problem.\n\nBut there is a commandeering problem with the CPP. In New York v. United States (1992), the Supreme Court struck down a law requiring states to \u201ctake title\u201d to low-level nuclear waste within their borders or dispose of it according to federal instructions. The Court ruled that states cannot be forced to choose between two schemes neither of which the federal government would be able to impose on them as a free-standing requirement. The CPP has a lot in common with the law that was struck down in New York, because whatever the state chooses to do, its agencies will be required to regulate in accordance with federal instructions.\n\nIf states decide to comply with the CPP by developing an SIP, they would have to restructure the jurisdictional relationships of their environmental and electrical regulating entities and make substantive changes to their electricity markets. Environmental regulators would become utility regulators, and vice versa. Renewable-energy and energy-efficiency mandates would have to be greatly expanded. The dispatch of electricity would be required to take into account environmental considerations \u2014 perhaps through the imposition of a carbon tax. Many of these changes would have to be made in the retail market, despite the D.C. Circuit Court\u2019s finding that Congress has specifically confined federal \u201cjurisdiction over the sale of electricity\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0to the wholesale market.\u201d The states can\u2019t be forced to do this in an SIP.\n\nIf states choose not to participate in the CPP, the EPA will implement it through an FIP. But since the federal government can\u2019t regulate the retail market, the EPA would have to require state regulators to implement the federal regulations \u2014 again stepping beyond the authority that Congress has granted to FERC. In either case, the states really have no choices at all \u2014 either by SIP or by FIP, the states are forced to implement the provisions of the CPP that neither FERC nor the EPA has the authority to demand individually.\n\nIt is quite likely that the EPA knows it has overstepped its bounds. But the EPA is taking this step because it knows that it has little hope of achieving its desired CO2-emission-reduction goals if it is forced to regulate on its own the only entities it actually has authority to regulate \u2014 the generators. So the EPA\u2019s greatest hope is that the states will voluntarily turn their utility regulators into an extension of the federal government, fearing that if they fail to comply, the EPA would turn up the heat on the industry in a recalcitrant state by making impossible demands, threatening huge fines, and essentially shutting down the permitting of existing generation. Either states comply or the feds may turn out the lights.\n\nWhile the potential of rolling blackouts is not an attractive option, the alternative is to take one more step down the road to a unified national bureaucracy. It might not be too long until state legislatures are no longer needed, except perhaps to tax their citizens to pay the state agency staff that will then regulate the economy under the direction of the federal government.\nThe Founders reserved to the states \u2014 and to the people \u2014 those powers not explicitly delegated to the federal government in order to protect the people from tyranny. While the CPP is purportedly about saving the world from the horrors of CO2 emissions, it will accomplish virtually nothing in that regard. Though the stakes are high, the states should force the EPA to show its hand in order to halt the creeping federal takeover of state governments, which continues to encroach on one of the most important protections in our Constitution \u2014 federalism, and the liberties it was meant to guarantee.\n\n\u2014 Bill Peacock is vice president for research and director of the Center for Economic Freedom at the Texas Public Policy Foundation.
