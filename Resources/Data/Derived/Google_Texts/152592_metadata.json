Traders reconsider employment rates as oil drops and HFTs kick in the every-other-day sell programs.\n\nWASHINGTON, February 11, 2015 \u2013 Since we rallied on Tuesday and since today is Wednesday, it therefore follows that the market should be tanking today. And so it is. As of 1:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is off around 90 points, with the broader-based S&P 500 down 7.65 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ off a shade under 1 point, indicating at least some strength in that sector.\n\nWe continue to suspect that the HFTs are continuing to have a field day, jacking markets to-and-fro according to the headlines as the financial media blathers along, blithely informing us that the economy is going great guns, at least in the U.S. Either the financial punditocracy as a whole is a confederacy of dunces; or, worse, they\u2019re colluding with TPTB (The Powers That Be) who feed daily lies to the public at large for personal as well as political reasons.\n\nThe fact is, the worldwide economic system remains under assault from a host of enemies foreign and domestic, and any major improvement in the situation is a long way off, if indeed it will ever happen short of a second American Revolution.\n\nTo the few that will listen, the Maven has long preached that if you proclaim a lie long enough and loudly enough, it will eventually be perceived as the truth. It\u2019s classic Marxism-Leninism, really, as deviously and cleverly modified by Antonio Gramsci.\n\nIn the far more realistic and patriotic (and therefore much-denigrated) 1950s, Communism was often depicted as \u201cThe Big Lie.\u201d This was literally true, as the virtues of Soviet-style Communism\u2014proclaimed by its fifth-column supporters in the U.S. and elsewhere\u2014were, in fact, an elaborate mirage meant to obscure Stalinism\u2019s murderous intent.\n\nThe left today is splintered into a million \u201cisms.\u201d And yet, all these socialist wannabes\u2014often if not always led by the wealthy, oddly enough\u2014instinctively maintain the elaborate fiction that\u2019s meant to conceal their criminal intent. The elaborate story they weave, via media \u201creports,\u201d films, TV, corporate reports, government proclamations and judicial edicts is what libertarians and conservatives have generally dubbed \u201cthe narrative.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cnarrative\u201d provides a seamless lie meant to cover up the crimes and misdeeds of the mega-wealthy and the so-called intellectual and artistic elites. But at this point in U.S. history at least, their happy talk narrative has become a massive, collective falsehood meant to convince the average American that he\u2019s better off than ever, even though the average American knows instinctively that he is not.\n\nHowever, since \u201ceverybody\u201d is proclaiming otherwise, the average American is afraid to voice his gut opinion for fear he\u2019ll be laughed out of the room. And that\u2019s how the Big Lie represses free speech and conceals the truth while those who instinctively know the truth are afraid to speak out.\n\nEvery once in awhile, however, the actual truth slips out. One such incident occurred on happy talk CNBC yesterday, and a hat tip goes to ZeroHedge for sussing it out.\n\nThe occasion for this rare bit of truth telling was an interview Tuesday with Mizuho\u2019s Steve Ricchiuto, who, among other things stated flatly that despite all the Fed\u2019s happy talk and the unabated bullishness of the shills who talk their book on CNBC,\n\n\u201cThere is no acceleration in [the nation\u2019s] underlying economic activity,\u201d and\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this wrong concept that I keep on hearing about in the financial press about the acceleration in economic growth\u2026 It\u2019s not happening!\u201d\n\nA stunned Simon Hobbs rebuffs, \u201cThat\u2019s a long list of non-ideal situations we find ourselves in,\u201d to which Ricchiuto snaps back \u201cand we can keep on going!\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a string of dismal data on durable goods, retail spending, and inventories, we get a good jobs number and everyone saying the economy\u2019s good \u2013 it\u2019s not good!\u201d\n\nCNBC, of course, as is the custom of all NBC outlets (and as was the custom of NBC\u2019s now-suspended news anchor, Brian Williams) typically edits out the good parts of its stories and interviews lest they interfere with the \u201cnarrative.\u201d Thus, a telling comment from one of their blow-dried and coiffed talking heads was quickly snipped out of their video, now on YouTube.\n\nNotes ZeroHedge:\n\nIt was Sara Eisen that had the quote of the brief clip\u2026 (which has unbelievably been edited out since we posted it seems at around the 1:40 mark) when faced Steve\u2019s barrage of facts about the real economy, replied:\n\n\u201cbut the key is that\u2019s not what The Fed is telling us.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the video:\n\nNot only are Ricchiuto\u2019s observations on America\u2019s mirage economic recovery courageous and dead-on. You can see exactly where Eisen\u2019s comment was snipped.\n\nRicchiuto\u2019s comments indicate that not everyone is being fooled. Ditto one of CDN\u2019s own columnists, Michael Busler who weighs in today on the utter falseness of America\u2019s unemployment picture, something we\u2019ve preached here before with little effect.\n\nRELATED: What is the real unemployment rate?\n\n\n\nBusler points to the implicit falsehood that\u2019s pitched by the current Administration as \u201cfull-time employment,\u201d a number whose meaning has changed due to the never-reported effects of Obamacare, aka the Affordable Care Act or ACA. Affordable by whom? Certainly not by employees who\u2019ve seen their hour cut back due to a spectacularly stupid provision in the ACA.\n\n\u2026 an individual is counted as employed even if she is working only a few hours per week. Because the Affordable Care Act now calls full-time employment as anyone working 30 or more hours per week, employers, especially in unskilled or low skilled jobs, have been reducing a worker\u2019s hours to under 30. So while these people are counted as employed, they are not\u2026 full-time employee[s] working the traditional 40 hours.\n\nWhen we add these under-employed workers and the discouraged workers the unemployment rate is much higher. The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates something they call the U6. This figure includes those items that are absent from the official unemployment rate. In 2007, prior to the start of the Great Recession, the U6 was 8%. In 2010 this rate peaked at 17%. Last month this rate was just over 11%, clearly indicating we continue to have an unemployment problem.\n\nThe situation is made worse when we look at another key statistic: the labor force participation rate. This measures the percent of the adult population that is working or actively seeking work. Prior to the recession, this number was about 67%. It is now under 63%, meaning almost 6 million adults who traditionally would be contributing to economic activity are no longer working or seeking work. This is perhaps the most disturbing number.\n\nIn short, as Busler notes, the current, vaunted, much-praised 5.6-ish percent unemployment rate this Administration brags about is essentially another lie. That lie was trumpeted all over the financial media yesterday, goosing Tuesday\u2019s rally. Today, reality and once-again declining oil prices kicked in and so we get a predictable 180 in the stock market.\n\nIn addition to a moribund and clearly not recovering economy and a continuing, significantly under-reported true unemployment rate, there\u2019s that small matter of housing. For years now, this sector has been touted as the engine that will re-start the U.S. economy. But, in another surprise bit of truth telling, CNBC seems to have accidentally interviewed another honest man this morning who pokes holes in the positive housing, with allusory links to the two issues we\u2019ve just examined.\n\n\u201cWhat we find is that many of America\u2019s fastest growing careers (in terms of numbers of workers) have average or below average homeownership rates,\u201d said Leonard Kiefer, deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac. \u201cAt the same time, the professions with higher homeownership rates are generally headed for average or subpar growth.\u201d\n\nMost of the job openings projected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics over the next decade are in retail sales, food preparation and cashiers. Workers in these professions have homeownership rates below the national average.\n\n\u201cOver the long run, it\u2019s not going to be supportive of a big pop in homeownership,\u201d said Kiefer.\n\nThere is the small exception of America\u2019s liberal elite, however:\n\nMeanwhile, professions with homeownership rates above the national average, like engineers, lawyers, doctors and computer and math professionals, are seeing only average job growth. Some with especially high homeownership rates, like business managers, have subpar growth rates. The glaring exception is nurses, who have both a high homeownership rate and high job growth rate.\n\nThis all may be why higher employment is not driving higher mortgage applications for home purchases. These applications fell for the fourth straight month last week, despite the average rate on the 30-year fixed still hovering below 4 percent, a historically low level.\n\nIt\u2019s important to pay attention to the truth-tellers when they actually slip through Media Message Control. They quickly and easily poke holes in the \u201cnarrative,\u201d and when this happens, people had ought to pay attention.\n\nThe markets have been propped up for years by happy talk that\u2019s endlessly trumpeted by government and media and buttressed by the entertainment industry. They\u2019re all on the take. And in order to stay there, post the disaster they\u2019ve caused, they need to keep selling the same mirage in order to keep the rest of us in line, as we\u2019re increasingly persuaded that things are getting better even when they\u2019re not.\n\nBut somehow, the truth-tellers have been sneaking in there of late. In addition to the above examples, a few governors have been attacking another key issue, the outrageous political collusion between Democrats in primarily blue states with the public employee unions who are stealing the average taxpayer blind. First Wisconsin\u2019s Republican Governor Walker and now Illinois\u2019 new Republican Governor Rauner have been courageous in pursuing the egregious collusion and corruption in their respective states.\n\nThe key, ultimately, is this: either the truth-tellers gain the upper hand, leading to genuine and lasting reforms that will benefit all Americans, not just the wealthy or well-connected few. This almost daily jousting is being reflected in today\u2019s markets. And it\u2019s all going to assure a treacherous investing climate, pretty much until the 2016 national election results are in the bag.\n\nToday\u2019s trading tips\n\nKeep your powder dry. We are adding tiny bits to positions in sector ETFs and, perhaps somewhat foolishly, to our new position in MLP ETF AMLP, primarily for the yield.\n\nThe risk here is the current resumption of dropping oil prices. Even so, however, the yield should remain relatively good even if cut, and eventually, prices will go back up again, but perhaps not until 2016.\n\nThe real strategy here and elsewhere is to slowly accumulate moribund but still promising issues, realizing they\u2019ll continue to go down for awhile. But in averaging down, the return will be greatly magnified when they finally come back.\n\nRELATED: Will they or won\u2019t they?

It will be priced this evening (we think) along with Inovalon Holdings (INOV).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bipolar stock market of 2015 continues apace.
