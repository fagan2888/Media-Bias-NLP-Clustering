Twenty million people!\u201d\n\nThe 20 million figure includes people who have received private health insurance on exchanges, those who gained Medicaid coverage under state expansions and young adults who were able to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26, the administration said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn its last comparable estimate, in September, the administration said 17.6 million uninsured people had gained coverage.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s trip was intended to reward Milwaukee, which won a nationwide competition called Healthy Communities by enrolling an estimated 38,376 people in private health insurance under the health care law. That was about 75 percent of previously uninsured residents who were eligible, a rate higher than that of any other city.\n\nThe law has been particularly successful in places like Milwaukee, where a coalition of local leaders, charities and health care companies have worked to sign up those who did not have health insurance.\n\nAverage insurance premiums in the city fell 2.1 percent for 2016 plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of what community outreach can do even in the face of a governor who is not supportive of the A.C.A.,\u201d said Drew Altman, the president and chief executive of the foundation, which focuses on health issues.\n\nWisconsin\u2019s Republican governor, Scott Walker, who has disparaged the health law, expanded the state\u2019s Medicaid program just short of the level that would allow the state to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid.\n\nMr. Walker has argued that federal funding is uncertain over the long term. \u201cIf anyone thinks the federal government, which is currently $18 trillion in debt, will not renege on its future funding promises, they are not living in reality,\u201d Laurel Patrick, the governor\u2019s press secretary, said in an email.\n\nBut no state would save more money by further expanding Medicaid than Wisconsin, according to an estimate by the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a nonprofit group.\n\n\u201cYour governor still refuses to expand Medicaid, which, by the way, actually would save money,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cHe\u2019s denying Wisconsinites their ticket to health insurance, and it\u2019s political.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Milwaukee county executive, Chris Abele, a Democrat, said in a speech on Thursday that city leaders were pleased to win the Health Communities contest, but that it was not the motivation for their efforts.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe did it because thousands of people in this county who never had health care before do now,\u201d Mr. Abele said. \u201cWe also did it because the Affordable Care Act has already saved \u2014 I wrote that in big, bold letters \u2014 saved the county over $2 million.\u201d\n\nBefore Mr. Obama\u2019s address at a middle school, he stopped at a restaurant, Engine Company 3, to speak to a handful of people who had written letters to him about the law. Among them was Brent Brown, of Mosinee, Wis., a Republican who later introduced the president to a raucous crowd of about 700 at the school.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, I have never voted for President Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cEver.\u201d\n\nMr. Brown said that the health law had saved his life after he became desperately ill.\n\n\u201cAnd to the Republicans who wish to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I plead with you to reconsider,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cSwallow your pride \u2014 as I am doing right now in front of many Democrats \u2014 and do what is right.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama said that as many as 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could no longer be charged more or denied coverage because of that prior illness, and that 140 million Americans now got free preventive care such as mammograms.\n\n\u201cSo your insurance is better than it was even if you don\u2019t know it, even if you didn\u2019t vote for me. Thanks, Obama,\u201d the president said to a roar of laughter. \u201cYou got an upgrade.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160303050005, "twitter": {"description": "The president went to Milwaukee to highlight the success of health care coverage under the act.", "title": "Obama Says Enrollment in Affordable Care Act Reaches 20 Million", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/obama-heads-to-wisconsin-to-promote-successes-of-affordable-care-act.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004247650"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "gardinerharris", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/04/us/04obamavid/04obamavid-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/obama-heads-to-wisconsin-to-promote-successes-of-affordable-care-act.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004247650", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/obama-heads-to-wisconsin-to-promote-successes-of-affordable-care-act.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Affordable Care Act Reaches a Milestone", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "March 3, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Obama  Barack,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Wisconsin,Medicaid,Walker  Scott K,Federal Aid (US)", "news_keywords": "Wisconsin,Medicaid", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Gardiner Harris", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Walker, Scott K", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By GARDINER HARRIS", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The president went to Milwaukee to highlight the success of health care coverage under the act.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/04/us/04obamavid/04obamavid-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The president went to Milwaukee to highlight the success of health care coverage under the act.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 3, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/gardiner_harris/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/section/us", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2016-03-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Federal Aid (US)", "published": "2016-03-03", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Wisconsin", "slug": "04obama", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160304144216, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/us/politics/obama-heads-to-wisconsin-to-promote-successes-of-affordable-care-act.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/04/us/04obamavid/04obamavid-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The president went to Milwaukee to highlight the success of health care coverage under the act.", "title": "Obama Says Enrollment in Affordable Care Act Reaches 20 Million"}, "pdate": 20160303, "des": "Federal Aid (US)", "articleid": 100000004247650, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Obama Says Enrollment in Affordable Care Act Reaches 20 Million", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/04/us/04obamavid/04obamavid-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "\u201cCongressional Republicans have tried and failed to repeal Obamacare about 60 times,\u201d Mr. Obama said to an audience here.\n\u201cTo be clear, I have never voted for President Obama,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYour governor still refuses to expand Medicaid, which, by the way, actually would save money,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\nMr. Obama\u2019s trip was intended to reward Milwaukee, which won a nationwide competition called Healthy Communities by enrolling an estimated 38,376 people in private health insurance under the health care law.\nVideoMILWAUKEE \u2014 President Obama said on Thursday that enrollment in health coverage under the Affordable Care Act had reached a new high, 20 million, and he called the law an overwhelming success in this city and around the nation despite Republicans\u2019 implacable opposition."}
