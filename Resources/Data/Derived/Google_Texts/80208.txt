Laurel Andrews

Laurel was born in Bethel and grew up playing in the woods in Fairbanks. She moved to Anchorage in May 2012; now she marvels at the mudflats of Alaskas largest city. She graduated cum laude from Clark University in Worcester, Mass. in 2007 with a B.A. in international relations. She loves to travel, and has lived in New Zealand and France. When shes not writing, she spends her time playing music, snapping photos and generally living it up in the frozen north.
