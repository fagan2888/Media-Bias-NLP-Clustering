LAGRANGE, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia state police say a former Auburn University tight end has died in a one-car crash in western Georgia.

Authorities say 23-year-old Philip Lutzenkirchen was ejected from a 2006 Chevrolet Tahoe when it overturned several times near LaGrange, Georgia early Sunday morning.

Investigators say 22-year-old Joseph Ian Davis was driving and was partially ejected from the vehicle. Authorities say blood was drawn from Davis to determine whether alcohol was a factor in the crash.

Troopers say 22-year-old Elizabeth Craig of Eatonton, Georgia and 20-year-old Christian Case of Dadeville, Alabama were also injured.

Lutzenkirchen of Marietta, Georgia was a graduate of Lassiter High School and is ranked first in touchdowns by a tight end in Auburn University history with 14. Lutzenkirchen played on Auburn's 2011 national championship team.
