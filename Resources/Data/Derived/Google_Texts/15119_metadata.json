But first he was looking forward to resting as long as he could.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go home and recover,\u201d Matarazzo said.\n\nHe deserved it. Matarazzo had two key completions on the game\u2019s opening drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown plunge by fullback Gunnar Sveen. Matarazzo capped a 14-play, 70-yard drive right before halftime with a 2-yard scoring toss to Anders Soderberg to make it 14-0 in a quarter in which there were only two possessions. And his 4-yard bootleg right made it 21-0 in the third quarter.\n\nMatarazzo also added an interception, helped overcome the void of star running back Jaden Franklin (sidelined with a groin injury) and kept the Savages chasing.\n\n\u201cI think it just goes with being the quarterback, you know?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had a different mind-set. I just count on the boys and they count on me.\u201d\n\nThe Sun Devils had to do a lot of counting. Assorted injuries created some makeshift lineups, including on defense, but Kent Denver generally remained in control and didn\u2019t have to overly sweat until Lamar got within 21-12 with 3:43 to play on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Draven Adame to Zach Ramsey.\n\nBut the Sun Devils were able to knock down Adame\u2019s conversion pass attempt and run out the clock.\n\n\u201cJoey did a great job,\u201d Sun Devils coach Scott Yates said. \u201c(The Savages) are a good football team; they play tough and we knew that going in.\u201d\n\nKent Denver won its fifth straight playoff game and will be at second-seeded Manitou Springs, which whipped Jefferson 49-8, next weekend. Lamar ended 7-3 and struggled early on offense, \u201cwhich has kind of been our MO this year,\u201d coach Jason Tice said.\n\nA banged-up Sveen saw spot duty, so Luke Wilson, Wyllis McKissick and Jack Ammons helped carry most of the load.\n\n\u201cIt always hurts not having Jaden,\u201d Matarazzo said of the junior who leads the Sun Devils in rushing (1,186 yards) and scoring (17 touchdowns).\n\nJack Raeder and Soderberg turned in some big receptions in traffic, and Trevon Hamlet blocked Lamar\u2019s first conversion kick attempt, which proved to be huge late.\n\nNeil H.
