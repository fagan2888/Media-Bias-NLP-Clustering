The average balance of plan participants’ 401(k)s at the end of 2014 hit a record $91,300, thanks to soaring stocks and larger contributions from workers, according to Fidelity Investments.



That’s up 2 percent year over year and a whopping 30 percent over the 2011 average of $69,100, Fidelty, the largest provider of 401(k) plans, said.

The average contribution to a 401(k) was also up 4 percent to $9,670, Fidelity said.
