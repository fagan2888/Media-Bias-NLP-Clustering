Our approach included aspects from many PCMH domains, centering on an innovative approach for coordinating patient care.Care coordination is a core component of the PCMH modeland was one of the \u201c7 Joint Principles\u201d promulgated by the primary care societies.Most of the literature on PCMH care coordination describes programs oriented around patients who are high-risk utilizers, have specific medical conditions, or are discharged from the hospital.These programs are frequently delivered from an external administrative unit separated from the primary care ambulatory practice, such as by the patient\u2019s health plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO), or an intensive ambulatory practice.Care coordination models without a tight linkage to primary care did not meet our health system\u2019s priorities of providing population-based care management that strengthens the patient\u2013primary care physician (PCP) relationship.In our PCMH model, a comprehensive care coordinator (CCC) is embedded in each practice with the flexible job role of providing additional support to any patient who needs it within the practice\u2019s panel. Some have proposed this role as part of the PCMH model, and we innovatively filled this role with nonlicensed staff instead of case managers, social workers, or counselors.These CCCs extend PCPs\u2019 reach by addressing barriers to coordinated care through short- and long-term relationships with patients. Our CCCs act more as patient navigators than health coaches, as the emerging literature differentiates the roles of nonlicensed personnel.In contrast to typical navigators, CCCs perform this function as part of the care team by reviewing the electronic medical record (EMR) system and executing care plans. Our care coordination model prioritizes higher-need patients with unmet medical or social needs, but moves away from empaneling patients solely by disease or risk of future utilization. Whereas UCLA Health has population-based capitation and risk-sharing contracts, many patients are in traditional fee-for-service plans and the CCCs support patients irrespective of insurance type.In this paper, we describe the structure of our care coordination program, including the CCC\u2019s training, typical work flow, and number and types of interventions delivered over 1 year. We hypothesized that providing care coordination through embedded, nonlicensed personnel to a broad and heterogeneous group of patients would allow our practices to deliver more complete primary care. We tested this hypothesis by examining emergency department (ED) utilization between practices with and without a CCC.We embedded 1 CCC per practice in 14 of the 28 primary care sites within UCLA Health. CCCs were not required to have specific healthcare training or licensure; instead, we sought prior experience functioning in complex organizations, acting independently to solve problems, and participating within busy teams. Many had been medical assistants, military medic or corpsman, emergency medical technicians, or community health workers.Because they did not have formal licensure and training, 2 types of support were provided to promote effective and high-quality patient care. First, the CCCs completed approximately 40 hours of initial training under a case manager and licensed social workers. The curriculum included topics on problem solving, patient engagement, post acute\u2013care planning, socio-behavioral risk assessment, physician communication, community resources, and health plan navigation. This introduction was reinforced through new CCCs shadowing a veteran for 2 weeks and then through case-based problem solving at biweekly, 2-hour CCC conferences. The second source of support for CCCs was a centralized team of more highly trained personnel that consisted of an RN program director, a nurse case manager and a licensed clinical social worker. These individuals were available telephonically to answer complex questions, provide consultation for complex case management needs, or to perform medical interventions, such as home visits, that require licensure and training. We had a ratio of approximately 1 licensed personnel to 7 CCCs.CCCs identified patients in need of coordination (patient identification), engaged in outreach to patients (patient engagement), and performed 1 or more interventions usually during a time frame of the next several days to weeks depending on the need (). While all patients within the practice\u2019s panel qualified for a CCC intervention, 3 categories of patients were identified to receive targeted efforts: patients recently in an acute care setting (ED or hospital), patients with high utilization rates or high-risk scores, and patients directly referred by the primary care provider. CCCs identified patients in these categories through regular automated reports and registries, structured huddles with the care team, or informal communication with PCPs. Each practice integrated its CCC into the PCMH team in different ways, but at minimum, the main touch point was a CCC\u2013PCP daily huddle with CCCs followed by coordination with the practice\u2019s front- and back-office staff (electronically or in-person) to define each patient\u2019s needs. CCCs reached out to patients directly, either by phone or in person, reviewed the patient\u2019s medical record, and performed an informal assessment of barriers to care. Based on this assessment, CCCs performed 1 or more interventions in the following categories: coordination of transitions, execution of care plan, monitoring and follow-up between visits, linkage to community resources, and/or patient assessment. The decision to \u201cdischarge\u201d a patient from the CCC\u2019s list was made by the PCP\u2013CCC dyad, not by centrally defined criteria. CCCs documented in an internally developed online Patient Care Coordination System (PCCS); initially, PCCS was not linked to UCLA\u2019s EMR, but subsequently, copies of PCCS documents were automatically ported over.Among the primary care practices within UCLA Health, most are traditional community-based practices with full-time clinicians; only 3 are academic with trainees. These practices include family medicine, internal medicine, internal medicine-pediatric, and geriatric physicians. The number of PCPs in these practices ranged from 3 to 11; however, to ensure co-location, 1 CCC was embedded in each practice. CCCs were introduced into the intervention sites in 2 waves: wave 1 consisted of 5 practices starting in May 2012 and wave 2 consisted of 9 practices starting in November 2012. The first wave was considered a 6-month pilot phase that helped shape the implementation process and the CCC work flow for the second wave. The control sites were the remaining 14 practices, which did not receive a CCC.We tabulated the total number of CCC \u201ctouches\u201d and unique patients touched in the PCCS documentation system from May 2012 to July 2013. A CCC touch was defined as an encounter that a) contributed to the development and/or implementation of a plan of care for a patient or family and b) was documented in PCCS. A coding system to categorize CCC touches was adapted from a systematic review of care coordination published by the Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality,literature on case management, discussions with CCCs, and an exploratory review of the PCCS database. Touches were then classified into 5 broad categories based on manual review of the first full year of PCCS records for the wave-1 practices. Five coders, in total, coded all touches with a high inter-rater reliability (\u03ba = 0.89).We evaluated the impact of the CCC intervention on ED utilization at the practice level. Although CCCs were available to all patients, we restricted the population used for the evaluation to patients for whom we had full data capture of ED visits: patients in the HMO insurance plan delegated to our medical group. ED visits were identified through encounters at our hospitals\u2019 EDs or through paid claims for visits at external facilities. A visit-based attribution rule was used to assign a patient to a PCP, so only patients with at least 1 PCP visit during either the pre- or post time periods were included.We limited our evaluation to wave-2 practices compared with the 14 control practices that did not have a CCC. The wave-1 practices were not included on account of several differences from the other practices: wave 1\u2019s mean age was statistically higher as it included our only geriatrics practice, the time period for wave 1 was different, and wave 1 was seen as a pilot. ED visit rates were calculated for the intervention and control sites based on the 12 months prior to and after the introduction of CCCs into the practices. A negative binomial multivariate regression model was used to test the effect of being in a CCC practice on ED utilization. The models controlled for baseline ED visit rate, age, gender, and risk adjustment factor score (RAF)\u2014a payment modifier used by CMS and a marker of medical complexity.
