Among those efforts are an extensive audit to remove ineligible dependents from workers\u2019 health plans and convert 14,000 contracts from more expensive family to cheaper individual coverage, renegotiations of terms and payment rates with insurers, assigning nurse case managers to civil servants with chronic conditions, and agreements with the unions that the city would not pay out $153 million in mental health benefits and would cover less of the cost of some of the most expensive prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cThe groundwork that has been accomplished in less than a year creates real momentum toward the four year $3.4 billion health cost savings goal,\u201d he testified, noting that the Municipal Labor Committee, which represents public employee unions, had consented and cooperated in the reforms. \u201cIt was our agreement that we would find savings together.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, Mr. Linn said the city would continue to restructure its coverage programs, and was already on course for a projected savings of $624 million for 2016, and predicted his office would ultimately exceed the $700 million goal. The city is even working on outreach programs to improve employees\u2019 physical fitness and nutrition, prevent diabetes and encourage them to seek care from primary physicians rather than at emergency rooms.\n\n\u201cMany thought this was smoke and mirrors,\u201d said Mr. Linn. \u201cI think we\u2019ve demonstrated they were wrong.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, insurance costs are projected to continue to climb by 5.2 percent a year. Mr. Linn, however, dismissed this growth as inherent to the healthcare industry and argued that his office had successfully prevented a potential double-digit increase.\n\n\u201cThe nature of health inflation has been tremendous,\u201d he told reporters after he was finished testifying. \u201cWe have not eliminated health inflation. What we\u2019ve done is dramatically reduced the rate of health inflation. And that I think is what any employer, anywhere, is the best they\u2019re able to do, is to try to reduce the dramatic rise in the cost of inflation.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, in a paragraph Mr. Linn included in his written testimony submitted to the Council, but did not read aloud, he noted that the Affordable Care Act\u2014popularly known as Obamacare\u2014costs the city $65 million a year, largely due to provisions that permit children to remain on their parents\u2019 insurance until age 26.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, the Affordable Care Act further changed the landscape,\u201d the testimony reads. \u201cThese new requirements provided important protections for consumers and employees but the additional cost was also borne entirely by the city.\u201d\n\nFinally, 24 percent of the city\u2019s employees still have no contract, which the labor commissioner blamed on the Bloomberg administration\u2019s \u201cmassive collective bargaining failure\u201d that left all municipal unions without any kind of agreement with the city. Mr. Linn insisted that he could not disclose the details of ongoing negotiations, despite the pressing of Julissa Ferreras, chairwoman of the Council\u2019s finance committee.\n\nHowever, he promised the process would prove \u201cfruitful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat everyone wants to do, is how do we make our healthcare system more efficient and more effective?\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Will Bredderman", "sailthru.author": "Will Bredderman", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_1230.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_1230.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Affordable Care Act, contract negotiations, DC 37, I.
