This is nothing new.\n\n\u201cJust watch the film,\u201d he said with a smirk. But three interceptions in camp, including a pick-six on Saturday, demand attention. The score didn\u2019t count because cornerback Bradley Roby was offside, but Talib made a perfect read stepping in front of Andre Caldwell. For Talib, coordinator Wade Phillips\u2019 defense plays into his strengths. \u201cIt\u2019s simple, straight to the point,\u201d Talib said. \u201cWe put a lot of pressure on the quarterback. It lets us get physical with the receivers. And we also get a chance to play with vision.\u201d\n\nLowlight: The offense failed to gain consistent traction. Safety Darian Stewart said linebacker Brandon Marshall set the tone with his energy and intensity. The offense put the ball on the ground on multiple occasions. Running back C.J. Anderson left with a nicked shoulder. It\u2019s not considered serious, but symbolized a tough day for the offense.\n\nPosition battle: Roby is a backup in name only. With the Broncos likely to spend a large chunk of time in nickel coverage, the former Ohio State star functions like a starter. He gave himself a \u201cC\u201d grade for last year\u2019s performance, and is bent on improving and holding his spot over Kayvon Webster. Roby spends extra time after practice working on his hands, and asks plenty of questions of Talib and strong safety T.J. Ward in meetings. \u201cI would be stupid not to,\u201d Roby said.\n\nQuarterback watch: Peyton Manning rolled and ran. It drew a large cheer from the crowd. Coach Gary Kubiak said offensive coordinator Rick Dennison had Manning \u201crunning around like he was a much younger man.\u201d Manning made a terrific over-the-shoulder throw to tight end Owen Daniels. Daniels figures to be a reliable target for Manning in the neighborhood of 50-to-60 catches, including several on third down.\n\nCamp facts: Training camp returns Sunday to a two-a-day session. The first practice remains open to the public. It goes from 9:30-11:30 a.m. Crowds have exceeded 5,000 daily. Gates open at 8:30 a.m., with parking by the field house on a first-come, first-serve basis. The stadium bag policy is in effect at training camp.\n\nTroy E.
