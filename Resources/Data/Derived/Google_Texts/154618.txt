<p>CONTRIBUTED IMAGE/VENTURA COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM</p>

The Ventura County Library now has an online payment system for fines, fees and donations.

Customers can login to their account with their bar code and PIN and select all or some of their fines to pay. Customers can pay any amount. To do so, go to the library’s website at www.vencolibrary.org and click on “Pay your fines & fees” under “My Account” or “Library Catalog.”

The link will take users to a secure website. The system will present a confirmation receipt of the transaction that can be printed. Visa and MasterCard credit cards are accepted.
