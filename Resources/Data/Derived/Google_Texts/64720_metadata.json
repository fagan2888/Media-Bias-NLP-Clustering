The presentation, now available for download at www.bda.bm/webinars, also gave an overview of captives and their benefits, attracting an engaged audience of mostly healthcare-related industry representatives. Featured panellists included Butch Agnew, Vice President, Dyna Management Services Ltd.; R&Q Quest Management Services\u2019 Vice President, Captives, Oceana Yates; and Anne Sousa, Senior Vice President, Casualty Healthcare, Aon Risk Solutions.\n\nNow a team of more than 10 brokers, captive managers and other insurance, regulatory, and associated representatives, led by the Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA), will attend the American Society for Healthcare Risk Management (ASHRM) event October 18\u201321. ASHRM is a membership group of the American Hospital Association (AHA), with nearly 6,000 members representing risk management, patient safety, insurance, law, finance and other related professions.\n\nThe BDA will have a Bermuda booth (#724) at the popular ASHRM exhibition, and the agency is also partnering with the Bermuda Society for Healthcare Risk Management (BSHRM) to sponsor a special lunch event for conference attendees, with cyber-risk expert Theresa Payton as keynote speaker; Payton drew a large audience to hear her talk on cyber issues at June\u2019s Bermuda Captive Conference. Dyna\u2019s Agnew, and Kimberly Morgan, of Endurance\u2014will also be guest speakers at the ASHRM conference, addressing the topic of future of healthcare risk-management.\n\n\u201cOur recent webinar highlighted the high level of international interest in the area of healthcare risk management, and provided a great launchpad for our upcoming attendance at ASHRM,\u201d says Jereme Ramsay, Business Development Manager at the BDA. \u201cBermuda is a trusted, innovative partner in the healthcare insurance space, with an active reinsurance market that\u2019s able to offer many professional liability excess of loss programmes. It makes our market a one-stop shop for those seeking solutions.\u201d\n\nHealthcare policy changes in recent years, particularly in the US under ObamaCare, have driven amalgamation of hospitals and other healthcare entities and expanded Medicaid coverage to millions more Americans. That trend has created greater demand for healthcare captives to offset the upsurge in potential risks. Bermuda has about 40 professionals writing healthcare insurance and reinsurance for a full spectrum of entities; the market can also count among its advantages a solid track record of paying claims, access to Bermuda\u2019s behemoth reinsurance market; and capacity in the jurisdiction to write up to $400m for any single risk.\n\n\u201cASHRM is an important showcase for the Bermuda healthcare market,\u201d agrees Agnew. \u201cIt\u2019s only second to RIMS as an annual insurance industry conference that brings together key risk managers, in this case, from major healthcare organisations looking for insurance solutions. Bermuda has a lot to offer and, going forward, its attraction in this sector is only going to grow.\u201d\n\nThe Island provides a diverse menu of healthcare risk solutions, catering to standalone hospitals, long-term care, fully integrated healthcare delivery systems, and countrywide, for-profit hospital chains. Access to reinsurance is another big selling point. With 15 of the top 40 reinsurers, Bermuda provides captive owners and operators with direct access to billions of dollars in open-market underwriting capacity.\n\nFollow the BDA on Twitter (@investBermuda) for ASHRM coverage.
