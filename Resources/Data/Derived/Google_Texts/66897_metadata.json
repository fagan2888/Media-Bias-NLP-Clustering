In four years with the Blue Devils, he returned 44 kickoffs for 930 yards and 65 punts for 869 yards and four touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI feel like I can help out in multiple ways,\u201d Crowder said in a conference call with reporters. \u201cFor one, I can come in and be a return man, a punt return guy, being able to help start the offense with good field position, score touchdowns. And then otherwise come in and be a good slot receiver as well. Come in, make plays and do whatever\u2019s necessary to help the team win.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Recapping the Redskins\u2019 2015 draft class, from Brandon Scherff to Austin Reiter\n\nCrowder could fill a role similar to that of Santana Moss, who is currently a free agent, returning punts and serving as a slot receiver on offense. Redskins coach Jay Gruden said he has the potential to return punts and kicks as a rookie this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been productive at it when he\u2019s had the opportunity,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s such a good receiver at Duke that they probably didn\u2019t use him as much as they would liked to have because he was such a key weapon for them on offense. But he\u2019s the type of guy that did a lot for them, and he\u2019s got the great, quick first step and he is a natural at punt returner. We\u2019ll see how he does at kick returner, but he will definitely compete.\n\nA native of Monroe, North Carolina, Crowder was a first team All-Atlantic Coast Conference selection in 2014 after catching 85 passes for 1,044 yards and six touchdowns.\n\n\u201cSpecial teams was something that I had great success with in college, and I feel like that\u2019s a way I can get on the field and be able to display my talents and abilities in the open field,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cAnd then wide receiver, I feel like I\u2019m one of the top receivers in this draft. I can go in and make an impact in the offense.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Crowder is undersized at 5 feet 9 and 175 pounds but had special teams success at Duke, returning four punts for touchdowns during his college career.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Crowder is undersized at 5 feet 9 and 175 pounds but had special teams success at Duke, returning four punts for touchdowns during his college career.", "title": "Redskins draft Jamison Crowder of Duke in the fourth round of 2015 NFL draft", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/2/redskins-draft-jamison-crowder-duke-fourth-round-2/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/02/AP127013629767.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/02/AP127013629767.jpg", "description": "Crowder is undersized at 5 feet 9 and 175 pounds but had special teams success at Duke, returning four punts for touchdowns during his college career.", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins draft Jamison Crowder of Duke in the fourth round of 2015 NFL"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jamison Crowder, Jay Gruden, Washington Redskins"}, "article_summary": "Redskins coach Jay Gruden said he has the potential to return punts and kicks as a rookie this season.\nThe Washington Redskins addressed an area of weakness with their first fourth-round pick in the 2015 draft, selecting Duke wide receiver Jamison Crowder, a prolific kick and punt returner, with the 105th overall pick.\nIn four years with the Blue Devils, he returned 44 kickoffs for 930 yards and 65 punts for 869 yards and four touchdowns.\nCrowder is undersized at 5 feet 9 and 175 pounds but has shown shiftiness and speed in the open field on special teams.\n\u201cI feel like I can help out in multiple ways,\u201d Crowder said in a conference call with reporters."}
