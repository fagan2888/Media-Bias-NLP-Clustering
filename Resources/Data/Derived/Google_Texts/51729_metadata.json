We are assured by the president that \u201cthe dangers of a serious outbreak are extraordinarily low,\u201d that our leaders are \u201ctaking this very seriously at the highest levels,\u201d and will now put forth a more \u201caggressive\u201d federal response.\n\nThat is cold comfort. The government\u2019s response to the outbreak has exposed the weakness of the modern administrative state in general, and the incompetence of the White House in particular. Consider the latest developments in the outbreak. The second nurse to contract Ebola, Amber Vinson, traveled from Cleveland to Dallas on a commercial flight Monday and checked herself into the hospital Tuesday with Ebola symptoms. She called the CDC before she boarded the flight and reported she had a temperature of 99.5\u2014yet CDC officials didn\u2019t stop her from boarding the plane.\n\nVinson was one of 76 staffers at a Dallas hospital that could have been exposed to Duncan. According to Frieden, the CDC requires anyone who may have been exposed to travel by \u201ccontrolled movement,\u201d which means not traveling on commercial airlines or public transportation. Clearly, the CDC is unable to enforce this requirement, which invites the question of how they\u2019ll be able to monitor all the people with whom the nurse might have had contact. During a telephone press briefing Wednesday, Frieden was asked about the 132 passengers that were on the flight and he said, implausibly, that the CDC is \u201ccontacting everyone who was on that flight,\u201d as if it were a matter of picking up the phone.\n\nThus continues a pattern of crippling naivet\u00e9 and ineptitude from the White House on everything from healthcare reform to foreign policy. Now we\u2019re seeing it with the Ebola outbreak. On the press call, Frieden explained that you can\u2019t get Ebola from sitting on a bus next to someone who\u2019s infected, but if you have Ebola then don\u2019t use public transportation because you might infect someone.\n\nGot that? The infected could transmit the disease on a bus, but the non-infected shouldn\u2019t fear catching the disease from sitting next to an infected person on a bus. It\u2019s either one or the other; both cannot be true. Frieden was responding to a question about whether the CDC vetted President Obama\u2019s recent video message to West African countries, assuring residents that they \u201ccannot get [Ebola] through casual contact like sitting next to someone on a bus.\u201d Frieden\u2019s gem of bureaucratese is worth quoting at length:\n\n\u201cI think there are two different parts of that equation. The first is, if you\u2019re a member of the traveling public and are healthy, should you be worried that you might have gotten it by sitting next to someone? And the answer is no.\u201d \u201cSecond, if you are sick and you may have Ebola, should you get on a bus? And the answer to that is also no. You might become ill, you might have a problem that exposes someone around you.\u201d\n\nThe Limits of Administration\n\nBefore he was president, Woodrow Wilson articulated a rapturous view of what a centralized, professional bureaucracy could achieve. Writing in 1886, his shining example of government efficiency was\u2026 the post office:\n\n\u201cAdministration is everywhere putting its hands to new undertakings. The utility, cheapness, and success of the government\u2019s postal service, for instance, point towards the early establishment of governmental control of the telegraph system. Or, even if our government is not to follow the lead of the governments of Europe in buying or building both telegraph and railroad lines, no one can doubt that in some way it must make itself master of masterful corporations.\u201d\n\nAh yes, the post office\u2014a smashing success. And why not a government monopoly of the telegraph system, too? What could be better? To be fair to Wilson, in the late 19th-century maybe the post office did seem like a paragon of competent and efficacious administration. At the time, government monopolies in certain industries were thought to be \u201cnatural\u201d\u2014hence the eventual creation during World War I of a telephone monopoly operated by AT&T but controlled by a government commission headed by the postmaster general.\n\nHistory has shown this kind of confidence in centralized bureaucracy to be hopelessly na\u00efve. Government, alas, simply isn\u2019t as capable as Wilson hoped it would be. Does that mean we should disband the CDC and let hospitals dealing with Ebola cases fend for themselves? Of course not. But it should mean, at the very least, that we start talking about how to reform, say, the Food and Drug Administration, which has prevented the development of experimental drugs to treat Ebola through the exercise of a regulatory monopoly.\n\nIt also means we should think twice before defaulting to the assumption that government agencies like the CDC or the National Institutes of Health could have prevented the outbreak if only they\u2019d had more funding, as the NIH\u2019s Dr. Francis Collins averred recently to the Huffington Post. In a piece cataloguing the billions we\u2019ve wasted over the last decade to respond to something like an Ebola outbreak, Mollie Hemingway properly labels Collins an adherent to \u201cProgressive faith in the habitually unrealized magic of increased government funding.\u201d\n\nBut whether it\u2019s funding or regulation, it\u2019s becoming clear that government \u201ceverywhere putting its hands to new undertakings\u201d isn\u2019t working out all that well. Perhaps it\u2019s time for officials at the CDC and the White House to admit that we\u2019re not entirely sure how easy it is to spread Ebola, stop blaming funding shortages, and unleash the power of private innovation to combat the virus.\n\nIn a hundred years, when Americans read about the U.S. Ebola outbreak of 2014 and antiquated government agencies like the FDA that hampered the development of a vaccine, they\u2019ll laugh at us. Today, the idea of a government telephone monopoly overseen by the postmaster general is ridiculous. Likewise, future Americans will probably scoff at us for thinking our FDA, in its current form, was somehow necessary or helpful, or for how the Department of Health and Human Services could spend almost a trillion dollars a year and yet fail to prevent or adequately respond to the Ebola outbreak.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 17 Oct 2014 07:47:20 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "When it comes to Ebola, it\u2019s becoming clear that government \u201ceverywhere putting its hands to new undertakings\u201d isn\u2019t working out all that well.", "title": "Ebola and the Failure of the Administrative State", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/14655920349_fa7c26b0c3_k.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-21T07:21:57+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/10/17/ebola-and-the-failure-of-the-administrative-state/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "When it comes to Ebola, it\u2019s becoming clear that government \u201ceverywhere putting its hands to new undertakings\u201d isn\u2019t working out all that well.", "creator": "@johnddavidson", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/14655920349_fa7c26b0c3_k.jpg"}, "title": "Ebola and the Failure of the Administrative State", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Health Care", "tag": "Administrative State,Amber Vinson,CDC,Dallas,Ebola,FDA,Francis Collins,Liberia,NIH,Thomas Eric Duncan,Tom Frieden,Woodrow Wilson", "published_time": "2014-10-17T07:47:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-21T07:21:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "When it comes to Ebola, it\u2019s becoming clear that government \u201ceverywhere putting its hands to new undertakings\u201d isn\u2019t working out all that well."}, "article_summary": "Now we\u2019re seeing it with the Ebola outbreak.\nIn a hundred years, when Americans read about the U.S. Ebola outbreak of 2014 and antiquated government agencies like the FDA that hampered the development of a vaccine, they\u2019ll laugh at us.\nThe government\u2019s response to the outbreak has exposed the weakness of the modern administrative state in general, and the incompetence of the White House in particular.\nThe second nurse to contract Ebola, Amber Vinson, traveled from Cleveland to Dallas on a commercial flight Monday and checked herself into the hospital Tuesday with Ebola symptoms.\nAnd the answer is no.\u201d \u201cSecond, if you are sick and you may have Ebola, should you get on a bus?"}
