The base seems to have finally realized that its establishment mainly serves plutocrats and not ordinary Americans.\n\nOn the one issue that animates the GOP base, illegal immigration, the base has realized that one reason undocumented immigration wasn\u2019t tackled more seriously in the last decade and a half is because the steady stream of cheap, exploitable labor from across the border serves the plutocrats and their industries.\n\nAll this and more has caused a civil war within the GOP or, to borrow a Palinism, a \u201csquirmish.\u201d Don\u2019t you love this word? I do, and it translates to me as a skirmish that makes the viewer squirm.\n\nThings aren\u2019t, obviously, pretty over on the Democratic side either. The base isn\u2019t behaving itself as per establishment expectations. As experienced and able as Hillary Clinton is, her candidacy is flailing for two reasons.\n\nOne, the candidate is giving the appearance of feeding at the very trough that she\u2019s promising to regulate and bring to heel. And two, her presidency, if it materializes, will deliver crumbs after the plutocracy has had its fill, but the base is in no mood for crumbs anymore.\n\nThe issue most animating the Democratic base is rising income inequality, and on this the base wants cake, and not crumbs meant to placate them and maintain the status quo.\n\nClinton may yet prevail, but she\u2019s obviously getting a run for her money, quite literally.\n\nProbably the eeriest thing is that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are sounding similar on some things. They certainly aren\u2019t equivalent, but are voicing similar thoughts on a rigged system, on the influence of the donor class, on politicians not acting as per the interests of ordinary Americans, and so on.\n\nMeanwhile, let me indulge in some schadenfreude. It\u2019s been satisfying, to say the least, to see some establishment politicians and their surrogates in establishment media struggle to both explain and live with the Trump and Sanders phenomena.\n\nThe biggest example here is Gov. Jeb Bush, with his $100 million Super PAC, and his roster of big-name advisers, struggling almost pitiably and fighting for third or fourth place in state primaries.\n\nOther examples are Marco Rubio and also Hillary Clinton \u2014 both backed by big donors and establishment leaders, and both being buffeted by stormy political winds.\n\nIn a strange way, we\u2019re seeing Citizens United being overturned, in effect, by voters in this election so far \u2014 yes, there is big money involved (just 158 ultrawealthy families contributed half of the early funds, $176 million) but it\u2019s yielding low returns for them.\n\nMeanwhile, there\u2019s the 2014 Princeton study saying that the U.S. is no longer an actual democracy but an oligarchy, where wealthy elites wield power and effect policy often against the will of a majority of voters.\n\nThe above was the 2016 plan, until ordinary voters decided to run the show, promising to put a billionaire or a socialist in charge.\n\nIt would all be \u201cfunny ha ha, not funny,\u201d as the eminently quotable Palin said in another context, except there are, obviously, high stakes and serious issues involved.\n\nSaritha Prabhu of Clarksville is a Tennessean columnist.
