Hecklers were on hand to greet the president when he arrived in Las Vegas on Friday to sell his immigration amnesty at a largely Hispanic high school.

The irate crowd was chanting “Worst president ever, Obama!” according to Lesley Clark, a White House correspondent for McClatchy Newspapers.

The president cared so much about their concerns he addressed the crowd the very next day.

Just kidding. He went off to play golf at the ultra-exclusive Shadow Creek.

Then he took to Twitter to tweet a “fact” about his immigration plan.

The Twitter world had a field day responding to it.
