Usually white, ostensibly male, oddly Christian lawmakers can\u2019t keep their head from other people\u2019s most private business.\n\nNow they want to police our bathrooms.\n\nI suppose if as recently as 1986 a Supreme Court majority could call homosexuality \u201ca disgrace to human nature\u201d and \u201ca crime not fit to be named\u201d (though it had to rear back to the pre-Revolutionary era to find the quotes from William Blackstone) it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that some people using one bathroom over another might be seen as a threat to western civilization, the American way of life, the family and, of course\u2013let\u2019s not forget the children\u2013every child from here to Neverland.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe probably shouldn\u2019t make too much of this, and for many years, we didn\u2019t. The recent history of this country has been one of rights gained, not lost. Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s Blackstonian dissent aside, that 1986 decision was overturned in 2003, and a decade later the court declared same-sex marriage legal. We have a black president. Aside from the usual bastions of Catholic indecency and the odd hobby store, access to contraception\u2013which the same court only legalized in 1965\u2013is not an issue. It\u2019s even free under Obamacare. Urine tests are still the rage, but that\u2019s because while we may growl about police powers at the swipe of an iphone, we limply submit to the corporate police state, two-ply in hand, especially in Florida, where Rick Scott in one stall and Pam Bondi in the other have had our \u2018hood boys and girls surrounded for six years.\n\nWhich brings us back to that other bathroom outrage. It wasn\u2019t an outrage, or a political issue, until lawmakers decided to make it one. I\u2019m not referring to President Obama\u2019s order to schools across the nation to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. I\u2019ll even concede\u2013for argument\u2019s sake\u2013that the order was overreach. But I am referring to those bills that have been foaming out of legislators\u2019 mouths in one-party states such as Florida, Texas, Oklahoma and North Carolina to make bathroom use contingent on showing your papers at the door: if your birth certificate declares you of one sex, that\u2019s the bathroom you use regardless of how you identify or where you are in your transition to another sex.\n\nIn public bathrooms, lawmakers are predators to fear most.\n\n\n\nThose laws emerged because, to use Ted Cruz\u2019s creepy phrase, \u201cmen should not be going to the bathroom with little girls.\u201d (I wonder where Ted Cruz\u2019s outrage was when the Catholic Church was revealed to have been enacting William Blackstone\u2019s quotes on little boys all these years. But anyway.) Cruz is making the obscene comparison between transgender people and pedophiles, which is really an update of the old and finally discredited comparison between gays and pedophiles, or the more idiotic assumption that gays and transgender people have anything whatsoever to do with each other.\n\nIgnorant prejudice aside, there is zero evidence that making access to bathrooms more just to all puts anyone in danger. Some 200 cities and 18 states have non-discrimination laws that protect transgender people. None has seen a spike in sex crime. None.\n\nBut there is evidence, and plenty of it, that discriminating against transgender people is deadly. As it is, 41 percent of transgender people attempt suicide at one point in their lives. The proportion rises above 50 percent when it comes to more aggressive discrimination, including denying them the right to use the bathroom of their choice.\n\nThe Cruz-like image of predators set loose on our little girls is powerful and visceral, however baseless. What parent won\u2019t respond with outrage to the first hint that an adult\u2013or anyone, for that matter\u2013could harm one\u2019s child in a bathroom? But here\u2019s what we all know at one level or another: making bathrooms justly accessible to transgender people isn\u2019t going to change the fact that public bathrooms have always posed at least a minor danger to safety\u2013not just to children, but to anyone, and not because of people whose sexuality gives you instant PTSD, but because of good old-fashioned pervs (from Larry Craig to Mark Foley to Dennis Hastert, for example: lawmakers all) who prowl the wrong places for their jollies. But that\u2019s also true of churches, schools, libraries, and of course senate cloak rooms. It\u2019s not by putting on a wig and a skirt that a predator will gain access to prey. It\u2019s by being a predator. So sex crimes will continue. But don\u2019t get excited. They won\u2019t go up. At least not by ending the crime of dehumanizing transgender people in the name of trumped-up fears.\n\nLet\u2019s also not get too googly-eyed over the kind of public bathrooms we do have in our binary tyranny. They\u2019re not exactly the sort of thing you\u2019d want highlighted on a Voyager-like interstellar Golden Record (I\u2019m not making up the name) for other civilizations to know us by. When I go into a public bathroom, whether it\u2019s at Magic Kingdom or at the Government Services Building, it\u2019s not pervs I\u2019m worried about. It\u2019s the guy next-stall and the catalog of sensory depravation I have to endure (or inflict on others) as if suddenly we were all in the same foxhole. What deviant designs these places and why can\u2019t rest-rooms be a little more like rooms and a little less like rush-hour subway cars with urinals? So if transgender people end up being the catalyst for greater privacy\u2013and, ultimately, unisex bathrooms that restore the civil in engineering for all\u2013then call me transgender.\n\nAs for that until then part: For several years cities and schools, including Palm Coast and the Flagler school system, have taken a pragmatic, enlightened approach to non-discrimination, either by making private bathrooms available or making decent arrangements on a case-by-case basis. It\u2019s not perfect. Universal acceptance is best. But we\u2019re not there yet. We were getting there\u2013until those lawmakers decided to invent a crisis where there wasn\u2019t one, mostly for political reasons. That\u2019s why Obama felt compelled to issue an order that was, until then, unnecessary.\n\nNow we have an ugly controversy where previously we had common-sense pragmatism. Now we have again demonized transgender people by comparing them to freaks and criminals where before we were at least slowly learning that a human being\u2019s sex is not as simple as \u201cboy parts\u201d or \u201cgirl parts,\u201d in the embarrassingly juvenile phrases of people who call themselves adults.\n\nThe result is smutty politics at its slimiest. The problem isn\u2019t predators in our bathrooms. It\u2019s legislators. The solution isn\u2019t new prohibitions. It\u2019s less bullying and bigotry crossdressing as law.\n\nPierre Tristam is FlaglerLive\u2019s editor.
