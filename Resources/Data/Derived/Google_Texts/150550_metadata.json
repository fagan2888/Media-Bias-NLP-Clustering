At age 5, the responsibility for that \u201cnamed person\u201d would be shifted to local governments.\n\nAccording to the institute, the state-employed named person \u201cwould be able to share information with a wide range of public authorities and may intervene without parental consent.\u201d\n\nThe organization has obtained a legal opinion from Aidan O\u2019Neill, who found that the government\u2019s \u201cnamed person\u201d program allows it to make decisions that \u201ccut across\u201d the rights of parents.\n\nO\u2019Neill believes the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires governments to respect \u201cprivate and family life,\u201d would not allow the law.\n\nAccording to the London Telegraph, the Children and Young People Bill is under fire for overstepping government rights.\n\nThe report explained: \u201cThe Conservatives unsuccessfully argued that a guardian should only become involved where there were concerns over issues of well-being or safety of a child.\u201d\n\nLiz Smith, the Scottish Conservative Party young people official, told the newspaper, \u201cThis will tip the balance of family responsibility away from parents towards the state \u2013 something which most parents find completely unacceptable.\n\nSmith said that forcing all young people \u201cto have a named person will, inevitably, dilute the resources available for our most vulnerable children.\u201d\n\nThe Catholic Church, the Church of Scotland and a number of legal organizations have opposed the idea.\n\nThe institute\u2019s plan for the legal challenge was announced just hours after Scotland\u2019s parliament adopted the law. It came only days after it was revealed that the government already was operating under some of the provisions of the law.\n\nThe institute said some 8,000 children already had been singled out for \u201ctargeted intervention\u201d by the government.\n\nA government official revealed that 7,927 children already had been given a \u201cChild\u2019s Plan\u201d by a teacher or heath department official.\n\nIn a report by the institute, Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said the figures suggest that \u201cthousands of families are having their privacy interfered with on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nWND previously reported that a sociology lecturer was warning the plan could lead to the targeting of perfectly good and careful parents.\n\nLecturer Stuart Waiton told the institute, \u201cIt will take very little to trigger an investigation into a child and from there a false picture can easily be arrived at.\u201d\n\nInnocent issues such as what a child eats or the views they express could make \u201cgood parents fair game\u201d for the \u201chealth and safety zealots, obsessed with risk management,\u201d he said.\n\nWND reported that parents in Scotland were fighting the \u201canti-parent\u201d proposal. According to the Home School Legal Defense Association, the measure is part of an initiative that calls for \u201cGetting it Right for Every Child.\u201d\n\nBut the Scottish Express reported that one expert described the idea as \u201csinister.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proposals could interfere with Article 8 of ECHR, the right to respect for private and family life, as there is scope for interference between the role of the \u2018named person\u2019 and the exercise of a parent\u2019s rights and responsibilities,\u201d said the Scottish Law Society\u2019s Morag Driscoll.\n\n\u201cIt could be interpreted as disproportionate state interference,\u201d she said.\n\nThe nation\u2019s Schoolhouse Home Education Association said the legislation \u201cis open to abuse and misinterpretation and many parents could fall foul of overzealous agents of the state or people who are just plain busybodies.\u201d\n\nCritics charge the plan also would allow children who are angry with their parents to report them to their named person, with potentially devastating consequences.\n\nThe government has defended the idea, explaining: \u201cThe protection and promotion of the well-being of Scotland\u2019s children and our aim of making our nation the best place for children to grow up are at heart of the Children and Young People Bill. Our focus is on the safety and protection of children. The named person, who is likely to be a health visitor, head or deputy head teacher and will usually already know the child, will be a first point of contact if help is needed. This is formalizing what should already happen and there is evidence it is working well in many areas. We are confident it is compliant with European law.\u201d\n\nWND reported that Will Estrada, director of federal relations for HSLDA, believes the idea is an outgrowth of the general belief held by organizations such as the United Nations that government knows best for everyone.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of why HSLDA opposes ratification of [various] U.N. treaties,\u201d Estrada said. \u201cThe argument that these treaties are mere altruistic expressions melts away when you look at what is happening in the legislatures of countries who ratify the treaties and try to live up to their treaty obligations. A \u2018named-person\u2019 for every child and national databases?
