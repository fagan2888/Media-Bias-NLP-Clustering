ADVERTISEMENT Obama will chat with Colbert about her Let Girls Learn and Reach Higher initiatives stressing the importance of adolescent girls' education, the White House announced in guidance issued Friday.

The interview with Colbert will be taped Sept. 28 and air later that evening.

Several 2016 presidential candidates have stopped by Colbert's show since he debuted as host of the long-running late-night chatfest — taking over for the retiring David Letterman — in early September.

GOP White House hopeful Jeb Bush, formerly Florida's governor, was a guest on Colbert's first show Sept. 8, while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and fellow Republican candidate Donald Trump are booked for the program next week.

Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is scheduled to appear Friday.
