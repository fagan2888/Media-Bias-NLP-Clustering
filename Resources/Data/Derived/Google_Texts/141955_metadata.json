Total A/R over the same time period from uninsured self-pay patients decreased 22 percent, mostly as a result of high financial risk patients joining Medicaid in expansion states.\n\nAdditionally, as the industry shifts to consumer-driven healthcare, many patients or their employers are moving away from health plans with lower patient responsibility for HDHPs.\n\n\u201cThese two market trends have resulted in higher overall and average patient responsibility for insured patients,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe average amount collected from insured self-pay patients increased marginally from the first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2015. Insured self-pay payments have a much greater impact on total patient collections. Insured self-pay is defined as \u201cpatient responsibility for accounts with an insurance payer source (copays and deductibles.)\u201d Uninsured is defined in the report as \u201cpatient responsibility where self-pay is the primary payer.\u201d\n\nFor every one uninsured self-pay patient payment dollar in the first quarter this year, there were approximately 22 insured self-pay patient payment dollars. Lower average payments from the insured self-pay population weigh more heavily than uninsured payments on a provider\u2019s bottom line, according to the report.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the performance of self-pay patient collections for both insured self-pay and uninsured self-pay patient types is a critical component of a provider\u2019s financial success,\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cWhile the uninsured self-pay patient population appears to be performing better from an A/R perspective, the expanding insured self-pay patient volume and A/R highlights the need for providers to focus on this area of growing financial risk.\u201d\n\nBased on the findings, Crowe Horwath recommends that providers create strategies for improving financial performance in collecting from patients with more financial responsibility.\n\nStaff who is responsible for financial discussions with patients should be well-versed on HDHP plans and determining which payments have the ability to pay, according to the report.\n\nThis can be accomplished through creating unique HDHP codes to separate patients who have traditional lower copays and deductibles and high deductibles than can be more than $5,000 for one adult.\n\nThe firm\u2019s analysis shows than only 16 percent of providers have unique HDHP codes and most of the providers with the codes in place are not effectively registering patients with the information, according to the report.\n\nRecommendations for healthcare providers firm include tracking self-pay patient collections, as the performance varies for uninsured and insured patient sources, according to the report.\n\nProviders can implement strategies specifically designed for the insured self-pay patient type and should use a more focused approach.\n\nThey should also, \u201cestablish and enforce policies that improve collections based on pre-service deposits for elective procedures and by providing payment options for patients who are unable to pay initial balances in full,\u201d according to the report.\n\nStates that have adopted multiple portions of the Affordable Care Act continue to experience more improvement in their uninsured rates, according to new data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index released in August.\n\nAcross the U.S., the uninsured rate declined from 17.3 percent in 2013 to 11.7 percent in the first six months of this year, according to Gallup.\n\nAnother group of consumers, the underinsured, are likely to have high deductible health plans and out-of-pocket costs.\n\nThirty-one million people, or 23 percent, with health coverage in the U.S. were underinsured in 2014, according to a report released by The Commonwealth Fund in May. The share of working-age adults who had health insurance all year but were underinsured was statistically unchanged since 2010, after nearly doubling from 12 percent to 22 percent between 2003 and 2010. People are considered underinsured if they have had health insurance for a full year but have high deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses relative to their income, according to The Commonwealth Fund.\n\n\u201cThe replacement of traditional health plans with HDHPs is creating more patients who are not only newly insured, but who bear significant financial responsibility via copays and high deductibles,\u201d said Cory Herendeen, a principal in Crowe Performance Consulting in the news release. \u201cThis has created more financial risk from the insured self-pay population.\n\nFollow ACA on Twitter @ACAIntl or Facebook for news and event updates.
