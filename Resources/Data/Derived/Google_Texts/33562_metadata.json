Pundits and politicians have been casting blame or defending the program, but what do citizens think of the Obamacare rollout? Not surprisingly, a Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll found that most respondents are unimpressed with the glitch-prone healthcare.gov, even though few have even tried to sign up. (Information on respondents is available here. More information about SurveyMonkey Audience is here.)\n\nConsidering the avalanche of negative news following the website\u2019s botched launch, the fact that even 13 percent of respondents considered the launch a success is a surprise. With Obama on an apology tour and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius getting lambasted everywhere from Capitol Hill to The Daily Show, 13 percent ain\u2019t bad. The plurality, at 38 percent, thought that the launch was extremely unsuccessful, while 60 percent overall deemed the launch unsuccessful. More than a quarter of the respondents hadn\u2019t made up their minds on the site\u2019s success yet, possibly waiting to see whether the technical issues are resolved before giving up on it.\n\nThe impression of a failed launch is evident in the rate that people are accessing the website. Barely 10 percent of the survey\u2019s respondents had tried to access the website, and only 22 percent knew someone who had attempted to log on. While most of the survey respondents, like most of the U.S. population, don\u2019t need a new insurance plan, these numbers are still remarkably low.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe numbers also offered another grim verdict for healthcare.gov. Of the 46 survey respondents who had tried to buy insurance through the website, only three people successfully purchased insurance. That makes up less than 1 percent of the total sample size.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll gauges the depths of despair over healthcare.gov.", "fb-share": "Poll: Wait, 13 Percent Think Healthcare.gov Is a Success?", "sailthru.author": "Nicholas Duchesne", "description": "Since the launch of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online health insurance marketplace in October, news coverage of technical glitches, coding problems, and ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Since the launch of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online health insurance marketplace in October, news coverage of technical glitches, coding problems, and ...", "title": "Poll: Wait, 13 Percent Think Healthcare.gov Is a Success?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/slate_surveymonkey_healthcare_gov_poll_what_do_americans_think_of_the_obamacare.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/131113_POL_Sebelius.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since the launch of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online health insurance marketplace in October, news coverage of technical glitches, coding problems, and ...", "title": "Poll: Wait, 13 Percent Think Healthcare.gov Is a Success?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/slate_surveymonkey_healthcare_gov_poll_what_do_americans_think_of_the_obamacare.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/131113_POL_Sebelius.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-13T16:58:22Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Poll: Wait, 13 Percent Think Healthcare.gov Is a Success?", "sailthru.headline": "A Glitch in the Matrix", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Poll: Wait, 13 Percent Think Healthcare.gov Is a Success?\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/slate_surveymonkey_healthcare_gov_poll_what_do_americans_think_of_the_obamacare.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/131113_POL_Sebelius.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100131113010\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-13T16:58:22Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Nicholas Duchesne\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"obamacare\",\n    \"polls\",\n    \"healthcare.gov\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Poll: Wait, 13 Percent Think Healthcare.gov Is a Success?", "keywords": "healthcare.gov poll, Obamacare poll, healthcare.gov rollout, Obamacare implementation, aca implementation, affordable care act, health care, health care reform, survey monkey, healthcare.gov survey, slate polls", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare.gov poll, Obamacare poll, healthcare.gov rollout, Obamacare implementation, aca implementation, affordable care act, health care, health care reform, survey monkey, healthcare.gov survey, slate polls", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "Since the launch of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online health insurance marketplace in October, news coverage of technical glitches, coding problems, and ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/11/131113_POL_Sebelius.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd3d\"", "article_summary": "The plurality, at 38 percent, thought that the launch was extremely unsuccessful, while 60 percent overall deemed the launch unsuccessful.\nPundits and politicians have been casting blame or defending the program, but what do citizens think of the Obamacare rollout?\nOf the 46 survey respondents who had tried to buy insurance through the website, only three people successfully purchased insurance.\nNot surprisingly, a Slate/SurveyMonkey snap poll found that most respondents are unimpressed with the glitch-prone healthcare.gov, even though few have even tried to sign up.\nWhile most of the survey respondents, like most of the U.S. population, don\u2019t need a new insurance plan, these numbers are still remarkably low."}
