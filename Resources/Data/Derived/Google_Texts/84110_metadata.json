REUTERS\n\nAny day now, the U.S. Supreme Court will issue its third ruling on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe previous two were easy reduce to a sentence: Can the government make people buy health insurance? (Yes, sort of.) Can the government make company owners pay for employee insurance coverage of contraceptives, even if the owners\u2019 religion forbids the use of contraceptives? (No.)\n\nThe latest case defies simple reduction. But let\u2019s start with why this case maters: The outcome will determine whether low-income residents are entitled to subsidized health insurance in more than two thirds of the states.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t they be? Well, the law says the subsidies are available to low-income Americans for insurance purchased on marketplaces \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d But most of the states never set up their own insurance marketplaces, in a show of defiance. Their residents have made do with a marketplace established by the federal government.\n\nFederal agencies often draft regulations to flesh it out major pieces of legislation, for better or for worse (but that\u2019s a debate for another day). The IRS drafted a regulation that extended the subsidies for insurance bought in the federal marketplace.\n\nSo, the real question facing the Supreme Court is whether the IRS was within its rights to do so.\n\nWhat could happen if the justices rule that the text of the law precludes subsidies in states without their own marketplaces?\n\nSubsidies in states that rely on the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, would disappear, unless or until the states established their own marketplaces.\n\nIn all, more than six million people already have received tax credits for 2015 through the federal exchange. A group of Republicans is considering a short-term extension of financial assistance, in the event the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidies.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many of those who currently receive subsidies would continue to pay for insurance without the tax credits, but if a significant number fled, experts say, the price of insurance could increase, driving even more Americans out of the program.\n\nMany would face no penalty for failing to purchase health insurance; the so-called individual mandate applies only if affordable insurance relative to income is available.\n\nMany legal experts believe that eschewing subsidies in states that depend on HealthCare.gov would also weaken the so-called employer mandate, which requires businesses with 50 or more employees to provide them with health insurance or face a monthly penalty.\n\nHere\u2019s why: The penalty is triggered only when an employee gets a tax credit for health insurance acquired on one of the exchanges. If the subsidies disappeared, so too would the penalty trigger, the thinking goes.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The latest Supreme Court review of the Affordable Care Act defies easy explanation.
