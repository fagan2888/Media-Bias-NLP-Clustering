Even then, states overwhelmingly made their decisions as if the subsidies weren\u2019t at stake.\n\nAs if to underscore the point, no less an Obamacare foe than Justice Samuel Alito envisioned states rushing to set up their own exchanges if the Court eliminates their citizens\u2019 subsidies. \u201cSo going forward,\" he said, \"there would be no harm.\" Unlike the Journal editors, Alito\u2019s aim wasn\u2019t to refute Kennedy. He was trying to allay concerns that a ruling for the challengers would create chaos. He\u2019s right that if states set up exchanges, it would mitigate the disruption. But in making that strategic suggestion, he illustrated the very coercive arrangement the Journal is now trying to deny.\n\nThe law\u2019s opponents are thus arguing amongst themselves. Deep in the challengers\u2019 own brief to the Court is another perfect demonstration of Kennedy\u2019s point about coercion. In their own telling, the threat to states would have worked if the IRS had made good on it:\n\n[T]here is no reason to believe that the\u2026incentive would not have worked if the IRS had not eliminated that incentive through bureaucratic fiat. Because the IRS Rule promised states the quid of subsidies without demanding the quo of state-run Exchanges, 34 states predictably declined to assume the difficult responsibility of establishing Exchanges. So, to the extent that enforcing the Act\u2019s plain text now would temporarily deprive people of subsidies, that result is caused by the IRS\u2019s departure from the law\u2014it cannot be used to justify the departure. And, indeed, if the original \u201cdeal\u201d is restored by this Court, states may well establish Exchanges going forward.\n\nWith the threat removed, 34 states shrugged off responsibility for their own exchanges. If it hadn\u2019t been removed, many of those states would have felt it acutely and done what they weren\u2019t otherwise inclined to do.\n\nHad Kennedy been the first and only person to sense coercion here, the Journal would have an easier time trying to convince him that he'd made an error. Instead, their position requires him and us to ignore arguments the challengers spelled out in their own briefs\u2014the people on whose behalf the Wall Street Journal is now publishing dishonest editorials, and the conservative lawyers who set about to cripple the law under the coercion theory four years ago. To an unappreciated extent, they\u2019re now relying on the conservative media to clean up their mess.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "It\u2019s almost impossible to keep track of all the contradictions in King vs. Burwell\u2014the case that threatens Affordable Care Act subsidies in 34 states\u2014but the latest is probably the most important.We learned in Supreme Court oral arguments last week that King is likely to turn on the question of whether the challengers\u2019 interpretation of the law is unconstitutionally coercive.&nbsp;Can the federal&...", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Taking up arms against their own allies.", "title": "The Wall Street Journal's Dishonest Crusade to Gut Obamacare Has One Huge Flaw", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/7862d65e4f9bbd41671df7709059dd2cd4d9831b.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/121274/king-burwell-wall-street-journal-disputes-obamacare-coercion-evidence", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taking up arms against their own allies.", "title": "The Wall Street Journal's Dishonest Crusade to Gut Obamacare Has One Huge Flaw", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/7862d65e4f9bbd41671df7709059dd2cd4d9831b.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/7862d65e4f9bbd41671df7709059dd2cd4d9831b.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Wall Street Journal's Dishonest Crusade to Gut Obamacare Has One Huge Flaw\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/121274/king-burwell-wall-street-journal-disputes-obamacare-coercion-evidence\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-11T18:39:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":121274,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Obamacare\",\"Barack Obama\",\"King v.
