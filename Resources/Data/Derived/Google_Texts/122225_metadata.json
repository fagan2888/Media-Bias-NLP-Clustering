Dr. Mody says that the group is well on its way to achieving a two year, $250,000 fund raising plan for Children\u2019s Day. Held on November 20th every year, Dr. Mody says that $100 bronze level sponsorships for Children\u2019s Day are available, as well as higher level support opportunities. Money raised for Children\u2019s Day goes to help Family Resource and Youth Services Centers at local schools as well as Feeding America\u2019s Back-Pack program.\n\nWith the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Dr. Mody said that the focus of Community Medical Care has shifted somewhat from working adults to senior citizens.\n\n\n\nDr. Mody says the program also helps seniors with hearing aids and dentures. He also added that with the future of healthcare still being discussed on both a state and federal level, the focus of Community Medical Care may have to go turn back toward care of working adults.\n\nThe Glasgow City Council also approved accepting Montgomery Court as a city street. Betty Herbert and Summer Harper were both appointed to the Plaza Advisory Board.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "WCLU", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://wcluradio.com/glasgow-city-council-dr-mody-encourages-support-for-local-program-dickinson-talks-about-new-epb-rate-structure/", "article_author_name": "Angela Briggs", "image": "http://wcluradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/041216DR-MODY.png", "site_id": "ec665d3a408b584e2d0a51dce8fc7b54", "article_published_time": "2016-04-12T13:06:53+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T21:28:34+00:00", "keywords": "featured, local news, news, top stories", "wp_version": "7.8.0.0"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe271a\"", "article_summary": "Money raised for Children\u2019s Day goes to help Family Resource and Youth Services Centers at local schools as well as Feeding America\u2019s Back-Pack program.\nDr. Mody says that the group is well on its way to achieving a two year, $250,000 fund raising plan for Children\u2019s Day.\nDr. Mody says the program also helps seniors with hearing aids and dentures.\nHeld on November 20th every year, Dr. Mody says that $100 bronze level sponsorships for Children\u2019s Day are available, as well as higher level support opportunities.\nWith the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Dr. Mody said that the focus of Community Medical Care has shifted somewhat from working adults to senior citizens."}
