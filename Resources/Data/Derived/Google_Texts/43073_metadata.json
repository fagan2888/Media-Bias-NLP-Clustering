Workers have been repairing it for about two weeks and he can feel the steps vibrate when he climbs, Asare said.\n\n\"If it drops, this is not going to do anything,\" he said, pointing to a wooden beam.\n\nAnother staircase collapsed about a year ago, said Larry Kamer, a spokesman for the building owners. Nobody was hurt in that accident.\n\nKamer said work was underway to reinforce all the staircases in the apartment complex, and the steps that collapsed Friday had been high on the repair list.\n\nAll staircases were inspected Friday evening and those needing repair will be temporarily shored up until permanent fixes can be made, Kamer said.\n\nHe also said residents concerned about safety will be housed in hotels or guest quarters until repairs are made.\n\nThe accident follows the June 16 collapse of a balcony at an apartment building in Berkeley that killed six people and injured seven. City officials said water damage had rotted the balcony's wooden support beams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A falling staircase that killed a tenant at a Northern California apartment building was due to be repaired after another set of steps collapsed a year ago, the Sacramento Bee reported.", "title": "Apartment Building With Staircase Death Had Earlier Collapse", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Bay Area", "description": "A falling staircase that killed a tenant at a Northern California apartment building was due to be repaired after another set of steps collapsed a year ago, the Sacramento Bee reported.", "title": "Apartment Building With Staircase Death Had Earlier Collapse", "url": "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/Apartment-Staircase-has-Fatal-Collapse--311685441.html", "image": "http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*734/stairwell.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A falling staircase that killed a tenant at a Northern California apartment building was due to be repaired after another set of steps collapsed a year ago, the Sacramento Bee reported.", "title": "Apartment Building With Staircase Death Had Earlier Collapse", "url": "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/Apartment-Staircase-has-Fatal-Collapse--311685441.html", "image": "http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*734/stairwell.JPG?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcbayarea", "site": "@nbcbayarea", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 75829892837}, "keywords": "folsom apartment collapse, folsom apartment, folsom stairwell collapse", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCBayArea"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "folsom apartment collapse, folsom apartment, folsom stairwell collapse"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb40a\"", "article_summary": "The accident follows the June 16 collapse of a balcony at an apartment building in Berkeley that killed six people and injured seven.\nAnother staircase collapsed about a year ago, said Larry Kamer, a spokesman for the building owners.\nA falling staircase that killed a tenant at a Northern California apartment building was due to be repaired after another set of steps collapsed a year agoA falling staircase that killed a 26-year-old tenant at a Northern California apartment building was due to be repaired after another set of steps collapsed a year ago, the Sacramento Bee reported.\nShun Xiang Yuan of San Francisco was killed Friday afternoon when the outdoor steps connecting second- and third-story landings collapsed.\nThirumurthy, who lives with his family on the first floor of the building, said he feels unsafe."}
