It has also doubled in size in just a few years, capping off a long growth period by acquiring U.K.-based Logica PLC in a $2.7-billion acquisition that transformed CGI into a global giant with 68,000 employees.\n\nAnd then came Obamacare.\n\nCGI was the main contractor behind the website at the heart of U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s health-care reform. On Oct. 1, an online platform launched that allowed Americans to pick and choose health insurance \u2013 and it was immediately assailed for being ridden with glitches, kicking people offline, displaying faulty data and confusing spouses with kids and various applicants\u2019 ages.\n\nThe disaster was magnified by the fact that the well-oiled Republican political machine \u2013 which wanted to kill the law at all costs \u2013 seized on the struggling website to attack President Obama, while powerful Democrats defended the law by expressing disapproval of the technical contractors.\n\n\u201cClearly, I think there was a perfect storm there,\u201d said Michael Roach, CGI\u2019s president and chief executive, in an interview. \u201cWe kind of got caught up in it.\u201d\n\nCGI ducked, dodged and defended itself through sensational accusations in congressional hearings \u2013 attracting scorn from angry U.S. lawmakers for refusing to apologize \u2013 and suffered a heavy barrage of negative media attention.\n\nBut when the company emerged from the fracas, Mr. Roach bragged on a conference call that the firm\u2019s pipeline of new contracts was as strong as ever. Asked again whether there was anything to feel bad about, Mr. Roach refused to apologize.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s takeaways here that we will examine at the appropriate time,\u201d Mr. Roach said, declining to answer whether anyone was fired for the problems. \u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done, we\u2019ll be known as the company [that] was involved in the largest, transformational social program undertaken in the U.S. in the last 50 years.\u201d\n\nIn some ways, CGI\u2019s ability to win contracts throughout the company\u2019s biggest public relations disaster is a testament to its successful strategy. Unlike more well-known tech players like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., CGI does not sell technology to consumers; it sells a mix of back-end technology, IT and business services to huge clients such as Bombardier Inc., the Government of Canada, Pfizer Inc., Vodafone Group PLC, TD Bank Financial Group, Carrefour SA and the U.S. Department of Defence.\n\nThe lifespan of these contracts, Mr. Roach said, stretches anywhere from six to 15 years, so the business is more about maintaining relationships than taking big risks. Throughout the Obamacare row, analysts cautioned investors to avoid the hype, maintaining that CGI was well run and that the healthcare.gov fiasco was not indicative of broader problems. Over the past five years, CGI shares have risen on the Toronto Stock Exchange from around $10.50 to almost $40, before falling back to around $35, as the company won and completed contracts similar to the U.S. health-care reform deal. Revenue in 2013 was $2.5-billion, up more than 50 per cent.\n\nOf course, as the healthcare.gov fiasco revealed, large-scale government health procurement contracts might be good for the bottom lines of contractors who win them, but they are often disasters waiting to happen for policy makers and tax payers. A combustible combination of entrenched bureaucracies \u2013 with little-to-no technical expertise themselves \u2013 demanding complicated platforms that will handle vast amounts of sensitive data.\n\nNick Ragaz, who worked at the health-care consultancy Courtyard Group that got tied up in Ontario\u2019s eHealth scandal, said the nature of these contracts results in expensive, outdated technology that ends up with more bugs and possible points of failure than a similar project handled purely by the private sector. \u201cThe things that we think about when we think about how technology is changing our world \u2013 or magical or revolutionary or whatever word Apple wants to use \u2013 they\u2019re developed in a completely different way,\u201d said Mr. Ragaz, who started a health-care technology company that only works directly with physicians, to avoid working with vast bureaucracies.\n\nMr. Ragaz, alluding to some of the government\u2019s last minute changes to the Obamacare website, said it is most likely that blame for the website\u2019s original failure should be shared among the various actors. \u201cAt the same time,\u201d he said, \u201cI think that as a vendor you have a responsibility, too. You can\u2019t just dodge that responsibility by saying your masters are unfair.\u201d\n\nCGI\u2019s Mr. Roach, for his part, doesn\u2019t seem perturbed. His company has grown from a market capitalization of around $3.4-billion to roughly $11.4-billion, and he said he is proud that CGI has created 11,000 jobs across Canada. He stresses that many of these jobs are well outside major urban centres in Atlantic Canada, as well as in Quebec, which allows the company to offer 24-hour assistance to French clients.\n\nContrasting the Ontario government\u2019s recent $190-million subsidy to help Cisco Systems Inc. invest and create jobs in the province with what\u2019s happening in India, Mr. Roach said Canadian governments should favour long-term industrial policy that would help create more companies like CGI.\n\n\u201cI think one needs to develop a strategy around technology that spans over time and encourages more Canadian companies not to stop their growth at the border,\u201d he said. \u201cIn India, they have made a long term, strategic decision ... They have linked their education to this. They have linked their export to this. And they\u2019ve linked their tax system to this \u2026 We can compete globally.\u201d\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "Chief executive Michael Roach is proud of growing IT services firm, despite Obamacare website scandal", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Chief executive Michael Roach is proud of growing IT services firm, despite Obamacare website scandal", "title": "CGI remains Canada\u2019s hidden tech darling", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/cgi-remains-canadas-hidden-tech-darling/article16247578/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/d63/report-on-business/article16247577.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/cgi-roach08rb2.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chief executive Michael Roach is proud of growing IT services firm, despite Obamacare website scandal", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/16247578", "iphone": "tgam://article/16247578"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2014-01-09 06:30:37 EST", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Michael Roach;Barack Obama;BlackBerry Ltd.;CGI;contracts;health-care;tech darling;hidden tech darling;health procurement contracts;health-care technology company;government health procurement;consumer technology industry;government contract;public contract;Health Care;Technology;CGI group;", "article": {"engagement": "true", "type": "news", "id": 16247578, "comments": "false", "pages": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "article_summary": "CGI Group Inc. doesn\u2019t seem to like \u2013 or need \u2013 the spotlight.\nYou can\u2019t just dodge that responsibility by saying your masters are unfair.\u201dCGI\u2019s Mr. Roach, for his part, doesn\u2019t seem perturbed.\nThe lifespan of these contracts, Mr. Roach said, stretches anywhere from six to 15 years, so the business is more about maintaining relationships than taking big risks.\nAsked again whether there was anything to feel bad about, Mr. Roach refused to apologize.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s takeaways here that we will examine at the appropriate time,\u201d Mr. Roach said, declining to answer whether anyone was fired for the problems."}
