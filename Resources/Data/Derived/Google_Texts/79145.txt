Jimmy Fallon’s lip-sync battle trend is catching on, but the innovative host debuted a new spin-off: Nip-syncing. Instead of a battle, it’s a duet, where two men flex their pectoral muscles in unison. (It was likely inspired by “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” actor Terry Crews’ body).

If you see well-oiled, shirtless men singing the Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder hit “Ebony and Ivory” this summer, you know whom to thank.
