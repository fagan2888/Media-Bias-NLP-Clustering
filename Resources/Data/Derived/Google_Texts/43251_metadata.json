He knows how it feels to be hopeless, enough to use an extension cord as a noose in a bid to end it all.\n\nIf that cord hadn\u2019t broken Oct. 23, 2003, he wouldn\u2019t be here to explain how he fixed his broken life: By deciding to pursue the Ironman triathlon \u2014 a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and marathon run (26.2 miles) \u2014 after reading a story about Boulder Ironman Dave Scott in Outside magazine while he was on suicide watch.\n\nNiemeyer began training in jail while awaiting a prison sentence for felony drug offenses, starting with three sets of six push-ups and three sets of eight sit-ups, his body a \u201ctoxic organism\u201d that weighed 220 pounds.\n\nFor a man who saw himself as a \u201cparasite\u201d and believed he was \u201cirredeemable,\u201d tri- athlon would help him earn self-esteem he lacked when he tried to \u201cstop the noise\u201d in his head and kill himself.\n\n\u201cRight before I jumped with that noose around my neck, I really did think there were no redemptive qualities in my life,\u201d said Niemeyer, who will compete in his 15th Ironman on Sunday in Boulder. \u201cI distinctly remember feeling I had fallen too far, that things had gone to a point where it was hopeless, and hopelessness is, I think, the worst place a human being can find himself. Loneliness and hopelessness, and that\u2019s where I was.\u201d\n\nA resident of Boulder since 2007, Niemeyer has been married two years to \u201can All-American golden girl\u201d who is a professional triathlete and speech pathologist, and who sometimes does modeling gigs. He has published an autobiography, \u201cThe Hurt Artist: My Journey from Suicidal Junkie to Ironman,\u201d which came out in May.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always wanted to reach out to people, because his biggest problem was his self-esteem,\u201d said his wife, Mandy McLane. \u201cBecause his self-esteem was so low, that was what was making it really hard for him to wrap his head around what we would call normal stress. He\u2019s really been able to relate to individuals going through troubled times. He knows it\u2019s possible to get out of it, but they need help. And help is giving them hope, to see there is light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t know that before he tried to kill himself while in jail. Having had a troubled childhood, he turned to alcohol and drugs. He survived four overdoses and went through five rehabilitation efforts without success while compiling a lengthy rap sheet.\n\nBut when he was emerging from heroin withdrawal after the failed suicide attempt, he saw the story about Scott and was intrigued by the notion of becoming an Ironman. Seemingly a superhuman event, it would not only give him self-esteem, it would fill his free time after he got out of prison. Better to be obsessed with working out than strung out on drugs.\n\n\u201cEmerson says a man is what he thinks about, all day long,\u201d said Niemeyer, 38. \u201cAll I had thought about from the time I woke up until the time I went to bed (was) how I was going to get high, how I was going to get money to make it work. I couldn\u2019t just remove that. I\u2019m sitting in a cell thinking, \u2018What am I doing to do with my life?\u2019 That article seemed like, \u2018Well, that\u2019s something, right?\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe first simple workout in jail of a few push-ups and sit-ups gave him a sense of achievement, a spark of confidence. He saw \u201cshoots of hope\u201d and kept at it. He served 14 months in prison and walked out at age 29 with clothes that didn\u2019t fit and $212. His defense attorney let him sleep on his couch in Boise. He got jobs washing dishes. He bought a bike and trained to be a triathlete.\n\nSix months after he got out of prison, he did a half Ironman in Sunriver, Ore., finishing in 5 hours, 8 minutes. Two months after that he did his first Ironman in Santa Rosa, Calif., finishing in 11 hours, 14 minutes.\n\nIn May 2013, at the Ironman Texas near Houston, Niemeyer finished 19th among more than 1,500 men with a time of 9:14 on a day when the temperature soared into the 90s and humidity put the heat index near 100. Seventeen percent of the field didn\u2019t finish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m living this life I envisioned in prison,\u201d Niemeyer said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fathom what my life was once, devoid of any kind of meaning, and now \u2014 the woman I\u2019m married to, the people I\u2019m surrounded by \u2014 I wonder: How does that work?\u201d\n\nHe wonders why he survived his suicide attempt by pure accident when that cord broke. He believes a higher power intervened. Sometimes he thinks about men he knew when he was a drug addict who died.\n\n\u201cI was the craziest of them all,\u201d Niemeyer said. \u201cWhy did I not? Life is great. It\u2019s much better than I ever envisioned. There are times I have to pinch myself. It\u2019s hard to imagine, how did I live the way I did? It\u2019s a very interesting dichotomy. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Inmate to Ironman: Shane Niemeyer\u2019s story of redemption", "title": "Inmate to Ironman: Shane Niemeyer\u2019s story of redemption", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/02/inmate-to-ironman-shane-niemeyers-story-of-redemption/", "image": {"width": 505, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140802__20140803_C1_SP03IRONMAN2p2.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140802__20140803_C1_SP03IRONMAN2p2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-02T23:29:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T12:09:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb57\"", "article_summary": "Now the Boulder triathlete uses the story of his metamorphosis from junkie to Ironman to give others hope of redemption.\n\u201cI\u2019m living this life I envisioned in prison,\u201d Niemeyer said.\nHe has published an autobiography, \u201cThe Hurt Artist: My Journey from Suicidal Junkie to Ironman,\u201d which came out in May.\n\u201cHe\u2019s always wanted to reach out to people, because his biggest problem was his self-esteem,\u201d said his wife, Mandy McLane.\nSix months after he got out of prison, he did a half Ironman in Sunriver, Ore., finishing in 5 hours, 8 minutes."}
