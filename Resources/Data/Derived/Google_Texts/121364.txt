One of the country’s iconic families accepted the “ice bucket challenge” this weekend — and nominated President Obama himself to be doused with ice water to raise awareness of ALS.

If you’ve been on social media over the past week, you’ve probably see friends filling buckets with ice water and dumping over their heads to raise awareness and collect donations for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a neurodegenerative condition also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.

The Kennedy family lined up with buckets over the weekend and soaked themselves one after the other, ending with Ethel Kennedy, the widow of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, Boston.com reported. Prior to dumping the water, Mrs. Kennedy called out President Obama to accept the challenge.

“Welcome to Cape Cod, Mr. President. I nominate you,” Mrs. Kennedy said to the president, who is currently vacationing in Martha’s Vineyard.

Rep. Joe Kennedy, Massachusetts Democrat, tweeted the story, saying: “My grandma is a tough lady to say no to, Mr. President.”

No word yet on if Mr. Obama will participate in the ice bucket challenge. A series of big names from sports stars to team mascots to television personalities have all gotten wet for the cause.

The goal of the viral videos is to raise awareness of the disease and generate donations from people who choose to give money instead of getting drenched. The disease effects nerves in the spinal cord and brain, eventually leading to paralysis and death, according to the ALS Association.
