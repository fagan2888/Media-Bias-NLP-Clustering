â€” Cumberland County authorities on Thursday asked for the public's help to locate a 20-year-old woman and 23-year-old man wanted in the death of a 73-year-old Fayetteville man.

Clemasee Guyton was reported missing by his family on April 21, and authorities found his body Tuesday in a wooded area along Lillington Highway in Spring Lake.

Officials have charged Tracy Channel Williams, of 309 Laketree Blvd., and Joseph Franklin Lamont Davis, of 151 Cimarron Drive, with first-degree murder and conspiracy.

Samuel Lorenzo Davis, 20, of the 1300 block of Kingstown Court in Spring Lake, was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder, common law robbery and felony conspiracy in Guyton's death.

Authorities haven't said how Guyton was killed or what led to the discovery of his body.

Anyone with information about Williams' or Davis' whereabouts should call the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office at 910-323-1500.
