But this time, as the newest representative from the 59th District of the West Virginia House of Delegates.\n\nThis spring, college freshman Saira Blair will skip class for the state capital to be sworn in as the youngest state representative in the nation.\n\nWhile still a senior at Hedgesville High School in Martinsville, Blair launched a primary challenge against Larry Kump of Berkeley, her district\u2019s two-term Republican incumbent, defeating him just before graduation.\n\nKump had succeeded Craig Blair, Saira\u2019s father, when he moved up to the state Senate.\n\nAs an 18-year-old freshman, Blair ran her general election campaign from her college dorm at West Virginia University in Morgantown.\n\nWhen the polls closed on Election Day, she had made history, knocking off Democrat Layne Diehl, also of Martinsville, 54.5 percent to 45.5 percent, to become the youngest elected state lawmaker in West Virginia history.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Saira Blair explained her race as an attempt to persuade millennials \u201cthat we shouldn\u2019t wait until we\u2019re 40, 50 or 60 to understand that conservative values and principles are the way to prosperity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to prove to people that I\u2019m mature enough and capable of doing the job.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t mistake her for a political novelty or simply the product of circumstance. Saira Blair has a plan. The economics/Spanish double major sees her age as an advantage and she\u2019s ready to bring this fresh perspective to Charleston.\n\nHer first concern: economic revitalization. As Blair explained in an interview with The Daily Signal, \u201cmy No. 1 priority is jobs.\u201d\n\nBlair worries that a bad economy will continue to drive her state\u2019s millennial exodus. To turn things around, \u201cmaking West Virginia a right-to-work state\u201d tops her agenda.\n\nThe young lawmaker wants to repeal certain \u201charshly imposed\u201d regulations on coal mining and natural gas drilling. Blair said these industries will help \u201crevamp the economy\u201d and provide opportunities for \u201cyoung people coming out of high school and college.\u201d\n\nAs a young conservative woman, she\u2019s eager to give a new face to her party.\n\nDuring both the primary and general elections, Blair ran a self-described \u201cpro-life, pro-jobs, pro-family\u201d campaign. She rejects the idea of \u201ca war on women\u201d and notes that conservatives \u201chave always welcomed me with open arms and supported me along the way.\u201d\n\nNow she just wants to get to work. Blair says she feels a responsibility both to her constituents and especially her supporters to merit their confidence.\n\n\u201cI want to prove to people that I\u2019m mature enough and capable of doing the job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This spring, college freshman Saira Blair will skip class for the state capitol to be sworn in as the youngest elected representative in state history.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This spring, college freshman Saira Blair will skip class for the state capitol to be sworn in as the youngest elected representative in state history.", "title": "From the Classroom to the Capitol: America\u2019s Youngest Lawmaker Is All About Ideas", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141112_Blair_Wegmann.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-13T15:19:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/14e6UrZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "This spring, college freshman Saira Blair will skip class for the state capitol to be sworn in as the youngest elected representative in state history.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/141112_Blair_Wegmann.jpg"}, "title": "From the Classroom to the Capitol: America\u2019s Youngest Lawmaker Is All About Ideas", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2014-11-12T17:13:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-13T15:19:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2014 election, election results, saira blair, wv, west virginia"}, "article_summary": "This spring, college freshman Saira Blair will skip class for the state capital to be sworn in as the youngest state representative in the nation.\nBut this time, as the newest representative from the 59th District of the West Virginia House of Delegates.\nAs an 18-year-old freshman, Blair ran her general election campaign from her college dorm at West Virginia University in Morgantown.\nWhen the polls closed on Election Day, she had made history, knocking off Democrat Layne Diehl, also of Martinsville, 54.5 percent to 45.5 percent, to become the youngest elected state lawmaker in West Virginia history.\nThe young lawmaker wants to repeal certain \u201charshly imposed\u201d regulations on coal mining and natural gas drilling."}
