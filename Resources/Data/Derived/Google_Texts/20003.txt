VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) â€” Canadian authorities say at least three people died after a whale watching boat with 27 people on board sank off Vancouver Island.

The Joint Rescue Coordination Centre confirmed that the vessel made a mayday call shortly before 4 p.m. Sunday near Tofino, British Columbia.

Jenn Hamilton, a spokeswoman for British Columbia Emergency Health Services, said at least three were dead.

Hamilton said she did not have further details including nationalities of the deceased.

She didn't know how far off the coast of British Columbia the boat sank. Five ambulances were dispatched and many off duty paramedics went to the dock to help, she said.
