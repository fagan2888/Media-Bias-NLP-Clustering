Doing so will allow St. Joseph to cater to the growing demand for seniors who need help at home with personal care, exercise, meal prep and transportation, according to a press release. Those involved expect the deal to generate 600 new nursing jobs in Orange County, and a $50 million new revenue line for the system once fully operational.\n\nMore than 10,000 Americans are turning 65 every day and, as AARP notes, some 90 percent of them would prefer to do so in the comfort of their own homes.\n\n\u201cThis dramatic demographic shift requires a change in how health systems provide the best care where and when it is most needed,\u201d John Bennett, chief administrative officer of St. Joseph Health, said in the release. \u201cOur calling to care for our clients doesn\u2019t end when they leave the hospital.\u201d\n\nNurse Next Door comes by way of Canada, where it\u2019s opened 57 locations since 2007, to go with 80 in the United States. It offers a whole range of home-based services for seniors, from basic companionship to Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia support.\n\nFive steps to take following a needlestick injury\n\nSo you\u2019ve been scraped by a scalpel or nicked by a needle during your nursing duties? You\u2019re not alone, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that almost 385,000 sharps-related injuries occur in U.S. health care facilities each year.\n\nSuch injuries are a big issue in health care, with more than 20 blood-borne pathogens reportedly transmitted in these cases, sometimes including HIV or hepatitis B/C, Dave Hurton of health care compliance company MedSafe writes in a blog post.\n\nHe offers five steps that nurses can take following a needlestick injury:\n\nWash the wound with soap and water. Flush out your mouth, nose or skin with water. Irrigate eyes with water, saline or sterile irrigants. Report the incident to your supervisor. Immediately seek medical treatment at the nearest emergency department or treatment facility.\n\nWhat your CNIO can do to help push tech adoption forward\n\nIf your hospital is struggling to adopt new technology and get it into the hands of nurses on the front lines, Health Data Management has a few tips for your chief nursing information officer.\n\nIts website recommends that CNIOs must establish a solid connection with the organization\u2019s chief nursing officer, along with putting RNs at the information technology planning table, volunteering for projects outside their purview and just staying visible in general. Those tips come by way of Mary Beth Mitchell, R.N., the CNIO of Texas Health Resources.\n\n\u201cYou have to advocate for your customers,\u201d Mitchell tells the website. \u201cWhen I was a nurse, my patients were my customers, and now, the nurses are my customers. It doesn\u2019t mean they get everything they want, but it does mean I\u2019m out there listening to my users and responding to them. You can\u2019t just sit in an office and do this job.\u201d\n\nUsing her own advice, Mitchell has helped set THR on a solid path with its IT implementation, with the system getting recognized as a State 7 organization by HIMSS Analytics, and also winning the Davis award from HIMSS.\n\nRapid fire:\n\nHere are a couple more items in bullet format:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plus more nurse-related news that you may have missed in the past week.", "csrf-token": "G2F4bdcF2EWD2EahFkNPt8PxXhvFPe3vjD7A4CLL3Uc=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/NurseWatch_logo_190x127.jpg?1456928644", "description": "Plus, more nurse-related news that you may have missed in the past week.", "card": "summary", "title": "Nurse Watch: Southern California Health System Creates 600 Nurse Jobs, $50M Service Line with Unique Partnership"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/article_images/NurseWatch_logo_190x127.jpg?1456928644", "type": "Article", "description": "Plus, more nurse-related news that you may have missed in the past week.", "title": "Nurse Watch: Southern California Health System Creates 600 Nurse Jobs, $50M Service Line with Unique Partnership"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "CDC,HIMSS,centers for disease control,hiv,chief nursing officer,Alzheimer's,John Bennett,chief nursing information officer,MedSafe,Nurse Next Door,dementia,IT adoption,Irvine, Calif.,sharps-related injuries,needle stick,St. Joseph Health,CNIO", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Such injuries are a big issue in health care, with more than 20 blood-borne pathogens reportedly transmitted in these cases, sometimes including HIV or hepatitis B/C, Dave Hurton of health care compliance company MedSafe writes in a blog post.\nYou\u2019re not alone, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that almost 385,000 sharps-related injuries occur in U.S. health care facilities each year.\nThe 16-hospital, Irvine, Calif., health system announced Monday that it\u2019s purchasing up to 26 Nurse Next Door Home Care Services franchises as a way to extend its hospitals\u2019 reach.\nThose involved expect the deal to generate 600 new nursing jobs in Orange County, and a $50 million new revenue line for the system once fully operational.\nCalifornia health system bolsters senior home care through acquisitionRather than going through the headaches of building a home care service line from the ground up, St. Joseph Health is going the acquisition route to better care for seniors in their places of residence."}
