I was first licensed in 1999 and started selling in 2004,\u201d he said during this edited interview.\n\n\n\nWhat do you enjoy about selling real estate?\n\nI like the interaction with the people. I also like success when it all comes together and everyone is happy because it gives me some satisfaction.\n\nHow do you consider yourself to be different than other agents?\n\nI look at the real estate industry more as a service business rather than a selling business. I\u2019ve had about 30 years in service businesses and I\u2019ve learned that, rather than trying to sell, you have to approach it more as a guide.\n\nWhat role should an agent play for a client?\n\nYou\u2019re a guide who is there to help clients make their own decisions. The key is to educate them about what the options are so once they understand them, they can make an educated choice.\n\nWhat qualities make for a good agent?\n\nDedication, a willingness to put in long hours, and the ability to listen and understand.\n\nHow do you keep yourself current with the various aspects of the industry?\n\nI read as much as possible and we get a lot of material from the Board of Realtors. Many sources of material come our way. Of course, we also have to take accredited continuing education classes and I\u2019m not afraid to get guidance from others, either.\n\nWhat role does technology play in selling homes?\n\nNow, it\u2019s more so than ever. Everyone has a smart phone and is using the Internet as their first source for viewing properties. One thing I\u2019ve found works really well is hiring a professional photographer to take my pictures because having online presentation is so important. There is a lot of inaccurate information online and you have to educate clients on which sites are better and how to differentiate from what is valid information and what isn\u2019t.\n\nHave you had any mentors?\n\nThe gentleman who got me into real estate, Lou Fons, is one person I call a mentor. Dick Kollmansberger was my original broker.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best advice you\u2019ve been given?\n\nAlways make sure your clients\u2019 interests come first.\n\nWhat\u2019s the most important advice you give to clients?\n\nTry as hard as you can to keep emotion out of the process.\n\nWhat have you learned from your clients?\n\nI\u2019ve learned paying close attention to their wants and needs is greatly appreciated as is giving them a chance to think for themselves.\n\n\n\nHow have you developed as a realtor since the beginning?\n\nI did pretty well out of the gate as Rookie of the Year. Almost all of my business has come from referrals from past clients and people I\u2019ve worked with. When you give people good service, it just seems to grow. A lot of people may disagree, but it\u2019s been working for me.\n\nIs there anything you do differently than you did at the beginning?\n\nI don\u2019t think so. You have to work at clients\u2019 schedules and put in a lot of hours. There isn\u2019t any magic to it.\n\nWhat\u2019s your business philosophy?\n\nI don\u2019t look at deals as large or small, because I\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019ve helped a client sell an investment property in the inner city and the client became one of my biggest. I\u2019ve helped him flip a number of properties and sold his personal residence. I just treat everyone the same and it comes back to you.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest challenge clients face in today\u2019s market?\n\nBeing able to level with themselves and price their property properly. This can be tough because people tend to look at what they have as higher value and what they want to buy as lower value. I take the time to provide as much information as possible so they can come to the right conclusion on their own.\n\nWhat do you do if you a client is making a particularly poor decision?\n\nYou have to provide enough information so clients can help themselves. The decision ultimately has to come from them.\n\nHow do you relax in your down time?\n\nMy wife and I do motorcycle tours and we spend a lot of time camping with our children and their families. We live on the lake, so we enjoy the water life.\n\nWhat professional/charitable organizations are you involved with?\n\nWe\u2019re involved with our church.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"title": "Karl Brien, RE/MAX Lakeside", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/homes/realtoroftheweek/318322151.html", "image": {"width": 183, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/karlbrein2web.jpg", "height": 324}, "type": "article", "description": "After having been a landlord for many years, Karl Brien&rsquo;s real estate agent suggested he get his license so he could save himself the real estate commission from buying and selling properties. &ldquo;Once I did that, many of the guys from my investors&rsquo; group asked me for help selling their properties and it got to the point where I was making more money than I was at my full-time job, so I broke off into real estate.
