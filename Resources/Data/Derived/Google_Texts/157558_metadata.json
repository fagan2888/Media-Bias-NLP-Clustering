Federal officials just extended the state\u2019s Section 11-15 waiver, which reimburses hospitals for uncompensated care \u2013 but money from that program will disappear soon unless the state replaces it with Medicaid.\n\nJoan Alker, director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said statistics show hospitals have a lot more paying patients when states expand Medicaid coverage.\n\n\u201cSo, there\u2019s a lot of data already,\u201d she said, \u201cthat shows that states that have done the Medicaid expansion are seeing far, far greater declines in their uninsured-patient hospital stays.\u201d\n\nSection 11-15 waivers are temporary programs to help states pay for uncompensated care and to encourage innovation in health-care delivery. Under its waiver, Texas has received about $6 billion a year for the past five years. But without a Medicaid expansion, about 1 million Texans still fall into a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d without access to affordable health insurance.\n\nThe waiver was set to expire this September, but this week federal officials granted Texas a 15-month extension. Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, said federal officials are in the process of phasing out payments for uncompensated care, also called UC, when a patient is eligible for Medicaid or other insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cThat UC money goes away starting in 2018, no matter what,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is whether or not we have a federally funded and Texas-designed coverage plan in place that will reduce the number of uninsured and bring in about $6 billion.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government currently is fully funding Medicaid expansion. States will begin paying a small fraction of the cost starting in 2017, and will pay no more than 10 percent beginning in 2020.\n\nMark Richardson, Public News Service", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The El Paso Herald-Post delivers El Paso News & Opinion from local people that ask you to consider their opinion and politely asking for your view.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Herald-Post", "description": "The El Paso Herald-Post delivers El Paso News & Opinion from local people that ask you to consider their opinion and politely asking for your view.", "title": "Feds Temporarily Extend Texas Program for Uncompensated Care | El Paso Herald-Post", "url": "http://elpasoheraldpost.com/feds-temporarily-extend-texas-program-uncompensated-care/", "image": {"width": 525, "identifier": "http://elpasoheraldpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/grview-51786-1.jpg", "height": 350}, "updated_time": "2016-05-09T23:32:52-06:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The El Paso Herald-Post delivers El Paso News & Opinion from local people that ask you to consider their opinion and politely asking for your view.", "title": "Feds Temporarily Extend Texas Program for Uncompensated Care | El Paso Herald-Post", "image": "http://elpasoheraldpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/grview-51786-1.jpg", "creator": "@eperaldpost", "site": "@eperaldpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/elpasoheraldpost", "section": "Regional News", "tag": "Texas Program for Uncompensated Care", "published_time": "2016-05-10T10:00:40-06:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-09T23:32:52-06:00"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "Under its waiver, Texas has received about $6 billion a year for the past five years.\nBut without a Medicaid expansion, about 1 million Texans still fall into a \u201ccoverage gap\u201d without access to affordable health insurance.\nFederal officials just extended the state\u2019s Section 11-15 waiver, which reimburses hospitals for uncompensated care \u2013 but money from that program will disappear soon unless the state replaces it with Medicaid.\nThe waiver was set to expire this September, but this week federal officials granted Texas a 15-month extension.\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2013 The Texas Legislature has thus far refused to expand its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, but the state still receives billions of health-care dollars from the federal government."}
