So Pope Francis should be very well received by the president.\u201d\n\nThe White House expects some 15,000 people to be on the South Lawn for Wednesday\u2019s meeting, the first since Obama and Francis initially met in March 2014 at the Vatican. Invited guests at the South Lawn event will include Gene Robins, the first openly gay Episcopal bishop; Sister Simone Campbell, a liberal nun who frequently challenges stances from the Vatican; and two transgender activists, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nOne example of complexity that doesn\u2019t fall along traditional left-right lines is the pope\u2019s encyclical on the environment, largely in agreement with the Obama administration\u2019s warnings about climate change. However, even that document says, \u201cSince everything is interrelated, concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president and the pope will agree on issues of poverty and the environment,\u201d said Rick Hinshaw, a spokesman for the Catholic League advocacy group. \u201cIn Pope Francis\u2019s encyclical on the environment, he says all of God\u2019s creation, including human life, is precious.\u201d\n\nFrancis also played a key role in normalization of relations between the United States and Cuba, a major breakthrough for Obama.\n\nThe pope \u201csets his own agenda\u201d and won\u2019t be influenced by the administration, nor is he setting out to shape U.S. policy, said deputy White House national security adviser Ben Rhodes.\n\n\u201cI think the pope operates at a level of calling on all of us to care for the weak among us, which is obviously a central tenet to the church\u2019s mission and certainly to this particular pope,\u201d Rhodes told reporters in a conference call Thursday. \u201cI think people of different political persuasions can find inspiration in that, no matter what they think of different policies. The notion that we all benefit when people are lifted out of poverty and there\u2019s not the challenge of extreme inequality.\u201d\n\nTackling poverty is important, but Hinshaw, of the Catholic League, said he hopes the pope and the president discuss the dispute over religious freedom, which concerns the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 contraception mandate that was part of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe president is using the power of the federal government to coerce the Catholic Church and people of other faiths to do things that are morally objectionable,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cThe president could go a long way in reversing the policies of repressing religious freedom. We don\u2019t expect him to back away on his position on abortion and marriage. But drawing back on the mandates would be a sign of good faith.\u201d\n\nThe rift between Obama and Catholics pre-dated Obamacare, and even the Obama presidency. Prominent Catholics were kept out of participating in the 2008 Democratic convention in Denver, as well as the 2009 inauguration.\n\nIn a 2012 letter to bishops, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said bishops raised concerns about the mandate during a meeting with White House officials. Dolan wrote the White House officials \u201cadvised the bishops\u2019 conference that we should listen to the \u2018enlightened\u2019 voices of accommodation.\u201d\n\nWhat followed, though, was an elongated legal battle over the ever-controversial contraceptive mandate \u2014 one that continues to rage three years later.\n\nNevertheless, even amid this contentious atmosphere, Obama won the Catholic vote in 2008 and 2012.\n\nHinshaw argues that what pollsters call the Catholic vote should be looked at carefully.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to determine what is the Catholic vote, because surveys now conflate practicing Catholics and non-practicing Catholics,\u201d Hinshaw said. \u201cOn the issues of life and marriage, most church-going Catholics are in tune with church teachings.\u201d\n\nBut Professor Way, of Christendom College, says that despite social conservatism, there has been a long history of Catholics backing big government.\n\n\u201cMany Catholics believe social justice comes from the government,\u201d Way said. \u201cMany bishops have long sought government health care, then the church raised objections when that led to the HHS mandate. That was only natural step under government health care.\u201d\n\nThe issue over some of the controversial attendees found it\u2019s way into the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s classless decision to transform Pope Francis\u2019 visit to the White House into a politicized cattle call for gay and lesbian activists is an insult to the Pope and millions of Catholics,\u201d former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said in a statement. \u201cWhy is it that Obama goes to extremes to accommodate Muslim terrorists but shows nothing but disdain for Christians? This is a new low for an administration that will go down as the most anti-Christian in American history.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Pope Francis' meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House this week comes at a time of a very complex relationship between the administration and American Catholics \u2014 one that has included not just policy clashes, but also legal fights over religious liberty.
