DOLORES, Uruguay (AP) â€” Residents of this small city in western Uruguay are sifting through the remains of their homes following a powerful tornado that razed buildings, hurled cars into the air and left four people dead and dozens more injured.

Uruguay's government declared a day of national mourning on Sunday for the deaths in Dolores, a city of 20,000 people about 165 miles (265 kilometers) west of Montevideo, and President Tabare Vazquez was expected to travel to the devastated city that day as well.

The tornado took the city by surprise on Friday afternoon, and officials say a good part of the population lost their homes. Two of the dead were reportedly hit by flying cars. The city was declared an emergency zone.
