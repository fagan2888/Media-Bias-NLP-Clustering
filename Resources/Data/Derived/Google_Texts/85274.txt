Updates report that 7 cars derailed, reports indicated 10.

SCOTLAND, SD - The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad says seven ethanol tanker cars derailed and at least one caught fire Saturday morning in southeastern South Dakota.



BNSF spokesman Andy Williams says the 98-car train carrying ethanol derailed at about 6:15 a.m. between the towns of Scotland and Lesterville. He says there were no injuries and no nearby structures were threatened by the fire.



Williams says three tankers were compromised and lost their contents but crews haven't yet determined how many actually caught fire.



Bon Homme County Emergency Management spokesman Lee Rettig says firefighters from several departments responded and the fire was put out about 2:30 p.m. Saturday. BNSF hazardous materials teams were also responding to assess damage.



Rettig says the derailed cars were near the front of the train.

Scotland Fire Chief Mike Mehrer said additional crews were called to the scene.

"We came out here with probably 5,000 gallons of which wouldn't have lasted very long," Mehrer said. "The biggest reason we might have sprayed any water is to cool the tanks."

Firefighters were able to put most of the fire out. Now, their focus is on cleaning up. They're now planning to fill the cars with foam to clean out any ethanol material remaining. Crews also plan to repair the wooden bridge that was damaged.

The exact cause of the derailment and fire still remains under investigation.
