Fletcher a \u00a3500,000 target City could snap up Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher for \u00a3500,000 in January, but face competition in the latest suggestion he is heading for Hull.The Daily Mail reports that Steve Bruce is closing on the Scotland international but the Daily Telegraph claims Aston Villa are also in the hunt. Tigers backed for a replay in Arsenal FA Cup tie? TIME to get carried away with the FA Cup today as the Tigers travel to the Emirates to take on Arsenal in a repeat of last year\u2019s epic final.Gunning for revenge, Steve Bruce\u2019s men will be hoping to avert the agonising 3-2 extra-time defeat at Wembley in tonight\u2019s third-round tie.BetVictor pundit Michael Owen doesn\u2019t believe that will happen, though, and is backing Arsenal to progress despite the Gunners\u2019 woeful defeat at Southampton last time out.\"A repeat of last season\u2019s Final and I expect the Gunners to prevail and bounce back after a disappointing result at St Mary\u2019s on New Year\u2019s Day,\u201d Owen wrote.\"The Tigers will be lifted by their win against Everton on Thursday but Premier League survival will be their primary objective this term.\u201dMeanwhile, BBC Sport pundit Mark Lawrenson believes the Tigers will force the tie into a replay at the KC Stadium - but still says Arsenal will win.\"The repeat of last season's final should be interesting because I cannot see Hull boss Steve Bruce changing his team too much from the side that beat Everton on New Year's Day,\u201d Lawrenson wrote.\"The Tigers were in mid-table when they started out on their cup run last time. They are fighting relegation this season but, even so, Bruce is not the kind of guy just to throw a game away.\"Usually, I would expect Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger to juggle his squad but he is under a bit of pressure after the non-performance in their defeat by Southampton.\"That game underlined how the Gunners don't just need a new defender and defensive midfielder, they need a new goalkeeper too. Wojciech Szczesny is a good keeper but he is not top class, and therein lies one of their problems.\"Neither side will want a draw, so that is what I am going for.\u201d Walcott raring to go ARSENAL striker Theo Walcott is confident he will return from his latest injury lay-off a more complete player in tonight\u2019s FA Cup tie with the Tigers.The 25-year-old has only made three appearances for almost a year with a serious knee injury and a groin problem which delayed his comeback.Walcott came off the bench in the 2-0 Premier League defeat at Southampton, but is expected to lead the Gunners attack in what is a re-run of last season\u2019s FA Cup final against Hull City.\u201cIt is about a year since the injury and it has gone very quickly. I have had loads of things in my life that have changed completely, so that side of it was a good thing,\u201d Walcott told London24.com.\u201cThings happen for a reason and it has given me the opportunity to work on different parts of my game that I missed out on when I was younger, the actual development stage of it.\u201cI am looking forward to going out there and getting a few minutes. I am not expecting too much from these games early on.\u201cIt will be blowing the cobwebs away and will be good to be out playing with my mates again because I have missed it all.\u201d Hull City Academy snap up striker Luer AHEAD of their Final Third Development League trip to Rotherham on Tuesday afternoon, Hull City\u2019s under-21s side have completed a move for Burgess Hill Town striker Greg Luer.The 19-year-old arrives in East Yorkshire on an 18-month deal with plenty of promise and he told the club\u2019s official website he can\u2019t wait to prove his worth at the Premier League club.\u201cIt was a very easy decision for me to have to make \u2013 a move to the Premier League was a no brainer,\u201d Luer said.\u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s dream to get the chance to join a Premier League club. \u201cI had a great time at Burgess Hill and I would like to thank them for all of their support during my development as a footballer there. \u201cThey have been very supportive of me in relation to the move and I can\u2019t thank them enough.\u201d Nice confirm Ben Arfa arrival IT\u2019S official. After seemingly going AWOL at Hull City after a torrid loan spell, Hatem Ben Arfa has all but joined Nice to complete his Premier League exit.The French club posted a picture on their Twitter feed yesterday confirming Ben Arfa\u2019s arrival at the Allianz Riviera, but says all the finer details are yet to be signed (if my GCSE French is correct)\u2026So with Ben Arfa gone, and money possibly to spend on another loan signing, will the Tigers dip into the market again over the next few weeks?\n\nIl n\u2019a pas encore sign\u00e9.
