There are at least a dozen companies selling food for long-term storage, from military rations to shrimp gumbo. It\u2019s hard to imagine dry cat food going bad \u2014 what would that possibly smell like? \u2014 but Pet\u2019s Banquet sells a dehydrated version it claims will keep for 15 years. At Wal-Mart, you can buy a one-year food supply for a family of four for $3,360.86. The emergency food business is booming.\n\n\u201cSales have been crazy,\u201d said Saul Meshkin, owner of XMRE, which packages and sells meals, ready-to-eat, like the ones issued to U.S. troops. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the Ebola warnings, but we\u2019ve almost tripled sales this month from the past month.\u201d Mountain House, which used to make food almost exclusively for the outdoors market, now does about 50 percent of its business in emergency supplies, according to marketing director Reiner Bohlen. That got started after Katrina. \u201cIt was practically overnight,\u201d Bohlen said. \u201cPeople saw that something like this can happen to you. Everybody wanted to be prepared.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m opposed to prepping, both philosophically (I think people should plan to help each other in an emergency rather than just preparing their own bunkers) and temperamentally (I\u2019m lazy). But still \u2026 you never know. If society breaks down, I don\u2019t want to be the only one living on ketchup while everyone else gets turkey tetrazzini and chocolate pudding. I decided to try some of this emergency food, so I got on the phone and got samples from as many companies as possible. If I was going to be eating this food for weeks, months \u2013 possibly the rest of my life \u2013 I should choose my brand carefully.\n\nThe boxes arrived promptly, from Lindon Farms, Wise Food Company, Food Supply Depot, Mountain House and XMRE. The first thing you notice about emergency-storage food is that it\u2019s the only kind you ever find \u2013 with the exception of bodybuilder drinks \u2013 that actually boasts about how many calories it has.\n\n\u201cGet full. Go farther. More calories per serving,\u201d reads the copy on Food Supply Depot\u2019s website. It makes sense. \u201cIn a grid-down scenario,\u201d said Lisa Bedford, author of \u201cSurvival Mom,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019d have to walk everywhere. You\u2019d be exerting a lot more energy, so what do you do for calories?\u201d\n\nPaleo, Atkins and gluten-free diets will thankfully be the first casualties of any national emergency. Calories are good. Carbs are good. I felt grateful to the generous people at Lindon Farms, who sent me two pails of food, one full of nothing but freeze-dried fruit, the other packed with a possibly lifesaving quantity of good old American obesity fuel: mac and cheese, broccoli cheddar soup, cheese sauce. I counted 30,000 calories in that pail. Other brands\u2019 offerings were similarly heavy and starchy. There were two kinds of beef stroganoff, rice and beans, multiple chilis and pasta dishes. I also got to sample snacks, desserts, appetizers, cereal and side dishes \u2013 entire menus of freeze-dried and dehydrated delicacies, literally from soup to nuts. I recruited a few friends to help me conduct a taste test.\n\nThe results? Well, the simpler fare was best. MRE peanut butter was, to me, indistinguishable from Jif. Wise Foods\u2019 strawberry granola, although supposedly best when reconstituted with water, was strangely addictive right out of the bag. Other dishes also surpassed expectations. Two soups \u2013 Lindon Farms\u2019 cheddar broccoli and Food Supply Depot\u2019s beef with vegetables \u2013 both had plenty of flavor, as did the MRE chili, which tasted pretty much like Hormel\u2019s. Both stroganoffs were rich and creamy. The most ambitious offering, Mountain House\u2019s sweet and sour pork with rice, was probably my favorite, approximating sugary takeout Chinese pretty well, right down to the pineapples. Their raspberry crumble dessert was also palatable, although the texture was a little gluey \u2013 \u201clike hot jam,\u201d as one taster put it. Duds included Wise Food\u2019s cheesy lasagna, which was, first of all, pourable, and therefore not lasagna, and also had a weird, rancid flavor, and the MRE oatmeal cookie, in which our tasters detected notes of \u201csweet plastic,\u201d and \u201cmetal.\u201d\n\nIn general, this emergency food really isn\u2019t bad. It just doesn\u2019t taste like regular food. It all has a certain laboratory flavor, that artificially mouth-watering quality shared by, for example, Cool Ranch Doritos, Chef Boyardee spaghetti and meatballs, and Mrs. Field\u2019s cookies. Like a new-car smell. The texture of the entr\u00e9es is also a little funny, especially the meat. It\u2019s impossible to tell the real beef and pork from the vegetarian imitations: Both have that tempeh toughness. But, in general, most of this stuff was surprisingly tasty. In the end, the nod went to the high-end Mountain House, with XMRE a close second.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ebola, ISIS, global warming: There's never been a better time to be in the survival business.
