ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. — Miss New York Kira Kazantsev has been named the new Miss America, marking the third year in a row that a contestant from her state has walked away with the crown in the nationally televised pageant.

Kazantsev received the crown Sunday night at Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall from outgoing Miss America – and Miss New York – Nina Davuluri.

Kazantsev sang Pharrell Williams’ “Happy” while sitting cross-legged on the stage and banging a red plastic cup on the floor.

She named combating sexual assault in the military as the issue she would want female U.S. Senators to press their male counterparts.
