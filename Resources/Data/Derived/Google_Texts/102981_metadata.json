I had a book of clients. That\u2019s what I was going to do.\u201d\n\nDel Rio had played the 1995 season with the Minnesota Vikings, where Dungy was his defensive coordinator. Dungy became head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and he wanted to take Del Rio with him as an assistant coach.\n\nInstead, Del Rio gave it one more shot as a player, going to training camp with the Miami Dolphins. Beaten out at middle linebacker by a rookie named Zach Thomas, Del Rio decided he didn\u2019t want to hang on for a 12th NFL season as a backup.\n\n\u201cI probably helped him out a little more than I should have,\u201d Del Rio said with a grin.\n\nThe 1996 season played out with Del Rio dabbling as a financial adviser at his northern California home until Dungy called in January to say he was going to be in the neighborhood for the East-West Shrine Game in Palo Alto.\n\n\u201cAre you happy?\u201d Dungy asked Del Rio over lunch.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s great. I\u2019m doing this stock broker thing,\u201d Del Rio said.\n\n\u201cNo, really, are you happy?\u201d Dungy said.\n\nMerrill Lynch never had a chance. As Dungy\u2019s invited guest during the East-West practices, Del Rio was hired on by Mike Ditka with the New Orleans Saints.\n\nThus began a coaching career that eventually took Del Rio to the Broncos as a defensive coordinator in 2012. When head coach John Fox had open-heart surgery last week, Del Rio became his temporary replacement.\n\n\u201cI knew when I coached him as a player that he would be a great coach,\u201d Dungy said. \u201cHe was such a great leader and he was smart. He loved to study. And he was so competitive, I thought coaching would be a natural for him.\u201d\n\nTwo-sport Trojan\n\nInheriting a 7-1 team, Del Rio takes control just as the Broncos embark on the most onerous stretch of their schedule \u2014 at San Diego on Sunday, then home against 9-0 Kansas City, at 7-2 New England and at Kansas City.\n\nThe schedule may be daunting, but it\u2019s not the first time Del Rio traded comfort for challenge. Everything Broncos fans need to know about their interim head coach can be explained by the life decision Del Rio made as he was choosing his college. His dad, Jack Del Rio Sr., wanted Junior to attend nearby Stanford. Cal, Nebraska, Arizona, USC, UCLA and Notre Dame also were interested.\n\nDuring his visit to USC, Del Rio met with Marvin Goux, the Trojans\u2019 long-serving, gruff-talking defensive assistant.\n\n\u201cHe sat me down, he writes 20 names on a list and my name is at the very bottom,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cHe said if you come here, this is where you start. Where you wind up is up to you. Then he said if you don\u2019t come here, we\u2019re going to kick your you-know-what.\n\n\u201cEveryone else was saying: \u2018If you come here, you\u2019ll start as a freshman. And if we can get enough guys like you, we can beat Southern Cal.\u2019 I was drawn to the competitive challenge.\u201d\n\nDel Rio twice sacked Ohio State quarterback Mike Tomczak to earn co-MVP of the 1985 Rose Bowl. During the Trojans\u2019 baseball season, Del Rio not only caught Johnson, who eventually became arguably the hardest-throwing left-handed starter in major-league history, he caught him while the Big Unit was far from under control.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some stories now,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cRandy had wicked movement. He crossed me up once and got me right in the cup. At UCLA\u2019s baseball stadium. And, of course, they all delighted in that.\u201d\n\nMcGwire was a pitcher too, until a trip to the Alaska summer league let him know that his future was as a power-hitting first baseman.\n\n\u201cHis fastball didn\u2019t move at all,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cIt was straight. Obviously, he turned out to be a great first baseman.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike an uncle figure\u201d\n\nWith his strong build and stern expression, there is an intimidating presence to Del Rio. Peel back that competitive facade, though, and there is some real human compassion.\n\n\u201cIn Jacksonville, there were times I came to meetings, being a rookie and having to play early, the pressures of the league \u2026 and he was almost like an uncle figure,\u201d said Broncos defensive tackle Terrance Knighton. \u201cI won\u2019t say father figure, because your father\u2019s going to be on you all the time. An uncle will laugh at you, encourage you.\u201d\n\nKnighton played four years with Jacksonville when Del Rio was his head coach. Their fifth year together is with the Broncos.\n\n\u201cOne thing I looked for when I signed here, is to see if he was a little more relaxed because he didn\u2019t have as much responsibility as a D-coordinator,\u201d Knighton said. \u201cBut he\u2019s the exact same. He\u2019s the same at practice. I would say he seems a little happier. We have leadership on defense. He has a lot more confidence in his players here.\u201d\n\nSo far, so good with Fox\u2019s recovery from heart surgery. He left a Charlotte, N.C., hospital on Friday, and the plan is for him to fly back to Denver this week. Del Rio may be the Broncos\u2019 interim coach for two games, maybe four or six.\n\nIn his job as temporary boss, Del Rio has played it straight. He has been businesslike in his postpractice speeches with the team. Nothing has been over the top. No rah-rah, win-it-for-Foxy themes.\n\n\u201cNo, to me that\u2019s something that naturally occurs or it doesn\u2019t,\u201d Del Rio. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I can try to force.\u201d\n\nThe pinnacle of Del Rio\u2019s coaching career came in the 2007 season when he led Jacksonville to a playoff win at Pittsburgh.\n\nSteelers owner Art Rooney II came to the visiting team\u2019s locker room and congratulated Del Rio.\n\n\u201cI shake his hand and I say, \u2018I want you to meet my son,\u2019 \u201d Del Rio said. \u201cMy son was with me. So Mr. Rooney shakes my son\u2019s hand and my son has this disappointed look on his face. I say, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 He said, \u2018Ah, the only thing I really wanted was a Terrible Towel.\u2019 So two minutes later, Mr. Rooney has a guy at the door, he\u2019s got a Terrible Towel for Luke. I look at Luke, \u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019 \u201c\n\nFive years later, Luke Del Rio left Episcopal High School in Jacksonville, Fla., before his senior year and followed his dad to Denver and play one season for Valor Christian High School. He threw 28 touchdown passes, then bypassed scholarship offers from Oklahoma State and many others to walk on at Alabama.\n\nWho makes such daring decisions at 18 years old? The son of a former three-sport prep athlete who went to USC because he was 20th on a list of 20, that\u2019s who.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Broncos are in good hands with Jack Del Rio", "title": "Denver Broncos are in good hands with Jack Del Rio", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/09/denver-broncos-are-in-good-hands-with-jack-del-rio/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109__20131110_C1_SP10FBNBRONXp3.jpg", "height": 455}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109__20131110_C1_SP10FBNBRONXp3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-09T18:06:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:45:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe05a7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI probably helped him out a little more than I should have,\u201d Del Rio said with a grin.\nAs Dungy\u2019s invited guest during the East-West practices, Del Rio was hired on by Mike Ditka with the New Orleans Saints.\n\u201cI had spent my last four offseasons as a player working with Merrill Lynch,\u201d Del Rio said.\nThus began a coaching career that eventually took Del Rio to the Broncos as a defensive coordinator in 2012.\nAn uncle will laugh at you, encourage you.\u201dKnighton played four years with Jacksonville when Del Rio was his head coach."}
