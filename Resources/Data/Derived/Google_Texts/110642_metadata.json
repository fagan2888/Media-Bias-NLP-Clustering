Designs are being developed and the first of the construction tenders will begin soon, Al Baker said.\n\n(Reporting by Nadia Saleem; Editing by William Maclean)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Airways' chief executive said on Sunday the airline would cons", "title": "Qatar Airways chief says would consider A380neo to replace A380s", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/08/Qatar-Airways-chief-says-would-consider-A380neo-replace-A380s", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/dubai-airshow_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/08/Qatar-Airways-chief-says-would-consider-A380neo-replace-A380s", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/dubai-airshow_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Airways' chief executive said on Sunday the airline would cons", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2974\"", "article_summary": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Airways' chief executive said on Sunday the airline would consider replacing some of its Airbus A380s with the upgraded A380neo if the newer plane performed better.\nDesigns are being developed and the first of the construction tenders will begin soon, Al Baker said.\nAl Baker also said Qatar Airways was not allowed to take part in Indian carrier IndiGo's initial public offering but it may still purchase shares.\nIndiGo raised $464 million from a public offering in late October.\n\"If Airbus produces a (plane) which is head and shoulders above what they produce today we would look at them for replacements,\" Akbar Al Baker said when asked about interest in the A380neo."}
