Rand Paul, Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker and Mike Huckabee have all taken their turn bashing it.\n\nThe most common line of attack claims that Common Core, which began as a shared initiative between many state governments, has become a means of federal control forced upon states by the Obama administration. Jindal has been a particularly strong proponent of this argument, filing a federal lawsuit against the government claiming that Department of Education incentives such as Race to the Top amounted to an illegal effort to nationalize curriculum.\n\nKasich, however, said on Fox News Sunday that such attacks are bogus, and accused his fellow governors of not merely being wrong, but also of being dishonest.\n\n\u201cThese were governors who helped create Common Core,\u201d he said. That up-close involvement means they know Common Core wasn\u2019t Obama-driven.\n\n\u201cThe Common Core was written by state education superintendents and local principals,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIn my state of Ohio, we want higher standards for our children, and those standards are set and the curriculum is set by local school boards. Barack Obama doesn\u2019t set it, the state of Ohio doesn\u2019t set it. It is local school boards driving better education, higher standards, created by local school boards.\u201d\n\nKasich said the narrative of Common Core\u2019s creation is so clear that foes have been unable to genuinely challenge it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked the Republican governors who have complained about this to tell me where I\u2019m wrong, and guess what, silence,\u201d he said.\n\nKasich said their skepticism is almost certainly political rather than genuinely ideological in nature.\n\n\u201cPart of the problem is today politicians, are running to try and get votes,\u201d he said.\n\nKasich himself has been touted as a possible 2016 presidential candidate, and his defense of Common Core wasn\u2019t the only thing he said Sunday that may make him stand out. He also continued to defend his expansion of Medicaid in Ohio under ObamaCare, saying he could not \u201cturn his back\u201d on groups such as the mentally ill and very poor.\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
