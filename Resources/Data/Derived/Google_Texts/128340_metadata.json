Leslie Combs (D-Pikeville), did something stupid with a handgun in her office at the Capitol Annex Tuesday, accidentally discharging the weapon while cleaning it. No one was injured. Combs joins the ranks of responsible legislative gun owners like Dave Evans, the aide to Missouri\u2019s Speaker of the House, who left his loaded handgun on a toilet paper dispenser in that state\u2019s capitol; Kyle Tasker, the New Hampshire state rep. who dropped his gun on the House floor during a committee meeting; and Lori Klein, the Arizona legislator who pulled a loaded gun from her purse and pointed it at a reporter with the safety off. Those folks were all Republicans, so it\u2019s awfully nice to see a Democrat joining the Responsible Gun Owner fun.\n\nCombs says she was unloading her gun when it accidentally went off, as those things sometimes do. It is a mystery, really. Does anyone even know how guns work? Particularly some of the people who own them? Further,\n\nshe stressed that she was following safety procedures. \u201cI was going through the process as I have been trained to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI had it pointed in the proper direction.\u201d\n\nSo hey, no harm, no foul! Just a hole in the wall, not in a constituent or aide. Heck, this technically doesn\u2019t even count as an \u201caccident\u201d does it?\n\nWe\u2019re just happy to know Rep. Combs wasn\u2019t handling marijuana, because that stuff is illegal, and dangerous.\n\n[Courier-Journal via tip from Wonkette Operative \u201cBill in West Virginia\u201d]\n\nFollow Doktor Zoom on Twitter.
