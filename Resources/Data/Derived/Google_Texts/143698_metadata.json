But some on the right say his positions on Obamacare and gun control make him an uneasy fit.\n\nTo avoid the morality police, some Iranian women are dressing like men\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee member Sen. Angus King (I) of Maine listens to testimony on Capitol Hill in Washington, Feb. 11, 2014. King, who currently sides with the Democratic Party, says he might flip to GOP.\n\nIndependent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who currently sides with the Democratic Party, says he is considering crossing the aisle and caucusing with Republicans following the November midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make my decision at the time based on what I think is best for Maine,\u201d Senator King told The Hill Wednesday.\n\nIf King made this move Republicans would need to gain only five seats to control the chamber, instead of the current six. That could set up a bidding war for his services \u2013 if the GOP is right on the edge of ruling the Senate, they might offer King better committee spots to entice him to their side.\n\nRecommended: Seven open US Senate seats in 2014\n\nOr Democrats could up the ante to retain him.\n\nIf Republicans win the Senate outright, snagging King could increase their margin and give party leaders a cushion for tough votes to come.\n\nSo in a pure power sense, this offer is logical. King could maximize the political benefits flowing to the state of Maine by in effect auctioning his vote for Majority Leader to the highest bidder.\n\nThat probably would be fine with Maine\u2019s voters, given that the state as a whole doesn\u2019t particularly tilt in either partisan direction. King replaced the retiring Sen. Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican, by winning election in 2012. The other Maine senator, Susan Collins, is another middle-of-the-roader. King does not need the state Democratic Party behind him to win elections \u2013 he\u2019s a declared independent, after all.\n\nAnd King has warned he might do this. When he originally took his seat he said that being in the majority was something that was good for his constituents. That\u2019s why he\u2019s aligned with the Democrats so far, he says \u2013 they\u2019re the ones in charge. For the moment.\n\nBut would King be comfortable in today\u2019s Republican Party? Would they even accept him?\n\nThe answers to those questions aren\u2019t obvious, because to conservatives, the \u201cI\u201d next to King\u2019s name doesn\u2019t matter. To them he\u2019s a Democrat. Yes, the party might get more power by accepting him, but ideology is already a problem in the GOP, given the struggles between establishment Republicans and tea party-leaning insurgents.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how King would actually help the GOP pass an agenda, writes Jim Geraghty in the National Review, given that the American Conservative Union rates his past voting record as only 13 out of a hundred.\n\n\u201cI guess if you\u2019re an independent, craven opportunism can be considered a form of helping your constituents,\u201d Mr. Geraghty writes.\n\nIndeed, National Journal\u2019s rankings, based on recorded votes, place King as more liberal than 11 of the Senate\u2019s current Democrats. He supports the Affordable Care Act, also known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d He\u2019s pushed for controls on ammunition magazines for semi-automatic weapons.\n\n\u201cSo going GOP might be a stretch,\u201d tweeted Washington Post political writer Aaron Blake Thursday.\n\nGOP officials contacted King in 2012 to gauge whether he\u2019d actually join their caucus. They\u2019re likely to do that again after the 2014 vote, no matter who wins the Senate. That\u2019s just politics 101.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect them to woo King, writes Ed Morrissey Thursday at the right-leaning Hot Air site. In the event they win only five seats, and need another to take control of the chamber, the GOP might first target Sen. Joe Manchin (D) of West Virginia, the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, according to National Journal rankings.\n\n\u201cManchin\u2019s voting record is closer to the GOP than King\u2019s, and the trend in his home state might make him more reliable, too,\u201d writes Morrissey.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "c821258372e2422bf633ea7d81fb551c", "sailthru.author": "Peter Grier", "description": "If King flipped, the GOP would need to gain only five seats in the midterms to control the Senate.
