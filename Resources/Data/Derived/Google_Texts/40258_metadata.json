Many studies have shown that even a few minutes of these intervals can substantially improve health and cardiovascular fitness.\n\nBut high-intensity interval workouts have a drawback that is seldom acknowledged. Many people don\u2019t like them and soon abandon the program.\n\nIn a telling study published last year, researchers in New Zealand asked overweight, out-of-shape adults to complete three months of high-intensity interval training, using one of two common types of training programs. One consisted of either four minutes of fast jogging, a rest, and four more minutes of strenuous jogging. The other consisted of 30 seconds of all-out effort, followed by rest, and was repeated three times.\n\nSome of the exercisers\u2019 sessions were supervised, and some were supposed to be done on their own.\n\nBoth programs would have been expected to round the volunteer into much better shape.\n\nThey didn\u2019t. Few of the participants became significantly more fit, especially in the 30-second hard interval group. The probable reason, the researchers speculate, was that most of the participants had quit doing most or all of their assigned exercise early on in the study.\n\nThis finding and others like it troubled Jens Bangsbo, a professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, who studies high-intensity interval training. In studies at his lab, repeated hard intervals had almost invariably made people fitter, faster and healthier.\n\nBut those studies typically had involved highly motivated athletes riding high-tech stationary bicycles and had been supervised by the scientists, who personally had cajoled the participants to complete each interval.\n\nThose were hardly real-world circumstances, Bangsbo realized.\n\nSo he and his colleagues began to wonder if there might be more practical and palatable approaches to high-intensity interval training.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to create a workout that could be employed by everyone, from the nonexperienced person to the elite athlete,\u201d Dr. Bangsbo said.\n\nAfter some trial and error, they came up with a candidate routine and named it 10-20-30 training.\n\nIt has become my favorite interval program.\n\nThe essentials of 10-20-30 training are simple. Run, ride or perhaps row on a rowing machine gently for 30 seconds, accelerate to a moderate pace for 20 seconds, then sprint as hard as you can for 10 seconds. (It should be called 30-20-10 training, obviously, but that is not as catchy.) Repeat.\n\nThe enticements of this particular program are many. It is easy to remember and low-tech, requiring no gym membership, heart rate monitor, or flow chart, as some complicated interval programs seem to demand. You don\u2019t even need a stopwatch to monitor the 30-, 20-, and 10-second time changes. You can, like me, count to yourself, which seems to make the intervals pass quickly.\n\nPerhaps best of all, the grueling, all-out portion of the workout lasts for only 10 seconds, which is far more manageable for most of us than 30 seconds or 4 minutes.\n\nBut of course the program must be effective if scientists are to recommend it. So for a study published in December in The Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports, Bangsbo and his colleagues set out to test the routine with a large group of average exercisers.\n\nApproaching running clubs throughout Denmark, the scientists found 132 mostly middle-aged, recreational runners who agreed to substitute 10-20-30 training for two of their usual weekly workouts.\n\nAs a result, their weekly mileage fell by about half.\n\nThe scientists also recruited 28 runners to serve as controls and continue their normal training.\n\nAll of the runners underwent physiological testing at the start of the study, including a simulated 5K race.\n\nThen the scientists turned the runners loose to continue with or abandon their training as they chose.\n\nAfter eight weeks, almost all of the runners in the 10-20-30 group were still following the program. And when they repeated their 5K runs, they had shaved an average of 38 seconds from their times. Most also had lower blood pressure and other markers of improved health.\n\nThere were no changes among the runners in the control group.\n\nOf course, any regular interval training should improve someone\u2019s athletic endurance and health if it replaces slower training, which is why serious athletes incorporate interval sessions into their regimens.\n\nBut in Bangsbo\u2019s study, the 10-20-30 program not only allowed the runners to train less while growing faster, it seemed to make the workouts pleasurable.\n\n\u201cThe running clubs in our study reported much improved social interactions between members\u201d during the workouts, Bangsbo said, because when the fastest runners turned around after each set of five 10-20-30 sprints, as most did, they found themselves following the slower runners, who had the satisfaction of being in the lead, at least for the moment.\n\nYou can undertake the program solo, too, or, as I have, with dogs. They are likely to be enthusiasts. This is how they always have run.\n\nIf you wish to try 10-20-30 training, Bangsbo recommends starting by replacing one or two of your normal weekly workouts with a 10-20-30 session.\n\nWarm up with an easy jog (or pedaling or rowing), then ease into the intervals. The 30-second portion should feel relaxed; the next 20 seconds moderately hard; and the final 10 seconds a full gallop. \u201cThe aim is to cover as much distance as possible in those 10 seconds,\u201d Bangsbo said.\n\nDo five of the 10-20-30 intervals in a row without pause, then rest for two minutes by standing or very slowly walking about. Repeat the five consecutive intervals one more time, cool down, and you are done. The whole session, minus warm-up and cool-down, will have lasted 12 minutes.\n\nIf you are already in fine shape, Bangsbo said, add another set of the five uninterrupted intervals.\n\nRest the next day, he said, or very lightly exercise; don\u2019t do two of the intense interval sessions in a row. Although a smaller percentage of runners in the 10-20-30 group sustained injuries than did runners in the control group in his study, \u201cwe recommend very slow progress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/08/1003343596-FL_SAR_HFFIT11.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6e2\"", "article_summary": "Of course, any regular interval training should improve someone\u2019s athletic endurance and health if it replaces slower training, which is why serious athletes incorporate interval sessions into their regimens.\nSo he and his colleagues began to wonder if there might be more practical and palatable approaches to high-intensity interval training.\nIn a telling study published last year, researchers in New Zealand asked overweight, out-of-shape adults to complete three months of high-intensity interval training, using one of two common types of training programs.\nIf you wish to try 10-20-30 training, Bangsbo recommends starting by replacing one or two of your normal weekly workouts with a 10-20-30 session.\nThis finding and others like it troubled Jens Bangsbo, a professor of physiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, who studies high-intensity interval training."}
