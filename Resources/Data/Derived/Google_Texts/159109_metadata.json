Leftist Cardiff students, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t care less\u2014their minds are already made up on the subject, and anyone who dares to disagree should be chased of campus by a pitchfork-wielding mob.\n\nThe petition, which urges Cardiff to disinvite Greer, labels her views \u201cproblematic and hateful\u201d and maintains that her mere presence on campus would be \u201cdangerous\u201d:\n\nGreer has demonstrated time and time again her misogynistic views towards trans women, including continually misgendering trans women and denying the existence of transphobia altogether. Trans-exclusionary views should have no place in feminism or society. Such attitudes contribute to the high levels of stigma, hatred and violence towards trans people - particularly trans women - both in the UK and across the world. While debate in a University should be encouraged, hosting a speaker with such problematic and hateful views towards marginalised and vulnerable groups is dangerous. Allowing Greer a platform endorses her views, and by extension, the transmisogyny which she continues to perpetuate. Universities should prioritise the voices of the most vulnerable on their campuses, not invite speakers who seek to further marginalise them.\n\nOn the contrary, speakers who provoke discussion and upset the dominant way of thinking about an issue are exactly the kinds of people worth bringing to campus. As Spiked editor and Reason contributor Brendan O\u2019Neill put it in his writeup of the Greer controversy:\n\nThe Cardiff censors say Greer\u2019s ideas are \u2018problematic\u2019. That is what the PC say instead of \u2018haram\u2019. Well, we need more problematic people. A problem is a question to be answered, an obstacle to be navigated, which is exactly what students ought to be doing. Student bureaucrats\u2019 fear of anything \u2018problematic\u2019 sums up how philistine, dogmatic and illiberal they have become.\n\nRelated: Anti-Feminist Speaker Disinvited to \u2018Uncomfortable Learning\u2019 Lecture Series.
