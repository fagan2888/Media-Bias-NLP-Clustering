The \u201cObamatrade\u201d deal is longer than Obamacare plus the 2013 amnesty bill, authored by 2016 candidate Sen. Marco Rubio and Democratic leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY).\n\n\u201cThe deal is so bad because of the fact they don\u2019t cover currency manipulation,\u201d Trump added. \u201cIt\u2019s the number-one weapon used by foreign countries to hurt the United States and take away jobs.\u201d\n\nHe also hit the deal as a giveaway to China. \u201cWe are giving away what ultimately is going to be a back door for China,\u201d he said. \u201cChina will take advantage of it\u2014all the weak points in it, more than anybody else,\u201d said Trump, who has previously criticized China\u2019s manipulation of currency prices. China is not part of the TPP deal, but is widely expected to join in the next few years.\n\nRubio, Trump\u2019s chief rival from the Washington establishment, has publicly backed the TPP deal multiple times throughout the year\u2014in the Wall Street Journal and in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, where he called it a \u201cpillar\u201d of his desired presidency.\n\nBut now Rubio\u2019s team says he\u2019s undecided about the unpopular deal.\n\nHowever, Rubio also provided the critical 60th vote for Obamatrade\u2019s Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which greases the skids for an congressional approval of the trade deal. TPA makes it impossible to amend the deal\u2013or any other trade deal brought before Congress\u2013and eliminates the ability for a Senate filibuster, essentially sealing final passage of TPP before the deal\u2019s text even became public last week.\n\nQuestions have arisen about whether Rubio read the text of the TPP deal\u2013which was available in the basement of the U.S. Capitol for lawmakers to read in person \u2013before he voted for the TPA which would fast-track it. Rubio\u2019s team refuses to answer which days he supposedly spent in the classified reading room reading the text. It would have required multiple days in the room to read the deal before he voted on it.\n\nDuring the interview, Trump asked how many pages are in the deal. When told by this reporter that the deal is 5,544 pages long, Trump responded by saying \u201cWow.\u201d\n\nHe said that he thinks the only reason why politicians like Rubio are backing the TPP deal is because they are \u201ccontrolled\u201d by Washington lobbyists.\n\n\u201cThe only people that are supporting it politically are people that are controlled by the lobbyists for certain companies that want this to happen because it\u2019s to their advantage, not to the country\u2019s advantage. So the lobbyists and the special interests are supporting it, and certain politicians are supporting it because they\u2019re totally controlled by the lobbyists and the special interests.\u201d\n\nTrump said he is not controlled by the lobbyists. \u201cPeople are so happy that I\u2019m putting up my own money,\u201d Trump told Breitbart News. \u201cPeople are so happy that I\u2019m self-funding.\u201d\n\nIf he\u2019s elected president, Trump told Breitbart News that he would negotiate trade deals with individual countries, rather than giant multinational deals like TPP. He would also stop currency manipulation, he said.\n\n\u201cI would make individual deals with individual countries and currency manipulation would be a preeminent part of every deal because that\u2019s the chief weapon that other countries\u2014particularly China and Japan\u2014use to take away our businesses and our jobs,\u201d Trump said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump: Obama's free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal Is 'Insanity'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump: Obama's free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal Is 'Insanity'", "title": "Trump: Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal Is 'Insanity'", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-493142634.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/09/exclusive-donald-trump-obamas-trans-pacific-free-trade-deal-insanity/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump: Obama's free-trade Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal Is 'Insanity'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-493142634.jpg", "title": "Trump: Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership Deal Is 'Insanity'", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, Obamatrade, TPP, Trade Promotion Authority, Trans Pacific Partnership,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Cronyism,free-trade", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Trans Pacific Partnership", "published_time": "2015-11-09T12:41:25-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Cronyism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ea8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe deal is so bad because of the fact they don\u2019t cover currency manipulation,\u201d Trump added.\nChina is not part of the TPP deal, but is widely expected to join in the next few years.\n\u201cThat deal should not be supported and it should not be allowed to happen.\u201dThe 5,544-page deal is far too long to be understood, said Trump.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERGOP frontrunner Donald Trump lambasted the permanent political class for supporting the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal, in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News ahead of the next debate.\nHowever, Rubio also provided the critical 60th vote for Obamatrade\u2019s Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which greases the skids for an congressional approval of the trade deal."}
