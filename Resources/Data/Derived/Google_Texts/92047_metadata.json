Hennessey with the intention of executing mergers, capital stock exchanges, asset acquisitions, stock purchases and reorganizations with one or more companies.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the USI\u2019s established presence in high-growth construction markets when combined with strategic acquisitions will lead to sustained revenue growth and profitability for our stockholders,\u201d says Hennessy in the firm\u2019s statement. Once combined, the company will be rebranded as USI Holdings, led by current USI President Bill Varner.\n\nHCAC received financial advisement on the deal from UBS Investment Bank, Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., BMO Capital Markets and XMS Capital Partners, and legal advice from Sidley Austin LLP and Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP.

Completion of the merger is expected during the third quarter of 2016.\n\nGrowth in the homebuilding market is likely to increase in tandem with sales, making for attractive targets in the sector.
