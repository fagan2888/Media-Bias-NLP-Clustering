Political director Lisa Desjardins takes a look at the big issues that came up in the debate and where the candidates stand.\n\nTo weigh in on how the candidates fared, Judy spoke with NPR\u2019s Tamara Keith and USA Today\u2019s Susan Page, sitting in for Amy Walter.\n\nTamara says both Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders were able to frame themselves the way they want the democratic voters to see them. But Susan says Sanders was able to challenge Clinton on Wall Street and Clinton effectively attacked Sanders on gun control.\n\nFor all that and more on the race for the top republican spot between Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, watch Politics Monday, above.\n\nRead the full transcript of this segment below:\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: But, first, two weeks from tonight, voters in Iowa will gather to caucus and cast the first votes in the race for president.\n\nLast night, the Democratic candidates debated one last time before voting.\n\nNewsHour political director Lisa Desjardins reports how the tightening race sparked the Democrats\u2019 most tense debate yet.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: The three Democratic candidates entered the stage, and a debate, with substance and swipes, both.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, Democratic Presidential Candidate: This should not be a political issue.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: The first topic, guns, was close to home for the Charleston, South Carolina, crowd, where nine black churchgoers were killed by a white gunman in June.\n\nNBC\u2019s Lester Holt asked Bernie Sanders about his 2005 vote to protect gun makers and gun sellers from lawsuits. Sanders replied he was now for a bill that would roll back some of those protections.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: What we also said, is a small mom and pop gun shop who sells a gun legally to somebody should not be held liable if somebody does something terrible with that gun.\n\nSo what I said is, I would re-look at it. We are going to re-look at it and I will support stronger provisions.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Hillary Clinton pounced at the chance to be to the left of Sanders.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, Democratic Presidential Candidate: He has voted with the NRA, with the gun lobby numerous times. He voted against the Brady Bill five times. He voted for what we call the Charleston loophole. He voted for immunity from gun makers and sellers.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Third on stage, and a distant third in the polls, Martin O\u2019Malley hit at both rivals.\n\nFORMER GOV. MARTIN O\u2019MALLEY, Democratic Presidential Candidate: they\u2019ve both been inconsistent when it comes to this issue.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY: I\u2019m the one candidate on this stage that actually brought people together to pass comprehensive gun safety legislation.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Another clash came on health care. Clinton said political reality makes another health care overhaul impossible right now, and, instead, President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act must be protected.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: There are things we can do to improve it, but to tear it up and start over again, pushing our country back into that kind of a contentious debate, I think, is the wrong direction.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: But Sanders insisted the U.S. should strive to cover everyone.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: No one is tearing this up. We\u2019re going to go forward. But with the secretary neglected to mention, not just the 29 million still have no health insurance, that even more are underinsured with huge co-payments and deductibles.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: The volleying came hours after Sanders released this, an outline of his Medicare-for-all plan. Sanders would replace the current system, private insurers, with a single government-run system. The price tag, $1.4 trillion a year, his campaign says.\n\nSanders would pay for that a few ways: Employers and most taxpayers would each pay a percentage of income as a kind of premium. But the biggest chunk comes from a sweeping income tax change. Sanders would raise rates for those making over $250,000. They\u2019d rise to a 52 percent income tax for the very top, multimillionaires.\n\nThat touched off a dispute over whether the middle class would come out ahead or behind from the plan.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: I\u2019m the only candidate standing here tonight who has said I will not raise taxes on the middle class.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS: It\u2019s one thing to say I\u2019m raising taxes. It\u2019s another thing to say that we are doing away with private health insurance premiums.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: With each exchange, the candidates were fighting to define themselves and each other. Sanders pushed his anti-Wall Street message and Clinton\u2019s donations from banks.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: It\u2019s easy to say, well, I\u2019m going to do this and do that, but I have doubts when people receive huge amounts of money from Wall Street.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: In her defense, and through the night, Clinton clung to President Obama more than ever.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: He\u2019s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street, and President Obama has led our country out of the great recession. Senator Sanders called him weak, disappointing.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: The candidates did talk foreign policy, but the real divides were domestic and sharper than seen before, a sign of a tightening race, with voting in Iowa just two weeks away.\n\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m Lisa Desjardins.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: With more on last night\u2019s debate and the race among the Republican candidates, for Politics Monday, we turn to Tamara Keith of NPR, and, filling in for Amy Walter, Susan Page of USA Today.\n\nWelcome to you both.\n\nTAMARA KEITH, NPR: Thank you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, they didn\u2019t hold back, Tamara. Did either one of them land any lasting blows?\n\nTAMARA KEITH: I think that they both came out and they defined themselves the way that they wanted to be defined, which is Hillary Clinton came out, and she really was the pragmatic one, the one who said, you know, I have fought this fight, and this is going to be tough, and tried to paint Senator Sanders of idealistic and out of touch.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Sanders did a pretty good job of painting her as willing to settle for less, and why should the U.S. do what it\u2019s done before and sort of settle for what the Washington establishment says is possible?\n\nI think they both came out and they were themselves.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Susan?\n\nSUSAN PAGE, USA Today: Such a different tone from the previous three debates.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Really different.\n\nSUSAN PAGE: Remember that first debate, when Bernie Sanders said, \u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of hearing about your damn e-mails,\u201d and they shook hands and everybody smiled?\n\nDays of smiling with each other were over, two weeks until the Iowa caucuses, margin of error races in both Iowa and New Hampshire. So you really saw them really fiercely attacking one another in ways that we haven\u2019t even before.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Did you think that anything that was said did real damage?\n\nSUSAN PAGE: Yes, I do. I think that the \u2014 that the \u2014 Bernie Sanders did some damage to Hillary Clinton by saying, I have an idealistic vision for coverage for all, health care coverage for all. That is going to appeal to voters who are in the Democratic \u2014 who vote in Democratic primaries.\n\nAnd I thought Hillary Clinton, by embracing Barack Obama in a way that she hasn\u2019t done before, helped her in states like South Carolina, where Barack Obama has a 90 percent approval rating among Democrats in South Carolina, and raising issues about the criticism that Bernie Sanders has made of Obama in the past.\n\nSo, I think, in that way, both of them did some of the damage they came in intending to do.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Why, Tamara, didn\u2019t we see this earlier?\n\nAnd I ask because there was a \u2014 I think a New York Times story over the weekend that said there are some in the Clinton camp who think maybe they should have gone after Sanders earlier.\n\nTAMARA KEITH: And it\u2019s not clear to me that those people are really inside the Clinton campaign, as much as maybe friends of the Clintons or people in the orbit.\n\nThis was inevitable. This race has gotten closer. And, also, people are paying attention now. I went to a bunch of events in Iowa last week. And every voter I met said, oh, this is the first campaign event I\u2019m going to this cycle. People are paying attention now and the candidates are making their closing arguments.\n\nAnd it can\u2019t be all hugs and kumbaya at the very end. They need to define themselves. An interesting question for Bernie Sanders is, does defining himself, does trying to define Hillary Clinton make him seem more like a politician? People expect Hillary Clinton to be like a politician. It\u2019s not as clear that people expect Bernie Sanders to do the politician thing.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, how much is Hillary Clinton being pulled to the left by Sanders, who, as we need remind no one, has called himself a Democratic socialist?\n\nSUSAN PAGE: You know, I don\u2019t know if Bernie Sanders will get the nomination or not, will win the war, but \u2014 will win the battle, but he\u2019s won the war.\n\nHillary Clinton already has been pulled significantly to the left on a whole series of issues, including \u2014 including saying she wants to change the health care system, even though she hasn\u2019t really laid out any details on how she wants to improve and build on Obamacare.\n\nOn other issues well, she\u2019s including income inequality and treatment of Wall Street. We have seen her pulled to the left because of this challenge from Bernie Sanders.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Let\u2019s talk for a few minutes about the Republicans.\n\nIf it\u2019s getting tougher, Tamara, on the Democratic side, it\u2019s clearly getting tougher on the Republican side between these two front-runners, at least in Iowa, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. In that case, is it the same dynamic at work, that we\u2019re getting close to voting and it\u2019s just getting nasty as a result?\n\nTAMARA KEITH: We are getting close to voting.\n\nAnd Ted Cruz had said he had sort of predicted this, that he was going to hug Donald Trump until he didn\u2019t anymore. Donald Trump has not fallen as Ted Cruz sort of expected him to. And so he\u2019s starting to go on the attack and say, hey, look, Donald Trump isn\u2019t a real conservative. He used to be a Democrat.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump, whenever someone is on his heels, turns around and begins attacking. So, this is not a surprise. One interesting thing today that sort of gives a sense of the state of the race, Donald Trump was at Liberty University, the evangelical university, giving a speech, and Ted Cruz is now in New Hampshire, where Donald Trump has a solid lead, on a 17-stop bus tour.\n\nSo, they are going \u2014 going for each other\u2019s strengths there.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What \u2014 Susan, how do you see this race between the two of them? Is it really between the \u2014 is it down to the two of them now?\n\nSUSAN PAGE: Well, it\u2019s down to the two of them to be the front-runner. And who would have thought six months ago, when these people were announcing, that we would get two weeks before the Iowa caucuses and the two leading candidates nationwide and in the first two states would be Donald Trump and Ted Cruz? I don\u2019t think any of us would have predicted that.\n\nIt just shows how remarkable this race has been. There\u2019s a battle between the two of them to be the outsider candidate who has \u2014 that have been leading the field from the start. There is a second race going on to be the surviving establishment figure, whether it\u2019s John Kasich or Chris Christie or Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio, to be the alternative once that battle is won.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: That separate lane.\n\nBut are the \u2014 do issues matter at this point, Tamara? Are voters \u2014 and you have been talking to voters in Iowa. I mean, are they asking about the candidates\u2019 positions, or is it who do they like?\n\nTAMARA KEITH: I still think that it\u2019s \u2014 so much of politics comes down to who do you like and who would you like to have a beer with some day.\n\nThere\u2019s certainly an element of that. I think that issues matter too. But I think that there may not be a really strong cry for details and specifics. It is not clear yet, but it sure seems like this could be a passion election.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, we hear, we read, we understand that Ted Cruz has a pretty good campaign organization in Iowa. How much does that matter in the final\u2026\n\nSUSAN PAGE: It could really deliver for him in Iowa, because Donald Trump has tried to build an organization, but Ted Cruz has the traditional Iowa organization that can turn people out.\n\nBut I would just say, look at what hasn\u2019t mattered this year. Money hasn\u2019t mattered, or Jeb Bush would be leading. I don\u2019t think that issues have mattered so much. It\u2019s really been, who can channel my anger? Who can shake things up, especially on the Republican side?\n\nSo, it may be a year in which organization matters less. We\u2019re just going to have to find out in two weeks.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And are we seeing, just quickly, Tamara, New Hampshire waiting to see what Iowa does, or is New Hampshire already making up its mind?\n\nTAMARA KEITH: I don\u2019t think New Hampshire would ever say that they are waiting to see what Iowa does.\n\nYou know, there is, like, a real intense campaign happening there, just as there is in Iowa, and especially in the establishment lane on the Republican side.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it doesn\u2019t get any more exciting than this.\n\nBut it will be even more exciting next week.
