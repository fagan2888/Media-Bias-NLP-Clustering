A two-vehicle accident in the West Ridge Mall parking lot, where one of the cars was T-boned, sent a man to a local hospital on a stretcher with unknown minor injuries, an official with the Topeka Police Department said.

The accident — which brought about eight emergency vehicles — happened around 6 p.m. on the north side of the mall in front of Sears.

Sgt. Jay Junghans said a tan Chrysler Sebring was northbound in the lot and a red Pontiac Grand Prix was westbound when the Sebring struck the Grand Prix on the driver’s side door, injuring the male driver, age unknown.

The man was taken by AMR to local hospital.

The Sebring suffered minor front-end damage, while the front axle on the driver’s side of the Grand Prix was disabled.
