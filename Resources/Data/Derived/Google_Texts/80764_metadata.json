Russ Feingold, who lost his Senate seat to Ron Johnson during a Republican wave that year, has a healthy lead in the polls ahead of a in a rematch in November. The president\u2019s approval rating is the highest it\u2019s ever been in the state, while Republican Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s numbers are underwater and haven\u2019t recovered since his presidential campaign flamed out late last year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd despite attempts by Walker \u2014 once seen as a giant-slayer after overcoming a union-backed recall effort in 2012 \u2014 to undermine Obamacare in the state, it's posting robust enrollment numbers. Milwaukee beat out 19 other cities in a White House contest meant to spur coverage for the uninsured, and that objective measure was the official reason for Obama\u2019s visit. But a White House official admitted that debates over the health law are inherently political, and Walker has been a top antagonist.\n\nObama was all too happy to rub the law's success in Walker's face.\n\n\u201cBy the way, Milwaukee, while you worked your tails off to cover enough folks to fill Lambeau field, your governor still refuses to expand Medicaid in this state,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe\u2019s denying Wisconsinites their ticket to health insurance, and it\u2019s political.\u201d\n\nHe went after Johnson, too: \"Your senior senator won\u2019t tell you that if he gets his way and repeals Obamacare, millions of working families would see their premiums spike.\"\n\nDemocrats in the state say Obama\u2019s visit would boost their efforts to draw a sharp contrast with Walker, Johnson and the Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\nThe \u201cdivision and the fear that is being injected into society, it may be exciting for sound bites,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Melissa Sargent in an interview. Sargent wrote a column published Monday arguing that Walker\u2019s rhetoric, including his refusal to say whether Obama is a Christian, helped create Trump, even though he dropped out in hopes that conservatives would unite against the loudmouthed billionaire.\n\nWalker\u2019s administration has worked to block Obama\u2019s agenda, whether by refusing to take federal dollars to expand Medicaid or suing to stop the president\u2019s new power plant regulations.\n\nRepublicans are perfectly happy to exploit that record, and they\u2019re still confident that running on the health law is a loser\u2019s move in the state, six years after it passed.\n\nJohnson\u2019s campaign, which still refers to Feingold as the \u201cdeciding vote\u201d for the health law, cast Obama\u2019s visit as \u201ca stark reminder of Senator Feingold\u2019s partisan record on Obamacare,\u201d and Republican state Senator Leah Vukmir, seen as a rising star in the party, hit the talk radio airwaves ahead of the president\u2019s visit on Thursday morning to trash his \u201cObamacare love fest.\u201d That was on top of an email from Freedom Partners blasting the law for causing \u201csurging deductibles\u201d in Wisconsin and 40 other states.\n\nBack before anyone took Trump\u2019s candidacy seriously \u2014 back when Walker was No. 1 in the Iowa polls \u2014 the union-busting, budget-cutting brawler seemed like the ultimate anathema to Obama\u2019s presidency; in fact he remains one of the only Republicans to have put out a plan to not just repeal but also replace Obamacare. (Trump released his own plan Wednesday night.)\n\nObama hasn't been subtle about taking Walker on. In July, he traveled to Wisconsin to unveil a labor-pleasing overtime rule, while mocking the state for having more unemployment than its blue neighbor, Minnesota. The White House also took the rare step of releasing a critical statement when Walker signed a right-to-work law in March and called Walker\u2019s criticism of the Iran negotiations \u201cfoolish.\u201d\n\nNow Obama\u2019s back again, while Walker\u2019s poll numbers are in the dumps. According to a Marquette Law School poll last month, 52 percent of Wisconsinites approve of Obama\u2019s performance, with a record margin. That same poll showed Walker with 39 percent approval, with 55 percent disapproving of his performance. That\u2019s actually a slight improvement over previous months; his approval rating hasn\u2019t cracked 40 percent since he dropped out of the race in September.\n\nIt\u2019s a mistake to rule out Walker in the Badger State, local Republicans say, pointing to his political history, and they\u2019re confident that his popularity will come back as he ramps up efforts to reconnect. Johnson has shown zero reluctance to campaign with the governor, and on Monday, they held a joint press conference where Walker praised Johnson for \u201ctaking on the oversize problems that we\u2019ve seen with Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike Pres. Obama, @ScottWalker & @RonJohnsonWI understand that ObamaCare is wrong for Wisconsin. RT if you agree!\u201d the State GOP tweeted on Thursday.\n\nFeingold, meanwhile, is trying to thread the needle in how he positions himself in relation to Obama. On Thursday, he campaigned on the other side of the state from Milwaukee, near Minneapolis, and his theme this week emphasizes one of his biggest differences with Obama: Feingold opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nFeingold, who has long worked to cultivate a maverick image, would welcome Obama on the stump in Wisconsin in the fall, a campaign official said.\n\nBut now, as the Obama administration finishes crunching the numbers on his final insurance enrollment season, the president\u2019s Milwaukee speech \u2014 one of his last major reflections on the health law \u2014 shows his fresh confidence that Democrats can feel good about it.\n\nObama announced that 20 million people are now covered under Obamacare, raising the stakes for repeal efforts.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that real people are actually getting insurance,\u201d Obama said.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t have Obamacare plans, \u201cYour insurance is better than it was,\" he said, \u201cEven if you didn\u2019t know it. Even if you didn\u2019t vote for me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThanks, Obama,\" he deadpanned, smirking as the crowd cheered. \"It's ok.\"\n\nThe majority aren't saying thanks yet, according to surveys. Only four in 10 Americans hold a favorable view of the law, according to February\u2019s Kaiser Health Tracking poll. But the law\u2019s backers say Milwaukee is evidence that people are voting by enrolling. Democratic Mayor Tom Barrett \u2014 who lost the governors race to Walker in 2010 and the 2012 recall \u2014 led an effort that signed up 75 new customers for every 100 eligible uninsured people in the city.\n\nAnd Democrats working on Senate races both at the national level and in Wisconsin say candidates increasingly feel comfortable celebrating Obamacare\u2019s successes. If anything, Feingold has run on going even further.\n\n\u201cIn fact, [Sen. Bernie Sanders] and I were holding out for an even stronger bill on the Affordable Care Act. We wanted a single-payer,\u201d Feingold said in January. \u201cWe wanted an option, an option to opt in, a public option.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment, but he spoke for himself on Thursday \u2014 on Obama\u2019s turf. Citing his record of defunding Planned Parenthood, enacting a voter ID requirement, and passing a concealed carry law, Walker urged on conservatives at the CPAC conference just outside Washington.\n\n\u201cConservative, positive reforms actually work. How do we do it?\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe did it like other states did it. We got government out of the way.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The president hails Obamacare's success in Milwaukee, as he thumbs his nose at Walker and his fellow Republicans.", "title": "Obama revels in redemption on Walker's turf", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/barack-obama-milwaukee-visit-obamacare-220193", "image": "http://static.politico.com/60/12/b256d84f462c8b136a086937e532/160303-barack-obama-2-gty-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The president hails Obamacare's success in Milwaukee, as he thumbs his nose at Walker and his fellow Republicans.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| Getty Obama revels in redemption on Walker's turf The president hails Obamacare's success in Milwaukee, as he thumbs his nose at Walker and his fellow Republicans.\nPresident Barack Obama speaks about the Affordable Care Act at the United Community Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on March 3, 2016.\nBut a White House official admitted that debates over the health law are inherently political, and Walker has been a top antagonist.\nObama was all too happy to rub the law's success in Walker's face.\nCiting his record of defunding Planned Parenthood, enacting a voter ID requirement, and passing a concealed carry law, Walker urged on conservatives at the CPAC conference just outside Washington."}
