Michigan health officials are still talking to state lawmakers about approving a $25 million Medicaid waiver benefiting children and pregnant women, which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service already approved in early March.

Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon told a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee Wednesday that he and other officials are still negotiating with state lawmakers, but that he’s optimistic that they’ll sign off on the waiver.

Lyon said the delay was caused partly by opposition from some lawmakers, but also by a sense that this could be done in a normal state budget bill, until state officials urged them to hurry.

“The state legislature has not put up its share because it’s a state-federal partnership?” Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.) asked.

“That’s basically correct,” Lyon said. “What I would say is we have to have the authorization in the funding to do this, and we go through a budget process every single year and that takes some time. So I think there was a bit of an inkling that this could be done as a regular part of the budget and we’ve asked that they take a quicker look at this.”

Lyon added that he expects the legislature to sign off within the next few months, and that lawmakers have mostly been receptive.

“I think we’ll hear quickly,” Lyon said. “We’ve been having conversations at very high levels with leadership, and I’ve been over discussing with them, and they understand the importance of doing it.”
