Jones\u2019s clients were financially harmed because of the breach, the agency chose to take action anyway as part of its burgeoning efforts to pressure companies to tighten their cybersecurity.\n\n\u201cAs we see an increasing barrage of cyberattacks on financial firms, it is important to enforce the safeguards rule even in cases like this when there is no apparent financial harm to clients,\u201d said Marshall Sprung, co-chief of the SEC Enforcement Division\u2019s Asset Management Unit.\n\nR.T. Jones agreed to pay a $75,000 penalty as part of the settlement.\n\nIn addition to enforcement actions, the SEC is also considering requirements that would force companies to reveal more information about their cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cFirms must adopt written policies to protect their clients\u2019 private information and they need to anticipate potential cybersecurity events and have clear procedures in place rather than waiting to react once a breach occurs,\" Sprung said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The enforcement action is part of the SEC's increasing cybersecurity oversight.", "description": "The enforcement action is part of the SEC's increasing cybersecurity oversight.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The enforcement action is part of the SEC's increasing cybersecurity oversight.", "title": "SEC goes after investment adviser for poor cybersecurity", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/254554-sec-goes-after-investment-firm-for-poor-cybersecurity", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/online_hacker_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/254554-sec-goes-after-investment-firm-for-poor-cybersecurity", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-22T16:33-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "cybersecurity,,SEC", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-22T16:33:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/254554-sec-goes-after-investment-firm-for-poor-cybersecurity", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The enforcement action is part of the SEC's increasing cybersecurity oversight.", "card": "summary", "title": "SEC goes after investment adviser for poor cybersecurity"}, "dcterms.title": "SEC goes after investment adviser for poor cybersecurity"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd420c\"", "article_summary": "The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled charges Tuesday with an investment adviser that allegedly failed to properly protect its clients\u2019 data in what might be a first-of-its-kind enforcement action.\nR.T.
