They don\u2019t know why she\u2019s going downhill so fast.\u201d\n\nMy father couldn\u2019t have called at a more depressing time. I was watching my impractical dream of being a writer turn to dust: I was in Minnesota trying to salvage the novel on which I had worked for five years. I had just lost my big time New York agent. She kept the book for a year, then told me, \u201cPublishers are wary of taking a book from a white author that has so many black story lines. Now if you change your name to Fannie Lou Hamer, I could sell it in five minutes.\u201d\n\nThe news had thrown me back into my father\u2019s \u201cfactory mentality.\u201d He once asked how much I would make per word as a writer. I didn\u2019t have the heart to calculate the price per word, but I figured that my unpublished novel had cost me over $2 million so far in lost revenue from my former business. All told, it would probably have covered the cost of buying enough copies to make it into a bestseller.\n\nBefore Dad\u2019s call, I knew that Mom had gone in for an operation for her back, but now he told me that her lungs were filling with fluid. Something may have gone wrong with the anesthesia. \u201cYou know how weak her lungs are.\u201d\n\nWhat I wanted to say was, \u201cI bet living 50 years in close quarters with a chain smoker couldn\u2019t have helped much.\u201d But I didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cSounds like I should come down.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s up to you. Come if you want to.\u201d\n\nNot You need to be here, or Your mother needs you here, or, for God\u2019s sake not, I need you here. My father and I routinely communicate like poker players, keeping our hearts as close as our cards.\n\n\u201cDo you think I should come down?\u201d I asked, trying to force him to say it, that he needed me there.\n\n\u201cDo you have the time?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe\u2019ll understand if you\u2019re too busy.\u201d The sad thing was, he wasn\u2019t being sarcastic. Work obligations always trump family.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t have anything scheduled that can\u2019t be moved.\u201d I didn\u2019t have anything scheduled for the next 40 years, but I wasn\u2019t telling him that.\n\n\u201cWell, come if you think you should,\u201d he said, but quickly added, \u201cbut I don\u2019t want to tell you to come down and then have her get well by the time you get here. I just don\u2019t want to tell you one way or the other. You have to decide.\u201d He refused to sway me. He wouldn\u2019t have it on his hands.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll catch the next flight,\u201d I said, making the choice that both of us knew I would all along.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure your mother will appreciate it, whichever way it goes.\u201d\n\nI hung up, feeling like I had just gotten off a conference call with a lawyer. It was easier to approach the situation as a scheduling issue rather than as a trip that could be my last chance to see my mother alive.\n\nWhen I arrived at Forrest County General, my younger brother and my father were in the waiting room. That morning, when the attendants came to my mother\u2019s room to take her for X-rays, they found her sprawled unconscious on the floor. She had somehow managed to get out of bed and fallen. When my brother asked her why she hadn\u2019t buzzed for assistance, all she would say was that she wanted \u201cto fix her face.\u201d She had been trying to get to her makeup kit. They figured she must have been delirious.\n\nAfter shaking hands with my father, I took a chair close by and carefully observed him. Before you engage with my father, it\u2019s wise to calibrate his mood, which could range from mildly controlling to tyrannically oppressive. Yet, tonight, something was different. My father had always been in charge, but here in the waiting room he was as close to passive as I had ever seen him. For one of the first times in his adult life, he was watching everything with keen interest, but not exerting authority over any of it. My brother David had assumed the lead role, and next to him, my father seemed small and submissive.\n\nDad politely asked the nurse if we could go into my mother\u2019s room. The nurse brushed him off, somewhat heartlessly I thought. I held my breath, waiting for Dad to shame her out of the helping profession. He acquiesced. But my brother took off after the nurse and told her, not asked her, that we were going to see Mother now.\n\nMom had lost a lot of weight and appeared frail, as if she would snap in my arms if I hugged her. She was breathing oxygen through a tube in her nose. Her hair, always kept perfectly in place, was flat in spots and tangled in others. Her lips were dry and chapped. There was a lot of purple bruising on her arm where she had fallen. She was only semi-conscious, but still she recognized me.\n\n\u201cJohnny,\u201d she said, brightening a bit. She lifted her hand for a moment before letting it drop again to the bed.\n\nI held her hand and kissed her damp forehead. \u201cHello, Momma. They say you\u2019ve had a pretty rough time of it.\u201d\n\nShe shook her head, then a frown crossed her face. \u201cThere was something I wanted to tell you,\u201d she said. \u201cI forgot what.\u201d Speaking was hard for her.\n\n\u201cIt can wait,\u201d I said. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time. I\u2019m staying till you get well.\u201d\n\nAgain she shook her head as if frustrated by the sluggishness of her thoughts. \u201cOh! I know!\u201d she said in a rushed whisper.\n\nI looked into her washed out eyes. They were the weakest shade of blue I could ever remember them being, like the last remnant of morning sky, just before being bleached out by the heat of the day.\n\n\u201cJohnny, when you go to the house tonight, bring back the sack that\u2019s under my bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in the sack, Momma?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see. I want you to have something that I made myself. But it\u2019s not finished, so don\u2019t look. I want it with me. I don\u2019t want it to get lost.\u201d\n\nI promised her that I would. She seemed satisfied and closed her eyes.\n\n* * *\n\nBack at the house, Dad and I sat out on the porch. It was late. He pulled out a cigarette and lit it. I noticed he had switched from Salem to a tiny brown cigar. The smell, even outside, was awful, but he claimed he smoked less.\n\n\u201cHow do you think she looks?\u201d he asked. If this were anyone but my father, I would have sworn he was asking for reassurance.\n\nI told him the truth. \u201cShe looks bad. Real bad.\u201d\n\nHe grimaced as if I had intentionally tried to hurt him.\n\n\u201cHow do you think she looks, Dad?\u201d\n\nHe was no longer facing me. \u201cI thought maybe she looked a little better,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course you haven\u2019t been here. Probably hard for you to tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I guess that\u2019s it.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to burst his bubble. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the sack under the bed? Was that the drugs talking?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. She said she wanted to leave you something you could remember her by. She\u2019s been embroidering you a tablecloth. Been on it for over a year. Napkins, too. She\u2019s nearly done. Don\u2019t tell her I told you.\u201d\n\nMy mother now has severe arthritis in the fingers of both hands. There passed a long silence between my father and me.\n\nIt occurred to me that I much preferred sitting in silence with my father than speaking with him. I felt closer to him when I wasn\u2019t struggling to decide what a normal son might say to a normal father. I liked it best when no words were expected. Together we looked into the clear night sky. The stars were bright pinpoints.\n\nAfter a long while I finally spoke it aloud even though I knew I shouldn\u2019t. It broke the rules. \u201cI don\u2019t want her to die, Daddy. I\u2019m scared she might.\u201d\n\nDad jerked up in his chair and shot me a startled look. \u201cYou can\u2019t let yourself think like that, son. No sense in getting emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to help.\u201d\n\nHis eyes glistened in the dim porch light. \u201cBut Dad,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s you that\u2019s crying. Don\u2019t you even know it?\u201d\n\nHe reached up and touched his face. No, he hadn\u2019t, and it seemed to scare the hell out of him. He awkwardly said goodnight and went to bed.\n\nI sat up for a while in the den. All was quiet, except for the steady ticking of a clock somewhere in the room. The den, like the rest of the house, was decorated with Mom\u2019s arts and crafts projects. She lived to clip articles out of Redbook or McCall\u2019s or Good Housekeeping on how to make some god-awful decorative piece that she could proudly display. On the coffee table sat a 2-foot-high pyramid made of a dozen Styrofoam balls. The surface of each ball was completely covered with row after row of lima beans, glued on and then spray-painted gold. I was being watched over by half a dozen angels on the mantel made from handkerchiefs stuffed with cotton balls, shirtsleeve buttons for eyes, supported on stands made of Popsicle sticks. I wondered, if she hadn\u2019t been raised dirt poor and had gotten more than a high school education, would she have become a professional artist? She certainly had the inclination.\n\nMom got a raw deal, I thought to myself. She was the only one in the family who understood my need to write. She had taken the poem I read in high school and had given it a place of honor in the scrapbook. It was then she told me that she had been her high school\u2019s poet as well. \u201cBut I wasn\u2019t any good,\u201d she said, embarrassed. \u201cYou are. You should write if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d It struck me how little her opinion had mattered when I was a teenager and how much it mattered now.\n\nAgain I noticed the ticking of the clock and looked to see that it was 3 a.m. But I\u2019d never seen that particular clock before. Its face seemed to be made out of \u2026 what? A phonograph record? I got up to examine it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When I found out what happened to Mother that hot summer day so long ago, I knew I'd never really know her at all", "title": "\u201cTell me this one, Momma\u201d: Each snapshot revealed something new about who we were", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When I found out what happened to Mother that hot summer day so long ago, I knew I'd never really know her at all", "title": "\u201cTell me this one, Momma\u201d: Each snapshot revealed something new about who we were", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/21/tell_me_this_one_momma_each_snapshot_revealed_something_new_about_who_we_were/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/photo_album.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When I found out what happened to Mother that hot summer day so long ago, I knew I'd never really know her at all", "title": "\u201cTell me this one, Momma\u201d: Each snapshot revealed something new about who we were", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/photo_album.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jonathan Odell", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Family, family stories, Life stories, The Great Depression", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Don\u2019t tell her I told you.\u201dMy mother now has severe arthritis in the fingers of both hands.\n\u201cDo you think I should come down?\u201d I asked, trying to force him to say it, that he needed me there.\nI just don\u2019t want to tell you one way or the other.\nThey don\u2019t know why she\u2019s going downhill so fast.\u201dMy father couldn\u2019t have called at a more depressing time.\nWhen I arrived at Forrest County General, my younger brother and my father were in the waiting room."}
