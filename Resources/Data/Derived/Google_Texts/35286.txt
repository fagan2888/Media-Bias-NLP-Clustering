Eight days before the end of the fiscal year, the Senate Appropriations Committee has fired the first shot in the skirmish that will, hopefully, lead to avoiding the second federal government shutdown in three years. To get around the requirement that spending bills first originate in the House, the Senate employed a common tactic and tacked their draft of a short term Continuing Resolution to a previous House Joint Resolution called the "Hire More Heroes Act of 2015."

The continuing resolution would keep the federal government limping along at fiscal year 2015 levels of funding through December 11, 2015. The bill is relatively rich in detail but I'll focus on the Pentagon spending aspects of the draft resolution. Overall, it conforms to the topline caps established by the Budget Control Act of 2011 â€“ $1.017 trillion for fiscal year 2016. That's a good first step. The measure also explicitly rejects the Pentagon's request (actually, the Defense Department documents called it a "requirement") that they be given blanket authority to start new programs, enter into multi-year contracts and increase production rates on existing programs. These additional authorities would defy the purpose of a Continuing Resolution, which specifically prohibits such actions and is meant to only "continue" existing programs at the previous fiscal year's funding level. But the Pentagon likes to think it's special. And, unfortunately, during more than a decade at war, the Congress has allowed the military services to fall into lazy practices where accountability disappears and more spending is always better. So saying "no" to such requests was sensible.
