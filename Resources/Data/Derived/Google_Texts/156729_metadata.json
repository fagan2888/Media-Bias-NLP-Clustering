Hope you\u2019re ready for the Airing of Grievances! Our greatest grievance is, of course, that we can only bring Wonkette to you a mere 7 days a week, and worse, on some of those days, you may still miss some of our Wonkings because of things like a \u201cjob,\u201d a \u201cfamily,\u201d or a \u201clife.\u201d Happily, the weekend is a great time to catch up on some of our best stuff, and so we bring you this feature, in which we count down the ten best stories of the week \u2014 or at least most-shared on the Facebooks, which is pretty much the same thing. Don\u2019t see your favorite story here? Maybe your tastes are not in line with those of your peers. Have you considered conformity? Oh, or you could make a point of clicking \u201cshare\u201d a bunch more! That may be an even better way to express your individuality, you exceptional American, you.\n\nAnd so, to our Top Ten:\n\n10: For the first time, a recipe breaks into the top ten! You must really love these date-bacon-blue-cheese-pecan appetizers! And also recipe hub maven Mojopo, whose farewell post this was. She\u2019s got some other \u201cjob,\u201d at which she\u2019s no doubt busy excelling, and Fitzgerald Chesterfield has stepped into the Wonkette Test Kitchen.\n\n9: Rachel Maddow tried to make sense of why Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn would block a bill to prevent suicides by veterans. Could be he\u2019s just a dick that way.\n\n8: The War on Hanukkah continued with a Massachusetts city councilor explaining, at a menorah lighting, how Hanukkah is all about Jesus.\n\n7: A San Jose policeman let the world know that he\u2019s very fond of his power to kill, for anyone who might think that their life matters.\n\n6: More Hanukkah gaiety, as Rick Perry issued an important message about how the Maccabees were just exactly like the patriots at the Boston Tea Party, proving he\u2019s serious about becoming historian in chief.\n\n5: Tennessee finally decided to join the Affordable Care Act\u2019s expansion of Medicaid coverage, just as long as they didn\u2019t have to give any credit to Barack Obama for it.\n\n4: After cops shot a man to death for carrying a BB gun that he\u2019d picked up from a shelf in Walmart, an Ohio supercop grilled the victim\u2019s girlfriend, because she had to be guilty of something.\n\n3: Rachel Maddow introduced us to the parents who got Congress to increase help for prevention of suicide by veterans\u2026 and to Tom Coburn, the senator who thinks preventing suicide is a little too pricey.\n\n2: It turns out that Fox News\u2019s favorite witness in the Darren Wilson grand jury was almost certainly nowhere near the shooting of Michael Brown. Lying doesn\u2019t make her a bad witness, does it?\n\n1: In a pleasant surprise for fans of functional government, the Senate finally confirmed Surgeon General nominee Vivek Murthy, even though medical experts at the NRA didn\u2019t approve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Happy Festivus weekend, Wonkers!
