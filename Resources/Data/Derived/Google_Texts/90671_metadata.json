The killing of unarmed residents. The killing of cops. Disputes between New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and rank-and-file officers over issues of respect. And yet, a policing issue that totally consumed and divided New York and the nation in recent years now garners little mention: the NYPD\u2019s stop-and-frisk policy.\n\nOne big reason, of course, is that the tactic is used much less now. But another is that, while few have announced it, the debate over the once hotly divisive practice is effectively over. As new data this week confirmed, when it comes to whether a city can reduce crime without stopping-and-frisking enormous numbers of its residents of color, one side was right and one was wrong.\n\nFirst, some background. It\u2019s hard to overstate how inescapable this debate was during the last decade (and as recently as a year or two ago). For years, the rampant police practice of stopping mostly young black and Latino men and frisking them, if cops detected \u201cfurtive\u201d movements, was a constant point of division, with many whites approving and people of color overwhelmingly disapproving.\n\nProponents argued that the city had seen record decreases in crime under Mayor Michael Bloomberg and NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly (this was true), and that to let up on the tactic would all but guarantee throwing these improvements away. This was repeated not only by the mayor and his administration, but the city\u2019s tabloids, with the Daily News and New York Post ominously warning that anyone questioning the policy\u2019s aggressive implementation would usher in the \u201cbad old days\u201d when crime ravaged the city in the 1970s and 1980s. Their message was not only absolute but impressively manipulative: when crime was down, they\u2019d argue, it was because of the prevalence of stop-and-frisk \u2014 and if crime ticked up at times, it made the tactic\u2019s frequent deployment all the more imperative.\n\nThe policy had plenty of critics, of course; among them the ACLU, civil rights leaders and communities of color who considered its application a deplorable invasion of privacy (and dignity), racially targeted and responsible for fraying police-community relations. As I noted in 2012:\n\nNew Yorkers strongly support the performance of police commissioner Ray Kelly (68-23) and that of the NYPD as a whole (62-31), but sharply oppose stop-and-frisk tactics (by 53-42) that have mostly targeted black and Hispanic men. This dichotomy indicates that the disapproval of stop-and-frisk is not merely a proxy or byproduct of blind hatred toward (or even dissatisfaction with) the police department, but rather, a stand-alone concern about which there is very real discontent.\n\nA few years back, I sat on a working group in the New York Attorney General\u2019s Office to look at the practice, specifically its implementation and efficacy. The group found that in one year, 2011, there were more stops of young black men in the city than there were actual young black men \u2014 meaning that on average, every single young black man in the city had been stopped by cops that year. As the NYCLU put it:\n\nThe number of stops of young black men exceeded the entire city population of young black men (168,126 as compared to 158,406). Ninety percent of young black and Latino men stopped were innocent.\n\nBy \u201cinnocent,\u201d they meant that those stops did not lead to an arrest. Indeed, our working group found that if you took all the stops in the city and tracked what happened to those interactions, roughly 1 in 9 ever led to an arrest, and of those that did, a far smaller number resulted in actual convictions \u2014 suggesting the number of stops, which approached 700,000 in 2011, was excessive.\n\nStill, proponents dismissed concerns about racial disparities or civil liberties, focusing instead on the policy\u2019s purported effectiveness in reducing crime. Even if the high number of stops rarely resulted in arrests or convictions, they argued, they were creating a deterrent effect on the city that could not be measured. Their advantage in the debate was that they could propound their claim but no one could ever disprove it, because the mayor and his administration were determined to keep the practice in place. So any counter-arguments would be merely hypothetical.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYPD's aggressive \"stop & frisk\" policy divided a city into two camps.
