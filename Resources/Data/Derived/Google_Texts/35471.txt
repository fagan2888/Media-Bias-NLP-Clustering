HOWELL - An Edison woman and Asbury Park man were arrested on Friday after police found them with their one-year-old daughter and 400 bags of heroin in their possession.

According to a post from the Howell police Facebook page, the child's mother, 21-year-old Edison resident Queenarabia Suggs, and 24-year-old Asbury park resident Keith Foster were charged with possession and distribution of suspected heroin, along with a second degree count of endangering the welfare of a child.

The child was turned over to a relative, police said.

Suggs and Foster were transported to Monmouth County Correctional Institute in Freehold in lieu of $205,000 bail.

"Two complete losers were apprehended. Their conduct is inexcusable," the Facebook post states, purportedly signed by Howell police Chief Andrew Kudrick. "The accolades are somewhat suppressed by the sadness of the infant involvement."
