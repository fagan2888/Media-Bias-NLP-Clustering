Students graduate and then zig-zag through (unpaid and paid) internships, limited-term apprenticeship positions, part-time work, contract work, graduate-school programs, underemployment, and outright unemployment. In 2012, a Pew study found that 24 percent of 18-to-34-year-olds had taken unpaid work to gain the experience they needed; 35 percent said they had entered graduate programs because of the difficulty of finding work. The March 2014 unemployment rate for 20-to-24-year-olds is 12.2 percent, back up to October 2013 rates . And according to recent findings from the New York Fed , 33 percent of all four-year college graduates are working in jobs that don\u2019t require a four-year degree.\n\nAll that said, there\u2019s a reason that a special \"Recent Graduates\" edition of Lean In is coming out today. It has never been more important for young adults beginning their career to lean in\u2014hard. In a tough economy, one in which who you know can determine your employment prospects, the value of Sandberg\u2019s advice about making connections and taking initiative is undeniable.\n\nReading Lean In as an idealistic and unemployed college graduate is an emotional roller coaster. Months into my job search and I had a sad little collection of interviews, rejections, and silence in response to my resume, not to mention the hours I spent wondering what was wrong with me as a job candidate. Needless to say, Sheryl Sandberg\u2019s certainty that anyone could have a successful career, if only they took her advice and leaned in, didn\u2019t help my unemployment doldrums.\n\nThese criticisms are great if you're safely ensconced in the collegiate environment, or if you're a career woman with some modicum of job security. But when I left my safe haven and ventured out into a tepid if not downright frigid job market\u2014and when, after months of soul-sucking unemployment, I got lucky and landed short-term work\u2014my perspective on Sheryl Sandberg softened.\n\nNor, I felt, does Lean In require any meaningful restructuring from the professional working world, other than that it accommodate an equal division of leadership positions among men and women. When Sandberg does demand change from a system that punishes workers who can't sit at a desk for long daytime hours and that still expects (mostly) women to work a \"second shift\" of parenting and housework when they arrive home, she does it by asking individual women\u2014already the outsiders in the professional world\u2014to carry the burden of the reform. She believes that the best way to achieve professional gender equality is for women to suck it up and learn to rise to the top of the existing system. At its worst, her message calls out women for failing to floor the accelerator of their career. Subtext: Ladies, you\u2019re not trying hard enough.\n\nSheryl Sandberg is an undeniably easy target if you're in the business of raging against the machine. My huffy critique ran something like this: Lean In speaks to and for a very specific group of women\u2014highly educated, skilled professionals, most privileged by their wealth and many by their race. What does it have to offer women of color or lower income women?\n\nA year ago, when Lean In hit book stores and caused the firestorm that happens every time a prominent woman makes some sort of dramatic cultural intervention, Sheryl Sandberg wasn't my girl. I was in my final year of college, embroiled in the exhausting process of thinking radical thoughts and then self-righteously posting them to Facebook. I had no time for career advice, and I was not interested in a tech dynamo telling women to get in the damn driver's seat, already.\n\nIt\u2019s a daunting landscape for any college graduate to survey, and for me as a young woman (granted, one in Sandberg\u2019s target audience\u2014ambitious, financially privileged, and highly educated), it was a confusing one. I knew that the odds of landing a permanent full-time job were slim, which left internships, fellowships, and contract work, one of which I might be able to parlay into the beginnings of a career, although I didn\u2019t know how. Worse, as a young woman, I had an idea of some vague spectre of sexism in the workplace, but I worried that I had very little sense of the practical dynamics of that discrimination, nor any idea of how I might address it as a bottom-of-the-totem-pole intern or entry-level professional. I was unemployed, unhappy, and unsure of what I could do to help myself in the face of economic and cultural forces far beyond my control.\n\nOddly enough, I ended up taking a second look at Sheryl Sandberg, whose neglect of the pervasiveness of racial, socioeconomic, and gender-based social barriers sparked such criticism from my college self (then safely at school on my parents\u2019 dime). Not so (or not so much) anymore: What I needed now, far more than feminist theory, was someone to tell me that I did have the personal strength to respond to the vast, impossibly complex challenges of finding meaningful work in this economy and preparing to navigate the professional world as a young woman. I needed an example of someone who had the audacity to consider the individual, not society, the center of paradigm shifts. I needed a reminder that I owed it to myself to respect the power of my own agency.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to accuse Sheryl Sandberg of not believing in the individual\u2019s ability to create the change that they desire. While it\u2019s frustrating that her bootstraps approach to 21st century feminism isn\u2019t characterized by a more consistent recognition of the breadth of the societal obstacles to women\u2019s rise to the top, I don\u2019t think we should lose sight of her celebration of the potential force of individual effort. It\u2019s something of a conservative impulse, and it\u2019s definitely imperfect, but it did get me out of bed every morning to face another day of unemployment.\n\nI don\u2019t credit Lean In with getting me full-time work; I don\u2019t credit Sandberg with discovering some new frontier in feminism; and I believe that Sandberg\u2019s acknowledgement of structural barriers to professional success\u2014particularly where race and class are concerned\u2014is cursory at best. But, almost a year after my graduation from college, she\u2019s giving me hope that, all social and economic structures to the contrary, I can exercise some control when it comes to my professional life.
