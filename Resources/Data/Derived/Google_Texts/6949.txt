It’s that time of the year again, when legislators, lobbyists and a host of others head to Pueblo for a BBQ kicking off the opening of the Colorado State Fair.

The event often is better attended in election years, when candidates come and mingle with the crowd. Joining this year’s dinner: Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and his Republican challenger, Bob Beauprez. Democratic U.S. Sen. Mark Udall will attend while his Republican challenger, Congressman Cory Gardner, will be in Pueblo Saturday.

Last year’s event featured an interesting twist: then state Sen. Angela Giron and the locals attempting to recall the Pueblo Democrat over her gun votes.

The recall was successful and Republican George Rivera took her seat in the state Senate. He’s expected to be at the BBQ. The Democrat trying to unseat him in November, Rep. Leroy Garcia, confirmed he’s fair bound.
