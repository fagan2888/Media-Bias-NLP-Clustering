How about the debate over NSA surveillance? The way the Federal Reserve affects interest rates?\n\nYou\u2019re far from alone.\n\nAdditional Images This 2012 photo shows Glynn McGehee, an aide of Rep.

Those paying attention \u2013 people who vote regularly, follow news about November\u2019s midterm election, or simply feel a civic duty to stay informed \u2013 are most likely to say that issues have become \u201cmuch more complicated\u201d over the last decade, an Associated Press-GfK poll shows.\n\nWhy are things such a muddle?\n\nKarla Lynn of Lavaca, Arkansas, blames politicians who would rather snipe at each other than honestly explain the nation\u2019s problems in straightforward terms.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll spin everything,\u201d said Lynn, 61, a retired product developer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to wade through so much muck to try to find the truth.\u201d\n\nDavid Stewart blames the deluge from social media, partisan blogs and 24-hour news sites for complicating things. At one time people would only see a news story about a violent group like the Islamic State, he said, but now they watch the militants\u2019 videos of beheadings online.\n\n\u201cPeople get a little overwhelmed by all the information about what\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d said Stewart, 40, a salesman at a home improvement store in Georgetown, Kentucky. The father of three said it takes time from an already busy life to go online and sort out \u201cwhat\u2019s fluff, what\u2019s been engineered, and what\u2019s actually true and believable.\u201d\n\nThe issue that stumps Stewart most? President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul. It can sound like a tragedy or a godsend, depending on whether Republicans or Democrats are talking about it.\n\nNearly three-fourths of Americans find it difficult, according to the AP-GfK poll, and about 4 in 10 say it\u2019s \u201cvery hard\u201d to understand.\n\nOne obvious reason: The law really is complex. Politicians even say so.\n\nRepublicans were condemning \u201cObamacare\u201d as a regulatory morass even before it passed. When the federal website enrolling people crashed last year, Obama himself pointed to the enormous size of the undertaking. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nPoliticians do try to make issues sound simpler. They like to invoke your own family budget when talking about the national debt.\n\nBut in the AP-GfK poll, confidence in dealing with household problems didn\u2019t offer much help in understanding national matters. Most under age 30 said it\u2019s easy to protect your privacy and financial information online. But most young adults think it\u2019s hard to understand NSA data collection programs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's not just people who have tuned out politics who feel perplexed.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "It's not just people who have tuned out politics who feel perplexed.", "title": "Americans find issues harder to understand, poll says - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/509987_AP-Poll-Politics-Too-Comp2.jpg", "height": 575}, "updated_time": "2014-09-27T22:21:19-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/09/28/americans-find-issues-harder-to-understand-poll-says/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's not just people who have tuned out politics who feel perplexed.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/509987_AP-Poll-Politics-Too-Comp2.jpg", "title": "Americans find issues harder to understand, poll says - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2014-09-28T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-27T22:21:19-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1d6\"", "article_summary": "The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192Most Americans say the issues facing the country are getting harder to fathom.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Confused by the federal health care law?\nNearly three-fourths of Americans find it difficult, according to the AP-GfK poll, and about 4 in 10 say it\u2019s \u201cvery hard\u201d to understand.\nAdditional Images This 2012 photo shows Glynn McGehee, an aide of Rep.
