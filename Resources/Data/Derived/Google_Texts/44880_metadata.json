If you listen to my show on Talk Radio 1210 or watch Fox News Channel, you know that Gruber is an MIT economics professor and an architect of Obamacare who has been caught on a series of videos saying that to get Obamacare put into law he and others had to lie about big parts of the law.\n\nWhen you watch the videos, Guber\u2019s message hits you squarely between the eyes. The reason why the lies were necessary is that the American people are stupid and don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them. This video was of a panel discussion of the annual Health Economic Conference held at the University of Pennsylvania in October of 2013.\n\nGruber responding to comments about transparency said of Obamacare \u201cThe bill was written in a tortured way to make sure CBO did not score the mandate as taxes.\u201d He went on to say \u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage and basically call it the \u2018stupidity of the American voter\u2019 or whatever, but basically this was really, really critical to get the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nAfter this initial video, several more in the same vein have surfaced of Gruber reinforcing the lies behind the bill and the contempt for the intelligence of the American people. Democrats have tried to deny that Gruber was a major player in getting Obamacare passed. Senator Bob Casey on my show on 1210 Radio told me that Gruber was only a policy wonk and didn\u2019t craft the bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther major Democrats have echoed this by saying \u201cWho is this guy Gruber?\u201d The evidence points to the fact that they know exactly who Gruber is. In 2009, Representative Nancy Pelosi pointed to Gruber as a key player. Records indicate he was at the White House in strategy sessions with President Obama over the bill and he was paid hundreds of thousands dollars in consultancy fees by the democrats pushing the bill.\n\nIn addition to the lies and arrogance that have been revealed, the Gruber tapes indicate a big divide in the media. Talk radio and Fox News Channel have fully discussed all aspects of this. The mainstream media by and large doesn\u2019t think this is much of a story. That position underlines why Fox News and talk radio are so popular. We offer an alternative to the news that others won\u2019t cover because of their bias.\n\nObamacare is not settled law and there is a case before the Supreme Court right now that could overturn it. The Gruber tapes probably give Justice Roberts and others on the Court more reasons to consider seeing it as a deception that is unconstitutional.\n\nAs far as Gruber, I think he should be called before Congress and questioned on the fraud that was required to get the bill passed. This bill affects every aspect of the lives of all Americans. Gruber has said it was sold as a cost cutter to Americans when it clearly won\u2019t cut costs.\n\nIt is a fact that politicians count on the apathy of the public. It\u2019s how they get their pet laws passed, and it\u2019s how they continue to win re-election when they clearly don\u2019t deserve it. Regardless of your political viewpoint, you need to practice engaged citizenship and cry \u201cfoul\u201d when our public servants fail to serve its citizens. It\u2019s the public\u2019s version of checks-and-balances.\n\nTalk show host Dom Giordano is heard weekdays 9 AM to 12 noon on WPHT 1210-AM Radio.
