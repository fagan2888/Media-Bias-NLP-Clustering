The Affordable Care Act is dragging down private sector hiring, according to newly released government data.

The Congressional Budget Office projected that Obamacare will cost nearly $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years–but that does not include the cost in its effects on the labor market, Economics 21 reported.

Data from Wednesday’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed that 4.8 million job openings existed at the end of August–the highest they have been since January 2001. But people are not taking the jobs. There were 300,000 fewer hires in August than in July, reflecting underlying problems with the job market.
