We have very specific investments that need to be made in certain places, and we need to start talking about infrastructure in those terms--an international bridge crossing in Michigan, a clean energy transfer station in the southeast. In order to get something done, we\u2019ve got to get more specific. And we have to understand who\u2019s responsible for doing what.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fix Infrastructure Now or Apologize for It Forever\n\nPuentes also warns against overestimating the federal government\u2019s role in infrastructure improvement.\n\n\u201cWe overemphasize the federal role in this, when cities states and metropolitan areas make many of the decisions about infrastructure spending,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat moves things in Washington these days is tough to understand. But the federal government is not the whole pie. The federal share matters, but I don\u2019t want to overemphasize what it would really do.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The International Monetary Fund this week added more evidence that investing in public infrastructure is not only important for a functioning society, but would actually pay for itself.", "title": "Why Infrastructure Investment Is a No-Brainer Payoff", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/10/01/Why-Infrastructure-Investment-No-Brainer-Payoff", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03072014_Potholes_Fix_Me.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/10/01/Why-Infrastructure-Investment-No-Brainer-Payoff", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03072014_Potholes_Fix_Me.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The International Monetary Fund this week added more evidence that investing in public infrastructure is not only important for a functioning society, but would actually pay for itself.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: 10 Most Dangerous Infrastructure Problems\u201cFor economies with clearly identified infrastructure needs and efficient public investment processes and where there is economic slack and monetary accommodation, there is a strong case for increasing public infrastructure investment,\u201d they write.\nAnd we have to understand who\u2019s responsible for doing what.\u201dRelated: Fix Infrastructure Now or Apologize for It ForeverPuentes also warns against overestimating the federal government\u2019s role in infrastructure improvement.\n\u201cWe overemphasize the federal role in this, when cities states and metropolitan areas make many of the decisions about infrastructure spending,\u201d he said.\nIn the U.S. though, he said, broad conversations about infrastructure have remained too vague to be useful.\nSo far, neither of those caveats apply to the U.S., where the government is still able to borrow at rock-bottom rates, and where detailed studies, such as this one from the Brookings Institution, have documented that the returns to infrastructure investment \u2013 particularly in the area of job creation \u2013are manifold."}
