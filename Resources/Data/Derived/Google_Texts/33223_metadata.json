That means only one thing: Syria is the next stop on the road to defeating the Islamic jihadists.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to give them sanctuary at all,\u201d says Anthony Zinni, former chief of U.S. Central Command, which oversees the region. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a Pakistan,\u201d where U.S. military efforts in Afghanistan have been frustrated by enemy forces who could scoot across borders to escape U.S. attacks. \u201cThey\u2019ll simply regroup inside Syria and then re-attack\u2014that\u2019s stupid\u201d if allowed to happen, the retired Marine general says.\n\nThe nation\u2019s top military officer has already said rooting out ISIS\u2019s Syrian haven is required for success. \u201cCan they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in Syria?\u201d Army General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Aug. 21. \u201cThe answer is \u2018no\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe challenge of any U.S. military action in Syria is to hurt ISIS without helping the government of dictator Assad, whose civil war against several rebel groups, including ISIS, has killed nearly 200,000 people over three years. \u201cWe are supporting the Syrian moderate opposition,\u201d Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Sunday in Tbilisi, Georgia.\n\nThe strikes launched Saturday and Sunday marked the first acknowledged time in a month-long U.S. bombing campaign of nearly 150 strikes against ISIS that U.S. munitions hit targets in western Iraq\u2019s Anbar province. Prior American attacks had been limited to northern Iraq.\n\nLike earlier strikes, the Pentagon justified the weekend\u2019s action as part of Obama\u2019s two-pronged ISIS effort to protect U.S. interests in Iraq and prevent humanitarian disasters against the Iraqi people. Earlier strikes were needed to defend the Mosul dam from an ISIS takeover, the Pentagon said, due to fear that the militants might sabotage it and send a 60-foot cascade of water down the Tigris River, threatening residents of Mosul.\n\nThe U.S. military used a similar justification for the weekend\u2019s strikes on ISIS units near Anwar\u2019s Haditha dam on the Euphrates River. \u201cThe potential loss of control of the dam or a catastrophic failure of the dam\u2014and the flooding that might result\u2014would have threatened U.S. personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad, as well as thousands of Iraqi citizens,\u201d Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nThe attacks in Anbar\u2014even if from the sky\u2014 mark a watershed return for the U.S. to the Sunni-dominated province where American forces fought several of the Iraq war\u2019s most deadly battles before leaving the country nearly three years ago. It\u2019s a tacit acknowledgement that the U.S. withdrawal\u2014aided and abetted by a recalcitrant Iraqi government\u2014was premature.\n\nThe Anbar action comes nine months after ISIS forces took control of Fallujah, one of its main cities and the site of some of the 2003-2011 war\u2019s bloodiest battles between U.S. forces and Iraqi insurgents. Some U.S. military officers believe Washington should have begun stepped-up military action back then.\n\nMilitary experts are divided on how well the Obama Administration has handled the ISIS threat. Lawrence Korb, a former assistant defense secretary in the Reagan Administration, praises the President\u2019s methodical approach. \u201cYou make it clear we\u2019re going to get these guys,\u201d says Korb, now with the Center for American Progress think tank, \u201cjust like we got [Osama] bin Laden.\u201d\n\nOthers suggest partisanship at home has hobbled the U.S. effort to deal with ISIS. \u201cOur nation is suffering this current distraction because of our inability to reach a consensus on how to deal with the crisis in Syria over a year ago,\u201d says Jerry Hendrix, a naval flight officer who went on to serve as the Navy\u2019s top historian before retiring from the service as a captain two months ago. Hendrix, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, blames \u201cthe hyper-partisan atmosphere and the continuous election campaign we find ourselves in\u201d for the delay.\n\nFor his part, Zinni finds what he sees as Obama\u2019s foot-dragging distressing. \u201cThe President\u2019s job is not to put his finger up and test the political winds,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s to make a decision based on threats to our people and interests, and then explain to the American people why he\u2019s doing it.\u201d\n\nObama gets his chance Wednesday, the eve of the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It looks increasingly like the U.S. will start attacking targets there", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "It looks increasingly like the U.S. will start attacking targets there", "title": "U.S. Strikes in Iraq Against Jihadists, Moving West Toward Syria", "url": "http://time.com/3294956/u-s-strikes-in-iraq-against-jihadists-moving-west-toward-syria/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/rtr4598s.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/rtr4598s.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "It looks increasingly like the U.S. will start attacking targets there", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "U.S. Strikes in Iraq Against Jihadists, Moving West Toward Syria"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "iraq, islamic state, military, national security, syria, terrorism", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "iraq, islamic state, military, national security, syria, terrorism"}, "article_summary": "Some U.S. military officers believe Washington should have begun stepped-up military action back then.\nPresident Obama said Sunday he will detail his plans for destroying the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in a speech to the nation Wednesday.\nPrior American attacks had been limited to northern Iraq.\nThat means only one thing: Syria is the next stop on the road to defeating the Islamic jihadists.\nThe U.S. military used a similar justification for the weekend\u2019s strikes on ISIS units near Anwar\u2019s Haditha dam on the Euphrates River."}
