Video captured a sound byte in which Obama told French President Francois Hollande that one of the great things about being the American president is, \u201dI can do whatever I want.\u201d\n\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEPFMGPhcqs[/youtube]\n\nHe said that to be charming and engaging, but does he really believe it?\n\nConservatives were outraged, but their anger is pointless. Obama is absolutely right. That is, he is wrong in theory but completely right in practice. To understand Obama, look at his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.\n\nWhile Obama certainly has not taken the arbitrary exercise of power to the level that Putin has, both are leaders of countries with constitutions. Both have strengthened their executive powers despite those constitutions.\n\nArticle 81, Section 3 of the Russian constitution states that, \u201cOne person may not hold the position of Russian president for more than two terms in a row.\u201d Putin is now in his third term, through the stratagem of trading jobs with his prime minister after his second term, then trading them back again. He managed to remain within the narrow requirements of the constitution while completely ignoring the intent. Constitution Article 81 be damned.\n\nOn the world stage, Putin is the bully who treats Obama with disdain. Putin imprisons whomever he pleases, supports bloodthirsty dictators like Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad, and declares laws to be whatever he decides on any given day.\n\nHe acts with impunity because he can. There are no checks on his power.\n\nHe had a film-maker imprisoned for committing the sin of jeopardizing Obama\u2019s reelection chances. The film-maker disproved Obama\u2019s Benghazi narrative as a successful terror warrior, and was jailed for it. Another conservative film-maker, Dinesh D\u2019Souza, was recently indicted for making a movie criticizing Obama.\n\nObama and Attorney General Eric Holder get to decide which laws to enforce and which ones to ignore, even though both have sworn an oath to faithfully uphold all laws. Obama and Holder have unilaterally decided not to enforce laws they consider unjust \u2013 including drug laws and bans on gay marriage.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has been altered thirty times by unilateral executive action.\n\nObama does all of this because he can.\n\nStalwart Obama allies in the mainstream media, Hollywood, and the ACLU have remained mute because the ordinary citizens whose First Amendment rights have been crushed are political conservatives. Obama knows that liberals will blithely accept threats to civil liberties for the greater good of advancing liberalism.\n\nRepublicans say nothing for fear as being accused of racism, misogyny, or anti-immigrant bias. When Mitt Romney tried to bring up Benghazi in 2012, he was bullied and intimidated. He caved, and that played a key role in costing him the White House.\n\nThe Supreme Court is supposed to referee disputes between the Legislative and Executive branches, but the current court is terrified of being seen as activist. Republican legislators have tried to bring lawsuits through the courts to curb Obama\u2019s power, but the reality they face is a court that kicks that responsibility back to Congress.\n\nThe only real remedy to stop Obama is impeachment, and that is completely off the table. Republicans know it would be political suicide to go this route, and Obama knows it as well.\n\nWithout a credible way to contain him, Obama can and does run wild. His supporters prefer victory at all costs to accepting constitutional limits. His critics do not have the stomach to stop him and are unable to market themselves as a quality alternative.\n\nThe many apolitical people in this country just want everybody to get along, and their attempt to stay out of politics is the same as giving Obama a blank check.\n\nThe only thing separating Obama from becoming Putin is longevity. Putin is well into the third of what could be many terms. His rivals are likely to find themselves charged with corruption or theft, thus made ineligible to challenge him.\n\nIf Obama tried to seek a third term, Hillary Clinton\u2019s medicine cabinet would make for an interesting inspection.\n\nUntil January 20, 2017, Obama will wield absolute power. He can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Video captured a sound byte in which Obama tells Hollande that one of the great things about being the American president is\u201d\u2026I can do whatever I want\u201d.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Eric Golub", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Video captured a sound byte in which Obama tells French President Hollande that one of the great things about being the American president is \u201d\u2026I can do whatever I want\u201d.", "title": "Yes, I can\u2026 President\u2019s Obama\u2019s abuse of power", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/yes-i-can-presidents-obamas-putin-like-abuse-of-power-10606/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obama-hollande-monticello.jpg", "height": 427}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Video captured a sound byte in which Obama tells Hollande that one of the great things about being the American president is\u201d\u2026I can do whatever I want\u201d.", "title": "Yes, I can...
