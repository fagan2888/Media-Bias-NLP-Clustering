They\u2019ve been par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly suc\u00adcess\u00adful in lever\u00adaging the law to oust mod\u00ader\u00adate Demo\u00adcrats from purple states. In that re\u00adgard, as Ken\u00adtucky Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans hope to re\u00adtake the Gov\u00adernor\u2019s Man\u00adsion this Novem\u00adber, the anti-Obama\u00adcare cam\u00adpaign strategy ap\u00adpears ideal. But in Ken\u00adtucky, it\u2019s not so simple, be\u00adcause in Ken\u00adtucky, the law has had tre\u00admend\u00adous suc\u00adcess in get\u00adting state res\u00adid\u00adents in\u00adsured.\n\nMore than half a mil\u00adlion Ken\u00adtucki\u00adans signed up for private in\u00adsur\u00adance or Medi\u00adcaid through the state\u2019s Obama\u00adcare ex\u00adchange. Since the ex\u00adchange\u2014known as \u201cKynect\u201d\u2014launched in 2013, the state has cut its un\u00adin\u00adsured rate by more than 40 per\u00adcent. And be\u00adcause Ken\u00adtucky, un\u00adlike many red and purple states, set up its own ex\u00adchange, the state\u2019s as\u00adpir\u00ading in\u00adsur\u00adance buy\u00aders were spared the early fail\u00adures of Health\u00adCare.gov. In exit polling from the 2014 Sen\u00adate race, 50 per\u00adcent of voters said Kynect was func\u00adtion\u00ading \u201cwell\u201d or \u201cvery well,\u201d com\u00adpared with 37 per\u00adcent who as\u00adsessed the ex\u00adchange neg\u00adat\u00adively.\n\nThe ex\u00adchange\u2019s pop\u00adular\u00adity, however, didn\u2019t stop Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan Sen. Mitch Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell from at\u00adtack\u00ading Obama\u00adcare en route to a massive vic\u00adtory last year over Demo\u00adcrat Al\u00adis\u00adon Lun\u00adder\u00adgan Grimes. Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell, who has pushed re\u00adlent\u00adlessly for re\u00adpeal of the law, as the top Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan in the Sen\u00adate, ad\u00added a Ken\u00adtucky twist for his state race: He at\u00adtacked Obama\u00adcare as a whole, but said Kynect could sur\u00advive even if the fed\u00ader\u00adal law came off the books. (The claim was chal\u00adlenged by Demo\u00adcrats, who noted that the ex\u00adchange de\u00adpends in part on Obama\u00adcare sub\u00adsidies and man\u00addates.)\n\nIt\u2019s un\u00adclear, however, wheth\u00ader a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan gubernat\u00adori\u00adal can\u00addid\u00adate will ap\u00adply the same strategy, or if that rhet\u00ador\u00adic\u00adal line will sur\u00advive the party\u2019s com\u00adpet\u00adit\u00adive four-way primary. Both the over\u00adall law and Kynect are un\u00adpop\u00adu\u00adlar among Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan voters, and the race\u2019s two un\u00adder\u00addogs have already pledged to scrap the ex\u00adchange en\u00adtirely. And therein lies the dif\u00adfi\u00adculty for the two fa\u00advor\u00adites. If they coddle Kynect in the primary, they risk los\u00ading the base and watch\u00ading the gen\u00ader\u00adal elec\u00adtion from the couch. But if they pledge to do away with the ex\u00adchange, they risk drift\u00ading too far to the right of the state\u2019s swing voters\u2014and hand\u00ading a health care ad\u00advance to the state\u2019s Demo\u00adcrat\u00adic can\u00addid\u00adate, At\u00adtor\u00adney Gen\u00ader\u00adal Jack Con\u00adway.\n\nSo far, the two GOP front-run\u00adners\u2014state Ag\u00adri\u00adcul\u00adture Com\u00admis\u00adsion\u00ader James Comer and former Louis\u00adville Metro Coun\u00adcil mem\u00adber Hal Hein\u00ader\u2014have been tight-lipped over what they would do with Kynect.\n\nHein\u00ader\u2019s cam\u00adpaign was re\u00adluct\u00adant to of\u00adfer much by way of com\u00adment on the top\u00adic. Spokes\u00adman Doug Al\u00adex\u00adan\u00adder would say only this: \u201cHal Hein\u00ader op\u00adposed Obama\u00adcare from its in\u00adcep\u00adtion, and sup\u00adports ef\u00adforts by Sen\u00adat\u00adors Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell and [Rand] Paul to re\u00adpeal the law.\u201d Al\u00adex\u00adan\u00adder wouldn\u2019t re\u00adspond to ad\u00addi\u00adtion\u00adal ques\u00adtions on wheth\u00ader Hein\u00ader agreed with Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s state\u00adment that Kynect could per\u00adsist even ab\u00adsent Obama\u00adcare.\n\nIn a state\u00adment provided to Na\u00adtion\u00adal Journ\u00adal, Comer de\u00adscribed Kynect as \u201cjust a tool to ex\u00adpand Medi\u00adcaid.\u201d In\u00addeed, 80 per\u00adcent of people who got in\u00adsur\u00adance through Kynect did so by en\u00adrolling in Medi\u00adcaid. (Ken\u00adtucky\u2019s ex\u00adchange is one of the few in which the in\u00adsur\u00adance ex\u00adchange\u2019s only portal can also be used to con\u00adnect with Medi\u00adcaid.) But in\u00adstead of re\u00adpeal\u00ading the pro\u00adgram, Comer says he would call for re\u00adforms, in\u00adclud\u00ading a pro\u00adpos\u00adal \u201cthat Ken\u00adtucky re\u00adquires Medi\u00adcaid par\u00adti\u00adcipants to reen\u00adroll in Medi\u00adcaid every two years like every\u00adone with private health in\u00adsur\u00adance plans have to do.\u201d\n\nFormer Ken\u00adtucky Su\u00adpreme Court Justice Will Scott and Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s 2014 primary chal\u00adlenger, Matt Bev\u00adin, mean\u00adwhile, have been un\u00adequi\u00advoc\u00adal. Bev\u00adin and Scott are call\u00ading for an end to the Kynect ex\u00adchange and the trans\u00adfer of the pro\u00adgram\u2019s private in\u00adsur\u00adance en\u00adrollees to the fed\u00ader\u00adal ex\u00adchange. Scott\u2019s lo\u00adgic is this: \u201cThe only thing we are get\u00adting out of a state-run Obama\u00adcare ex\u00adchange is the priv\u00adilege of pay\u00ading for it. When we shut ours down, the feds will come in and pay for the whole thing.\u201d\n\nAc\u00adcord\u00ading to a spokes\u00adper\u00adson at the Ken\u00adtucky Cab\u00adin\u00adet for Health and Fam\u00adily Ser\u00advices, Kynect cur\u00adrently costs the state roughly $28 mil\u00adlion a year to ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adter. States were giv\u00aden fed\u00ader\u00adal funds to set up their ex\u00adchanges, but they are now re\u00adspons\u00adible for the costs of ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adter\u00ading them.\n\nNot\u00adably, no Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan in the race has yet called for a re\u00adpeal of Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion, sym\u00adbol\u00adiz\u00ading the lim\u00adits of run\u00adning against a law that\u2019s be\u00adcome in\u00adcreas\u00adingly in\u00adgrained. \u201cIf we start fol\u00adlow\u00ading the law, we\u2019re stuck fol\u00adlow\u00ading the law. The apt ana\u00adlogy is a roach motel\u2014you can check in, but you can\u2019t check out,\u201d Dav\u00adid Adams, Scott\u2019s cam\u00adpaign man\u00adager, said of the dif\u00adfi\u00adculties of tak\u00ading back Medi\u00adcaid ex\u00adpan\u00adsion.\n\nThe ques\u00adtion of Kynect\u2019s fu\u00adture is un\u00adlikely to go away be\u00adfore Novem\u00adber. In the primary, it is one of the few is\u00adsues that di\u00advides the GOP field, giv\u00ading Scott and Bev\u00adin an in\u00adcent\u00adive to ac\u00adcen\u00adtu\u00adate it as they try to make up ground. And, in the gen\u00ader\u00adal, it prom\u00adises to be a key is\u00adsue: Ques\u00adtions about Mc\u00adCon\u00adnell\u2019s view on Kynect were largely hy\u00adpo\u00adthet\u00adic\u00adal\u2014sen\u00adat\u00adors don\u2019t get a say over their state\u2019s ex\u00adchanges\u2014but after the Novem\u00adber elec\u00adtion, the fate of the state\u2019s ex\u00adchange will rest largely in the new gov\u00adernor\u2019s hands.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "As Republicans look to take the governor\u2019s mansion in Kentucky, they\u2019ll have to contend with the law\u2019s success in connecting residents with insurance.", "title": "How to Run Against Obamacare in a State that Depends on Obamacare", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/32112/how-run-against-obamacare-state-that-depends-obamacare", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/static/images/placeholder_square.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/static/images/placeholder_square.jpg"}, "title": "How to Run Against Obamacare in a State that Depends on Obamacare", "description": "As Republicans look to take the governor\u2019s mansion in Kentucky, they\u2019ll have to contend with the law\u2019s success in connecting residents with insurance.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nationaljournal"}, "description": "As Republicans look to take the governor\u2019s mansion in Kentucky, they\u2019ll have to contend with the law\u2019s success in connecting residents with insurance.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d82\"", "article_summary": "More than half a mil\u00adlion Ken\u00adtucki\u00adans signed up for private in\u00adsur\u00adance or Medi\u00adcaid through the state\u2019s Obama\u00adcare ex\u00adchange.\nScott\u2019s lo\u00adgic is this: \u201cThe only thing we are get\u00adting out of a state-run Obama\u00adcare ex\u00adchange is the priv\u00adilege of pay\u00ading for it.\nBut in Ken\u00adtucky, it\u2019s not so simple, be\u00adcause in Ken\u00adtucky, the law has had tre\u00admend\u00adous suc\u00adcess in get\u00adting state res\u00adid\u00adents in\u00adsured.\n(The claim was chal\u00adlenged by Demo\u00adcrats, who noted that the ex\u00adchange de\u00adpends in part on Obama\u00adcare sub\u00adsidies and man\u00addates.)\nSince the ex\u00adchange\u2014known as \u201cKynect\u201d\u2014launched in 2013, the state has cut its un\u00adin\u00adsured rate by more than 40 per\u00adcent."}
