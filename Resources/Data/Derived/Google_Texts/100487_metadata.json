She attributes this inflexibility to the Common Core, new standards\u2014created in 2009 by a group of education professionals, none of them K-12 classroom teachers or special-education experts\u2014that have been adopted by 45 states. Though most Common Core goals are abstract and schematic, collectively they constitute a one-size fits-all approach that, in practice, has severely straightjacketed America\u2019s special-needs students. The teacher I quoted above\u2014one of the many special-ed instructors I\n\nteach at the Drexel University and University of Pennsylvania\n\neducation schools\u2014is hardly alone. She\u2019s echoing the concerns of dozens of other special-education teachers I\u2019ve spoken with, most of whom have already gotten the message from their supervisors or superiors that they must adhere to the standards and give all their students the designated grade-level assignments.\n\nPrecocious students, students with learning disabilities, precocious students with learning disabilities: How does the Common Core suit them? Even before the widespread adoption of the Common Core, it was already increasingly rare for even the most intellectually unusual children to be exempted\u2014whether by acceleration, remediation, or placement in special classrooms\u2014from the course of study followed by their cognitively typical peers. The 2001 No Child Left Behind Act had schools focusing away from the most academically advanced students (and requires no special programming for them); the 2004 re-authorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act required children with disabilities \u201cto be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.\u201d Increasingly, it\u2019s the general curriculum for everyone. And now that this general curriculum is being shaped by dozens of grade-specific Common Core standards, and that teachers (including special-ed teachers) are increasingly expected to align each day\u2019s lesson with one or more of these standards, there\u2019s even less room for remediation or acceleration. Restricting students to curricula beyond their cognitive capacities substantially lowers their achievement. Indeed, those two words appear nowhere in the standards, not even in the one Common Core document that addresses this subject: a one-and-a-half-pager entitled \u201cApplication to Students with Disabilities.\u201d It says that special-needs students should have the support services, individualized instruction, and assistive technology they need for the \u201cthe rigor and high expectations of the Common Core State Standards.\u201d It does not, however, state what these services are or how they would work. As for curricular materials, they might be altered or presented \u201cin multiple ways,\u201d but only \u201cwithin the framework of the Common Core.\u201d For students with sensory disabilities like deafness or blindness, the necessary accommodations\u2014e.g., sign language interpreters or audio books\u2014are obvious. Cognitive disabilities are different. Yet the document simply states: Some students with the most significant cognitive disabilities will require substantial supports and accommodations to have meaningful access to certain standards. So what happens to the approximately six percent of the student population with significant cognitive disabilities\u2014whether general intellectual disabilities, language impairments, reading impairments, non-verbal learning disabilities, or autistic spectrum disorders? What happens when their classrooms function under a set of guidelines that ignore their skills and specific needs?\n\nIn general, the news isn\u2019t good. Last November, an issue of Education Week ran several articles on special-needs students and the Common Core. One article characterizes the English language arts goals as \u201clargely unmet.\u201d Another reports more than half of teachers surveyed saying they are unprepared to teach the standards to high-needs students. To see how the Common Core standards play out in practice, let\u2019s look at two subsets of children with cognitive disabilities: those with language impairments and those with autism. Let\u2019s look at eighth grade in particular, and at two of the English language arts standards for reading and literature, beginning with R-L 8.2: Determine a theme or central idea of a text and analyze its development over the course of the text, including its relationship to the characters, setting, and plot; provide an objective summary of the text. This, like all Common Core goals, is rather schematic. So perhaps there\u2019s a way to tweak things in line with the Students with Disabilities document. Perhaps one could adjust the material by using a simplified or alternative text at the student\u2019s actual reading level. Related Story The Common Core Is Tough on Kids Who Are Still Learning English But probably not. As additional Common Core documents explain, the texts for the different grade levels must be at a certain grade-appropriate level of verbal complexity. The Common Core Myths vs. Facts page notes, \u201cthe Standards require certain critical content for all students, including\u2026 America\u2019s Founding Documents, foundational American literature, and Shakespeare.\u201d And an appendix explains that sample texts, which include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer for eighth grade, \u201cexemplify the level of complexity and quality that the Standards require all students in a given grade band to engage with.\u201d So, while one might supplement a text, say, with glossaries and storyboards, one can\u2019t adjust the text itself to match the student\u2019s reading level. Further showing what special needs students are up against are the sample tasks. For R-L 8.2 above, we have: Students summarize the development of the morality of Tom Sawyer in Mark Twain\u2019s novel of the same name and analyze its connection to themes of accountability and authenticity by noting how it is conveyed through characters, setting, and plot. Now imagine a 14-year-old who comprehends language at a fourth-grade level. What combination of assistive technology and supplemental material could possibly provide sufficient access to how accountability and authenticity play out in the complex paragraphs of Tom Sawyer? What, other than years of remediation in reading comprehension, could get her through highly relevant sentences like this one, in which Tom takes a lashing from Schoolmaster Dobbins for an infraction actually committed by Becky Thatcher? Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed\u2014for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss, either. What, short of simplifying the text or spoon-feeding its meaning to her, will it take for our language-impaired 14-year-old to grasp this 67-word sentence, with its complex syntax, words like \u201cflaying,\u201d \u201cindifference,\u201d and an outdated sense of \u201cshould,\u201d and the inference needed to grasp the contextual meaning of \u201ccaptivity\u201d? One can only imagine how tough things become once the student gets to Shakespeare\u2014one author that the standards appear to mandate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The standards don&#39;t allow enough flexibility for students who learn differently.", "author": "Katharine Beals", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The standards don&#39;t allow enough flexibility for students who learn differently.", "title": "The Common Core Is Tough on Kids With Special Needs", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/5495506142_2ea1d3800d_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/the-common-core-is-tough-on-kids-with-special-needs/283973/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0178\"", "article_summary": "Related Story The Common Core Is Tough on Kids Who Are Still Learning English But probably not.\nPrecocious students, students with learning disabilities, precocious students with learning disabilities: How does the Common Core suit them?\nLast November, an issue of Education Week ran several articles on special-needs students and the Common Core.\nThough most Common Core goals are abstract and schematic, collectively they constitute a one-size fits-all approach that, in practice, has severely straightjacketed America\u2019s special-needs students.\nThis, like all Common Core goals, is rather schematic."}
