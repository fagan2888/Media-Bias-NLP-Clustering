An actual veto would mark the fifth time in U.S. history that the defense budget did not pass muster with the White House.\n\nIn every case, the White House won.\n\nThis time around, the White House disagrees with Congress\u2019 attempt to circumvent budget caps through shoving programs into the controversial Overseas Contingency Operations fund, an account ostensibly designed for variable and emergency war-related expenses in Iraq and Afghanistan. Part of the reason for the fund\u2019s existence is that occasionally war expenses don\u2019t neatly track with the regular budget process. But OCO has ended up functioning as a method to bypass limits imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and slide in routine programs that belong in the base budget.\n\nNow that the defense bill has passed the Senate, with support from nearly every Republican aside from Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, it will head to Obama\u2019s desk. And it is unlikely that Obama is bluffing about a veto. While the votes exist in the Senate to override a presidential veto, those votes don\u2019t exist in the House. Minority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that Democrats will stand behind Obama\u2019s decision.\n\nGOP Rep. Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, complained about the veto threat and how it diminishes the credibility of U.S. political institutions around the world.\n\n\u201cWhy not get this done, and at least show the world that our political institutions can function for our own national defense?\u201d Thornberry said, according to Defense One. \u201cY\u2019all, think about the headlines today \u2014 the Russians launch cruise missiles, a new ground offensive is starting in Syria \u2014 there is danger wherever you look. This is absolutely one of the worst times I can imagine to veto a bill that supports our troops, that gives the president additional tools.\u201d\n\nThe White House has also complained about additional restrictions in the bill regarding the transfer of detainees out of Guantanamo Bay, though GOP Sen. John McCain, who has sided with the Obama administration on the need to shutter the facility, blamed the White House for not sending a final closure plan to Congress for consideration in time.
