On Jan. 1, the key provisions of the Affordable Care Act took effect. Americans gained access to new health plans subsidized by federal dollars. Insurers can no longer turn away people with existing conditions. Millions are now eligible for new Medicaid benefits.

But the federal law also upended health-insurance arrangements for millions of people. For many, it has been a confusing and frustrating experience. Throughout 2014, the Wall Street Journal is following stories of people affected by the health law, from industry executives to consumers to care providers. Readers can submit their story as well by going here.

On Tuesday, February 25 at 3:00 p.m. ET the Wall Street Journalâ€™s Anna Mathews will be joined by Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, Mike Stahl, senior vice president at HealthMarkets, and Adam Okun, senior vice president at Frenkel Benefits, to discuss the health law, what it means for consumers and employers, and answer reader questions. You can comment below, tweet us at @WSJhealth or ask a question during the video chat by signing in with Twitter, Facebook, or joining as a guest.
