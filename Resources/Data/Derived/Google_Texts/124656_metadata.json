As part of a research project at UC Irvine, he was sifting through thousands of PET scans to find anatomical patterns in the brain that correlated with psychopathic tendencies in the real world.\n\n\u201cI was looking at many scans, scans of murderers mixed in with schizophrenics, depressives and other, normal brains,\u201d he says. \u201cOut of serendipity, I was also doing a study on Alzheimer\u2019s and as part of that, had brain scans from me and everyone in my family right on my desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got to the bottom of the stack, and saw this scan that was obviously pathological,\u201d he says, noting that it showed low activity in certain areas of the frontal and temporal lobes linked to empathy, morality and self-control. Knowing that it belonged to a member of his family, Fallon checked his lab\u2019s PET machine for an error (it was working perfectly fine) and then decided he simply had to break the blinding that prevented him from knowing whose brain was pictured. When he looked up the code, he was greeted by an unsettling revelation: the psychopathic brain pictured in the scan was his own.\n\nMany of us would hide this discovery and never tell a soul, out of fear or embarrassment of being labeled a psychopath. Perhaps because boldness and disinhibition are noted psychopathic tendencies, Fallon has gone all in towards the opposite direction, telling the world about his finding in a TED Talk, an NPR interview and now a new book published last month, The Psychopath Inside. In it, Fallon seeks to reconcile how he\u2014a happily married family man\u2014could demonstrate the same anatomical patterns that marked the minds of serial killers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never killed anybody, or raped anyone,\u201d he says. \u201cSo the first thing I thought was that maybe my hypothesis was wrong, and that these brain areas are not reflective of psychopathy or murderous behavior.\u201d\n\nBut when he underwent a series of genetic tests, he got more bad news. \u201cI had all these high-risk alleles for aggression, violence and low empathy,\u201d he says, such as a variant of the MAO-A gene that has been linked with aggressive behavior. Eventually, based on further neurological and behavioral research into psychopathy, he decided he was indeed a psychopath\u2014just a relatively good kind, what he and others call a \u201cpro-social psychopath,\u201d someone who has difficulty feeling true empathy for others but still keeps his behavior roughly within socially-acceptable bounds.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t entirely a shock to Fallon, as he\u2019d always been aware that he was someone especially motivated by power and manipulating others, he says. Additionally, his family line included seven alleged murderers, including Lizzie Borden, infamously accused of killing her father and stepmother in 1892.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The Psychopath Inside\" author James Fallon on learning he was lacking in empathy and prone to aggression, violence", "title": "The neuroscientist who discovered he was a psychopath", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"The Psychopath Inside\" author James Fallon on learning he was lacking in empathy and prone to aggression, violence", "title": "The neuroscientist who discovered he was a psychopath", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/23/this_neuroscientist_discovered_he_was_a_psychopath_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/shutterstock_134220278-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"The Psychopath Inside\" author James Fallon on learning he was lacking in empathy and prone to aggression, violence", "title": "The neuroscientist who discovered he was a psychopath", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/shutterstock_134220278-1.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joseph Stromberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Genetics, Parenting, Psychopaths, Smithsonian.com, Sociopath", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4137\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI was looking at many scans, scans of murderers mixed in with schizophrenics, depressives and other, normal brains,\u201d he says.\nTopics: Genetics, Parenting, Psychopaths, Smithsonian.com, Sociopath, Technology News, Life News, NewsThis article originally appeared on Smithsonian.comOne afternoon in October 2005, neuroscientist James Fallon was looking at brain scans of serial killers.\nWhen he looked up the code, he was greeted by an unsettling revelation: the psychopathic brain pictured in the scan was his own.\nMany of us would hide this discovery and never tell a soul, out of fear or embarrassment of being labeled a psychopath.\nPerhaps because boldness and disinhibition are noted psychopathic tendencies, Fallon has gone all in towards the opposite direction, telling the world about his finding in a TED Talk, an NPR interview and now a new book published last month, The Psychopath Inside."}
