They will also continue settlement discussions with the government.\n\n[Also: Running list of notable 2015 healthcare frauds]\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed,\u201d Tuomey CEO and President Michelle Logan-Owens stated on the health system\u2019s website. \u201cI am confident that we will find an appropriate resolution which will allow Tuomey to close this chapter and emerge strongly and successfully in our potential collaboration with Palmetto Health.\"\n\nTuomey is a nonprofit hospital located in a largely rural community that is a federally designated, medically underserved area.\n\nJudge Albert Diaz, writing the majority opinion, called the case \u201ctroubling\u201d even as he agreed the health system violated both the Stark Law that prevents physician referrals in which they earn money based the referrals, and the False Claims Act.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, I am troubled by the picture this case paints: An impenetrably complex set of laws and regulations that will result in a likely death sentence for a community hospital in an already medically underserved area,\u201d Diaz wrote.\n\n\u201cWhile the award is substantial, we cannot say that it is unconstitutional,\u201d he said.\n\nThe case, decided July 2, 2015, upholds a jury\u2019s decision in a second trial that found Tuomey knowingly submitted 21,730 false claims to Medicare for reimbursement. The district court awarded damages and civil penalties totaling $237,454,195.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nThe whistleblower case, in which the U.S. Department of Justice intervened, was originally brought by Dr. Michael Drakeford in 2005.\n\nDrakeford refused to go along with Tuomey\u2019 s financial incentives proposed to make up for an estimated $8 to $12 million in lost revenue over a 13-year period from facility fees associated with gastrointestinal procedures, according to the court record.\n\nPhysicians who previously performed outpatient surgery at Tuomey began doing so in their own offices or at off-site surgery centers.\n\nTo stem this loss, Tuomey sought to negotiate part-time employment contracts in which the bulk of the physicians\u2019 compensation was earned from a productivity bonus, which paid them 80 percent of the amount of their collections for that year. The physicians were also eligible for an incentive bonus of up to 7 percent of their earned productivity bonus.\n\nIn addition, Tuomey agreed to pay for the physicians\u2019 medical malpractice liability insurance as well as their practice group\u2019s share of employment taxes. The physicians were also allowed to participate in Tuomey\u2019s health insurance plan.\n\nFinally, Tuomey agreed to absorb each practice group\u2019s billing and collections costs. The contracts had 10-year terms, during which physicians could maintain their private practices, but were required to perform outpatient surgical procedures exclusively at the hospital.\n\nOther conditions were also imposed.\n\nAfter getting advice from attorneys on physician referrals as it applied to the Stark Law, Tuomey ultimately entered into part-time employment contracts with 19 physicians.\n\nDrakeford, an orthopedic surgeon, did not sign on.\n\nIn May 2005, Tuomey and Drakeford sought the advice of Attorney Kevin McAnaney, who advised the proposed employment contracts raised significant \u201cred flags\u201d under the Stark Law and separate concerns under the Anti-Kickback Statute.\n\nMcAnaney\u2019s testimony was excluded at the first trial in District Court.\n\n\u201cIn the first trial, the jury did not hear from McAnaney and found for Tuomey on the FCA claim. When the case was retried, McAnaney was allowed to testify and the jury found for the government. Coincidence? We think not. Rather, we believe that these results bespeak the importance of what the jury in the first trial was not allowed to consider,\u201d Diaz wrote\n\nHad Tuomey followed McAnaney\u2019s advice, it likely would have faced no lawsuit in which to raise an advice of counsel, or any other, defense, according to Diaz.\n\nTuomey said there was no evidence the government did not get what it paid for, and therefore, there were no actual damages under the False Claims Act.\n\nDrakeford was not called as a witness at either trial. He is entitled to receive 15 percent of the total recovery.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/tuomey-healthcare-system-loses-appeal-will-pay-237-million-over-false-claims", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tuomey-Health-System-facebook-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The multimillion dollar fine is more than the hospital's annual revenue and is believed to be the largest ever applied to a community hospital.", "title": "Tuomey Healthcare System loses appeal, will pay $237 million over false claims"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Tuomey-Health-System-facebook-feature.jpg"}, "description": "The multimillion dollar fine is more than the hospital's annual revenue and is believed to be the largest ever applied to a community hospital.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tuomey Healthcare System loses appeal, will pay $237 million over false claims"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A U.S. Court of Appeals in South Carolina has upheld charges under the government\u2019s False Claim Act against Tuomey Healthcare System, forcing it to pay a $237 million fine from a lower court ruling.&#13; The multimillion dollar fine is more than the hospital\u2019s annual revenue and is believed to be the largest ever applied to a community hospital.&#13; Sumter, South Carolina-based Tuomey has 45 days to request reconsideration from the court.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9264\"", "article_summary": "Photo of Tuomey Health System from Facebook.\nA U.S. Court of Appeals in South Carolina has upheld charges under the government\u2019s False Claim Act against Tuomey Healthcare System, forcing it to pay a $237 million fine from a lower court ruling.\n[Also: Running list of notable 2015 healthcare frauds]\u201cWe are disappointed,\u201d Tuomey CEO and President Michelle Logan-Owens stated on the health system\u2019s website.\nThe case, decided July 2, 2015, upholds a jury\u2019s decision in a second trial that found Tuomey knowingly submitted 21,730 false claims to Medicare for reimbursement.\nAfter getting advice from attorneys on physician referrals as it applied to the Stark Law, Tuomey ultimately entered into part-time employment contracts with 19 physicians."}
