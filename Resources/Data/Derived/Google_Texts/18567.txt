(Newser) – Finally, Frito-Lay is saving you the trouble of physically dipping your potato chips in chocolate sauce. The company is releasing milk chocolate-covered chips for the holidays, and they're set to hit shelves next week—though only at Target, and only for a limited time, USA Today reports. "When you try something drastically different, you have to walk before you can run," says a Frito-Lay VP. "We wanted to test our way through this before we go big." If the chips are successful, they could become permanently available.

USA Today cites a number of snacking trends that may have prompted the chips' release: First, Americans have taken an interest in foods that are a combination of sweet and salt, like ice cream with pretzels. There also have been increasing numbers of snacks sold only as holiday treats between Halloween and New Year's. Finally, we're just snacking more: About 43% of us have a little something three to four times a day, up from 24% four years ago. A 5-oz. bag of the chocolate-covered chips will cost $3.49, simplifying life for people like this YouTuber, as noted at Time.
