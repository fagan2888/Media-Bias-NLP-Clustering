Considering the recent passage of the nuclear agreement with Iran, the prime minister\u2019s comments were especially powerful.\n\n\u201cIran is setting up dozens of terror cells,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cImagine what they will do after the sanctions are lifted.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnmuzzled,\u201d Iran will \u201cgo on the prowl, devouring more and more prey,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the wake of the nuclear deal, Netanyahu remarked, Iran is spending billions on weapons and satellites.\n\n\u201cDo you think Iran is doing that to advance peace?\u201d\n\nThat question was perhaps a direct response to President Obama\u2019s claim on Monday that the Iran Deal will ensure their nuclear program is \u201cpeaceful.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu rejected such assurances, saying the agreement does nothing to block Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cWhen bad behavior is awarded, it only gets worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m gravely concerned the nuclear deal with Iran will prove to be the marriage certificate of that unholy union.\u201d\n\nNetanyahu acknowledged some \"well-intentioned people\" believe the deal is the only way to block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb. Yet, \u201cthe best intentions don\u2019t prevent the worst outcomes.\u201d\n\nIn the most powerful part of his speech, Netanyahu stopped to directly address the nations in attendance.\n\n\u201cIf Iran\u2019s rulers were working to destroy your countries, perhaps you\u2019d be somewhat less enthusiastic about the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Iran\u2019s terror proxies were firing thousands of rockets at your cities, perhaps you\u2019d be more measured in your praise.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet the response from every one of you here, utter silence,\" he said. \"Deafening silence.\u201d\n\nAfter those remarks, he stood at the podium and glared at the delegates around the room for about one minute.\n\nWatch the chilling moment below:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Imagine what they will do after the sanctions are lifted. .05/27/2016 8:39:10AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Imagine what they will do after the sanctions are lifted.", "title": "Chilling: Netanyahu Glares at UN Delegates for 45 Seconds for Their 'Deafening Silence' on Iran Deal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/10/01/netanyahu-un-speech-n2059774", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/10/1/7.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Imagine what they will do after the sanctions are lifted.", "title": "Chilling: Netanyahu Glares at UN Delegates for 45 Seconds for Their 'Deafening Silence' on Iran Deal", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2015/10/01/netanyahu-un-speech-n2059774", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/10/1/7.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Chilling: Netanyahu Glares at UN Delegates for 45 Seconds for Their 'Deafening Silence' on Iran Deal, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In the wake of the nuclear deal, Netanyahu remarked, Iran is spending billions on weapons and satellites.\nConsidering the recent passage of the nuclear agreement with Iran, the prime minister\u2019s comments were especially powerful.\nAt the United Nations General Assembly Thursday in New York City, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu renewed his warning about Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear bomb.\n\"Deafening silence.\u201dAfter those remarks, he stood at the podium and glared at the delegates around the room for about one minute.\n\u201cI\u2019m gravely concerned the nuclear deal with Iran will prove to be the marriage certificate of that unholy union.\u201dNetanyahu acknowledged some \"well-intentioned people\" believe the deal is the only way to block Iran\u2019s path to the bomb."}
