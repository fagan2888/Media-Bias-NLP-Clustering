Even without that rule, plenty of these bills would still earn a veto from the president. But moving a funding bill written on conservatives\u2019 terms out of Congress would at least apply more pressure on the president to sign it. And more importantly, in the not-so-distant future: If Republicans can retain control of Congress in 2016 while picking up the White House, the legislative filibuster will be their only impediment\u2014and if it isn\u2019t reformed, the source of unthinkable rage among the grassroots right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhich makes it so peculiar that some of the conservatives who complain most about the lack of fight in their leaders are the most hesitant to reform the filibuster.\n\nIt\u2019s peculiar that some of the conservatives who complain most about the lack of fight in their leaders are the most hesitant to reform the filibuster.\n\nTedious people frequently describe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell as a Senate \u201cinstitutionalist.\u201d As if the senior senator from Kentucky licks the well of the chamber clean each night before retiring to bed in his Henry Clay\u00ad\u2013themed pajamas and nightcap. A more apt label for McConnell would be \u201cmaster political operator who robotically follows whatever path political incentives have laid out for him.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a very \u201cinstitutionalist\u201d move, for example, to decide in 2009 to filibuster every agenda item congressional Democrats and the Obama administration could conceive of. In terms of scorched-earth partisan politics, though, it was an extremely effective procedural innovation\u2014so successful that his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Harry Reid, has deployed the filibuster just the same way, and with just as much success, since his \u201cdemotion\u201d to minority leader.\n\nSo give McConnell some credit: The institutionalist made it a full nine months as Senate majority leader before changing his tune on filibuster reform. Perhaps recognizing that grassroots conservatives would be coming for his head after lopping off John Boehner\u2019s, McConnell last week blessed a new \u201cspecial task force to explore changes to the filibuster rule and other procedural hurdles\u2014including whether to eliminate filibusters on motions to proceed to legislation,\u201d the Hill reported. A mix of Senate Republican veterans and freshmen will constitute this blue-ribbon commission.\n\nOne would have expected rejoicing in the streets from conservative movementarians that McConnell had finally opened the door to eliminating the obnoxious 60-vote rule that he himself perfected, under a different set of circumstances, a few short years ago. Instead, one of the first statements that came out of the conservative pressure-group world was a scream from FreedomWorks, the Tea Party\u2013aligned group, arguing against any changes to the filibuster.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Senate is supposed to be the \u2018world\u2019s greatest deliberative body,\u2019 but any weakening of the filibuster will lead us further down a slippery slope where reactionary policies are rammed through the chamber without any serious debate,\u201d FreedomWorks legislative affairs manager Josh Withrow said. \u201cSimply put, the Senate is the last check on impulsiveness and majority rule. Limiting the profound deliberation for which the chamber is known will come back to haunt Republicans should they once again become the chamber\u2019s minority party.\u201d\n\nThat is the conservative position in its most traditional sense: If the ideological purpose is to slow federal lawmaking to a halt, then the filibuster is conservatives\u2019 best friend. These are precisely the terms with which another surprising filibuster reform opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz\u2014who sees each mathematical impossibility as one that must be \u201cfought\u201d against\u2014describes his position. \u201cThe legislative filibuster slows down legislative action in the Senate,\u201d Cruz told reporters in September, \u201cand I believe that, over time, protects human liberty by slowing down the expansion of government.\u201d\n\nAn interesting theory of politics. But here\u2019s another one: The filibuster is super annoying, and conservatives have a lot they\u2019ll want to get done under a hypothetically Republican president and Congress in 2017. If they want to repeal Obamacare and cut individual tax rates by trillions of dollars, they will either need to come up with the most creative budget reconciliation package of all time, or they will need to carve up the filibuster.\n\nThe question of what is to be done about the filibuster puts conservative ideology and conservative practice in pursuit of ideological ends in direct conflict. \u201cOver time,\u201d as Cruz says, conservatives believe that a better-greased pathway for legislation leads to bigger, bloated government. But conservatives also believe that serious conservative legislation rolling back the liberal achievements of the Obama administration (and Johnson and Roosevelt administrations) is needed immediately to save America from financial ruin, tyranny, famine, the apocalypse of liberty, and what have you.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "What happens when conservative ideology and
