Bob Andres, bandres@ajc.com\n\nThe current session of the General Assembly has produced some prosecutors who haven\u2019t been shrinking violets when it comes to criticism of legislation under debate.\n\nWe told you about the sharp attacks that state Rep. Allen Peake\u2019s medical marijuana bill received on Tuesday. Then there\u2019s the case of David Cooke, the Democratic district attorney from Macon who has raised questions about H.B. 29, the religious liberty bill introduced by state Rep. Sam Teasley, R-Marietta.\n\nLast month, Cooke said the bill would give child abusers a religious-based line of defense \u2013 a line of attack picked up by the liberal group Better Georgia, and denounced by prominent Republicans.\n\nCooke is back today with another op-ed in the Macon Telegraph that includes these lines:\n\nIn the last 20 years, there have been many \u201creligious liberty\u201d bills passed by state legislatures. Of all the religious liberty laws in place across the nation, H.B. 29, the \u201cPreventing Government Overreach on Religious Expression Act,\u201dis special. But not in a good way. Many of the bills passed in other states explicitly protect victims of violent crime, and do not allow their law to be used by abusers as a defense in trial. Some do not even allow their bill to be used as a defense against the failure to report suspected abuse\u2026. Georgia\u2019s version of this proposed law is unique because it provides no such protection. We should not open the door for activist judges to interpret this new law in a way that protects abusers. But the bill\u2019s supporters can\u2019t claim it\u2019s an oversight. The drafters of the bill know it could be used as a defense at a criminal trial, so they\u2019ve carved out an exception for child sexual abuse. By implication, any other crime would be subject to the law\u2019s defense. Even worse, the bill explicitly provides an avenue for abusive parents by protecting \u201cthe fundamental right of every parent\u201d to control the discipline of that child. In other words, \u201cspare the rod and spoil the child\u201d is given free reign, regardless of the size of the rod or the number of blows, even if the child dies from the abuse. Cobb County DA Vic Reynolds \u2013 a Republican \u2013 was asked about this bill, and he said he shared my concerns, as has every other prosecutor that I\u2019ve talked to\u2026. When asked, DA Reynolds had confidence that the problems he and I share with the bill will be worked out. Only now the politicians are saying that there isn\u2019t any problem to fix.\n\nAJC columnist Kyle Wingfield also notes the ties between Cooke and Better Georgia, which has emerged as one of the leading critics of the legislation. From Wingfield\u2019s column:\n\nA Better Georgia employee, Louis Elrod, managed Cooke\u2019s successful 2012 campaign for the DA job. Better Georgia mentions this on its website, and filings with the state ethics commission confirm as much. In 2013, other ethics filings show, Cooke\u2019s campaign paid Better Georgia $250 for a \u201csponsorship\u201d and another $500 for event tickets.\n\n***\n\nThe proposal for a 24-hour gaming attraction in south DeKalb will indeed face rough sledding, if Gov. Nathan Deal has anything to say about it.\n\nBut state Rep. Ron Stephens, a Savannah Republican who has long supported strategically placed casinos, said it could be worse. He outlined his nightmare scenario, a proposal in which Native American buyers with roots in Georgia quietly buy up land and then try to build a full-fledged casino.\n\n\u201cThey can totally bypass us. And it could have been a real interesting situation. They didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n***\n\nState Rep. Mike Jacobs, R-Brookhaven, chairman of the legislature\u2019s MARTA oversight committee, has dropped two bills that are likely to become part of the debate over transportation funding in Georgia.\n\nH.B. 213 would remove the state-imposed mandate that requires MARTA to split its expenditures from tax revenues 50-50 between operational and capital costs \u2013 as long as the transit agency submits itself to a management audit every four years.\n\nH.B. 214 would restore the MARTA board voting rights of the commissioner of the state Department of Transportation, at least until 2017. Right now he\u2019s a non-voting. Surely that change of status would mean there would be some state funds that he\u2019d need some say-so on \u2013 right, guys?\n\n***\n\nLast week, after House Republican leaders introduced the Transportation Funding Act of 2015, tea party activist Debbie Dooley struck, labeling the plan a tax-raising \u201cscheme\u201d:\n\n\u201cHouse Republicans are causing everyday Georgians to be burdened with higher taxes/gas prices while they give large corporations massive tax breaks and are helping fund a parking deck for the new Atlanta Falcons stadium,\u201d Dooley wrote in an alert to supporters\u2026.\n\nWe have been lax in reporting that this is not a universally held point of view among tea partyists. The following, more circumspect statement comes from Julianne Thompson, who has worked with Dooley in many a fray:\n\nA big complaint I have read by which many others seem to arise from is the conversion from a sales tax to an excise tax. I understand this puts a burden locally, however, if we are truly about Constitutionally limited government then we should be intellectually honest. The Georgia Constitution states that all money derived from motor fuel taxes should be used for infrastructure and maintenance of roads and bridges, so my opinion is that converting the sales tax to an excise tax is sound policy. That has not been the policy in the past and this bill addresses that and I am encouraged at the strides that were made to make this package more Constitutionally sound. I fought against TSPLOST and will continue to be a fiscal hawk. We will call out leaders that fail us, but we also need to praise them when they are trying to do what is right\n\nI do understand that things may change and the final bill may look different, but most people want to be proactive, not reactive. And I know the door is open to grassroots activists truly wanting to find consensus on a solution that we can no longer kick the can down the road and ignore.\u201d\n\n***\n\nU.S. Reps. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, and Hank Johnson, D-Lithonia, have introduced a bill to give the Congressional Gold Medal to the Freedom Riders of the early 1960s.\n\nThe 400 people, black and white, who challenged Jim Crow laws by riding buses in the South would share the medal, which would be displayed at the Smithsonian.\n\nThe bill is backed by former Atlanta mayor Andrew Young and has 136 co-sponsors so far. Not among those co-sponsors is Rep. John Lewis, D-Atlanta, perhaps because it would be a tad gauche to sponsor a bill to give yourself a medal.\n\n***\n\nThe U.S. House voted on party lines to repeal Obamacare, and you can be forgiven if a feeling of deja vu comes with that sentence.\n\nRepublican aides said it was the 67th vote to alter or repeal the law, including eight votes for full repeal. But the important thing was to make sure the freshmen got their \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d merit badge before this month\u2019s recess.\n\nAnd they were excited, at least according to their press releases. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Monroe, was \u201cthrilled.\u201d Rep. Rick Allen, R-Evans, was \u201cproud.\u201d Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Cassville, even hailed the repeat vote as \u201ca strong departure from business-as-usual.\u201d\n\n***\n\nGeorgia\u2019s fourth House freshman, Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Pooler, also bemoaned Obamacare\u2019s impact on the health care profession, but this op-ed in the Savannah Morning News caught our eye even more. Carter, as a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, went on a fact-finding trip to the Mexican border and \u2014 remarkably \u2014 found some facts he did not already assume to be true:\n\nI was thoroughly convinced that a fence across the entire border was the answer to border security. However, after meeting with these [Arizona] ranchers who live this situation on a daily basis, I realize that I was wrong. Almost in unison, the ranchers all say that they need more technology and, above anything else, boots on the ground. The terrain out here is tough, to say the least. Where the mountains stop, the desert starts and most of the area is desolate.\n\nThe full op-ed describes the changing border conditions and challenges Carter saw from San Diego to Texas.\n\n***\n\nWe have a post-script to state Sen. Vincent Fort\u2019s unforgettable attack on Gov. Nathan Deal\u2019s attempt to empower the state to intervene with failing schools.\n\n\u201cGiving Nathan Deal a school system to run is like giving a drunk the keys to the car,\u201d was what Fort told fellow Democrats in a red-meat address at the party\u2019s state convention.\n\nWe were reminded that his attack has a major flaw: Deal doesn\u2019t drink.\n\n***\n\nSome dispiriting news about millennials \u2014 you know, the generation that\u2019s taking everything over. A new Fusion poll of 18-34-year-olds shows that 77 percent cannot name one of the two U.S. senators from their states.\n\nWe think any such test is unfair if you didn\u2019t give them time to Google it on their phones.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/02/04/prosecutor-takes-another-swing-at-religious-liberty-bill/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/012915-leg-religious-ba08.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Georgia Baptist Convention leaders and clergy gathered last week to support \u201creligious liberty\u201d bills proposed for this session of the General Assembly.
