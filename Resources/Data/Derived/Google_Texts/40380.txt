Kevin Judd has been in recruiting overdrive the last few weeks.

The Cal Lutheran men’s volleyball coach needs to fill an entire roster from scratch for the inaugural 2015-2016 season.

Judd is trying to find a mix of incoming freshmen and community college transfers to launch the program.

“I have literally been going out to as many volleyball matches as I can at the high schools and junior colleges,” Judd said. “It’s been very busy, and I have been getting at least a name or two of new guys each week. Some of them see me at games and others have just found out online about CLU.”

Judd doesn’t have scholarships to offer at the Division III level, but he can sell players on the chance to be trailblazers in CLU athletics history.

Judd has already received a few commitments from local players. He doesn’t want to reveal any names until their paperwork is processed.

“My intention in the beginning is to hit the local area hard the first year or two. We are a volleyball power right here in Southern California. It’s just a hotbed for it,” Judd said. “But even though I haven’t been able to watch kids out of state, I’ve had kids emailing me from Hawaii and Arizona and even a kid from Massachusetts. It’s great because it means the word is spreading.”

CLU announced men’s volleyball would be the university’s 21st varsity sport in early December. Judd was named the head coach a month later.

Judd will continue to be an assistant for the CLU women’s volleyball team. CLU women’s head coach Kellee Roesel will be an assistant for the men’s program.

Judd and Roesel are working to put the finishing touches on the men’s first schedule for the spring of 2016.

CLU is one of only two Division III men’s volleyball programs in California along with UC Santa Cruz. The Kingsmen will compete as an independent.

CLU will be traveling East to participate in a few tournaments and is hosting two tournaments at the Gilbert Sports and Fitness Center. One of the tournaments at CLU will be in partnership with UC Santa Cruz.

Judd said he’s received a warm reception from other Division III coaches while on the recruiting trail.

“At a tournament in Anaheim, we ran into some coaches from back East and they were very positive,” Judd said. “The Nazareth (College) coach even offered to waive our entry fee if we can make it back to their tournament. The coaches have been very supportive of us starting a new program.”

Judd will finish this school year teaching science at Sequoia Middle School before joining the CLU faculty full time in June.

As the women’s assistant coach, Judd has become well known for his creative team-building activities. He takes ideas from TV shows like “Survivor” and “The Amazing Race” or creates Olympic-style competition to help players pass the time during long tournament breaks.

CLU athletic director Dan Kuntz took notice of Judd’s meticulous execution, and gave him with an extra job title. Along with his volleyball coaching duties, Judd is the “team chemistry coordinator” at CLU.

“He loves everything we have done with the women’s program and he wants me to help the other programs at CLU,” Judd said. “I have already helped the men’s water polo team, and had other coaches call and ask about me to create something for them to build off-court chemistry.”

Judd is eager to devote all of his energy to CLU, and try to start the men’s volleyball program off on the right foot.

“I am really excited about how things are going so far,” Judd said. “It’s kind of just a waiting game now to see how many kids we can get as they make their decisions about coming to CLU. Hopefully we will get quite a few.”
