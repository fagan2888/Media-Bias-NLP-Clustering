Richard E. Neal, D-Springfield, has remained bullish on the Affordable Care Act, undaunted by the controversy that has surrounded its roll-out and by polls that show significant public opposition.\n\n\n\nNeal, during a visit to two health center programs in Springfield on Thursday, defended the act, saying the \u201cstatus quo\u201d for health care in the United States was not working, and the opposition to the new act has failed to offer any better solution.\n\n\n\nNeal said the law will improve the longevity of the federal Medicare insurance program; will provide insurance to roughly 40 million more Americans who were not insured; provides a \u201cheavy emphasis\u201d on preventive care to help reduce health costs, and will \u201cend the scourge\u201d of people being denied insurance for pre-existing conditions.\n\n\n\n\u201cHalf the bankruptcies in America were health care related,\u201d Neal said. \u201cYou got sick, you lost your job, you lost everything. Not any longer.\u201d\n\n\n\nOpponents, including Republican legislators, have sharply criticized the program, many saying it has been confusing and cumbersome for the public; will result in substantial increases in fees and taxes to afford the program, and will be a burden on businesses and result in job losses. The registration of millions of Americans was marred with technological glitches and delays.\n\nWhile the program has triggered opposition and controversy, Neal said Medicare was also met with strong opposition when first introduced in 1965, and is now embraced.\n\n\n\n\u201cRemember the roll-out of Medicare was rocky, very rocky,\u201d Neal said.\n\n\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also referred to as Obamacare, did have serious problems in its launch, Neal said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the president is correct \u2014 the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act has been inexcusable, particularly from a technological perspective,\u201d Neal said. \u201cBut the technology side of it can be repaired. The problem is that the technological argument is overshadowing many of the good parts of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is \u201cno question\u201d that debate over the act is dwarfing many other issues before Congress and making it harder to address those other issues, Neal said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will become in many parts of the country the sole focus of the opposition,\u201d Neal said. \u201cOf that, there is little doubt.\u201d\n\n\n\nNeal on Thursday visited Fallon Community Health Plan\u2019s Summit ElderCare program on Wason Avenue, that opened last year, and also visited the Behavioral Health Center clinic at 417 Liberty St.\n\n\n\nPolls by CNN and other organizations have indicated that the majority of Americans oppose the Affordable Care Act. Many fear their insurance costs will increase.\n\n\n\nUnder the act, health insurance coverage is mandatory, and needs to be, just as automobile insurance in Massachusetts is mandatory, Neal said. In each case, someone may not get sick or hurt, but the insurance is there because someone may get sick or hurt, he said.\n\n\n\nThe opposition has said that government should \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, but there is no way you can eliminate the insurance mandate and keep the ban on pre-existing conditions, Neal said.\n\n\n\nAsked if the program may hurt Obama\u2019s legacy, Neal said the program will be debated \u201cfor a long period of time.\u201d\n\n\n\nDuring Neal\u2019s tour of the Summit Eldercare program, Fallon administrators and staff pointed out myriad of programs for senior citizen participants including its All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) program.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think in a lot of ways, this is the face of what health care is going to look like as we embark on the baby boom generation\u2019s retirement,\u201d Neal said. \u0090\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act, richard-neal, springfield, news", "title": "U.S. Rep.
