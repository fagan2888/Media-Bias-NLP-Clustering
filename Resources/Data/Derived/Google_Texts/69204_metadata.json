It\u2019s still the economy, stupid.\n\nposted at 8:01 pm on October 6, 2014 by Jazz Shaw\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since we heard from healthcare.gov and the fallout of the law, but we\u2019re approaching the end of the year and the period when most of us will begin looking at our tax situation. For those who were fortunate enough to still have jobs with health benefits (and who got to keep them, as promised) or those who earned so little that they qualified for mostly subsidized Obamacare, they won\u2019t see much of an effect. But by the latest estimates there are still roughly 41 million Americans without insurance who did not enroll in the government plan who are about to pay a stiff penalty to Uncle Sam. Why is that?\n\nThis is a question which was of particular interest to me because I know some folks in this situation personally. Are they just so woefully uninformed that they didn\u2019t know about the new law? Are they such haters of Barack Obama that they are willing to incur a significant fine at tax time to spite him? No and no. For most, as with the people profiled in this report from Yahoo Finance, they earned \u201ctoo much\u201d money for subsidies but just couldn\u2019t afford the unsubsidized premiums.\n\n\u201cI was excited to finally have an opportunity to have insurance,\u201d [Marta Hardy] says. \u201cThen I checked [the marketplace] and I found that the lowest tier Bronze plan was going to run me $725 per month, plus a $6,300 annual deductible. That is a house payment or two car payments for me.\u201d Hardy decided not to sign up. Come tax time, she, like most people who decided to forgo insurance in 2014, will have to pay for that decision. The penalty this year is 1% of gross annual income or $95 per adult (whichever is greater), plus $47.50 per child.\n\nThe report goes on to say that roughly one third of the uninsured cited the cost of the Obamacare plans as the number one reason they had no insurance. Marsha Danley, also featured in the article, makes $68K annually and did not qualify for any subsidy. The premiums would have been $500 per month with a $5K deductible. She might have been able to manage it, but was already $20K in debt with medical bills for her mother which she was paying off. It just made more sense to cough up the $680 at tax time than try to find $6,000 she didn\u2019t have for the Obamacare premiums.\n\nThese are not unusual stories. In fact, I don\u2019t know many working class people who could casually take on an additional 500 dollar per month bill if they are already in a tenuous enough professional and financial position that they had been left without insurance to begin with. If they were so flush with cash that they could sock away half a grand per month, they\u2019d probably already have insurance. And what do they get for that payment? A plan where if \u2013 God forbid \u2013 something does happen, they will have to lay out six thousand dollars in medical bills before the full insurance benefits kicked in.\n\nAnd they are expected to do this at a time when labor force participation is at an all time low, many work multiple part time jobs, and wages are stagnant for those who have managed to find work. Does this really come as a surprise? But now they\u2019ll get another surprise when their tax bill comes, and it won\u2019t be a pleasant one.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Decision point plus", "title": "Why so many uninsured passed on Obamacare.
