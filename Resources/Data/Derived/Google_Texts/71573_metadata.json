His railroad has a near monopoly on the transportation of oil from the Bakken and oil sands, and 52% of oil from the Bakken is transported by railroad.\n\nI recommend you pick up 100 shares of BRK.A at $220,000 a share:\n\nNot really \u2014 the sell-off when Warren (84) dies will be epic.\n\nThe Best Free Investment You''ll Ever Make Our analysts have traveled the world over, dedicated to finding the best and most profitable investments in the global energy markets.

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes.\n\nThis is the second oil train crash this week. Another train also carrying Bakken crude derailed in Ontario.\n\nThere have been nine such mishaps in the past two years. The most notable was when an oil train took out the small town of Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Canada and killed 47 people.\n\nWonderful, Wild West Virginia\n\nI know that Ms. Hannah probably doesn\u2019t condescend to slum in West Virginia. But I do \u2014 it's a fantastic wilderness state.\n\nThere is an abundance of pristine outdoor areas to mountain bike, camp, kayak, and fly fish. I take personal offense at the Hollywood elite, coupled with well-connected billionaires and politicians, and their idiotic protests and policies that are destroying my environment.\n\nPipelines don't fly off the rails and kill 47 people. Obama's own State Department released a report in March of 2013 saying that rails have an \u201cincreased statistical likelihood of spills.\u201d\n\nEvery piece of the data out there says pipelines are safer than rail. Pipes are also $8 to $9 a barrel cheaper.\n\nSo naturally, the smart thing to do would be to get going on building the Keystone pipeline right away. It would be good for the environment, create jobs for those roughnecks that just got fired, save money, and reduce the probability of igniting a rolling bomb of black fiery death.\n\nCongress recently cleared a bill approving the Keystone XL pipeline and sent it to the President.\n\nObama says he will veto it.\n\nSo it goes,\n\nChristian DeHaemer\n\nP.S.
