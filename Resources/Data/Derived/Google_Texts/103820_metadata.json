CEO narcissism is significantly correlated with CEO total compensation, the gap in compensation between the CEO and the senior team and the total value of the CEO\u2019s share holdings, according to a study on \u201cNarcissistic CEOs and executive compensation.\u201d\n\nThey have a hard time retaining talents. Employees who identified their managers and CEOs as humble reported feeling more engaged and less likely to leave a company, suggesting that while narcissistic CEOs may be good at attracting talents, it might be harder for them to retain these employees, according to a study on \u201cHumility in Organizations: Implications for Performance, Teams, and Leadership.\u201d\n\nThey pay more for acquisitions. Narcissistic CEOs are highly responsive to social praise, both in the forms of media praise and awards, a study on \u201cExecutive personality, capability cues and risk taking: how narcissistic CEOs react to their successes and stumbles\u201d found. This search for media exposure increases risk taking, which can translate into more frequent acquisitions and higher premiums paid for these acquisitions, and ultimately damage shareholder value.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While narcissist CEOs can use their charisma and risk-taking tendencies to lead a comp", "title": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Narcissistic CEOs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/28/Good-Bad-and-Ugly-Narcissistic-CEOs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07282014_Boss_Man_Suit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/28/Good-Bad-and-Ugly-Narcissistic-CEOs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07282014_Boss_Man_Suit.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "While narcissist CEOs can use their charisma and risk-taking tendencies to lead a comp", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d62\"", "article_summary": "Here are other behaviors of narcissistic CEOs and how they can affect their companies:They make more money.\nNarcissistic CEOs are highly responsive to social praise, both in the forms of media praise and awards, a study on \u201cExecutive personality, capability cues and risk taking: how narcissistic CEOs react to their successes and stumbles\u201d found.\nCompanies led by narcissistic CEOs reported higher earnings-per-share and share price than companies with non-narcissistic CEOs, according to a study, \u201cCEO narcissism and accounting: a picture of profits,\u201d recently published in the Journal of Management Accounting Research, according to Phys.org, a science and technology news service.\nCEO narcissism is significantly correlated with CEO total compensation, the gap in compensation between the CEO and the senior team and the total value of the CEO\u2019s share holdings, according to a study on \u201cNarcissistic CEOs and executive compensation.\u201dThey have a hard time retaining talents.\nRelated: 5 Smart Steps to Combat Workplace Bullying\u201cOn one hand, there may be something about individuals with narcissistic personality tendencies that helps them excel in executive leadership positions,\u201d wrote Kari Joseph Olsen from the University of Southern California, in a 2011 version of the research paper, which studied narcissistic CEOs at Fortune 500 companies."}
