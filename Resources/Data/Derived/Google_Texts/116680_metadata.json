Michaels Stores Inc., Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and others followed in Target\u2019s wake with their own security lapses in 2014.\n\nBecause of the magnitude of compromised data this year, the biggest concern for holiday shoppers is how their already stolen information \u2014 such as credit card numbers, user names and passwords \u2014 will be handled during the busy spending season, Hart said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen with the breaches announced by Target and Home Depot and JPMorgan Chase is that we\u2019ve put in jeopardy millions of consumers\u2019 personal information,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat loss of personal information is now going to be leveraged by fraudsters who will combine different pieces of that information in opening up unauthorized lines of credit and leveraging it for highly profitable fraudulent endeavors.\u201d\n\nShoppers should be on high alert for suspicious activity on their bank accounts during the weeks between the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.\n\nThe number of breaches tracked by the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit group that provides counseling services to identify theft victims, has risen 25 percent in 2014 from the year before. The counseling center compiles media reports and records obtained from state attorneys general and has found about 679 data breaches nationwide so far this year.\n\nData breaches occur when fraudsters break into computer systems to steal consumer names, payment card numbers, medical records and other information. Personal cellphones, tablets and computers infected by malware through phishing emails and other scams can also be breached, Hart said.\n\nIn fact, Hart says, the next big data breach has already happened, but the affected company just doesn\u2019t know it yet because it can take weeks to months to detect.\n\nRetail breaches are attention-grabbing, but according to the National Retail Federation, more breaches occur at government agencies (13 percent) and financial institutions (34 percent). The trade group says 10 percent of breaches are at retailers, and 11 percent are at hotels and restaurants.\n\nNot all data breaches are created equal, adds Eva Velasquez, chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center, based in San Diego. The risk is different for each disclosure because it depends on what information has been compromised.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s a matter of simply payment card information, that is generally less difficult to remediate and does less extensive damage,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cWhen you have a debit card compromised, there\u2019s potential a thief could go in and clear all your accounts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a breach where other sensitive, personally identifying information is compromised, like your Social Security number and date of birth, things of that nature, that can be much more devastating,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat actually gives the thief the ability to act as you,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can file for government benefits in your name; they can file a false tax return.\u201d\n\nPerhaps most troubling is that consumer data are no safer now than in past years, despite increasing reports of security failures, said James Thurston, spokesman for the Ohio Bankers League.\n\n\u201cSadly it isn\u2019t, and the reason why not is because the hackers, cybercriminals are getting more sophisticated. We\u2019re talking about organized crime in places like Russia, China and Eastern Europe,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cThe retailers\u2019 defenses have not kept pace with the sophistication of hackers,\u201d he said.\n\nChelsey Levingston,\n\nDayton Daily News\n\nAT A GLANCE\n\nHere are tips to help consumers better protect their information:\n\nKnow that online shopping is riskier than brick-and-mortar sales. Online shoppers should be wary that the website they are browsing is legitimate. Today, a lot of imitation websites look like the real thing. Make sure the hardware and software being used to browse hasn\u2019t been compromised by a virus or malware. At an online checkout, one of the things to be aware of is that the session with the retailer is secure. The way to tell is to look for \u201chttps\u201d in the website address and look for the \u201cs\u201d at the end. If there\u2019s no \u201cs,\u201d don\u2019t add any personal information or credit card number through that website.\n\nActivate online banking alerts to receive notifications of account activity.\n\n>Especially online, pay with a prepaid card or credit card because there are more protections. With credit cards, there\u2019s a zero liability or minimal liability for customers from fraudulent charges. Also, the Fair Credit Billing Act gives customers the right to dispute credit card charges and temporarily withhold payment while the dispute is investigated.\n\nReview financial statements to make sure debit and credit card transactions are reconciled accurately. Shoppers are encouraged to keep receipts for all purchases, in the store and online, including order numbers and warranties. That way, when it comes time to reconcile purchases with a statement, those records are available. In previous data breaches, criminals have attempted to post a small charge to check for live accounts or to see whether a consumer is monitoring an account. Larger fraudulent charges could occur hours, weeks or months later.\n\nAlert the bank or credit union immediately if fraudulent charges or debits are suspected.\n\nTake advantage of free credit monitoring services if provided by affected impacted retailers. Consumers should deal directly with the retailer to avoid falling prey to phishing scams or other fake credit monitoring offers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Holiday shoppers must worry how their already stolen information \u2014 such as credit card numbers, usernames and passwords \u2014 will be used during the busy spending season.", "og": {"description": "Holiday shoppers must worry how their already stolen information \u2014 such as credit card numbers, usernames and passwords \u2014 will be used during the busy spending season.", "title": "Data breaches put holiday shoppers at higher risk for fraud", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141128-data-breaches-put-holiday-shoppers-at-higher-risk-for-fraud.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141128-securing_credit_cards_34906787.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/SECURING_CREDIT_CARDS_34906787.JPG", "height": 494}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-11-29T02:56:12Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-11-29T02:41:12Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Data breaches put holiday shoppers at higher risk for fraud\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141128-data-breaches-put-holiday-shoppers-at-higher-risk-for-fraud.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141128-securing_credit_cards_34906787.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/SECURING_CREDIT_CARDS_34906787.JPG\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2067835\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-11-29T02:41:12Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20141128-securing_credit_cards_34906787.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/SECURING_CREDIT_CARDS_34906787.JPG", "publishtime": "2014-11-29T02:41:12Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33d0\"", "article_summary": "Not all data breaches are created equal, adds Eva Velasquez, chief executive of the Identity Theft Resource Center, based in San Diego.\nThe counseling center compiles media reports and records obtained from state attorneys general and has found about 679 data breaches nationwide so far this year.\nIn previous data breaches, criminals have attempted to post a small charge to check for live accounts or to see whether a consumer is monitoring an account.\nData breaches occur when fraudsters break into computer systems to steal consumer names, payment card numbers, medical records and other information.\nOnline shoppers should be wary that the website they are browsing is legitimate."}
