Sioux Falls, SD

When you watch Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade tomorrow, be sure to look for the six balloons made right here in Sioux Falls.

Raven Aerostar has been designing and making the huge parade baloons for the annual parade for 31 years.

This is a record year for Raven Aerostar with six large parade balloons in the parade.

There are five new characters, including a new Pickachu with Snowpoke, Erptor, Thomas the Tank Engine, Red Mighty Morphin Power Ranger, Paddington Bear and a repeat build of the Pillsbury Doughboy.

Since 1984, Raven Aerostar has built 89 large character balloons, 22 medium character balloons, 6 "balloonicles" and many small Macy's inspired balloons. 25 employees work on each balloon beginning in April. Raven Aeorstar says Thomas the Tank Engine was the most difficult balloon to construct because of its square shape It look 1450 hand-tied lines inside to keep it in its train shape.

Since 1984, every large character balloon you've seen in the parade, except one, has been built by Raven Aerostar.

The first balloons Raven Aerostar built for the Macy's parade were Raggedy Ann and Garfield. Macy's typically uses the balloons for three to five years, before retiring them.
