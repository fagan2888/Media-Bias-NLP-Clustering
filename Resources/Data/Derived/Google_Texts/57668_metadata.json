Currently, the governor has sole authority.\n\nRep. Ed Lindsey, R-Atlanta, is staunchly opposed to expansion and said the financial stakes are simply too high.\n\n\u201cBudget issues should start here in the people\u2019s chamber. The folks who are closest to the people,\u201d said Lindsey.\n\nThe bill ultimately passed along party lines, 118-57.\n\nAnother bill, HB 707, would prohibit state and local governments and agencies from using any of their resources to assist the rollout of the health law. The navigator program at the University of Georgia, for example, would be halted. HB 707 passed 115-59.\n\nLess partisan was HB 885, a bill legalizing the limited use of medical marijuana to treat seizures.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity to say to the state, \u2018we have compassion and we want to be committed to seeking a solution for Georgia families,\u2019\u201d said bill sponsor Allen Peake, R-Macon.\n\nUnder the legislation, a handful of academic research centers including Emory and Morehouse would cultivate the marijuana and process it into cannabis oil.\n\nDespite concerns from Majority Leader Larry O'Neal that the marijuana could be used for \u201chippie reasons,\u201d HB 885 passed overwhelmingly, 171-4.\n\nAround 11 p.m., House Republicans passed one of the more controversial bills of the day. HB 772 would subject food stamp and welfare applicants and recipients to drug testing if there's \"reasonable suspicion\" they are using drugs. It passed 107-66, with Democrats speaking strongly against it.\n\nIn 2012, state lawmakers passed similar legislation that required drug testing for all welfare recipients, but Fourth Amendment issues of illegal search and seizure kept it from being implemented. Democrats say the new drug test proposal is unconstitutional and would undoubtedly attract a costly lawsuit.\n\nIn other action, a bill paving the way for a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. on the Capitol grounds easily won passage, 173-3.\n\n\u201cMy vision is it will become a shrine of achievement,\" said O\u2019Neal, a co-sponsor of HB 1080. \"A shining beacon for many people from all around the world to come and see and enjoy and not just to enjoy, they will come and reflect.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neil says construction could begin as soon as 2015.\n\nAnother approved bill - the more controversial HB 702 - calls for a Capitol monument featuring, among other documents, the Ten Commandments.\n\nAmong the more high-profile bills that didn\u2019t make the Crossover deadline, HB 907 would have placed new regulations on smartphone-based car services such as Uber and Lyft. It was never called for a floor vote.\n\nAll approved legislation still must pass the Senate and be signed by the governor. The session is set to wrap-up March 20.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Medical marijuana, Medicaid expansion, and drug testing for food stamp and welfare recipients are just some of the topics state House members debated well", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wabe.org/post/marijuana-medicaid-food-stamp-drug-testing-make-crossover-deadline", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wabe/files/styles/medium/public/201403/0104_IMG_9237-XL_1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Medical marijuana, Medicaid expansion, and drug testing for food stamp and welfare recipients are just some of the topics state House members debated well", "title": "Marijuana, Medicaid & Food Stamp Drug Testing Make Crossover Deadline"}, "story_id": 285471034, "twitter": {"site": "@wabenews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jmshapiro"}, "author": "Jonathan Shapiro", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Marijuana, Medicaid &amp; Food Stamp Drug Testing Make Crossover Deadline"}, "nid": 53783, "datePublished": "2014-03-03", "keywords": "Allen Peake, Ed Lindsey, Larry O\\'Neal, MLK, medical marijuana, Crossover Day, Georgia Legislature 2014", "wordCount": 665, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0c3\"", "article_summary": "HB 772 would subject food stamp and welfare applicants and recipients to drug testing if there's \"reasonable suspicion\" they are using drugs.\nMedical marijuana, Medicaid expansion, and drug testing for food stamp and welfare recipients are just some of the topics state House members debated well into Monday night during Crossover Day, the key deadline in which legislation must pass at least one chamber to remain alive for the session.\nIn 2012, state lawmakers passed similar legislation that required drug testing for all welfare recipients, but Fourth Amendment issues of illegal search and seizure kept it from being implemented.\nHouse Bill 990 would give the Legislature new power to decide whether the state expands Medicaid under the health law.\nDespite concerns from Majority Leader Larry O'Neal that the marijuana could be used for \u201chippie reasons,\u201d HB 885 passed overwhelmingly, 171-4."}
