The collaboration will include direct communication between Centura Health providers, including Colorado Health Neighborhoods, Centura Health\u2019s clinically integrated network, and Healthcare Clinic nurse practitioners to facilitate care coordination and sharing of patient information, and enhanced awareness of Healthcare Clinic at select Walgreens and the Centura Health network.\n\nHealthcare Clinic providers are able to help monitor, manage and support Centura Health patients with diabetes, asthma, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. While Walgreens and Healthcare Clinic strongly encourage all patients to have a designated medical home for ongoing needs, the collaboration will provide the patients of Centura Health access to quality, non-emergent care seven days a week, with or without an appointment.\n\n\u201cThis clinical collaboration further supports our strategic efforts to expand our Total Health Solution to consumers. Centura Health and the Healthcare Clinic at select Walgreens will promote quality care through evidence-based medicine and best practices, and increase convenience through multiple access points, within a service-friendly environment, at an affordable cost,\u201d said Gary Campbell, Centura Health\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cWorking hand-in-hand, this coordinated care model enables us to carry out our combined vision to deliver optimal health care value and support population health management. The result is more people get the right care, at the right time, in the right place, for the right price.\u201d\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act bringing millions of newly insured patients into the health care system, the relationship aims to help address some of the needs and challenges facing both patients and providers.\n\n\u201cHealthcare Clinics are playing an important role in enhancing patient access to quality, convenient and affordable care, and serve as a cost-effective alternative to emergency rooms for non-emergent care,\u201d said Alan E. London, chief medical officer, Consumer Solutions Group, Walgreens. \u201cThe health care system today is facing myriad challenges, and this collaboration enables our nurse practitioners and physician assistants to further coordinate patient care in these communities, working closely with primary care physicians and others to help more people get, stay and live well.\u201d\n\nHealthcare Clinic at select Walgreens locations partnering with Centura Health include:\n\n5190 W. 120th Ave., Broomfield\n\n6820 Centennial Blvd., Colorado Springs\n\n5755 Constitution Ave., Colorado Springs\n\n8705 Lexington Dr., Colorado Springs\n\n6200 E Colfax Ave., Denver\n\n2975 Federal Blvd., Denver\n\n1505 S.
