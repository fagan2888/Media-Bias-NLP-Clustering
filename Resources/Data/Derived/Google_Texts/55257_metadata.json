Using the same FDA-cleared formulation of potassium ferrate and hydrophilic polymer found in StatSeal Powder, StatSeal Disc creates an instant seal to stop the flow of blood and exudates from PICC and central line insertions. The seal keeps access sites dry, intact and protected from contamination.\n\nWhile traditional access dressings (sponges, gels, gauze) absorb blood and exudates, mandating dressing changes three times in seven days on average, one StatSeal Disc application lasts seven days to dramatically minimize dressing disruption.\n\n\u201cLike we\u2019ve seen in our hospital, the study reports that disruption of the catheter\u2019s dressing increases the risk of colonization or infection, as much as 12-fold,\u201d says Louis M. Guzzi, MD, a critical care physician in Orlando, Fla. \u201cSince keeping the site pristine and sterile is paramount to a healthy outcome, I\u2019m glad that a proven powder we already use to seal access sites is now available in a convenient disc that fits securely around the catheter. This easy-to-use application will definitely prove beneficial to our nurses, patents and even our purchasing managers.\u201d\n\nCurrently, StatSeal Powder is used in hospitals around the country, including six of the top 10 children\u2019s hospitals. According to Lauren Blough, RN, at Biolife, the new disc is being clinically tested in many of the top hospitals in the country\n\n\u201cFrom my own experience as a nurse for over 25 years and then traveling the country to meet with doctors on behalf of StatSeal, I see firsthand how big an issue dressing disruptions are,\u201d says Blough. \u201cFor the first time, medical professionals have an effective and proven alternative to absorbent dressings including the CHG sponges and gels. When these products are left soiled and unchanged, they can contribute to infections.\u201d\n\nBased on feedback from the company\u2019s own testing, Blough states, \u201cThe use of StatSeal requires less training, leads to shorter product evaluation, is less disruptive to the access site and provides patients with greater comfort\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe StatSeal disc is a game changer,\u201d says Guzzi. \u201cFor PICC and central line insertions, the disc keeps the sites dry and intact. It is truly the future of vascular access care.\u201d\n\nFree samples of StatSeal Disc are available by contacting Biolife at customercare@biolife.com.\n\nReference: Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Timsit JF, et al.
