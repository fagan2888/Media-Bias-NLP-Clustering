Circuit heard oral arguments in Halbig v. Sebelius, one of four lawsuits challenging the legality of implementing certain ACA provisions in the 34 states with federally established health insurance Exchanges. On May 14, a panel of the Fourth Circuit heard arguments in a related case, King v. Sebelius. Rulings in these cases could come at any time.\n\nWashington & Lee University law professor Timothy Jost recently provided commentary on Halbig, King, and two similar cases. Since our research helped to generate these lawsuits, Health Affairs Blog invited us to respond, as we have responded to Jost\u2019s previous commentary on this issue.\n\nThe ACA Authorizes Certain Provisions Only in States that Establish Exchanges\n\nThe Halbig cases, as we will call them, are simple and straightforward.\n\nProf. Jost has written, and we agree, that the statutory eligibility rules for the ACA\u2019s premium-assistance tax credits \u201cclearly say\u201d that eligibility \u201cdepends on the applicant being enrolled in a qualified health plan \u2018through an Exchange established by the State.\u2019\u201d The rules employ that restrictive phrase nine times, without deviation. Since the Act explicitly ties its cost-sharing subsidies, employer-mandate penalties, and (in many cases) individual-mandate penalties to the availability of these tax credits, it therefore also authorizes those provisions only in states that establish Exchanges. Congress simply did not authorize those spending and revenue measures in the 34 states that opted for a federal Exchange.\n\nThis condition was not a fluke or a drafting error. Congress routinely conditions individual entitlements to health-insurance subsidies (including refundable tax credits) on state cooperation with federal requirements \u2013 see, for example, Medicaid, the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and the Health Coverage Tax Credit \u2013 and the remainder of the ACA and its legislative history are fully consistent with this condition. In the ACA\u2019s legislative history, both Republicans and Democrats introduced legislation conditioning various subsidies on states establishing an Exchange. This brief provides examples.\n\nOf note, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee reported to the full Senate a bill that withheld subsidies from a state\u2019s residents for four years if the state failed to establish an Exchange, and permanently withheld Exchange subsidies if the state failed to implement the bill\u2019s employer mandate. The Finance Committee approved and reported to the full Senate the ACA\u2019s language, which clearly, categorically, and permanently withholds tax credits in states that fail to establish an Exchange.\n\nBefore the House approved the ACA, a group of House Democrats actually complained about this feature. They likened the Senate-passed ACA\u2019s Exchange provisions to another program that conditions individual entitlements on state action (SCHIP). They warned that hostile states could block their residents from receiving \u201cany benefit\u201d by refusing to establish an Exchange, just as some states denied their residents the benefits of the just-passed Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 by refusing to participate.\n\nTo help overcome such resistance, Prof. Jost and 50 other health policy experts wrote a letter to House Democrats. They agreed the ACA was \u201cimperfect,\u201d yet urged the House to pass it anyway. The House, including each member of the group that complained about the conditional nature of the ACA\u2019s Exchange subsidies, then voted to enact the ACA, including that condition.\n\nThe Obama Administration Unilaterally Created a New Entitlement\n\nDespite clear statutory language, in 2011 the Obama administration announced it would implement those subsidies and penalties in states that did not establish Exchanges. It cited no legal authority for its decision, which sparked instant and sustained criticism, from both the public and members of Congress. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service wrote, \u201cA strictly textual analysis of the plain meaning of the provision would likely lead to the conclusion that the IRS\u2019s authority to issue the premium tax credits is limited only to situations in which the taxpayer is enrolled in a state-established Exchange.\u201d\n\nThe administration persevered, and is currently spending billions of dollars to subsidize Exchange enrollees in 34 states \u2014 two-thirds of the country \u2014 with no legal authority. Those subsidies are an important reason why Exchanges have enrolled 8 million Americans, or whatever the real number is.\n\nThe Halbig CasesDo Not Challenge the ACA\n\nThe plaintiffs in the Halbig cases are as diverse as two state governments, several private employers, several individual taxpayers, and dozens of public-school systems. They allege that the implementation of these spending and revenue measures in states that did not establish Exchanges is subjecting them to penalties from which they are, by law, exempt.\n\nThe plaintiffs are not questioning the constitutionality of any part of the ACA. They are not asking the courts to alter a single jot or tittle of the statute. They are asking the courts to stop the Obama administration from rewriting the statute \u2014 to put an end to the unauthorized spending that is subjecting them to penalties that Congress likewise never authorized. The National Federation of Independent Business, the attorneys general of Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia, West Virginia, and South Carolina, and various other groups have filed amicus briefs on behalf of the plaintiffs.\n\nDefending the Indefensible\n\nIn the hope of finding some legal justification for its actions, the Obama administration and its supporters, including Prof. Jost, have gone on a fishing expedition in the ACA and its legislative history. They have come up dry. The administration\u2019s counter-textual theory of congressional intent finds no support in the statute or legislative history.\n\nBut don\u2019t take our word for it. Ask Prof. Jost to identify any statutory provisions or elements of the ACA\u2019s legislative history that \u201cclearly say\u201d Congress intended the ACA to authorize tax credits in federal Exchanges. He cannot. He will instead cite parts of the statute and legislative history that might be compatible with an intent to offer tax credits in federal Exchanges, but that are equally or more compatible with the tax-credit eligibility rules that \u201cclearly\u201d express a contrary intent.\n\nWe emphasize: in nearly three years, the administration has not identified a single statutory provision or piece of legislative history indicating that Congress intended the ACA to authorize tax credits in federal Exchanges. Every statutory provision and piece of legislative history the administration\u2019s cites in its defense is fully compatible with the statutory requirement that tax-credit recipients enroll \u201cthrough an Exchange established by the State.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s strongest argument is that Congress could have authorized tax credits in states that did not establish Exchanges, such as by deeming federally established Exchanges to be \u201cestablished by the State.\u201d But Congress did no such thing.\n\nThe Government\u2019s Two Victories\n\nIf these cases are as clear as we say, you might ask, why have two federal district courts ruled against the plaintiffs? Good question.\n\nIn Halbig and King, two federal judges held that Exchanges established by the federal government are, somehow, \u201cestablished by the State,\u201d even though Congress never designated them as such. Those rulings are currently on appeal to the D.C. Circuit and 4th Circuit, respectively.\n\nChallenges brought by the attorneys general of Oklahoma (Pruitt v. Sebelius) and Indiana (Indiana v. IRS, whose plaintiffs also include dozens of Indiana school districts) await district-court consideration. (Click here for all briefs and rulings in all four cases.)\n\nCaveat Lector\n\nHealth Affairs readers should keep a few facts in mind when reading Prof. Jost\u2019s commentary on this issue.\n\nIn mid-2011, when the administration proposed issuing subsidies through federal Exchanges, we were the first to criticize the proposal, and Jost was the first to defend it. From the beginning, he has been dismissive of our arguments to the point of questioning our motives. But he has had to change his story several times, retract claims that turned out to be incorrect, and make numerous concessions to our argument. A sampling:\n\n.\n\nIn 2011, Jost wrote, \u201cThere is no coherent policy reason why Congress would have refused premium tax credits to the citizens of states that ended up with a federal exchange.\u201d When we brought to his attention that in 2009, he himself had proposed, \u201coffering tax subsidies for insurance only in states that complied with federal requirements\u201d as a way for Congress to get states to implement either Exchanges or a public option without \u201ccommandeering\u201d the states, Jost rediscovered his own \u201ccoherent policy reason.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Jost wrote, it \u201cis obvious to anyone who understands the ACA\u201d that this requirement is \u201ca drafting error.\u201d He later backtracked, \u201cI agree with Cannon and Adler that the courts are unlikely to find the \u2018established by the state\u2019 language a \u2018scrivener\u2019s error.\u2019\u201d\n\nJost claimed that no one \u2013 especially not a state \u2013 could establish standing to challenge the disputed tax credits. A federal court disagreed, ruling Oklahoma had standing in its capacity as an employer.\n\nJost then claimed that only employers could challenge the tax credits, and even they could not do so before 2015. Federal courts disagreed, ruling that individual taxpayers also had standing.\n\nTo his credit, Jost has never retracted his admission that the tax-credit eligibility rules \u201cclearly say\u201d credits are authorized only through state-established Exchanges. That key concession is also worth keeping in mind.\n\nJost\u2019s Latest Commentary\n\nJost\u2019s commentary on the D.C. Circuit\u2019s hearing in Halbig likewise relies on gratuitous and uncompelling inferences, makes claims that are contradicted by the statute, and reflects misunderstandings of the law and the facts.\n\nInferences. Even though the Supreme Court has written that \u201cthe best evidence of Congress\u2019s intent is the statutory text,\u201d and even though Jost concedes the ACA \u201cclearly\u201d restricts tax credits to states that establish Exchanges, he still claims Congress \u201cobviously\u201d intended to offer tax credits in states that did not. He again offers no statutory language or legislative history that supports this theory, only bad inferences.\n\nFor example, Jost claims (1) that a ruling for the Halbig plaintiffs \u201cwould do massive damage\u201d to the ACA, and (2) that \u201cCongress did not intend to create a law that would self-destruct.\u201d From these claims, he infers that Congress could not have intended to confine tax credits to states that establish Exchanges. Logically speaking, if either (1) or (2) were untrue \u2014 if a ruling for the plaintiffs would not damage the ACA, or if Congress sometimes does create laws that self-destruct \u2014 then Jost\u2019s inference falls apart.\n\nAs it happens, (1) is not necessarily true, and (2) is unquestionably false. If states respond to a ruling for the plaintiffs by establishing Exchanges, Halbig\u2019s effect on the ACA would be minimal, and the rule of law would be upheld. Moreover, Congress routinely creates laws that produce unintended consequences, up to and including the law\u2019s self-destruction. We need look no farther than elsewhere in the ACA for an example. When crafting that law\u2019s long-term-care entitlement program (the \u201cCLASS Act\u201d), Congress quite intentionally included a solvency requirement that ultimately destroyed the program.\n\nFrom his observations that \u201cthe provision was only discovered months after the legislation was passed\u201d and \u201cstates did not consider it in deciding whether or not to establish exchanges,\u201d Jost infers Congress did not intend what the law \u201cclearly say[s].\u201d Even if we ignore the fact that House Democrats were aware of this provision before they approved the ACA, Jost\u2019s inference crumbles if there are other explanations for these observations that do not contradict the statute. As it happens, there are.\n\nIt is hardly strange that citizens would not learn about every feature of a 2,000-page bill until well after Congress passed it. We seem to recall then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying something along those lines. Indeed, a congressional investigation found the IRS itself, which is charged with implementing this part of the statute, didn\u2019t notice this feature for a full year after the ACA became law, and only became aware of it when it was raised by a former Justice Department official and reported in the media.\n\nFinally, if states did not take this condition into account when making their decisions, the most likely reason is that the Obama administration told them it did not exist. It would be completely understandable for states to rely upon a duly promulgated federal regulation when making implementation decisions.\n\nMisstating the law. Related to what states knew and when they knew it, Jost argues that if Congress had conditioned tax credits on states establishing Exchanges, \u201cimposing such a severe penalty without clear notice is unconstitutional.\u201d Aside from all the strained inferences \u2014 if states did not understand the law to work this way, then Congress must not have given \u201cclear notice,\u201d thus Congress must not have intended this condition, thus the condition must not exist \u2014 Jost badly misstates this important facet of the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence.\n\nFirst, the Clear Notice Rule is not implicated where, as here, the text of a statute is clear. As Jost admits, the phrase \u201cestablished by the State under Section 1311\u201d is perfectly clear. Second, as noted above, insofar as states did not receive clear notice it is because the IRS issued a rule erasing the relevant condition. Had the IRS, instead, issued a rule following the plain text of the statute, there would be no question that states had clear notice when deciding whether or not to create exchanges.\n\nClaims contradicted by statute. Jost writes, \u201cStates were asked to establish exchanges, but the ACA explicitly established a federal fallback exchange for states that declined to do so, with all of the powers of a state Exchange.\u201d As Jost and the federal government have argued, federal exchanges established under Section 1321 \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d of state exchanges established under Section 1311.\n\nEven if one accepts this argument, it is insufficient to justify the IRS rule. For even if a Section 1321 exchange is equivalent to a Section 1311 exchange, it is still not an exchange \u201cestablished by the State\u201d as the plain text of Section 1401 requires.\n\nIgnoring Contrary Evidence. Jost writes, \u201cThere is not a hint in the voluminous legislative history of the law\u201d that Congress intended to offer subsidies only through state-established Exchanges. Jost ignores the many examples noted above from the ACA\u2019s legislative history where both Democrats and Republicans introduced legislation conditioning subsidies on states establishing Exchanges.\n\nJost likewise ignores the similarities between the ACA\u2019s tax credits and Health Coverage Tax Credits, another refundable credit Congress conditioned on state action. \u201cI can find no evidence,\u201d he writes, \u201cthat Congress modeled the ACA premium tax credit structure after the HCTC program.\u201d If so, he isn\u2019t looking very hard.\n\nHCTCs were introduced in 2002 by the same Senate Finance Committee chairman who wrote the ACA\u2019s tax-credit eligibility rules. They reside almost right next to the ACA\u2019s tax credits in the Internal Revenue Code (Sections 35 & 36B, respectively). Both the HCTC statute and the ACA use a concept called a \u201ccoverage month\u201d to define when individuals are eligible for credits. The HCTC\u2019s definition of \u201ccoverage months\u201d denies credits to individuals unless their state enacts certain regulations; the ACA\u2019s \u201cclearly\u201d denies credits to individuals unless their state establishes an Exchange.\n\nThe non-partisan Congressional Research Service writes, \u201cThe HCTC can be claimed for only 10 types of qualified health insurance specified in the statute, 7 of which require state action to become effective.\u201d A judge on the Halbig panel concurred, noting that the HCTC statute \u201creads almost identically to the statute we [are] arguing about\u2026citizens don\u2019t get any subsidies\u2026unless the state goes through a whole bunch of hoops and enacts a bunch of different laws, and so on and so forth, and if the state doesn\u2019t do it then the people don\u2019t get the money.\u201d\n\nJost\u2019s claim that \u201can individual\u2019s receipt of a HCTC is not dependent on states doing anything\u201d is simply mistaken.\n\nConclusion\n\nJost and the Obama administration have gone to great lengths to complicate matters, but the issue presented in Halbig is simple and straightforward. Section 1401 of the ACA only authorizes tax credits in exchanges \u201cestablished by the State under Section 1311.\u201d The IRS, in seeking to authorize tax credits in exchanges that are neither \u201cestablished by the State\u201d nor established \u201cunder Section 1311,\u201d seeks a power Congress explicitly denied the agency. The agency\u2019s actions exceed its authority and are illegal.\n\nIn the end, it is as simple as that.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2014/05/22/halbig-and-king-a-simple-case-of-irs-overreach/", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "title": "Halbig And King: A Simple Case Of IRS Overreach"}, "description": "Halbig And King: A Simple Case Of IRS Overreach | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb6c\"", "article_summary": "They reside almost right next to the ACA\u2019s tax credits in the Internal Revenue Code (Sections 35 & 36B, respectively).\nJost likewise ignores the similarities between the ACA\u2019s tax credits and Health Coverage Tax Credits, another refundable credit Congress conditioned on state action.\nJost then claimed that only employers could challenge the tax credits, and even they could not do so before 2015.\nThe ACA Authorizes Certain Provisions Only in States that Establish ExchangesThe Halbig cases, as we will call them, are simple and straightforward.\nThe Finance Committee approved and reported to the full Senate the ACA\u2019s language, which clearly, categorically, and permanently withholds tax credits in states that fail to establish an Exchange."}
