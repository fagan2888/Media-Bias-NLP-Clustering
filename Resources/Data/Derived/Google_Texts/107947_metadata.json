He then developed an app that the participants installed on their phones, which measured their usage during work hours and divided the usage into entertainment (Angry Birds, Candy Crush) or social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter). After the work day, the participants described their sense of well-being. Indeed, the people who spent small breaks on their phones were happier and more productive.\n\nKim believes that it\u2019s almost impossible for an employee to concentrate for 8 hours straight every day. If they\u2019re not on Facebook, they might find another way to distract themselves \u2014 whether going to buy a candy bar or chatting face-to-face with co-workers. But these short distractions are typically a good thing \u2014 as long as they don\u2019t last too long. \u201cA smartphone microbreak can be beneficial for both the employee and the organization,\u201d Kim said in the press release. \u201cFor example, if I would play a game for an hour during my working hours, it would definitely hurt my work performance. But if I take short breaks of one or two minutes throughout the day, it could provide me with refreshment to do my job.\u201d\n\nThe Importance Of A Break\n\nOf course, playing on your phone isn\u2019t the only way you can reduce your stress at work; in fact, there are plenty of healthy ways to sharpen your concentration and keep you energized. Exercising in the morning, on your lunch break, or after work can significantly reduce your stress. Be sure to eat well throughout the day to keep your energy up, but avoid sugary foods so you don\u2019t crash later in the day. Getting enough sleep and staying away from drinking on weekdays is probably the best way to ensure productivity.\n\nAnd make sure to take frequent short breaks to help you feeling refreshed throughout the day. Stress and anxiety can impair your work ethic, so make it more of a priority to keep it in check. \u201cThese days, people struggle with a lot of different types of stressors, such as work demands, time scheduling, family issues or personal life issues,\u201d Kim said in the press release. \u201cWe need to understand how we can help people recover and cope with stressors. Smartphones might help and that is really important not only for individuals, but for an organization, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "smartphones, productivity", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Taking small breaks at work to play on your phone might be beneficial to getting all your work done.", "title": "Playing With Your Smartphone During Work Could Boost Your Morale", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/playing-your-smartphone-during-work-could-boost-your-morale-make-you-more-productive-292006", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/taking-selfies-work.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taking small breaks at work to play on your phone might be beneficial to getting all your work done.", "title": "Playing With Your Smartphone During Work Could Boost Your Morale", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/playing-your-smartphone-during-work-could-boost-your-morale-make-you-more-productive-292006", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/taking-selfies-work.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/08/taking-selfies-work.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-08T17:29:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-08T17:29:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Taking small breaks at work to play on your phone might be beneficial to getting all your work done."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24b7\"", "article_summary": "After the work day, the participants described their sense of well-being.\nHe then developed an app that the participants installed on their phones, which measured their usage during work hours and divided the usage into entertainment (Angry Birds, Candy Crush) or social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter).\nTaking breaks at work to text or play Angry Birds on your phone might sound like the opposite of productive \u2014 but now psychologists are saying that it might actually boost your efficiency and morale at the workplace.\nAnd make sure to take frequent short breaks to help you feeling refreshed throughout the day.\nStress and anxiety can impair your work ethic, so make it more of a priority to keep it in check."}
