That case is currently being litigated.\n\nNow Roskam and other leading Republicans are trying to attack the administration on the basic health program funding, saying it's another example of the same tactic.\n\n\"It appears the administration is creating a pattern of taking funds from a permanent appropriation for purposes contrary to Congress' intent,\" Roskam wrote Wednesday to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell in a letter provided to the Washington Examiner, also signed by Reps. Kevin Brady, Tim Murphy and Joe Pitts.\n\nMinnesota is the only state that has set up the basic health program, although New York is taking steps in that direction. If states opt in, the federal government would cover 95 percent of the subsidies that enrollees would have otherwise collected in the marketplaces, although it's not allowed to cover administrative costs.\n\nAides said they only recently discovered how the administration was funding Minnesota's program, through looking at the state's first-quarter payment this year.\n\nProdded by Roskam at a hearing Wednesday, Burwell acknowledged the basic health program payments are coming out of the IRS fund but said \"tax credits for programs\" aren't part of the discretionary funding that must be approved by Congress.\n\n\"What extra-constitutional authority are you invoking that allows you to spend money that has not been appropriated?\" Roskam asked her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leading Republicans are charging that the Obama administration is illegally funding yet another part of Obamacare, in addition to the part of the healthcare law over which House Republicans are already suing.\nTheir latest criticism centers on the Affordable Care Act's basic health program, an optional program for states that started this year, in which low-income residents can get subsidized, state-contracted health plans instead of buying them through the new online marketplaces.\nThe administration is funding the program illegally by using a pot of IRS money used for tax refunds, says Rep.
