They have their eyes on holding on to their slim Senate majority by their fingernails with one race in particular whetting their appetites\u2026 and it\u2019s none other than the Senate Majority Minority Leader\u2019s. But is Mitch McConnell actually in danger? There\u2019s reason for him to be concerned, no doubt, but Matt Lewis has been doing some digging and finds that Democrat hopeful Alison Lundergan Grimes may not be quite as fearsome as the media portrays her.\n\nOn paper, Alison Lundergan Grimes was the perfect recruit to run against Sen. Mitch McConnell. McConnell\u2019s negatives are high, and Grimes is seen as an attractive (just me, or does she resemble Molly Parker?) young Secretary of State \u2013 with potential cultural crossover appeal in the \u201cBluegrass State.\u201d And it also doesn\u2019t hurt that she happens to be the daughter of former Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman (and Bill Clinton pal) Jerry Lundergan, either. And indeed, the race is close. But that only belies the fact that Grimes has, thus far, proven to be a mediocre candidate, running a mediocre campaign. And this suggests that McConnell might just be able to survive.\n\nMatt checks in on reporter Sam Youngman, who has some lengthy experience both inside the beltway and back home in the Bluegrass State. With an insider\u2019s view, he seems to feel that Grimes\u2019 organization leaves a lot to be desired.\n\n\u201cFor a long time before I moved home,\u201d Youngman said, \u201cI was reading in a number of publications about what a formidable campaign it was. And from what I\u2019ve seen so far\u2026from what I\u2019ve seen on the ground, at least, that doesn\u2019t track. It\u2019s a campaign that has struggled consistently to find its footing.\u201d \u201cMy own personal feeling is that they have missed a series of opportunities to define her in the minds of Kentucky voters,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause, despite winning statewide office in 2011, she\u2019s still not that well known \u2014 which, as you well know, is a danger zone for a first-time candidate.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t some revelation of a newly discovered scandal or some other definitive, disqualifying historical note. Rather, it\u2019s a sense among observers that Grimes has surrounded herself with some amateurs \u2013 or at least relatively green politicos \u2013 who don\u2019t seem to be on top of what\u2019s needed to bring a high profile race like this one over the finish line. And as much as we\u2019d like to think that elections are all about the pure qualities of the candidates and the better angels of the voters, campaign skills matter. The beltway is littered with the virtual bodies of many otherwise fine candidates who may have served their constituents well, but simply weren\u2019t prepared for the trench warfare of modern politics on the trail.\n\nMcConnell is in a tough fight, no matter how unskilled his opponents may prove to be, but it\u2019s not something he hasn\u2019t seen before. Mitch won his last three races in 96, 2002 and 2008 in pretty much of a cakewalk, but a look deeper into history shows that he didn\u2019t come from a position of having a glass jaw. In his first election to the Senate in 1984, McConnell had to beat a two term incumbent Democrat, and they had to stay up late on election day to find that he had won by only 5,200 votes out of more than 1.8 million. His first fight to defend the seat in 1990 against a former mayor of Louisville wasn\u2019t much easier, resulting in a victory margin of 4.5%, still inside the margins of some election day polls.\n\nHe may need to draw on that experience to win this one if Grimes plays her cards well. The race is currently locked up, with a couple of polls even showing Grimes holding on to a fractional lead. Also, McConnel has become very unpopular with a lot of conservatives over the last year or two (with evidence of that showing up in the Hot Air comments section on a regular basis), so turning out the base may not be a given. But there\u2019s a long way to go still, and plenty of time for mistakes to be made by Grimes. Over the summer we may find out whether Youngman\u2019s analysis proves prescient and the demands of the campaign lead to the challenger\u2019s team dropping the ball.\n\nUPDATE: (Jazz) Ooops. McConnell isn\u2019t the Majority Leader \u2026 yet. Corrected above.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Paper tiger?", "title": "Alison Lundergan Grimes: Fact or fantasy?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/05/alison-lundergan-grimes-fact-or-fantasy/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-05T18:31:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-05T19:06:18+00:00"}, "keywords": "Alison Lundergan Grimes, Harry Reid, Senate 2014,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Alison Lundergan Grimes: Fact or fantasy?\nOn paper, Alison Lundergan Grimes was the perfect recruit to run against Sen.
