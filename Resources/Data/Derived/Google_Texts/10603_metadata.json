The brain is the main player here, controling stimulation of blood flow, heartbeat, breathing, and the response of the central nervous system, which sends nerve signals to the brain\u2019s reward system. In addition to the physiological response that causes contractions in the anal sphincter, penis and/or vaginal muscles, and prostate gland in men, the brain releases feel-good chemicals called dopamine and oxytocin \u2014 the latter of which is also a \u201cbonding\u201d chemical that helps humans create relationships.\n\nResearch has shown that during an orgasm, certain parts of the brain are activated \u2014 while others are completely shut down. In women, the lateral orbitofrontal cortex temporarily shuts down; this is the part of the brain that is known for reasoning and behavior control. Women also experience an activation of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), which triggers the fight-or-flight response, but isn\u2019t activated in men\u2019s brains during an orgasm. Research has also proven that women see a decrease in the activity of the amygdala and hippocampus, both of which have to do with anxiety and fear. This contributes to the post-orgasm relaxed afterglow, which is mixed with the \u201ccuddling\u201d hormone and rushes of dopamine that produces an overall pleasant effect. This is why sex has often been linked to a reduction in anxiety, greater connection and bonding between partners, and a sense of well-being.\n\nInterestingly, some researchers even claimed in 2008 that they could tell a woman\u2019s orgasm history by her walk. In their study, they found that they could instantly tell the difference between videos of women walking, noting that the relaxed muscles lent an air of \u201cfluidity, energy, sensuality, [and] freedom\u201d to their strides.
