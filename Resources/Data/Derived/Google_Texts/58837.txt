BOULDER — They don’t have a nickname yet. Combine Booker and Dinwiddie and you get names that sound like cartoon characters or villains in a Harry Potter novel.

Yet Askia Booker and guard-mate Spencer Dinwiddie are certainly deserving of one. Dinbooker or Bookwiddie or whatever you want to call them combined for 50 points to lead 20th-ranked Colorado to a 100-91 win over 10th-ranked Oregon on Sunday afternoon before 10,398 delirious fans at the Coors Events Center.

Booker scored a game-high 27 points and Dinwiddie wove Harry Potter wizardry in scoring 13 of his 23 in a key 5½-minute stretch in the second half.

It’s hard to tell which junior is more important. Dinwiddie is the team’s leading scorer and point guard, a likely early NBA entry and the team’s conscience.

But listen to the team sage spin wise on the importance of Booker, the sniper who hit 8-of-16 shots Sunday.

“It’s pretty simple,” Dinwiddie said. “When he plays really well, we play really well. We kind of go as he goes. Me, Josh (Scott) and Xavier (Johnson) don’t change that much. Xavier can be a little up and down. No offense, but Askia knows he can be up and down.

“When he’s up we are one good team, and when he’s down we struggle.”

Colorado (13-2, 2-0 Pac-12), off to its best 15-game start since its 1968-69 Big Eight championship season, actually looked like a great team. It upgraded the adjective in the second half when it halted an attack from the highest-scoring team in the country.

Booker converted a three-point play, hit an 18-footer and made four straight foul shots to turn a precarious 74-72 lead to 94-86 with 1:30 left.

“It’s really fun,” Booker said. “I thank my teammates for getting me the ball in the right positions.”

However, Dinwiddie saved the Buffaloes first. After Colorado shot a fiery 56 percent in the first half, Oregon went to a zone that baffled the Buffs for more than five minutes.

UNLV transfer Mike Moser, who had a team-high 24 points, scored eight straight for a 58-48 lead. That’s when Dinwiddie went Chris Paul. He made a lay-in, three straight 3-pointers and two free throws to break Oregon’s zone and take a 72-66 lead.

“We want Spencer to be aggressive,” CU coach Tad Boyle said. “He has the ability to score. He’s really hard to keep in front of. He’s got great size, he can finish, he gets to the foul line.”

He and Booker nearly built a timeshare at the foul line. Booker went 10-of-12 and Dinwiddie 10-of-11 as the team made 33-of-39 (.846). None of this produced any gripes about officiating from Oregon coach Dana Altman, whose Ducks (13-1, 1-1) were trying to go 14-0 for the first time since 1937-38.

“I’m not going to take anything away from (Booker and Dinwiddie),” Altman said, “but we didn’t guard them.”

Or anyone else, for that matter. The Buffs finished shooting .564 (31-of-55). Scott had 15 points and 12 rebounds for his fifth straight double-double.

And don’t forget about the sixth man: Coors. It marked the fifth straight win over a ranked team at home.

“No question,” Boyle said. “We’re a little bit further along with the youth of this team, and the way this schedule was devised, than maybe I even thought.”
