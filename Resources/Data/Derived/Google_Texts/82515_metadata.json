Bruce Poliquin was lauded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce during the monthly breakfast meeting of the Lewiston Auburn Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce on Thursday.\n\nPoliquin, a Republican, learned Thursday that he would receive the national business advocacy group\u2019s \u201cSpirit of Business\u201d award for his work and voting record in Congress during a short ceremony at the Franco Center in Lewiston\u2019s Little Canada neighborhood.\n\nPoliquin is seeking re-election this year against Democratic challenger Emily Cain. Poliquin won the open seat in a race against Cain and independent Blaine Richardson in 2014.\n\nGeoff O\u2019Hara, vice president of regional affairs and advocacy for the U.S. Chamber, presented the award to Poliquin, noting he had scored a 95 out of 100 in the chamber\u2019s rating system for lawmakers.\n\nO\u2019Hara said all lawmakers who scored at least a 70 were given the award, but Poliquin stood out for his high score.\n\n\u201cThere are a million issues the congressman is doing a great job on,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.\n\nHe specifically mentioned Poliquin\u2019s advocacy for tax cuts for individuals and businesses. He also said Poliquin stood with business on lowering energy, fighting for fair international trade practices, \u201chelping to fix Obamacare,\u201d and advocating for improved transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe announcement was a surprise to Poliquin, who will be formally presented the award next week in Washington, D.C., O\u2019Hara said.\n\nPoliquin also addressed the chamber audience of about 300. He spoke for about 25 minutes and mentioned several initiatives on which he and other members of Maine\u2019s congressional delegation are focused.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t hear a lot about this stuff,\u201d Poliquin quipped, in reference to Congress, \u201cwhat you do hear about is that it\u2019s broken and it doesn\u2019t work. Well, I would like to add to that \u2014 it\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\nHe said trying to clean up that mess, however, was exactly why he ran for Congress. The first-term federal lawmaker who replaced a long-serving Democrat, Mike Michaud also noted he was carrying on some of Michaud\u2019s work.\n\nThat includes working to make the U.S. military equip its personnel with athletic footwear made in the U.S. and in Maine by New Balance, which employs about 900 workers in Norway, Skowhegan and Norridgewock.\n\n\u201cWe think it is really fair and right for the Pentagon to issue only fully American-made athletic shoes to fully-made American men and women in uniform,\u201d Poliquin said.\n\nPoliquin said later the military equips recruits with everything from marching boots to underwear but doesn\u2019t provide them with American-made athletic shoes.\n\nHe also noted his work to improve federal inspection procedures for those who export sea urchins and sea cucumbers to markets in Asia. Poliquin said federal inspections at warehouses in New York were delaying shipments and spoiling a valuable commodity that\u2019s a delicacy in some countries. The industry in Maine provides employment for as many as 600 workers, including the sea divers who harvest them.\n\nHe said lobsters and other Maine shellfish were largely exempt from similar inspections.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pick on \u2018em,\u201d Poliquin said later. \u201cThey\u2019re little critters, give them the same exemption you give lobsters.\u201d\n\nHe said the issue, which is being supported by all of Maine\u2019s lawmakers, looked like it was going to be solved.\n\nHe also noted his office along with U.S. Sens. Susan Collins and Angus King have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate an issue involving the possible illegal dumping of a fabric material from China, that\u2019s competing with Auburn Manufacturing \u2014 another local company that employs about 50 workers.\n\nAt the beginning of his speech, Poliquin said his work in Washington was largely focused on one thing:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about jobs \u2014 it is flat-out all about jobs,\u201d Poliquin said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
