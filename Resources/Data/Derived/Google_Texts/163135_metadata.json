They were up against students from other higher education institutions across the state competing in hands-on trade, technical, and leadership contests.\n\nAdriane Tenequer, a junior at NTU who plans to start her own business after graduation, was chosen to serve as president of the competition. \u201cI passed a panel interview and training at the national SkillsUSA competitions in Kansas City in 2014, and afterwards I was thrilled to be named president,\u201d she explained in a university press release. Tenequer was a gold medalist this year.\n\n\u201cFrom competing last year, I knew to bring all the materials I needed to plan my lesson and create everything on-the-spot to do my teaching demo, and sure enough I won again,\u201d said Marell Charley, a two-time gold medalist who plans to become a history teacher.\n\nVernon Kaye, a digital manufacturing major at NTU was on a two-man team that won gold in the Additive Manufacturing event. They used a 3-D printer to create an adaptor for a robot arm.\n\n\u201cI like SkillsUSA competition because you apply your learning from scratch. We were tested for our project, and I had to learn how to adapt to the tools I was provided, like a 3-D printer that was smaller than what I was used to, and I had to figure out how to downsize my product to fit,\u201d he said in the release. \u201cSkillsUSA stresses professionalism, right down to what you have to wear, so you have to step up in every way.\u201d\n\nCalvin Price, an Energy Systems major, was involved in a Teamworks event that stretched on for nearly two days. \u201cI worked on the plumbing part of the project, while my teammates each had their own parts to work on,\u201d said Price, who will graduate this month and plans on attending Arizona State University to study Sustainable Energy.\n\nAll 33 of the gold medalists from NTU will travel to the national SkillsUSA competitions in Louisville, Kentucky in June.\n\n\u201cNTU has one of the largest memberships in a SkillsUSA chapter.\u201d Kaye said in the release. \u201cThere\u2019s talk about getting Navajo Nation recognized as a \u2018state,\u2019\u201d which would allow the nation to hold its own round of competitions.\n\nFor a full list of medalists, visit NavajoTech.edu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Students from Navajo Technical University took 62 medals home from the NM SkillsUSA championships held in Albuquerque, New Mexico from April 9-11.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/08/ntu-students-earn-62-medals-skillsusa-competition-160248", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/navajo-technical-university-gold-medalists.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "NTU Students Earn 62 Medals at SkillsUSA Competition"}, "abstract": "Students from Navajo Technical University took 62 medals home from the NM SkillsUSA championships held in Albuquerque, New Mexico from April 9-11.", "dc": {"title": "NTU Students Earn 62 Medals at SkillsUSA Competition"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/08/ntu-students-earn-62-medals-skillsusa-competition-160248", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native American students, Navajo Technical University, Native American Education, Tribal Colleges, Navajo Nation", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2015-05-08T13:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "NTU Students Earn 62 Medals at SkillsUSA Competition"}, "article_summary": "Students from Navajo Technical University took 62 medals home from the NM SkillsUSA championships held in Albuquerque, New Mexico from April 9-11.\nVernon Kaye, a digital manufacturing major at NTU was on a two-man team that won gold in the Additive Manufacturing event.\nAdriane Tenequer, a junior at NTU who plans to start her own business after graduation, was chosen to serve as president of the competition.\nAll 33 of the gold medalists from NTU will travel to the national SkillsUSA competitions in Louisville, Kentucky in June.\n\u201cNTU has one of the largest memberships in a SkillsUSA chapter.\u201d Kaye said in the release."}
