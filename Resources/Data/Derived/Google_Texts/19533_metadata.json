Her announcement is part of the ongoing \u201cGrubergate\u201d news, after the video of Jonathan Gruber surfaced a week ago.\n\nAs previously reported by The Inquisitr, Obamacare \u201carchitect\u201d Jonathan Gruber is the center of a supposed government scandal regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), some are calling \u201cGrubergate.\u201d Gruber ignited a controversy with comments suggesting that Obamacare only passed for lack of transparency and stupidity of the American voter.\n\n\u201cCall it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical for the thing to pass\u2026 [I wish] we could make it all transparent, but I\u2019d rather have this law than not.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s comments have enflamed the American public and everyone has a response, and even the Obama Administration has chimed in with the White House disputing his claims. Melissa Francis\u2019 broadcast arose because she felt \u201ccomplicit\u201d to \u201cGrubergate,\u201d because she tried to illuminate the cost of Obamacare bill but was stopped from doing that.\n\n\u201cWhen I was at CNBC, I pointed out to my viewers that the math of Obamacare simply didn\u2019t work, not the politics, by the way, just the basic math,\u201d Francis said.\n\n\u201cAnd when I did that, I was silenced. I said on the air that you couldn\u2019t add millions of people to the system and force insurance companies to cover their preexisting conditions without raising the price on everyone else.\u201d \u201cI pointed out that it couldn\u2019t possibly be true that if you like your plan, you can keep it. That was a lie. And in fact, millions of people had their insurance canceled.\u201d\n\nFrancis said that she was reprimanded several times for saying that Obamacare did not add up.\n\n\u201cAs a result of what I said at CNBC, I was called into management where I was told that I was \u2018disrespecting the office of the president\u2019 by telling what turned out to be the absolute truth.\u201d\n\nAfter Jonathan Gruber\u2019s video surfaced Francis felt compelled to point out the cover-up by the media.\n\n\u201cI think the American public deserves to know that the reason why Jonathan Gruber and others like him are able to get away with this is because there are networks out there and management at CNBC who are complicit in this cover-up and keeping people ignorant.\u201d\n\nThe response from CNBC to Francis\u2019 claim that she was \u201csilenced\u201d was that it is \u201claughable,\u201d reported NY Posts\u2019Page Six.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s laughable, but we take notice, because as the fastest-growing network in prime time, we\u2019re always on the lookout for high quality comedy writers and actresses.\u201d\n\nFrancis said she was not sure what CNBC was trying to say in their response Sunday during a follow up broadcast; that video can be seen below.\n\nMelissa Francis didn\u2019t specify names of the CNBC management who \u201csilenced\u201d her for supposedly \u201cdisrespecting the office of the president\u201d when questioning numbers of Obamacare, but many are wanting answers on \u201cGrubergate,\u201d and whether the facts support Jonathan Gruber\u2019s comments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Melissa Francis, a Fox News anchor, revealed Friday that while she worked at CNBC she was \"silenced\" by management for questioning the math of Obamacare while", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Melissa Francis, a Fox News anchor, revealed Friday that while she worked at CNBC she was \u201csilenced\u201d by management for questioning the math of Obamacare while", "title": "Obamacare: CNBC \u2018Silenced\u2019 Me, Melissa Francis Revealed After Jonathan Gruber \u2018Grubergate\u2019 Video", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1614385/obamacare-cnbc-silenced-melissa-francis-jonathan-gruber-grubergate/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-CNBC-Silenced-Me-Melissa-Francis-Revealed-After-Jonathan-Gruber-Video-.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-16T21:34:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T22:23:25+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-CNBC-Silenced-Me-Melissa-Francis-Revealed-After-Jonathan-Gruber-Video-.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-11-16T21:34:40+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,cnbc silenced me,fox news melissa francis,grubergate,jonathan gruber,melissa francis,obamacare architect,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Obamacare-CNBC-Silenced-Me-Melissa-Francis-Revealed-After-Jonathan-Gruber-Video-.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Melissa Francis, a Fox News anchor, revealed Friday that while she worked at CNBC she was \u201csilenced\u201d by management for questioning the math of Obamacare while"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a66\"", "article_summary": "Her announcement is part of the ongoing \u201cGrubergate\u201d news, after the video of Jonathan Gruber surfaced a week ago.\nMelissa Francis, a Fox News anchor, revealed Friday that while she worked at CNBC she was \u201csilenced\u201d by management for questioning the math of Obamacare while on television.\nMelissa Francis didn\u2019t specify names of the CNBC management who \u201csilenced\u201d her for supposedly \u201cdisrespecting the office of the president\u201d when questioning numbers of Obamacare, but many are wanting answers on \u201cGrubergate,\u201d and whether the facts support Jonathan Gruber\u2019s comments.\nMelissa Francis\u2019 broadcast arose because she felt \u201ccomplicit\u201d to \u201cGrubergate,\u201d because she tried to illuminate the cost of Obamacare bill but was stopped from doing that.\nAs previously reported by The Inquisitr, Obamacare \u201carchitect\u201d Jonathan Gruber is the center of a supposed government scandal regarding the Affordable Care Act (ACA), some are calling \u201cGrubergate.\u201d Gruber ignited a controversy with comments suggesting that Obamacare only passed for lack of transparency and stupidity of the American voter."}
