He kept on making his rounds.\n\nHours later though, when the worker made another round, he noticed that the person inside the sleeping bag still hadn\u2019t moved.\n\nHe walked over and shook the man\u2019s shoulder. As he did so the flap of the sleeping bag fell back and the worker saw blood.\n\nThe man had been shot in the head.\n\nSomeone apparently crept up to the sleeping man, put a gun to his head and fired.\n\nIf anyone saw any kind of a confrontation that morning they didn\u2019t come forward.\n\nDenver Det. John Weber investigated the shooting, according to an in-depth article by Philip Reed of the Rocky Mountain News.\n\nAn Denver Coroner\u2019s Office investigation determined that the victim was Michael Thomas, a 19-year-old man from Golden.\n\nWeber interviewed many of Thomas\u2019 friends, tracking the murdered man\u2019s steps the last day of his life.\n\nIf someone killed Thomas because they thought he was a homeless man they were wrong, according to the investigation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "coroner's office,Dead Men motorcycle club,denver,golden,Highway 6,hippies,keg party,motorcycle club,police,shooting,Washington Park", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "Cold Cases", "description": "Man shot in head in sleeping bag in Denver's Washington Park", "title": "Man shot in head in sleeping bag in Denver's Washington Park", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2015/01/24/denver-18/9787/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2015/01/michael-thomas.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Man shot in head in sleeping bag in Denver's Washington Park", "title": "Man shot in head in sleeping bag in Denver\u2019s Washington Park", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/2015/01/24/denver-18/9787/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/coldcases/files/2015/01/michael-thomas.jpg", "creator": "@kmitchelldp", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Man shot in head in sleeping bag in Denver's Washington Park"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2824\"", "article_summary": "The sleeping bag the man was in was beneath a large pine tree near East Mississippi Avenue and Lafayette Street.\nSomeone apparently crept up to the sleeping man, put a gun to his head and fired.\nAs he did so the flap of the sleeping bag fell back and the worker saw blood.\nHours later though, when the worker made another round, he noticed that the person inside the sleeping bag still hadn\u2019t moved.\nThe worker didn\u2019t think anything of it."}
