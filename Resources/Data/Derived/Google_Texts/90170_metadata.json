But for countless miserable Americans trapped in the ObamaCare 1095-A abyss, it's hell on stilts on a Segway teetering over the Grand Canyon.\n\nThe screw-ups and bureaucratic blame avoidance over the health insurance exchange tax forms make the healthcare.gov website fiasco look like a flawless product launch. How do I know? My family inexplicably got ensnared in the 1095-A paperwork pit.\n\nIn 2013, our private high-deductible PPO from Anthem Blue Cross got canceled because of \u201cchanges from health care reform.\u201d Millions of others like us in the individual market for health insurance \u2014 including self-employed people, small-business owners, writers, artists and home-based entrepreneurs \u2014 suffered the same fate.\n\nMy husband reluctantly contacted Colorado's state health insurance exchange. Months later, we settled on purchasing a new non-ObamaCare plan directly from a different private insurer, Rocky Mountain Health. The provider network is much narrower than the Anthem plan we had before the feds intervened.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse.\n\nSomewhere along the way, the worker bees at Connect for Health Colorado dragooned us into an ObamaCare exchange plan offered by Rocky Mountain Health without our knowledge or consent. (How else has the White House inflated ObamaCare enrollment figures?) Last month, we received an IRS 1095-A form, which, much to our shock, indicated that we had paid ObamaCare premiums every month during 2014.\n\nIt took hours of time on the phone and Internet to receive an explanation from Connect for Health Colorado on how exactly this happened.\n\nThis is just one little horror story. In Minnesota, thousands are still waiting for 1095-A forms that were supposed to arrive on Jan. 31. In California, at least 800,000 taxpayers received screwed-up 1095-A forms. As a result, some 50,000 people filed the wrong form. Another 750,000 are being told they'll get corrected forms this month. Hah. Good luck with that.\n\nWhere's the rest of the media \u2014 most of whom have been insulated from these problems because they get their health insurance through their employers?\n\nAt least one other journalist smacked into reality. Laura Krantz, a former NPR staffer, is now a Scripps fellow in environmental journalism at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Earlier this month, she found out that Connect for Health Colorado had mysteriously canceled her health and dental insurance. After four days and eight hours in ObamaCare phone hell, she learned she had lost her insurance coverage and her tax credit \u2014 and had to redo all of her paperwork.\n\nSan Francisco resident and former Obama supporter Melissa Klein recently exposed her ordeal with Covered California. The state exchange botched her 1095-A and then insisted she had never enrolled despite invoices she showed them documenting her premium payments.\n\nKlein concluded, better late than never: \u201cI no longer believe that the government should mandate health care. ... A great idea is just an idea if you can't execute. And the government has proved time and time again, it can't execute.\u201d Feelin' your pain, sister. Is D.C. listening?\n\nMichelle Malkin is the author of \u201cCulture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies\u201d (Regnery 2009).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Michelle Malkin", "description": "Tax season is stressful enough.
