(Photo: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nPainful lessons are learned over the years but over time are unlearned and have to be relearned.\n\nFor example, a professor of mine, Rex Tugwell, in his biography of Franklin Roosevelt, stated that the Glass-Steagall Banking Act \u201cmade quite unlikely that bankers in partnership with speculators could again being on such a debacle as had occurred in 1929.\u201d Unfortunately, in the late 1990s, Congress and the White House undid the firewall and the financial disaster erupting in 2007 took place. As my dad liked to say, \u201cWe\u2019re too soon old and too late smart.\u201d\n\nAnother area where we allow ourselves to be suckered is hysteria about domestic \u201cenemies.\u201d In 1798 we had the Alien and Sedition Acts. During World War I, we overreacted with the Espionage and Sedition laws. On the eve of World War II, we had the Smith Act (misnamed the \u201cAlien Registration Act\u201d). During the Civil War and the Cold War, from time to time, some in our government confused heresy with conspiracy.\n\nA third illustration: Despite the failure of Prohibition in the 1920s, by the 1970s the nation embarked on a \u201cwar on drugs.\u201d We should have recognized from the earlier effort at eradication that the result would be a surge in imprisonments and increased profitability for the law-breakers. (as well as venality by some law enforcers and disrespect for the drug laws by those who don\u2019t consider that their behavior should be considered as criminal.)\n\nMartin Gruberg\n\nOshkosh\n\nRead or Share this story: http://oshko.sh/1BgglS1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Painful lessons are learned over the years but over time are unlearned and have to be relearned.", "og": {"site_name": "Northwestern Media", "description": "Painful lessons are learned over the years but over time are unlearned and have to be relearned.", "title": "Letters: Americans must learn, again, from painful mistakes", "url": "http://www.thenorthwestern.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/12/27/letters-gruberg-history-lessons/20956745/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thenorthwestern.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Painful lessons are learned over the years but over time are unlearned and have to be relearned.", "title": "Letters: Americans must learn, again, from painful mistakes", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a4cb9d48c49d1d0e0b1ac32218c514692624f683/c=0-432-2474-2906&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Oshkosh/2014/12/27/B9315657333Z.1_20141227215548_000_GSL9H83K0.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@onwnews", "site": "@onwnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883770549", "fb": {"app_id": 167919243249397}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "On the eve of World War II, we had the Smith Act (misnamed the \u201cAlien Registration Act\u201d).\nDuring World War I, we overreacted with the Espionage and Sedition laws.\nBottom, from L to R : Lester J.
