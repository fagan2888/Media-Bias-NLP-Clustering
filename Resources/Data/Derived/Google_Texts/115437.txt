Affluent taxpayers paid $23 billion in additional taxes in 2014 due to a pair of tax increases to help fund the Affordable Care Act, according to data recently released by the Internal Revenue Service.

The tax increases, which Congress passed in 2010, took effect for the 2013 tax year and were first paid during the 2014 filing season.

The total revenue from the two increases was about $3 billion higher than forecast, says Roberton Williams, an income-tax specialist with the Tax Policy Center in Washington.

One of the taxes is a 3.8% surtax levied on the net investment income of high earners. It applies to most couples with adjusted gross income of more than $250,000 and singles with more than $200,000.

Taxpayers with earnings above the same thresholds were also hit with an extra 0.9% of Medicare tax, on top of the basic 2.9% that is split between employers and employees.

In 2014, 3.1 million taxpayers paid net-investment-income tax totaling $16.5 billion, according to the IRS. The average payment was $5,300. Mr. Williams calculates that the total income subject to the tax was about $435 billion.

Meanwhile, 2.8 million taxpayers paid $6.5 billion in additional Medicare tax, according to the IRS. The average payment was $2,300. That was levied on $725 billion of earnings, Mr. Williams says.

The surtax applies to the net investment income from dividends, capital gains, interest, rental and royalty income, and certain annuities, among other sources. The threshold isn’t indexed for inflation.

For an example of how the surtax works, consider a hypothetical couple that has $240,000 of adjusted gross income due to wages and $20,000 of dividends and capital gains. In this case, $10,000 is subject to the 3.8% tax, because it’s the amount of net investment income that exceeds the $250,000 threshold.

For taxpayers selling a home, only the capital gain above $250,000 (for singles) or $500,000 (for couples) is subject to this surtax, if the seller’s adjusted gross income is above the threshold. So if a couple buys a home for $125,000 and sells it for $400,000, the 3.8% tax wouldn’t apply to the $275,000 gain–assuming the couple qualifies for the $500,000 break.

CORRECTION: In 2014, 2.8 million taxpayers paid $6.5 billion in additional Medicare tax, according to the IRS. An earlier version of this post incorrectly said they paid $6.5 million.
