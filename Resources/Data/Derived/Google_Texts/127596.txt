Sioux Falls, SD

A '50s-style throwback basketball court with a dark parquet floor and retro scoreboards is the centerpiece of a $19 million indoor athletic complex set to open next month.



The Sanford Pentagon's 3,250-seat Heritage Court will make its prime-time debut Oct. 10 with an NBA preseason game between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Milwaukee Bucks. The arena will soon serve as home for the NBA development league's Sioux Falls Skyforce.



Sanford Sports Complex General Manager Eric Larsen says the goal was to create a setting that feels like the "Hoosiers"-era. He says when fans walk into the Heritage Court, they'll feel they're back in the '50s or '60s.



But the Pentagon does boast modern amenities such as two high-def video boards, 12 luxury suites and larger corner game-day suites.
