Since the famous brain surgeon retired last year from Johns Hopkins Hospital, he\u2019s been speaking around the country to enthusiastic audiences. And they\u2019ve affected his thinking about seeking national office\u2026 Carson writes that he suspects many others interested in high office would be better candidates. But in his book he has a caveat: \u201cIf I felt called by God to officially enter the world of politics, I would certainly not hesitate to do so.\u201d Interviewed this week, Carson said he\u2019s \u201cstarting to feel it. Because every place I go, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d One lady \u201creally touched me the other night \u2026 She just kept clinging to my hand and said, \u2018You have to run. You have to run.\u2019 And so many people tell me that, and so I think I\u2019m starting to hear something.\u201d\u2026 Carson said he has no illusions about running. \u201cIt\u2019s a daunting thing,\u201d he told me. \u201cI know how vehemently the left will come after you, try to destroy you, try to destroy your family. But at the same time I recognize that people like Nathan Hale \u2013 he said, \u2018My only regret is I have but one life to give to my country\u2019 \u2026 And if everybody runs for the hills because they\u2019re afraid that somebody is going to attack them or their family, then [the left] will have won.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s got his very own version of a \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d Super PAC (led by John Philip Sousa\u2019s great-grandson), which, believe it or not, has actually out-raised Clinton\u2019s org since the beginning of the year. The assumption all along, given his speech at CPAC and frequent appearances in righty media, has been that he\u2019ll run as a Republican. But \u2026 why would he do that? His natural base of support in the primary is conservatives, but how many conservatives are going to opt for a political novice when they\u2019ve got Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Bobby Jindal, and maybe Rick Perry and Mike Pence to choose from instead \u2014 especially given that Carson has a litmus-test problem on guns? The only path he has, realistically, is if none of those guys run except Paul (who\u2019s definitely running) and then Paul wobbles among righties under the cumulative weight of his ideological idiosyncracies. Then Carson could become the conservative choice, which would make him the \u201cNot Jeb\u201d or \u201cNot Christie\u201d alternative against whoever emerges from the center of the party. In which case, he\u2019ll lose anyway. And let\u2019s face it: If Paul is wobbly because of his take on, among other things, voter ID, one of the other candidates I mentioned will sense it and jump in to challenge him on the right. There\u2019s no way, in other words, that only Paul and Carson will be out there campaigning for tea partiers. That being so, what hope does Carson have?\n\nThe obvious solution, then: Don\u2019t run as a Republican, run as a conservative independent. Advance to the general election against Hillary and Jeb or whoever and offer yourself as a fresh-faced naif who\u2019s never worked in Washington, the natural antidote to the grotesque dynastic politics being played by the two major parties. He would get some votes as a Perot-like \u201cno more business as usual\u201d protest candidate \u2014 maybe enough to sink the GOP\u2019s chances against Hillary, which would be \u2026 sub-optimal for a conservative heartthrob. So, tell me how this ends. Early flame-out in the GOP primaries, albeit with better-than-expected numbers in Iowa thanks to social conservatives? Some sort of surprise momentum into February due to universal disgust with D.C. and craving for someone uncorrupted by the system among voters? Third-party candidacy? Fox News show circa 2017? What\u2019s the answer?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Big.", "title": "Sure sounds like Ben Carson\u2019s running for president", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/05/15/sure-sounds-like-ben-carsons-running-for-president/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-15T15:21:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-15T16:06:40+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016, ben, benjamin, carson, election, GOP, independent, President, republican,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcda7\"", "article_summary": "Ben Carson is warming to the idea of running for president.\nThe only path he has, realistically, is if none of those guys run except Paul (who\u2019s definitely running) and then Paul wobbles among righties under the cumulative weight of his ideological idiosyncracies.\nThere\u2019s no way, in other words, that only Paul and Carson will be out there campaigning for tea partiers.\n\u201cI know how vehemently the left will come after you, try to destroy you, try to destroy your family.\nSure sounds like Ben Carson\u2019s running for presidentposted at 11:21 am on May 15, 2014 by AllahpunditIf we\u2019re destined to have another Bush versus Clinton election, it\u2019s only right that there be a Perot-type in the mix too."}
