Brooks says it will take much stronger leadership and a change in how conservatives present their message.\n\nBrooks is author of \u201cThe Conservative Heart: How to Build a Fairer, Happier, and More Prosperous America.\u201d The book makes a passionate case that big-government policies are doing nothing to alleviate poverty in the U.S. and that conservative policies could have a significant impact if pursued boldly and wisely.\n\nBrooks told WND and Radio America the biggest problem right now is that very few people have the courage to take on entitlement reform because they fear failure or backlash, even though the need for it is fiscally obvious.\n\n\u201cThe fact that politicians say that\u2019s impossible is because they\u2019re not good leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re followers, is what it comes down to. The definition of leadership is inducing people to do something difficult on behalf of the whole society. Great leaders can take a country to war, yet we don\u2019t have leaders today who can reform our entitlements?\u201d\n\nAccording to Brooks, the longer Washington dawdles on the issue, the bigger the problem gets.\n\n\u201cThe creaking entitlement system that is just completely unsustainable is imperiling the safety net completely. We\u2019re going to have austerity. Just look at Greece,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s down the road for us at some point, and the people who will suffer are not the rich. They never are. It\u2019s always the poor. So if we love the poor, we have a responsibility to avoid austerity. That means we have to be solvent, and to be solvent means we have to be fiscal conservatives.\u201d\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Arthur C. Brooks:\n\nIn contrast to today\u2019s leaders who pretend issues of poverty and fiscal irresponsibility do not exist, Brooks offered a glimpse of what he thinks real leaders would do.\n\n\u201cWe have to have real leaders who have hard conversations about what the entitlement system should look like,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to throw somebody out on the street or take away benefits that are actually earned. You simply have to have some common-sense approaches to it.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we have leaders who are so poor that they can\u2019t even broach the conversation about what the retirement age ought to be when people are living longer and longer is just more evidence that we\u2019re incapable of doing hard things.\u201d\n\nBrooks said fiscally conservative solutions to keeping the nation solvent and lifting people out of poverty are the right approach, but the right has a problem. He said while conservative policies are far more compassionate and encouraging than the liberal approach of government cutting a check to the poor, conservatives have allowed the left to stake the higher moral ground on such issues.\n\nInstead, he said, conservatives need to do a better job of convincing people that they want them to succeed.\n\n\u201cGo from fighting against government institutions to fighting for people who are being held down and denied their equal rights to the pursuit of happiness, and you\u2019re going to be on track to starting a social movement and not just a protest movement,\u201d said Brooks, referring to the tea-party activists who he believes started a much needed revolt against Washington but need to do a better job of explaining what they support.\n\nSome of that starts with taking back the true definition of hot-button political terms. Brooks said conservatives have surrendered the term \u201csocial justice\u201d to the political left, when it should describe the opportunity culture small-government advocates seek to advance.\n\n\u201cConservatives never say \u2018social justice.\u2019 Why not?\u201d Brooks asked. \u201cWe believe in social justice. We just define it differently. The way we define \u2018social justice,\u2019 the way we define \u2018fairness,\u2019 the way we define \u2018compassion,\u2019 these are the definitions the majority of Americans share. It\u2019s time for us to start talking that way.\n\n\u201cIf you believe in poverty reduction like I do, you must be a fiscal conservative and you must have conservative values,\u201d he added.\n\nBrooks also stresses that creating opportunity means establishing a level playing field. He said that means not setting burdensome hurdles for people to chase their dreams and not having politicians handing out political favors to their donors and other political cronies.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if people vote Democrat or vote Republican. We have a moral obligation to stand up for people who need our opportunity society,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s in the way of that is very powerful people that are gaming the system, particularly at the corporate level, to make sure they can be in front of the line and in front of the little guys. It\u2019s not right. We have to stand up and denounce it.\u201d\n\nBut just as important as bold leadership and championing the rights of all Americans is how those messages are conveyed. In his book, Brooks lists what he calls \u201cThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective Conservatives.\u201d He says it\u2019s a debate strategy that helps conservatives win, with focuses on staking the moral high ground, fighting for people rather than against things, stealing good arguments, going to nontraditional audiences and more.\n\nBut he said the most urgent priority for conservative messaging is to get happy.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to follow someone who\u2019s grim, at least not for very long,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Republican Party only wins when it\u2019s the party of aspiration. Just ask the people who worked with Ronald Reagan. He threw away the playbook of malaise and throwing insults around and saying everybody\u2019s stupid. He said it\u2019s morning in America. We\u2019re going to fight for everyone. He was a true happy warrior.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Reducing the size of government entitlements and winning the war on poverty are both achievable goals, but American Enterprise Institute President Arthur C.
