Title II of GINA restricts how employers may collect and disclose genetic information and prohibits employers from using genetic information in employment decisions. EEOC\u2019s prior GINA regulations prohibit employers from offering incentives in return for \u201cgenetic information,\u201d which includes information about the \u201cmanifestation of a disease or disorder in family members of an individual.\u201d\n\nThe proposed rule is consistent with the EEOC proposed regulations published on April 20, 2015 regarding the application of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to employer wellness programs.\n\nThe proposed rule provides clarification on the following points:\n\nAn employer may offer, as part of its health plan, a limited incentive\u2014in the form of a reward or penalty (financial or in-kind)\u2014to an employee whose spouse (i) is covered under the employee\u2019s health plan; (ii) receives health or genetic services offered by the employer, including as part of a wellness program; and (iii) voluntarily provides information about his or her current or past health status as part of a health risk assessment, which may include a medical questionnaire, medical examination (e.g., blood pressure or blood test to detect high cholesterol or high glucose levels).\n\nThe total incentive allowed for an employee and spouse to participate in a wellness program that is part of a group health plan is 30% of the total cost of employee plus family coverage, and if offered to the employee alone, the maximum incentive is 30% of the total cost of self-only coverage. Note that these proposed regulations do not adopt the same 50% incentive allowance for enrollment in tobacco cessation programs as allowed under the existing wellness program regulations issued by the Department of Labor, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of Health and Human Services (Tri-Agencies) under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nEmployers may not require employees (or employees\u2019 spouses or dependents covered by the employee\u2019s health plan) to agree to the sale, or waive the confidentiality, of their genetic information as a condition for receiving an incentive or participating in a wellness program.\n\nAny health or genetic services an employer offers must be reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease. That means that the service must have a reasonable chance of improving the health of, or preventing disease in, participating individuals. An employer-sponsored wellness program cannot be overly burdensome to employees, a subterfuge for violating GINA or other employment discrimination laws, or highly suspect in the method chosen to promote health or prevent disease.\n\nInducements in exchange for current or past health status information about an employee\u2019s children (biological or not) are not permitted, although an employer may offer health or genetic services (including participation in a wellness program) to an employee\u2019s children on a voluntary basis and may ask questions about a child\u2019s current or past health status as part of providing such services.\n\nThe EEOC will accept comments on the proposed GINA regulations through December 29, 2015, and will likely finalize regulations based on those comments at some point in 2016. We expect that the final regulations will prohibit using a wellness program for \u201cgenetic tests,\u201d the meaning of which is still unclear. A possible prohibition would apply, for example, to a breast cancer BRCA test.\n\nThe breadth of this prohibition is anticipated to be the subject of many comments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Title II of GINA restricts how employers may disclose genetic info and prohibits employers from using genetic info in employment decisions", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently published a proposed rule to amend Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) as it relates to employer wellness pr", "title": "EEOC Amends Title II of Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/eeoc-amends-title-ii-genetic-information-nondiscrimination-act", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1141/dna1.jpg?itok=WdFxjDVX", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Nation, Government EEOC, Employee Benefits, Health, Administration, Genetic Information, GINA, Title II, Employment Decisions,", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Nation, Government EEOC, Employee Benefits, Health, Administration, Genetic Information, GINA, Title II, Employment Decisions,"}, "article_summary": "Title II of GINA restricts how employers may collect and disclose genetic information and prohibits employers from using genetic information in employment decisions.\nThe EEOC will accept comments on the proposed GINA regulations through December 29, 2015, and will likely finalize regulations based on those comments at some point in 2016.\nFriday, November 13, 2015The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently published a proposed rule to amend Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) as it relates to employer wellness programs that are part of group health plans.\nWe expect that the final regulations will prohibit using a wellness program for \u201cgenetic tests,\u201d the meaning of which is still unclear.\nAny health or genetic services an employer offers must be reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease."}
