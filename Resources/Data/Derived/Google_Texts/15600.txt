The Special College Issue of Winds of Change Magazine offers a list of the Top 200 Colleges for Native Americans that they’ve dubbed The 200 List.

As the introduction to the list says “the focus here is on the Native community and the support system, and from admissions to graduation.”

To choose schools to go on the list, the magazine “focused on schools with more than 40 American Indian undergraduates, or at least 2 percent, and those that award 10 or more baccalaureate degrees per year to Native students,” reads the introduction to the list. The latest information from the U.S. Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System database was also used, especially when it came to statistics for enrollment and graduation rates.

Bemidji State University was one of five Minnesota universities to make the list—Augsburg College, The College of St. Scholastica, the University of Minnesota and the University of Minnesota-Morris were the others.

“We are very proud to have Bemidji State University included on this prestigious list,” Dr. Anton Treuer, executive director of Bemidji State’s American Indian Resource Center, said in a release. “We work hard to serve the needs of our growing and diverse Native student population. Educational access is the key to economic opportunity and to strengthening Native nations.”

Winds of Change is published quarterly by the American Indian Science and Engineering Society. Its special annual college issue features the Top 200 Colleges for Native Americans list.
