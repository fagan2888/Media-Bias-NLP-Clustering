But underneath the rising cost and enrollment trends, something else has been happening:\n\nThe average per-person costs have been falling \u2013 particularly among those newly eligible for coverage under the federal health law.\n\nState Department of Social Services officials who oversee the Medicaid program said in recent interviews that it\u2019s too early to tell exactly what\u2019s causing the decline in per-person costs among those who became eligible under Obamacare \u2013 a group that, like its counterparts in other states, has drawn particular attention as people try to determine the financial consequences of expanding coverage.\n\nBut they suggested that the overall cost trend \u2013 per-person spending dropped 5.9 percent during the past fiscal year \u2013 reflects a variety of factors.\n\nThose include measures the state has undertaken:\n\nInitiatives to make it easier for people to receive long-term care in their homes or community settings, rather than in costlier nursing homes.\n\nEfforts to ensure that clients have primary care providers.\n\nIntensive care management programs for those with high needs.\n\nThe 2012 shift from using three managed care companies to handle Medicaid medical benefits \u2013 and take on the risk associated with clients' medical costs \u2013 to having one company administer the program with the state responsible for claims costs.\n\nBut DSS Finance Director Mike Gilbert also acknowledged other potential contributing factors, including budget cuts to the program and an influx of lower-cost clients.\n\n\u201cOur conjecture is that doing these right things, enabling primary care, putting applied care coordination techniques in place, really taking a goal-directed approach, that that saves money,\u201d Medicaid director Kate McEvoy said, \u201cas opposed to cutting the services and relying on managed care entities, which most states are doing, and they\u2019re not seeing our experience.\u201d\n\n\n\nOfficials also pointed to data suggesting improved health outcomes, including reduced rates of hospital admissions and emergency department visits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re achieving better performance at a lower cost,\u201d Gilbert said during a recent meeting of the council that oversees the Medicaid program.\n\nSeveral Medicaid council members expressed frustration at budget cuts to the program in recent years, and said the cost trends combined with data showing improved health outcomes should counter any pushes toward further cutbacks in the program as state leaders deal with future budget deficits.\n\n\u201cMedicaid keeps getting hit in the budget, and it can\u2019t absorb it anymore,\u201d said Rep. Catherine Abercrombie, D-Meriden, one of the legislature\u2019s most vocal advocates for social services.\n\nWhile rising costs are the norm in health care, Medicaid has an advantage in controlling costs that private insurers don\u2019t: While insurance companies must negotiate payment rates with health care providers, Medicaid programs generally set their own prices. And for the most part, Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid rates for providers haven\u2019t increased in recent years, with the exception of a bump for primary care providers as part of the federal health law. Many other providers, including ob-gyns, laboratories and radiologists, have faced rate cuts.\n\nThe numbers\n\nAnnual Medicaid costs have grown in recent years, from $4.08 billion during the 2010 fiscal year to an estimated $6.13 billion this year. A big chunk of that money is reimbursed by the federal government, including about 60 percent of the costs this fiscal year.\n\n\n\nThe spending increases largely reflect significant enrollment growth.\n\nIn June 2010, when the state began expanding the program under the federal health law, it covered just over 505,000 people. In December, 732,619 people were covered by Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid program, known as HUSKY.\n\n\n\nAccording to DSS figures, spending rose 5.7 percent during the 2015 fiscal year, while enrollment grew 12.4 percent.\n\nAnd the cost per person has fallen in recent years, according to DSS figures. Overall, it cost an average of $706 per month to cover a Medicaid client in the first three months of 2012. That dropped to $668 during the final three months of 2015, although the cost fluctuated within that time.\n\nGilbert said DSS reports the average monthly cost for each quarter because some payments are made on a quarterly basis and spending can vary significantly from month to month. The cost figures reflect when health care claims were paid, not when clients received care.\n\nThe overall figures also mask significant differences in spending between various parts of HUSKY.\n\n\n\nThe biggest decrease occurred among adults without minor children \u2013 the group made eligible by the federal health law, whose portion of the program is known as HUSKY D. Their average monthly per-person cost fell from $823 during the quarter that ended in September 2012 to $690 in the first three months of 2014. (The state expanded HUSKY eligibility in two stages, starting with the lowest-income adults in mid-2010 and raising the income threshold on Jan. 1, 2014.) The cost dropped to $625 during the quarter that ended in September.\n\nCosts were significantly lower, and more stable, among children and their parents, who account for about 61 percent of HUSKY clients, or close to 424,000 people as of September. In the quarter that ended September 2012, their monthly per-person cost averaged $331, compared to $316 during the quarter ending September 2015.\n\nNearly half of Medicaid spending covers the care of about 13 percent of clients \u2013 just under 95,000 seniors and people with disabilities, including those living in nursing homes. In the quarter ending September 2012, their monthly per-person cost averaged $2,328. It rose to $2,405 during the quarter that ended in September 2015.\n\nMcEvoy said a major factor in the cost stability of that segment of the program is the effort to provide more long-term care in people\u2019s homes or other community settings, rather than nursing homes.\n\nThe state now spends 55 percent of the money used to fund long-term care on institutional care, down from 67 percent in 2007, said Deb Migneault, senior policy analyst for Connecticut\u2019s Legislative Commission on Aging. And surveys show that those who have moved out of nursing homes are happier, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really dramatic change in the direction that we\u2019re going,\u201d Migneault said.\n\nThe expansion population\n\nThe health needs and costs of those who became eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare were big question marks of the health law: Would they have major medical needs after going without coverage?\n\nNational experience seems to indicate that the spike many anticipated from pent-up demand among the formerly uninsured didn\u2019t occur, McEvoy said.\n\n\u201cThat said, I think it\u2019s very early to be drawing conclusions,\u201d she said.\n\nIs it possible Connecticut addressed some of the pent-up demand for care before the health law?\n\nDr. Robert Zavoski, DSS\u2019 medical director, suggested that might have happened through the Charter Oak Health Plan, a state-run coverage option introduced by former Gov. M. Jodi Rell that was available to people, regardless of medical history, from 2008 to 2014. It covered many people with significant medical needs, including many who had gone for years without adequate care.\n\n\u201cWe had a number of folks who came into care, and their problem list ran several pages,\u201d Zavoski said. \u201cAnd we had a couple people who were on Charter Oak for three or four days and had a transplant.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Zavoski said he suspects those newly covered by Medicaid are likely to be significantly younger and healthier, although he added that it\u2019s still too early to tell how it will play out.\n\nAs of June, 35 percent of clients who were eligible as part of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion were aged 19 to 29, and another 16.5 percent were aged 30 to 39. Younger people tend to have lower health care costs.\n\nThe federal government currently reimburses the state for the full cost of the newly eligible clients' costs. That percentage will drop beginning next year, until it reaches 90 percent in 2020. For most other clients, the federal government reimburses the state for 50 percent of the costs.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/01/15/spending-and-enrollment-up-but-medicaid-per-person-cost-is-down/", "news_keywords": "Health Care", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/01/15/spending-and-enrollment-up-but-medicaid-per-person-cost-is-down/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid program is projected to cost the state and federal government more than $6 billion this year, and it covers close to one in five state residents, a dramatic growth from a decade ago.
