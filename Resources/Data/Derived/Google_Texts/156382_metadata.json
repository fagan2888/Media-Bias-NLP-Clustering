The rates of ADHD diagnosis increased an average of 3 percent every year from 1997 to 2006, and about 5 percent every year from 2003 to 2011. This rise in diagnoses has prompted concerns of misdiagnosis and over-diagnosis, and a new report from the Centers for Disease Control may have just added another reason to be concerned.\n\nAccording to the CDC, 9.5 percent of the children in the U.S. between the ages of 3 and 17 have received a diagnosis of ADHD, about 5.9 million kids. A new study revealed that one-third of these children were diagnosed before the age of 6.\n\nResearchers talked to nearly 3,000 parents of children who had been diagnosed with the disorder, and learned that the average age of diagnoses was 7 years old, meaning many children were diagnosed earlier than that.\n\nExperts cite multiple factors for these statistics.\n\nFirst of all, the overall increased rate is likely tied to children receiving a diagnosis at a younger age, according to Michael F. Troy, the medical director of behavioral health services at Children\u2019s Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIn general there\u2019s more awareness of the diagnosis, and once something\u2019s accepted as a relatively common diagnosis, it becomes less stigmatized,\u201d he told CBS News.\n\nTroy also cites a child\u2019s environment outside the home as a factor in ADHD diagnosis \u2014 younger children\u2019s symptoms may be easier to identify and subsequently cause problems.\n\n\u201cThe threshold to be dismissed from daycare of preschool is much lower than from elementary school or junior high or high school,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if you\u2019re a parent, and you have a child with highly disregulated behavior for any reason, it\u2019s easier for somebody to say that they can\u2019t come back to this daycare anymore. And now the parent has a problem that needs to be solved, whereas that wouldn\u2019t happen as quickly for a school-aged kid.\u201d\n\nThe difficulty in diagnosing ADHD also lies in the identification of behavior as the disorder, without considering other factors, said Troy. Oftentimes ADHD is a descriptor of behavior but does not include the etiology behind it.\n\n\u201cYou could have a severe cough and it could be because of a lot of reasons,\u201d Troy said. \u201cYou could have disregulated behavior and have difficulty focusing and concentrating, and it could be ADHD or it could be a combination of other conditions.\u201d\n\nExperts expressed concern that overdiagnosing ADHD can lead to more problems in the future, and they say that this potential for inaccurate diagnoses is the reason parents should closely monitor their child\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cOver-diagnosis presents a number of problems, including being improperly labled as ADHD if, in fact, another behavioral or psychiatric problem is the cause of the symptom,\u201d Dr. Danielle Fisher, vice chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., told HealthDay. \u201cThis could also lead to overmedication of such children.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the research found that for about one in five children, it was only family members who provided information to the doctor during ADHD assessment. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests information be collected from multiple sources, like teachers, coaches, and other adults involved with the child\u2019s care.\n\n\"It's important whenever possible to get data from a number of informants,\" Troy said. \"It's the best standard of practice to see how other people judge the behavior of the child and how they are doing in different contexts over and against expected developmental norms.\"\n\nThe study also found that slightly over half of the children with ADHD were diagnosed by a primary care physician, which Troy says highlights how necessary it is for primary care doctors to have access to mental health resources.\n\n\"One thing to take away from this is the importance of integrating and supporting primary care providers with appropriate mental health services,\" he said. \"We all know primary care visits tend to be pretty brief. It's very challenging for primary care providers to do the kind of data collection we discussed. It's something we know in the field and something we're working on, but we need to do a much better job overall.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cdc, says, more, children, are, being, diagnosed, adhd, young, ages", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "ADHD diagnoses have been rising for decades, but why are we diagnosing kids so young?", "title": "Kids Are Being Diagnosed With ADHD At Super Young Ages", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cdc-says-more-children-are-being-diagnosed-adhd-young-ages-351286", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/04/young-age.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "ADHD diagnoses have been rising for decades, but why are we diagnosing kids so young?", "title": "Kids Are Being Diagnosed With ADHD At Super Young Ages", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cdc-says-more-children-are-being-diagnosed-adhd-young-ages-351286", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/04/young-age.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/04/young-age.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-09-04T11:57:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T11:57:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "ADHD diagnoses have been rising for decades, but why are we diagnosing kids so young?"}, "article_summary": "The number of children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has risen steadily in the past 20 years.\nAccording to the CDC, 9.5 percent of the children in the U.S. between the ages of 3 and 17 have received a diagnosis of ADHD, about 5.9 million kids.\nThe rates of ADHD diagnosis increased an average of 3 percent every year from 1997 to 2006, and about 5 percent every year from 2003 to 2011.\nIt's very challenging for primary care providers to do the kind of data collection we discussed.\nA new study revealed that one-third of these children were diagnosed before the age of 6."}
