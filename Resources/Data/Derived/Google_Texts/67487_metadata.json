The act, comprising 906 pages, is the basic comprehensive substance of Obamacare. It was passed on a bill that was filibustered, and a supermajority vote of 60 was required to end that filibuster (by invoking cloture under Senate Rule 22). It was signed by the president on March 23, 2010, and became Public Law 111-148.\n\nA second bill, which was a reconciliation bill, was passed after that date to make a series of discrete budgetary changes in the ACA. That act, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, was signed by the president on March 30, 2010, and became Public Law 111-152. It comprises 54 pages, 42 of which dealt with health care. Like the reconciliation bill in 2010, the reconciliation bill that the president vetoed this month made discrete budgetary changes in existing law. That vetoed bill did not \u201crepeal\u201d Obamacare. It amended several of the law\u2019s budgetary components while leaving the basic structure of the law in place.\n\nThe Democrats played by the rules in 2010 in overcoming a filibuster to first pass the ACA, and then using the reconciliation process to pass a second bill making strictly budgetary changes in existing law. T he Republicans played by the rules this time to likewise make budgetary changes in existing law.\n\nProper procedure in 2010, proper procedure now.\n\nAlan Frumin, Bethesda\n\nThe writer was Senate p arliamentarian from 1977 to 2012.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "alan frumin, obamacare, affordable care act, Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, budget reconciliation, obama veto", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The Jan. 9 news article\u00a0\u201c Obama vetoes bill aimed at repealing health law \u201d repeated\u00a0a commonly held\u00a0misconception about the process used to pass\u00a0the Affordable Care Act in 2010: \u201cTo pass the Obamacar...", "title": "Obamacare was not passed using budget reconciliation", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamacare-was-not-passed-using-budget-reconciliation/2016/01/22/e72d321a-bed5-11e5-98c8-7fab78677d51_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/20/Editorial-Opinion/Images/503902824-397.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obamacare-was-not-passed-using-budget-reconciliation/2016/01/22/e72d321a-bed5-11e5-98c8-7fab78677d51_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "alan frumin, obamacare, affordable care act, Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, budget reconciliation, obama veto", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "e72d321a-bed5-11e5-98c8-7fab78677d51", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The Jan. 9 news article\u00a0\u201c Obama vetoes bill aimed at repealing health law \u201d repeated\u00a0a commonly held\u00a0misconception about the process used to pass\u00a0the Affordable Care Act in 2010: \u201cTo pass the Obamacar..."}, "article_summary": "Like the reconciliation bill in 2010, the reconciliation bill that the president vetoed this month made discrete budgetary changes in existing law.\nA second bill, which was a reconciliation bill, was passed after that date to make a series of discrete budgetary changes in the ACA.\nThat act, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, was signed by the president on March 30, 2010, and became Public Law 111-152.\nT he Republicans played by the rules this time to likewise make budgetary changes in existing law.\nProper procedure in 2010, proper procedure now."}
