We need a stronger economy and we change that reality.\u201d\n\nToomey said the president needs to do more to spur economic growth, citing the nation\u2019s 62.7 percent labor force participation rate, a statistic that measures those employed or actively looking for work against the entire U.S. population. The number is the lowest it\u2019s been since the 1970s. However, the unemployment rate is 5.6 percent, the lowest since June 2008.\n\nToomey also said the president should address his plan for health care and environmental regulations, especially the medical device tax put in place by the Affordable Care Act and President Obama\u2019s readiness to veto the Keystone XL pipeline bill.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping the president is open to taking a more balanced approach to regulation that is clearly holding back our economy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would run Canadian oil to American refineries off of the Gulf coast, would create as many as 40,000 jobs, Toomey said. But according to the Obama administration, the pipeline would create just 35 permanent jobs after construction.\n\nThe president also needs to put more of on an emphasis on national security, according to Toomey. He said the first step is reaching a deal with Iran to limit the country\u2019s nuclear program.\n\n\u201cI hope, in fact, that he\u2019ll change his mind and accept the wisdom of a new round of sanctions that would go into effect if the Iranians choose once again to have the deadline come and go without an agreement,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter failing to reach a deal in November, negotiators pushed the framework agreement deadline back to March and the end of June for the final pact.\n\nToomey also wants to see the president deliver a clear-cut strategy on how to stop the Islamic militant group ISIS. And, according to Toomey, it begins with Guantanamo Bay.\n\n\u201cThese folks go back to various hotbeds of Islamist terrorist activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThey go back with a new status of having been a Guantanamo Bay detainee, and they turn that status into the next stage in their career as a terrorist.\u201d\n\nTwenty-four detainees were freed in 2014 and five more were released Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt would be a very bad idea for the president to be releasing these people who are known to be dangerous, known to be likely to rejoin the fight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I intend to support legislation that would prevent further releases.\u201d\n\nThe address can be heard at 9 p.m. on 90.5 WESA and at WESA.fm.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government & Politics", "description": "When Pennsylvania\u2019s junior senator sits at his desk for the State of the Union Address tonight, he will have a specific list of items he would like", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wesa.fm/post/what-sen-pat-toomey-wants-state-union-address", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wesa/files/201412/WESA_logo_FB.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When Pennsylvania\u2019s junior senator sits at his desk for the State of the Union Address tonight, he will have a specific list of items he would like", "title": "What Sen.
