A candidate for office in Wyandotte County, Kan., faces felony charges following a crash that left four teens hospitalized.

Wyandotte County District Attorney Jerome Gorman charged Tamika Pledger Sunday afternoon. Gorman charged Pledger with four counts of reckless aggravated battery.

Pledger remains in the Wyandotte County Jail. She is a candidate for the Unified Government of Wyandotte County Commissioner, 1st District at large position. She has been a community leader decrying violence in the community especially involving young people.

Gorman said the charges relate to the injuries to the four teens who remain in the hospital.

A fifth teen was injured but it's unclear whether the injuries occurred in Friday's crash or in the alleged fight that Pledger told witnesses that she was trying to stop.
