He kicked off his final lap of the political race, and the New Year, with a press conference where he announced executive actions intended to reduce gun violence.\n\nTuesday morning, Obama opened the early part of the address with statistics that claimed 30,000 Americans fell victim to gun violence due to suicides, domestic violence, gang shootouts and accidents.\n\nCNN reports that to date, Obama has addressed the nation in regards to gun violence 15 times during his presidency. The foundation of the speech was four steps that Obama said should reduce gun violence in the U.S.\n\nGun sellers must get a license and conduct background checks. As it stands now, there are ways to purchase guns without a background check depending on where or how you purchase the gun. People who purchase guns online, for example, aren\u2019t subjected to the same scrutiny as someone who walks into a gun store. This will be an attempt to close the \u201cgun show loophole\u201d a term politicians have thrown around since gun violence incidents have escalated. Sellers who don\u2019t comply with these new rules will be subjected to criminal prosecutions.\n\nEnforce gun safety laws already in effect by adding 200 ATF agents and investigators. In addition, firearms dealers must report lost or stolen guns on a \u201ctimely basis.\u201d They will also work to increase protection for victims of domestic abuse from gun violence.\n\nIncrease support for people who suffer from mental disease and ensure that federal mental health records are also submitted to the background check system. \u201cAnd for those in Congress who so often rush to blame mental illness for mass shootings as a way of avoiding actions on guns, here\u2019s your chance to support these efforts,\u201d Obama commented.\n\nBoost gun safety technology. Obama announced that in 2013, more than 500 people lost their lives to gun accidents, which included 30 children under five years old. \u201cIn the greatest, most technologically advanced nation on Earth, there is no reason for this,\u201d stated Obama. He continued to express that guns need to get tech savvy and used examples like creating a \u201cfind my gun\u201d app similar to Apple\u2019s \u201cfind my iPhone\u201d app to decrease firearms getting into the wrong hands.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Vocative, in the four days before Obama\u2019s press conference, 147 people were killed by guns in the U.S. To get these findings, Vocative tallied shootings by searching Google for all mentions of gun-related deaths and cross referenced them with the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit organization that provides free online public access to information regarding gun-related violence in the U.S.\n\nTowards the end of the speech, Obama broke his political exterior to display a human response while talking about the Newtown massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School. As tears streamed down his face, he commented, \u201cEvery time I think about those kids it gets me mad. And by the way, it happens on the streets of Chicago every day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "The Pioneer", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://thepioneeronline.com/28946/showcase/what-did-obama-say-about-guns/", "article_author_name": "Kris Stewart", "image": "http://thepioneeronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ObamaGunControl_BrittanyEngland_WEB-826x900.png", "site_id": "0f5b11feecfe2c39a52b7b932229f229", "article_published_time": "2016-01-09T23:17:58+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-27T10:12:41+00:00", "keywords": "congress, executive action, gun safety, gun violence, obama, president, politics, showcase", "wp_version": "7.8.0.1"}, "language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Pioneer", "description": "It\u2019s President Obama\u2019s last year in office.
