But what about Mitch McConnell? He has been at least as complicit as Boehner. McConnell has given Obama: 1) 100% of his budget requests. 2) Fully funding Obamacare without any restraints 3) Fully funding Obama's illegal amnesty without any restraints 4) Raised the debt ceilings repeatedly without any restraints 5) Effectively given away the Senate's treaty deciding powers. 6) Refused to set up select committees to investigate the abuse of powers of this administration To be Senate Majority Leader, a Republican needs 51 votes (a Democrat would only need 50, because Lunch Box Joe would break a tie). Currently there are 54 Republicans. That means if a Republican challenged McConnell, only four Republicans would need to vote against him to topple him, assuming no Democrats voted for him.\n\nI think it is safe to say that Ted Cruz, who has fought repeatedly with McConnell over his efforts to support the Obama agenda, would vote against him. So I think would Mike Lee. Then there are two other Senators running for President. What is Marco Rubio's stand on this? If he supports the McConnell/Obama agenda, let him explain why. The same goes for Rand Paul. Put him on the spot and explain his support for McConnell as well. Perhaps the pressure of running for president might compell these two to vote against McConnell. In any event, there are other conservatives. Jeff Sessions of Alabama is a strong voice against illegal immigration. He might be a third vote. As for the fourth, who knows? Senators who pretend to be tea party conservatives, like Ben Sasse, Jodi Ernst, and Deb Fischer, might be put on the spot and pressured to do the right thing. And what about Tim Scott of South Carolina? Has anyone heard him speak out about any issue since he's been in the Senate? (I haven't). With two probable votes against McConnell (Cruz and Lee) and pressure on the others, McConnell might be toppled too. The sad fact is that most GOP senators agree with the McConnell agenda, but the spotlight on Senate presidential candidates and/or the threat of primaries for those up for reelection in 2016 could be enough to rid us of this supine gobbler.
