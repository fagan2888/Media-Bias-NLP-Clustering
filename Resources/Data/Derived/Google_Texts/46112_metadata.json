(Source: Reuters)\n\nFinding himself at odds with the US Supreme Court over its two landmark judgements upholding healthcare law and same-sex marriage, Louisiana\u2019s Indian-American governor Bobby Jindal wants to get rid of the court.\n\n\u201cThursday, the Supreme Court had its say on Obamacare; soon, the American people will have theirs,\u201d wrote the newly minted aspirant for Republican nomination for President in an opinion piece in Time magazine.\n\nThe Court\u2019s decision upholding subsidies for states participating in the federally run insurance exchange, he wrote, \u201cviolates the plain text of Obamacare,\u201d as President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law Affordable Care Act is nicknamed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad outcome for the rule of law \u2013 and the English language,\u201d said Jindal who like other Republican governors has refused to set up a marketplace or exchange where people can shop for affordable health insurance.\n\nBut an estimated 138,000 residents of Louisiana are getting federal subsidies through the federal exchange that is open to those who don\u2019t have access to state exchanges.\n\n\u201cContrary to this President\u2019s self-proclaimed edicts, yesterday\u2019s Supreme Court decision is not the end of the debate on Obamacare,\u201d said Jindal.\n\nIt merely \u201cshifts back to the elected branches of government \u2013 the ones that caused our health care mess in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is there that conservatives can complete our work to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nJindal\u2019s reaction to the apex court\u2019s ruling legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide was even more sharp.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is completely out of control, making laws on their own, and has become a public opinion poll instead of a judicial body,\u201d he said in a statement from Iowa, which holds the first presidential caucus.\n\n\u201cIf we want to save some money, let\u2019s just get rid of the court,\u201d Jindal added.\n\nJindal later said that the ruling fundamentally redefined the institution of marriage.\n\n\u201cMarriage between a man and a woman was established by God, and no earthly court can alter that,\u201d he added.\n\nHe also argued that protecting same-sex marriage would open the door to discrimination against people of faith who oppose its practice.\n\nDespite the Supreme Court judgment, the Jindal administration has said Louisiana\u2019s state government won\u2019t recognize gay marriage for now.\n\nBut Mike Reed, Jindal\u2019s spokesman in the governor\u2019s office, acknowledged \u201cOur agencies will have no choice but to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision\u201d eventually, he told NOLA.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bobby Jindal,
