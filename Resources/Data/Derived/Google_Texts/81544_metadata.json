But at least they\u2019ve sniffed the postseason since the Cold War ended.\n\nThe Kansas City Royals, who came to Coors Field on Tuesday rolling toward October as the hottest team in baseball, haven\u2019t played in the playoffs since winning the World Series with George Brett in 1985.\n\nNever mind the Rockies\u2019 three consecutive losing seasons and the possibility of 100 losses this year. For 29 years, the Royals haven\u2019t finished better than seven games back more than once.\n\nBut there\u2019s a way out. The Royals \u2014 behind a modest lineup and sturdy, if not spectacular, pitching \u2014 are proving there\u2019s always hope.\n\n\u201cWhat you do is, you don\u2019t panic. You stay patient,\u201d Royals manager Ned Yost said. \u201cKeep putting them out there. If you have faith in them and you have trust in them, you keep putting them out there. Because sooner or later, it\u2019s going to click.\u201d\n\nThe Royals on Tuesday night got consecutive doubles from Omar Infante and Salvador Perez off Rockies reliever Adam Ottavino for a three-run seventh inning.\n\nAfter another three-run inning in the eighth, the Royals went on to beat the Rockies 7-4, their 14th victory in their past 16 games.\n\nKansas City, at 70-55, maintained its two-game lead over the Detroit Tigers atop the American League Central. And the Royals are 15-4 against the National League.\n\nWith a payroll more than $1 million less than Colorado\u2019s, the Royals are 21 games better. In other words, the Royals have spent $1.3 million per win this season; the Rockies have spent $1.9 million.\n\n\u201cAt some point, the light switch turns on and you\u2019re no longer just glad to be here,\u201d Royals first baseman Billy Butler said. \u201cYou know you can win.\u201d\n\nKansas City is winning in ways that would baffle a diehard Rockies fan. The Royals\u2019 highest slugging percentage belongs to left fielder Alex Gordon, at .448. He would rank sixth in the Rockies lineup.\n\nInstead, the Royals are winning with balance. They rarely strike out, with a 15.8 percent K rate \u2014 the best mark in baseball by a wide margin. They also rarely walk. But never mind that, because they steal bases (AL-best 110) and play defense (their defense saves 50.2 runs above average, according to FanGraphs).\n\n\u201cTo win, if you\u2019re talking about winning a championship, you have to be complete,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cIf you have holes, you\u2019re going to get exposed in October. But defense is a big part of it. We talk about defense and pitching going hand in hand, and generally they do. If you can keep the other team from scoring, by pitching well and catching the ball, that\u2019s a good formula for success.\u201d\n\nJeremy Guthrie, who pitched half a season for the Rockies in 2012 and was traded to Kansas City before Colorado finished with a franchise-worst 98 losses, revived himself in Royals blue. He has won 29 games since then. He is now hedging toward the playoffs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very confident of our team as a unit for the past two seasons,\u201d Guthrie said. \u201cOne of the big things is, we haven\u2019t been as consistent as a winning team needs to be. We\u2019ve had runs of good stretches and bad stretches and the bad stretches have been too long to be a team that competes at the end of the season. This year, we\u2019ve done a better job with that.\u201d\n\nThe Royals last lost 100 games in 2006 \u2014 a mark the Rockies have yet to reach (or fall to). But they have lost 90 or more in five of the past seven seasons.\n\n\u201cThey have to learn that themselves. You tell \u2019em, you tell \u2019em, you tell \u2019em \u2014 all the time. That\u2019s the process. You\u2019re always telling them how good they are,\u201d Yost said.\n\n\u201cBut until they believe it in their heart \u2014 it hits a point when they believe it. And when they come together as a group and they believe in each other. That\u2019s part of your job, to continue to help them grow, help them believe it.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Royals journey from cellar to contender provides hope for Rockies fans", "title": "Royals journey from cellar to contender provides hope for Rockies fans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/19/royals-journey-from-cellar-to-contender-provides-hope-for-rockies-fans/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140819__rockies-royalsp1.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140819__rockies-royalsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-19T22:02:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:07:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb084\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOne of the big things is, we haven\u2019t been as consistent as a winning team needs to be.\nIn other words, the Royals have spent $1.3 million per win this season; the Rockies have spent $1.9 million.\nThe Royals \u2014 behind a modest lineup and sturdy, if not spectacular, pitching \u2014 are proving there\u2019s always hope.\nBut never mind that, because they steal bases (AL-best 110) and play defense (their defense saves 50.2 runs above average, according to FanGraphs).\nAfter another three-run inning in the eighth, the Royals went on to beat the Rockies 7-4, their 14th victory in their past 16 games."}
