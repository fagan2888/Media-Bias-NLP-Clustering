He says if elected, he plans to take his business experience to city government.\n\n\u201cI see Van Buren, and my goal is for it to grow, vitalize itself to create a vibrant town where people don\u2019t feel like they have to leave town to enjoy [themselves],\u201d Blake said.\n\nThe mayor is currently serving his second term and said if he wins, this will be his third and final term, wanting to finish the projects he\u2019s started, including a new police station and senior center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way; we\u2019ve got a long way to go.\u201d Mayor Freeman said. \u201cYou never stop and say, okay we\u2019re through. There\u2019s always something ahead, and my goal if elected over the next four years is to continue that, and at the end of the four years I want to be able to hand this off to the next person.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy decision [to run] was listening to the community and feeling like they\u2019re ready for a change and trying to provide some things that\u2019s not currently being provided,\u201d Blake said.\n\nIf re-elected, Mayor Freeman said he\u2019ll focus on improvements to city parks and economic development. He said he\u2019s most proud of a 70-percent approval rate of the penny sales tax passed to help fund ongoing projects.\n\n\u201cThose results say a lot about the citizens of Van Buren,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really proud and still am proud say I was the mayor and leader at that time and want to continue that to the future.\u201d\n\nBlake believes a tax-base needs to be created through tourism, which he says happens by attracting commerce and having a vibrant downtown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to compete; it\u2019s time for us to polish the city up and promote ourselves,\u201d Blake said.\n\n\u201cOur downtown has struggled without a doubt, but was starting to see a turnaround. We're starting to see some investors that are there,\u201d Mayor Freeman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great heritage; we\u2019ve got a great history. My great-grandfather was a part of that downtown, and I want to see that continue.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, records show freeman won by 56-percent of the votes.
