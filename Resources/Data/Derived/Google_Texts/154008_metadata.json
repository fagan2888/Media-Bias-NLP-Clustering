Dec. 15 is the deadline for those wishing to be covered by Jan. 1, and enrollment in the federal exchange is open through March 31.\n\n\u201cTake time to look and digest the information, and wait until the end of the month or even Dec. 15,\u201d Plese said.\n\nAndrew Remala, a student, said he was glad to learn more about the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an essential need of the millennials to actually understand the process and the economics to keep insurance coverage for younger people,\u201d he said.\n\nOrganizations elsewhere were busy helping Arizonans learn about their options.\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s Health Initiatives fielded so many calls that everyone pitched in answering them, said Jon Ford, a spokesman.\n\n\u201cWe are not getting calls from younger people, but we are getting calls from lots of parents asking about options for their adult children,\u201d he said.\n\n- 30 -", "article_metadata": {"DC.rights": "All rights reserved", "twitter": {"description": "As
