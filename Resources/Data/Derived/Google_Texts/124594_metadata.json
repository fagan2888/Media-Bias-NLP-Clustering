They found that on average, the stock prices of these companies increased 74 percent over the period of time from five days before the name-change announcement to five days afterward.\n\nThe firm then made its first move, adopting a new name, Cosmoz.com, that would telegraph its aspirations in the blooming digital economy. The market rewarded it handsomely for the change: Its stock price soared to $5, and later cooled off to $2. Wary of the way stocks like this could lure in investors, the director of the SEC\u2019s investor-education office told the Wall Street Journal , \u201cDon\u2019t invest by just a name. That is asking for losses.\u201d\n\nBy January of 1999, a company called MIS International had yet to turn a profit or do any business. Its stock was trading at well below 50 cents per share.\n\nThe researchers called this surge \"striking,\" in part because the gains resulting from a name change didn't disappear over time. In other words, a company that changed its name, and nothing else, got a one-time, permanent increase in its stock price. Perhaps even more striking was the fact that this effect was spread across all the firms studied\u2014even those that didn\u2019t do business on the Internet.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors, led by Michael J. Cooper, concluded that the market\u2019s behavior indicated \u201ca mania on the part of investors.\u201d While evidence is scant that a name change leads to long-term gains, bubbles seem to be one of conventional wisdom\u2019s blind spots. In the 1920s, when there was a mania over airplane-related stocks, investors lusted after shares of a company called Seaboard Airlines; only later did they find out that the company had renamed itself, and was actually in the railroad industry.\n\nBut that\u2019s not where this story ends. Starting around mid-2000, companies began shedding the \u201c.com\u201d from their names, a move that one analyst explained at the time to the Associated Press as companies \u201cdistancing themselves from that smell.\u201d Cooper, along with one of his co-authors and a crew of new researchers, then published another study, this one examining this reverse trend.\n\nIn the late '90s, a company that changed its name, and nothing else, got a one-time permanent increase in its stock price.\n\nTracking 67 firms that changed their names post-bust, the researchers found that during the period from a month before the name-change announcement until a month afterward, companies saw their stock prices rise 64 percent on average. As in Cooper's first study, a name change brought about a lasting increase in share price.\n\nThese results pointed to similar levels of irrationality, or at least ignorance, on the part of investors. The majority of the companies they studied had changed their names but not their Internet-centric business models, and these companies saw average returns of about 42 percent over the course of 60 days. There were, however, seven firms of the 67 that adopted business models less dependent on the Internet\u2014firms that actually earned their name changes. These companies, maddeningly, didn\u2019t see any statistically significant returns following their name changes.\n\nInternet.com\u2014which held a domain name that was prime real estate in its digital-manic time\u2014was one company that successfully rode the waves of boom and bust. In 1998, it changed its name from Mecklermedia to Internet.com, and then in 2001, it changed its name again, to INTMedia Group. Its stock price jumped 54 percent after the announcement of the second change. As its CEO told the AP, \u201cIt\u2019s window dressing for the financial community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just adding that one punctuation mark and three letters used to send stock prices up, on average, 74 percent.", "author": "Joe Pinsker", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Just adding that one punctuation mark and three letters used to send stock prices up, on average, 74 percent.", "title": "The Once-Upon-a-Time Magic of Adding '.com' to a Company's Name", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/08/RTR7IW/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/08/the-once-upon-a-time-magic-of-adding-com-to-a-companys-name/375658/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4125\"", "article_summary": "The market rewarded it handsomely for the change: Its stock price soared to $5, and later cooled off to $2.\nIn other words, a company that changed its name, and nothing else, got a one-time, permanent increase in its stock price.\nIn the late '90s, a company that changed its name, and nothing else, got a one-time permanent increase in its stock price.\nThe researchers called this surge \"striking,\" in part because the gains resulting from a name change didn't disappear over time.\nIn 1998, it changed its name from Mecklermedia to Internet.com, and then in 2001, it changed its name again, to INTMedia Group."}
