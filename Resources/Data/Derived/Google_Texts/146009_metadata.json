Professionalism. The organization. And their fans.\n\nJarome Iginla had two power-play goals, the second breaking a tie with 32.9 seconds remaining, as Colorado closed out its season with a 3-2 victory over Chicagoon Saturday, giving the Avs a sweep of those final three.\n\nCody McLeod \u2014 the senior Avalanche player in terms of continuous tenure with the franchise \u2014 had the other goal, and Semyon Varlamov made 28 saves and collected his 28th victory of the season. It came in front of a sellout, standing-room-only crowd of 18,049 at the Pepsi Center \u2014 albeit one that again included many fans in Blackhawks regalia.\n\nANALYSIS: Avs had multiple reasons for season gone bad\n\n\u201cOur captain (Gabe Landeskog) made some comments in the paper about those three games, and then we won the three of them,\u201d Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said. \u201cThat makes me proud of them and showed we have character, showed we have pride, and certainly as a coach, I\u2019m very happy with those three games, no doubt about it.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche finished 39-31-12, and the 90 points were the fourth-lowest total for the franchise in the 18 full seasons Colorado has played since arriving in Denver in 1995. The positive note was that the Avalanche\u2019s 48 points in the second half represented an upswing, and the 17-9-1 record in the final 27 games was a pace that would have gotten Colorado in the playoffs if maintained over the full season.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of regret,\u201d Roy said of the season coming to an end minus a playoff appearance. \u201cI have said many times, I am here to win the Stanley Cup, I am here to win and make the playoffs in order to win a Stanley Cup. Obviously, it is a disappointment. We\u2019re all disappointed our situation, but at the same time, I\u2019d like to think we\u2019ll benefit from it. I\u2019d like to think that will make us a better team along the way.\u201d\n\nThe Blackhawks were locked into the No. 3 playoff slot in the Central Division earlier in the day when the Minnesota Wild lost to St. Louis, meaning the Wild couldn\u2019t catch Chicago and drop the Hawks into a wild-card spot. With the Nashville-Chicago first-round matchup set, and with the Predators guaranteed of opening at home, the Blackhawks gave two of their stars \u2014 center Jonathan Toews and defenseman Duncan Keith \u2014 the night off in Denver. And Corey Crawford\u2019s backup, Scott Darling, got the start in the Chicago net.\n\nColorado\u2019s much-maligned power play was 2-for-2 for the night, and Iginla had both goals to get his team-leading total to 29. His first goal, at 14:21 of the second period, gave the Avalanche a 2-1 lead, but the Blackhawks tied it up again when Brandon Saad scored at 15:20 of the third. Then Iginla scored again to give the Avs the win.\n\nIginla, 37, came up just short of having his 13th 30-goal season, but he ended up only one short of that benchmark \u2014 and only one short of the total he posted last season for Boston, in advance of signing a three-year deal with Colorado as an unrestricted free agent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate to play with great players and chemistry has grown,\u201d Iginla said. \u201cI feel good and this year was a tough start for all of us, the first 20 games. But as a group I felt we got better and personally, I was able to get back in sync.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have the start he wanted,\u201d Roy said of Iginla, who had two goals in the first 20 games. \u201cBut I have to admit, 29 goals \u2026 I would have loved to see him get the 30th, but he was close. It was a great year for him. When we lost Paul (Stastny) , we thought (Iginla) was going to do a good job for us, and he did exactly that.\u201d\n\nREAD: Evaluating the Avs players for the 2014-15 season\n\nMatt Duchene had an assist on Iginla\u2019s first goal, and he finished with 21 goals and 55 points, down from his totals of 23 and 70 in 71 games a year ago.\n\n\u201cI was looking back at the schedule today \u2026 and we kind of put ourselves in such a hole in October and November,\u201d he said. \u201cWe played pretty good hockey from December on, but we just couldn\u2019t get out of it. We finished with 90 points and it\u2019s still not good enough, so it\u2019s pretty crazy nowadays, especially in this division. We know how important a start is and how important those divisional games are.\u201d\n\nAnd his own season?\n\n\u201cIt was frustrating at times,\u201d said Duchene. \u201cThere were a lot of times during the year where I liked my game and I thought I was generating a lot of chances and they just didn\u2019t go in as much this year. Having said that, there\u2019s still lots of stuff I\u2019m learning and I definitely got better from this season, for sure.\u201d\n\nWith defenseman Brad Stuart unavailable because of a cut leg, Duncan Siemens, recalled from Lake Erie on Friday, made his NHL debut for the Avs. He had 14:00 of ice time and most often was paired with Tyson Barrie.\n\nWhile Siemens played his first game, veteran forward Daniel Briere might have played his last. \u201cIt\u2019s very possible,\u201d Briere said after getting 8:44 of ice time against the Blackhawks.\n\nBriere\u2019s contract is up and the Avalanche likely won\u2019t attempt to re-sign him. He has 307 goals and it\u2019s possible he\u2019s reached the end of his career. His fiancee, Capt. Misha Harrell, is a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force, now stationed in North Carolina after overseas postings, including to the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThere are other things I have to think about,\u201d Briere said. \u201cI\u2019ve been away from my (three) kids the past two years. It\u2019s been fun playing in Montreal and in Denver. It\u2019s been a blast with two wonderful organizations, but there are other things I have to take into account here for the future. We\u2019ll see. I need a few weeks, too, to think about it.\u201d\n\nAlso, Avalanche assistant Tim Army coached his 1,000th game in the NHL.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche ends season on high note with victory over Blackhawks", "title": "Avalanche ends season on high note with victory over Blackhawks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/11/avalanche-ends-season-on-high-note-with-victory-over-blackhawks/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_105458_jarome-iginla-1.jpg", "height": 485}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150411_105458_jarome-iginla-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T21:34:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T00:42:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I need a few weeks, too, to think about it.\u201dAlso, Avalanche assistant Tim Army coached his 1,000th game in the NHL.\nGoing into the final three-game homestand, the Avalanche players were adamant about having some things \u2014 and someone \u2014 left to play for.\n\u201cThere is a lot of regret,\u201d Roy said of the season coming to an end minus a playoff appearance.\nI\u2019d like to think that will make us a better team along the way.\u201dThe Blackhawks were locked into the No.\nWe know how important a start is and how important those divisional games are.\u201dAnd his own season?"}
