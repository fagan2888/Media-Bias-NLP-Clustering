States like Indiana, Arkansas and Mississippi have successively broadened their RFRAs to the point that they now could allow discrimination against protected groups, including women and LGBT people.\n\nIn addition, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the 2014 Hobby Lobby case that the federal RFRA could be used, enabling employers to refuse to provide birth control coverage otherwise guaranteed by federal law.\n\nThese issues have sparked national protest and even international condemnation. Now, Democratic Representatives Joe Kennedy (Mass.) and Bobby Scott (Va.) have authored a bill to try to remedy the situation.\n\nAs introduced in the House, the Do No Harm Act would amend the RFRA to \u201cprotect civil rights and otherwise prevent meaningful harm to third parties, and for other purposes.\u201d\n\nThe text of the bill makes clear that the RFRA can only be invoked in cases where the federal government itself is involved. Furthermore, the legislation states that the RFRA cannot be used as an \u201cexemption that permits discrimination against other persons, including persons who do not belong to the religion or adhere to the other beliefs of those to whom the exemption is given.\u201d\n\nEssentially, this legislation would emphasize that the RFRA is not permission to discriminate against LGBT people, women or other groups. Nor does the RFRA grant broad exemptions to avoid nondiscrimination legislation on the basis of so-called \u201creligious objections.\u201d\n\nLegal groups like the ACLU are backing this legislation as a necessary limit to the scope of the RFRA.\n\n\u201cReligious freedom gives us the right to our beliefs, but not to harm others,\u201d Louise Melling, deputy legal director of the ACLU explained. \u201cThe Do No Harm Act would place much needed limitations on RFRA so that it can be used as a shield for religious exercise but not as a sword. With the Do No Harm Act, RFRA could no longer be invoked to justify discrimination, denial of health care, or other harms. We at the ACLU are proud to stand in support of this legislation.\u201d\n\nWhile the initial effect of this legislation would be subtle, its implications could be very important.\n\nStates that have enacted their own RFRAs have cited the federal act and claimed that they are only enshrining in state law what has been protected by federal law.\n\nIn many recent cases, such bills have used slightly different language than the federal RFRA. Analysts say these minor modifications have opened up the possibility of broader discrimination. For example, RFRAs are being used as justification to refuse to recognize and provide services for same-gender marriages, despite civil rights laws and the Supreme Court asserting that LGBT people deserve the same rights and dignity as straight couples.\n\nWhile the Do No Harm Act would not repeal those state level bills, it would show how grossly exaggerated the religious exemptions being claimed have become \u2014 and make clear that they do not have a basis in federal law.\n\nUncertainty over the RFRA has had significant consequences for the courts, too. This month the Supreme Court found itself in a 4-4 deadlock over a case known as Zubik v. Burwell. The case centers on the contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act, as several religious parties argue that providing contraception as part of their insurance violates their religious beliefs.\n\nAs Lambda Legal argues in its support for the Do No Harm Act, this case should have been a simple one for the Supreme Court, especially because a number of appeals courts had already ruled against the religious right to refuse the contraception mandate.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court punted the case back to the lower courts and, thus, refused to take up the central religious exemptions question. Congress needs to clarify the law, and the Do No Harm Act would do so in a way that keeps with the original intent behind the RFRA.\n\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s widely expected that the Republican-controlled Congress will do nothing with this legislation. Indeed, Republicans in the House have recently passed an amendment to a federal spending bill which would undermine President Obama\u2019s executive order protecting LGBT rights for businesses that contract with the government.\n\nNevertheless, the Do No Harm Act is a necessary step in scaling back the rampant misuse of religion as a weapon against women and minority groups.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats in Congress have introduced legislation that would amend federal law to clarify that while religious freedom is critical to civil life, it cannot be", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3179/3178080.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "do no harm act,dnha,religious freedom restoration act,rfra,lgbt,lgbt rights,lgbt equality,hobby lobby,zubik v. burwell,religious freedom,religious discrimination,marriage equality", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With the Do No Harm Act, RFRA could no longer be invoked to justify discrimination, denial of health care, or other harms.\nNevertheless, the Do No Harm Act is a necessary step in scaling back the rampant misuse of religion as a weapon against women and minority groups.\nThis month the Supreme Court found itself in a 4-4 deadlock over a case known as Zubik v.
