CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - Phillips Exeter Academy officials say they are hiring a law firm to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct on campus, including several new reports received recently.

School officials at the elite prep school sent an email to parents and alumni Saturday informing them of recent developments. The letter was also posted on the schoolâ€™s Facebook page.

The school is not identifying the law firm.

Officials earlier this week said police are investigating four new allegations of abuse at the boarding school. They came to light after the school acknowledged last month that longtime teacher Rick Schubart admitted to two cases of sexual misconduct dating back to the 1970s and 1980s.

Schubart was forced to retire and leave campus housing in 2011.

Authorities say the new cases do not involve Schubart.
