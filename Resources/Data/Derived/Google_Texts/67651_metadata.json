Thank you, unions and the American labor movement! And thank you, Grover Cleveland, for being a cynical strikebreaker who thought he could appease angry workers and stay in office by signing off on a pro-labor holiday. Cleveland didn\u2019t win reelection, but his transparent bid for public favor gave us a day off to eat hot dogs with our extended families and reflect on the current status of the American worker.\n\nSo how are we doing? How\u2019s the Republican-led House of Representatives faring on worker issues? (Spoiler: Womp womp.)\n\nWomen still don\u2019t have equal pay.\n\nWomen, on average, earn less than their male peers. Even in the same jobs. Even for the same hours worked. Even when they have the same level of education. According to a 2003 analysis from the Government Accountability Office, the pay gap persists between men and women even when factoring in part-time work and women taking time off to have children or care for other family members. \u201cEven after accounting for key factors that affect earnings, our model could not explain all of the difference in earnings between men and women,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAnd a breakdown of median weekly salaries from the Bureau of Labor Statistics reveals that women earn less than men in all but seven of the 600 listed occupations that the government has data on. A male high school teacher makes, on average, $1,050 a week. His female colleague earns, on average, 93 percent of that. A male physician makes, on average, $2,099 a week. His female colleague earns, on average, 67 percent of that.\n\nSo what\u2019s the mystery ingredient to explain the otherwise unexplainable and persistent gap in wages? The Department of Labor has a theory:\n\nDecades of research shows a gender gap in pay even after factors like the kind of work performed and qualifications (education and experience) are taken into account. These studies consistently conclude that discrimination is the best explanation of the remaining difference in pay. Economists generally attribute about 40 percent of the pay gap to discrimination \u2014 making about 60 percent explained by differences between workers or their jobs.\n\nAnd far from being equal in its unequalness, the pay gap is worse for women of color and LGBTQ women. African-American women who work full-time year round earn 64 cents on the dollar; Latina women earn 54 cents on the dollar. These losses add up, amounting to thousands and thousands of dollars over a lifetime.\n\nWomen have more tools than ever at their disposal to challenge this kind of discrimination, but are still playing catch-up when it comes to ensuring they receive equal pay for equal work. Part of changing this involves a really sweeping cultural overhaul that reevaluates how men and women are valued, both in the labor force and at home. But it would be great if, in the meantime, Congress would implement some of the measures proposed to increase transparency and accountability in rectifying this gap, like the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed again in 2014 but would have made it illegal for employers to punish workers who share information about their wages. And sharing information about your wages is one way to find out if your wages are grossly unequal.\n\nMinimum wage workers still can\u2019t support themselves on a full-time salary.\n\nMore than 25 percent of low-wage workers are single mothers. The minimum wage has been stalled at $7.25 an hour since 2009, meaning that even working full-time, these families are only bringing in $14,500 each year, which is $4,000 below the poverty level for a family with two children. And if you can\u2019t get a full-time schedule (or a reliably full-time schedule), the situation can become even more dire.\n\nRaising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to a meager $10.10 an hour would boost earnings for 28 million workers, and would help lift millions of women out of poverty. Overall, two out of every three minimum wage workers is a woman, and many of those women are also mothers or the primary caregivers in their households. Despite widespread support across gender and party lines, Republican lawmakers almost uniformly oppose a modest raise to the minimum wage, leaving millions of families in poverty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Take a moment from eating hot dogs with your extended family to consider the status of the American worker!", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Take a moment from eating hot dogs with your extended family to consider the status of the American worker!", "title": "GOP\u2019s Labor Day scorecard: Here\u2019s how they\u2019re flunking and hurting us all", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/01/gops_labor_day_scorecard_heres_how_theyre_flunking_and_hurting_us_all/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/blackburn_bachmann2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Take a moment from eating hot dogs with your extended family to consider the status of the American worker!", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/blackburn_bachmann2.jpg", "title": "GOP\u2019s Labor Day scorecard: Here\u2019s how they\u2019re flunking and hurting us all", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "GOP\u2019s Labor Day scorecard: Here\u2019s how they\u2019re flunking and hurting us all", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, economy, Editor's Picks, equal pay, Family, family and medical insurance leave act, Gender, hot dogs, Labor, Labor Day, Labor movement, Minimum wage, paid family leave, Poverty, sick leave, Unions, women, Work, Workers' Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf61c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: economy, Editor's Picks, equal pay, Family, family and medical insurance leave act, Gender, hot dogs, Labor, Labor Day, Labor movement, Minimum wage, paid family leave, Poverty, sick leave, Unions, women, Work, Workers' Rights, Politics NewsHappy Labor Day, everyone.\nAfrican-American women who work full-time year round earn 64 cents on the dollar; Latina women earn 54 cents on the dollar.\nAnd far from being equal in its unequalness, the pay gap is worse for women of color and LGBTQ women.\nDespite widespread support across gender and party lines, Republican lawmakers almost uniformly oppose a modest raise to the minimum wage, leaving millions of families in poverty.\nMinimum wage workers still can\u2019t support themselves on a full-time salary."}
