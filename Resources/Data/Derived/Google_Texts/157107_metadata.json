When you play something for somebody, it's just like giving them a present.\u201d\n\nMa will be the first recipient of a Fred Rogers Legacy Award, developed by the Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children's Media at St. Vincent College in Unity.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to focus on elements of service that pay forward Fred Rogers' legacy,\u201d said Karen Strubel Myers, director of development at the center.\n\nThe award was conceived as part of the center's 10th anniversary. The award will not necessarily be an annual honor, but will recognize meritorious work, Myers said.\n\nJoanne Rogers, wife of the late Fred Rogers, acted as honorary chairwoman for the center's advisory council in giving the award to Ma.\n\n\u201cHe, of course, told her he wanted to come to St. Vincent to receive it,\u201d Myers said.\n\nOn May 23, Ma will give a recital after accepting the award at a ceremony in the St. Vincent Basilica.\n\nWith 75 albums and 15 Grammy awards, Ma is a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, among many other awards, including the designation as a United Nations Messenger of Peace.\n\nIn 1998, Ma established the Silk Road Project to promote the study of the cultural, artistic and intellectual traditions along the Silk Road trade route that stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIt includes Silk Road Connect, a multidisciplinary middle school engagement initiative designed to encourage a lifelong passion for learning.\n\nMa focuses on using his gifts to benefit others, said Junlei Li, visiting professor in early learning and children's media in the Fred Rogers Center.\n\n\u201cHe's used all of those skills to serve,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe're thrilled the connection between him and Fred Rogers continues. ... It's not about nostalgia, it's about thinking, what does all this mean for the young people and grown-ups of today?\u201d\n\nTickets for the reception, ceremony and recital are $150, with proceeds benefiting scholarships and fellowships at the center.\n\nFor more information, go to fredrogerslegacyaward.com or call the center at 724-805-2750.\n\nStacey Federoff is a staff writerfor Trib Total Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Stacey Federoff", "description": "In a 1985 episode of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' Yo-Yo Ma, the world-renowned cellist, performs two Bach movements before the show's host tells his audience; ''Do ...", "pubdate": "2014-04-06 23:12:01", "author": "Stacey Federoff", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "In a 1985 episode of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' Yo-Yo Ma, the world-renowned cellist, performs two Bach movements before the show's host tells his audience; ''Do ...", "title": "Yo-Yo Ma to receive first Fred Rogers Legacy Award", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=qhOOr7fexptnqj_AlyDR0s$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvDRupvTmk6rlEWDy8zt4IOWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-04-06 23:12:01.312", "url": "http://triblive.com/news/westmoreland/5865856-74/rogers-fred-center", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a 1985 episode of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' Yo-Yo Ma, the world-renowned cellist, performs two Bach movements before the show's host tells his audience; ''Do ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "Yo-Yo Ma to receive first Fred Rogers Legacy Award", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=qhOOr7fexptnqj_AlyDR0s$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYvDRupvTmk6rlEWDy8zt4IOWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-04-06 23:12:01", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "Yo-Yo Ma to receive first Fred Rogers Legacy Award", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/news/westmoreland/5865856-74/rogers-fred-center", "keywords": "award, center, early, fred, learning", "headline": "Yo-Yo Ma to receive first Fred Rogers Legacy Award", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Westmoreland", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2014-04-06 23:12:01", "subcategory": "Westmoreland", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2014-04-06 23:12:01", "modified_time": "2014-04-06 23:12:01.312", "tag": "award, center, early, fred, learning", "subsection": "Westmoreland", "title": "Yo-Yo Ma to receive first Fred Rogers Legacy Award", "author": "Stacey Federoff"}, "docauthor": "Stacey Federoff", "sailthru.description": "In a 1985 episode of ''Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' Yo-Yo Ma, the world-renowned cellist, performs two Bach movements before the show's host tells his audience; ''Do ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcaf\"", "article_summary": "Yo-Yo Ma to receive first Fred Rogers Legacy AwardIn a 1985 episode of \u201cMister Rogers' Neighborhood,\u201d Yo-Yo Ma, the world-renowned cellist, performs two Bach movements before the show's host tells his audience; \u201cDo you know what a present that is?\nJoanne Rogers, wife of the late Fred Rogers, acted as honorary chairwoman for the center's advisory council in giving the award to Ma.\n\u201cWe really wanted to focus on elements of service that pay forward Fred Rogers' legacy,\u201d said Karen Strubel Myers, director of development at the center.\nWhen you play something for somebody, it's just like giving them a present.\u201dMa will be the first recipient of a Fred Rogers Legacy Award, developed by the Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children's Media at St. Vincent College in Unity.\n\u201cWe're thrilled the connection between him and Fred Rogers continues."}
