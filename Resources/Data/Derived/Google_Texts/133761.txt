Donald Trump made an impromptu stop at a caucus site in Las Vegas where Glenn Beck was appearing on behalf of his candidate, Sen. Ted Cruz. Trump entered the site at the exact moment Beck was Cruz. As soon as the word dropped caucus-goers mobbed the door to see the candidate make his entrance.



"This is an honor," Trump said as he addressed the raucous crowd. "Thank you for being with me tonight. We are going to have hopefully a historic night. In New Hampshire it was an amazing win. As you know, South Carolina. Unbelievable. Hopefully this will be the same. I appreciate everybody being here. I wanted to be here myself."



"Our borders are going to be strong. We're going to get rid of Obamacare. We're getting rid of Common Core. We're going to take care of our veterans, our military... we're going to make it big and strong. We're going to be respected again," Trump stumped.



"Get over there and vote!" Trump instructed the crowd.

How laughably fitting, as Trump overshadows Glenn Beck to show in a nut shell how he has hijacked the nutty party. pic.twitter.com/4f64Twa1Xh — Andrew Jerell Jones (@sluggahjells) February 24, 2016
