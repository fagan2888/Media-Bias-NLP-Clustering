In his latest visit to Tulsa Sunday, Senator Ted Cruz said Oklahoma is crucial in this year's primary.

"Oklahoma is a critical battleground making that choice for the Republican Party and for the nation and I am thrilled to be back here with so many strong principled conservatives in the great state of Oklahoma," said Cruz.

Hundreds of Tulsans came out to see the senator from Texas.

During his speech, Cruz listed three key items he plans to address if elected President.

These include jobs, freedom and security.

"We need a President whose loyalty is to the constitution, to the Bill of Rights and to the men and women of this country," he said.

"Not to the Washington dealmakers."

He also named many items on his Presidential "to-do" list that he has addressed several times throughout his campaign.

These include repealing Obamacare, passing a simple flat tax and abolishing the IRS.

"Let me tell the people of Oklahoma right now that I have no intention of compromising your religious liberty rights away," said Cruz.

"I have no intention of compromising your second amendment right to keep and bear arms. Core principals are not up for Washington deal making negotiation."

Cruz also visited Oklahoma City and Lawton Sunday.

He will continue his tour in Texas Monday.
