The maximum election amount for FSAs in 2015 is $2,550, up $50 from 2014.\n\nFSA Annual Contribution Limits\n\nStarting in 2013, the Affordable Care Act introduced new annual contribution limits for health FSAs. The maximum annual contribution limit for FSAs will increase to $2,550 for 2015, up $50 from 2014. This is the first time the annual FSA contribution limit has been increased since 2013, when the annual limit was introduced by the health reform law.\n\nHealth FSA Annual Contribution Limits 2013 $2,500 2014 $2,500 2015 $2,550\n\nOther Changes to FSAs\n\nIn addition to new contribution limits, FSAs have new \"use it or lose it\" rules. As of 2014, employers can allow up to $500 in unused health FSA balances to rollover to the next year.\n\nSee related: HRAs, HSAs and FSAs - Changes Under Health Reform\n\nAbout FSAs\n\nFSAs are sponsored by employers, and are (usually) 100% employee funded.

In a recent survey of large employers conducted by Mercer, 86% offered health FSAs, but only 23% of employees participated. The average employee contribution was $1,484 last year and the percentage of overall dollars forfeited was 4%.\n\nSource: IRS", "article_metadata": {"description": "2015 FSA annual contribution limits have been announced.
