He is a natural choice to handle this lawsuit,\u201d said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker Boehner.\n\nWhile acknowledging his support for universal healthcare coverage and decision to vote for Obama in 2008, Turley says the House\u2019s lawsuit \u201chas more to do with constitutional law than health care law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout judicial review of unconstitutional actions by the Executive, the trend toward a dominant presidential model of government will continue in this country in direct conflict with the original design and guarantees of our Constitution,\u201d Turley wrote, adding that \u201cour constitutional system as a whole would benefit greatly by courts reinforcing the lines of separation between the respective branches.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Turley sued the president for violating the War Powers Act by failing to obtain congressional authorization before sending U.S. troops into Libya, but a federal judge eventually dismissed the suit.\n\nThis time around, however, Turley plans to move ahead with full force.\n\nHouse Republicans filed their lawsuit Friday, less than 24 hours after President Obama delivered his plan for executive action on immigration. The lawsuit was filed against Health and Human Services Secretary Sylva Burwell for deferring Obamacare's employee mandate. The Treasury Department secretary is also named in the suit.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, \u201cthe suit also challenges what it says is President Obama\u2019s unlawful giveaway of roughly $175 billion to insurance companies under the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to litigate this matter as far as necessary,\u201d Turley wrote.\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @gabriellahope_", "article_metadata": {"category": "News Hall", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6093/GWU.jpg", "description": "George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley accepted a position Monday that is sure to land his name in the textbooks of future law students.", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley accepted a position Monday that is sure to land his name in the textbooks of future law students.", "title": "George Washington University prof. becomes lead attorney in GOP\u2019s lawsuit against Obama", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6093", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6093/GWU.jpg", "height": 600}, "author": "Gabriella Morrongiello", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6093/GWU.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",George Washington University, GWU, Turley, Obamacare, HHS, House Republicans, John Boehner, Jonathan Turley, law professor, GWU Turley, Gabriella Morrongiello", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "published_time": "2014-11-25 17:40:52.0", "description": "George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley accepted a position Monday that is sure to land his name in the textbooks of future law students.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "section": "News Hall", "modified_time": "2014-11-25 17:41:13.0"}, "twitter": {"description": "George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley accepted a position Monday that is sure to land his name in the textbooks of future law students.", "title": "George Washington University prof. becomes lead attorney in GOP\u2019s lawsuit against Obama", "image": {"src": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6093/GWU.jpg"}, "creator": "@gabriellahope_", "site": "@campusreform", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb694\"", "article_summary": "House Republicans filed their lawsuit Friday, less than 24 hours after President Obama delivered his plan for executive action on immigration.\nTurley is the third legal counsel hired by Speaker Boehner to represent the House; two previous attorneys terminated their contracts.\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley accepted a position last Monday that is sure to land his name in the textbooks of future law students.\n\u201cIt is an honor to represent the institution in this historic lawsuit and to work with the talented staff of the House General Counsel\u2019s Office.\"\nHe is a natural choice to handle this lawsuit,\u201d said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker Boehner."}
