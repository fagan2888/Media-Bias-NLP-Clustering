But is the past prologue?\n\nWith the deadline for voting in the SAG-AFTRA elections approaching \u2014 ballots for L.A., New York and national offices have to be received by mail Thursday morning \u2014 an outside observer would be forgiven for not understanding the fuss.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA elections matter, because the result could ultimately be a union set on a confrontation course \u2014 but will that happen?\n\nIn truth, whether the election will be \u201cunusually close,\u201d as the Los Angeles Times recently asserted, is unknown, since no one\u2019s done any polling and the newspaper offered no support for its claim. But what is clear is that the election is contentious. To understand why requires some backstory.\n\n\u201cDo loose clips sink ships? Apparently the actors think so,\u201d this reporter wrote seven years ago, in a Los Angeles Business Journal explainer that explored the Screen Actors Guild\u2019s seemingly scattershot objections to a contract proposal that the town\u2019s other unions had signed off on. As SAG\u2019s main contract slipped toward expiration in an echo of the Writers Guild strike that had ended only months earlier \u2014 and as the national economy collapsed into recession \u2014 the union threw itself into an acid bath of infighting, hurtling along on a \u201cdenigration express\u201d of name-calling and fear-mongering, filibusters and lawsuits as contract after contract simply expired, landing in what could only have been the SAG contract graveyard.\n\nAs SAG staggered, AFTRA prospered. With overlapping jurisdiction in television, and 44,000 dual cardholders \u2014 members of both unions \u2014 the rival union became the go-to choice for television producers even though its contract rates were 3.5 percent higher than SAG\u2019s, a result of AFTRA reaching agreement with the AMPTP studio alliance while SAG stalemated.\n\nThat chaos took place when the union was under the control of a faction called Membership First, but the membership itself eventually had second thoughts about MF, which had come to power in 2005. The faction narrowly lost its board majority in fall 2008 to a rival, Unite for Strength, which favored resumption of contract talks and merger with AFTRA, but despite the loss MF was effectively in control for many more months. UFS wrested control in 2009, installing David White in January as national executive director (the top paid staff position), fighting off a lawsuit from the guild\u2019s own MF-aligned president, signing a new-media deal with the studios after a yearlong stalemate and achieving the election of Ken Howard as president in the fall.\n\nBy 2012, UFS had led SAG to merger with AFTRA, which the SAG membership approved by an overwhelming vote, 82 to 18 percent. The AFTRA approval rate was even higher, 86 to 14 percent, and even in Los Angeles, merger was approved by 78 to 22 percent, a rout for the L.A.-based Membership First. \u201cMessage f\u2014kin\u2019 delivered,\u201d said one former AFTRA leader at the time.\n\nBut what might have appeared to be a done deal in 2012 has reemerged as unfinished business as SAG-AFTRA holds its 2015 elections. After weak performance in the last several rounds, MF is back in force, with a nearly complete slate of national board candidates in Los Angeles (18 MF aspirants for 19 seats; UFS is running a complete slate) and a full set of grievances.\n\nThe MF ticket is topped by Home Improvement\u2019s Patricia Richardson, facing off against UFS\u2019 Howard, who has been president since his first election in 2009 and who\u2019s also known as \"The White Shadow\" after his starring role in a TV show of the same name. Noting those TV credits isn\u2019t merely editorial adornment: the SAG-AFTRA election is in part a popularity contest, with fame, credits and good looks as the currency. Both MF and UFS tout their endorsements.\n\nReal issues are in play though, and among the ones churning up controversy are the following:\n\n* Merger. Some MF stalwarts mourn the \u201cdeath\u201d of SAG, and many ridicule UFS\u2019 belief that merging the two unions strengthened them. Said MF leader David Jolliffe in his campaign statement, \u201cWe\u2019ve been merged for over 3 years.\u2026 Where\u2019s all this new extra power? It\u2019s all been one huge disappointment.\u201d\n\nSome speculate that MF would even like to unwind merger, by expelling broadcasters and sound recording artists into their own union \u2014 an AFTRA-lite without non-news television jurisdiction \u2014 and keeping only performers in SAG-AFTRA, which would likely be renamed SAG once again. But for now that dream \u2014 that the once and future guild will rise Phoenix-like from the ashes, forged in fire to a supreme strength and luster \u2014 is an agenda item that goes unspoken (if it is one at all), because to regain control of the union MF needs to cultivate the support of discontented former AFTRA-ites in regions outside of Los Angeles and New York.\n\n* Closed Offices. In that vein, MF has focused on what some of those hinterland SAG-AFTRA members are most angered at, which is the union\u2019s decision in 2013 to close 10 of its 25 regional offices. The union defended the move as a necessary cost-saving measure.\n\n* Residuals. Virtually every above-the-line strike in the 80-year history of the guilds has been about residuals, and the fear that residuals are evaporating remains a potent theme. \u201cI've watched the erosion of residuals, the give aways by our negotiators, the buy outs, the new mediums that we haven't gotten our fair share of,\u201d said Richardson in her statement.\n\nBut whether Richardson\u2019s assertions are true is hard to judge. SAG-AFTRA says residuals have grown in aggregate to about $1 billion per year, but the union doesn\u2019t release breakdowns or exact figures. The WGA West does, however, and given the similarities in certain residuals formulas across guilds and the fact that virtually all scripted movies and television programs are shot with union actors, the WGAW figures are illustrative: From 2008 to 2014, theatrical residuals in the WGA were essentially unchanged, while television residuals grew by more than 60 percent, according to the guild\u2019s 2015 and 2014 annual reports. The SAG-AFTRA growth rates are likely to be similar.\n\nNotably, in the WGA, network primetime residuals were down about 5 percent, but new media residuals grew by over 1,000 percent, and actually exceeded network primetime residuals for the first time in 2014.\n\nUFS also adds that it has sped up residuals processing time and achieved residuals for high-budget new media programs. Those high budget SVOD residuals are probably more attributable to the DGA, however, since its negotiations happened first in the 2014 cycle and set the pattern for the other unions.\n\n* Pension and Health. Another flash point for MF remains the union-affiliated pension and health plans, which continue to exist as two separate organizations, one formerly affiliated with SAG, the other with AFTRA, and both controlled by boards of trustees that are equally divided between management and labor. The split SAG/AFTRA structure makes it harder for members to qualify for health insurance or pensions, since their earnings \u2014 which must meet certain thresholds to qualify for the SAG- or AFTRA-affiliated benefits \u2014 are still generally counted in two separate silos, corresponding to the two legacy unions.\n\nThere has been movement: As of 2014, earnings can sometimes be aggregated under the rubric of \u201creciprocity\u201d or \u201ccombined earnings eligibility\u201d for purposes of health insurance qualification, and last month, union national executive director David White said that there had been \u201csignificant progress\u201d toward merging the health plans. MF partisans scoff at that statement and assert that it\u2019s simply election-time propaganda.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that combining the health plans has been a slow process. Whether the fault lies with the management trustees or the labor side is impossible to tell, and some of the delay was probably due to the need to concurrently deal with the introduction of Obamacare. But as slow as the health plan merger has been, the task of combining or otherwise restructuring the pension plans is expected to be even more difficult, given their greater fiscal complexity. Members are understandably frustrated.\n\n* Contracts. MF contends that UFS has negotiated bad deals, while UFS counters that it hasn\u2019t. But who\u2019s to say? A negotiation is not a shopping spree; you don\u2019t get everything you want, and everyone inevitably goes home muttering what-if\u2019s. With labor generally weaker than it was 40 years ago, and with television viewership patterns fracturing (and hence disrupting residuals), judging a Hollywood labor contract as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d is something of a fool\u2019s errand.\n\nIn addition, because so much of the key areas of the contract are driven by the practice of pattern bargaining, and because the DGA usually goes first and sets the pattern for such areas as wage increases and residuals, it\u2019s hard for any SAG-AFTRA leadership to achieve something different, as MF discovered when it derailed negotiations in 2008 without a viable backup plan. In any case, though, the guilds work together behind the scenes, and each sends observers to the others\u2019 negotiations, so credit (or blame) in fairness should probably be shared.\n\nAs evidence that the 2014 studio deal was a bad one for the union, MF cites a studio labor vp\u2019s email to her boss, asserting that \u201cSony fared very well in these negotiations,\u201d but that Wikileaked missive is rather thin gruel: would anyone have expected the vp to say in an email, \u201cI did a poor job and got Sony a bad deal?\" It\u2019s ironic, too, that MF castigates its opponents for being too soft on Management, then cites a Management email as evidence of this.\n\nAlso noteworthy: MF omits mention of an email in which an AMPTP publicist said, \u201cThe good news is that our offer is consistent with the other two [DGA and WGA] deals, both of which were overwhelmingly ratified because they contained significant gains (increases in wages, benefit contributions, Internet streaming residuals and more). We have also worked hard to help SAG-AFTRA achieve its top priority of merging the separate television contracts.\u201d\n\n* TV Rates. Merging those contracts came with a price, MF complains: new TV shows will be paid at the lower SAG rates, rather than the slightly higher AFTRA rates. But what goes unmentioned is that the reason SAG rates are lower is that SAG stalemated its contract negotiations for months while under MF control back in 2008. And was there any chance that the AMPTP would reward the union for the stalemated 2008 talks by increasing contract rates? Not really.\n\n* Background Actors. When SAG absorbed the jurisdiction of the Screen Extras Guild in 1992, the union created an interest group that numbers in the tens of thousands (exactly how many is unknown, as SAG-AFTRA doesn\u2019t release figures). Appealing to those members has always been part of MF\u2019s strategy, and the dynamic is naturally one of discontent. That\u2019s because most extras, or more formally \u201cbackground actors,\u201d are herded like cattle, paid like paupers and denied the artistic and career success that principal performers come somewhat closer to attaining. Unsatisfied and by their lights underpaid, background actors are SAG-AFTRA\u2019s angry working class. But in a world where crowds of extras are often replaced by computer-generated imagery, it seems unlikely that anyone\u2019s promises to background performers will stop the erosion of their work.\n\n* Boardroom Dynamics. MF also argues that the SAG-AFTRA boardroom engages in groupthink and party-line politics \u2014 which were some of the same criticisms leveled at MF, of course. It\u2019s hard to know without actually attending board and committee meetings \u2014 but it is true that SAG-AFTRA has not generally been any more fiscally transparent under UFS than it was under MF.\n\nBookmark The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Labor Page for the most in-depth coverage of entertainment unions and guilds.\n\nEmail: jh@jhandel.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jonathan Handel", "description": "A host of grievances is powering a challenge to one faction\u2019s six-year leadership of the union.
