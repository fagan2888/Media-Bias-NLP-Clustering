Yet it not only insists on forcing them to participate in the delivery, it argues that their beliefs against participating are wrong and that government officials and judges can tell the Little Sisters what Catholic theology really requires,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s dangerous \u2013 especially when those same government officials have disrespectfully compared the Sisters\u2019 beliefs to \u2018fighting an invisible dragon\u2019 that can be vanquished with the \u2018stroke of the [Sisters\u2019] own pen.'\u201d\n\nVerrilli contended that the Supreme Court does need to review the case, since there is a conflict among the circuit courts of appeal regarding the resolution.\n\nBut he remained adamant that the government must be able to decide for people of faith when their religion is burdened by governmental actions.\n\n\u201cWhether a regulation imposes a substantial burden cognizable under RFRA is a question of law that must be resolved by the court, not a question of fact controlled by the challenger\u2019s sincere religious beliefs,\u201d his brief says.\n\nVerrilli\u2019s claim conflicts with the opinion of several appeals court judges who felt so strongly that they tried to revive the arguments over the case themselves.\n\nAt the 10th Circuit, for example, Judge Bobby Baldock said Obamacare\u2019s \u201caccommodation scheme \u2026 forces the self-insured plaintiffs to perform an act that causes their beneficiaries to receive religiously objected-to coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fines the government uses to compel this act thus impose a substantial burden on the self-insured plaintiffs\u2019 religion exercise. \u2026 Moreover, less restrictive means exist to achieve the government\u2019s contraceptive coverage goals here,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBaldock said the government \u201chas left self-insured plaintiffs in a position where they must decide whether their beneficiaries will actually receive objected-to contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe accommodation does not absolve these plaintiffs of this responsibility. Instead, it forces them to either (1) violate their sincere religious beliefs by performing an action that will cause their beneficiaries to receive objected-to coverage, or (2) violate the law. \u2026 This is a Hobson\u2019s choice and thus a substantial burden on their religious exercise.\u201d\n\nVerrilli, however, told the court that the justices should leave the Little Sisters case as it is and instead review one of the other cases that raises similar questions.\n\nRienzi said, after the government submitted its brief suggesting the Supreme Court review Obamacare again: \u201cWhat is the federal government afraid of? The government continues to insist that the Little Sisters help with its contraceptive delivery system, but doesn\u2019t want to let them present their side at the Supreme Court. Just a few days ago the president told the pope he would \u2018stand with\u2019 the pope \u2018in defense of religious freedom.\u2019 Forcing nuns to violate their faith for no good reason is a very strange way to do that.\u201d\n\nHe noted that so far, 18 federal appellate judges have blasted the Obamacare mandate.\n\n\u201cThis growing tide has recognized the mandate scheme as \u2018clearly and gravely wrong\u2019 because \u2018it is not the job of the judiciary to tell people what their religious beliefs are,'\u201d the Becket Fund said in a statement.\n\nWND reported when a federal appeals court in Denver temporarily suspended its demand that the nuns of the Denver-based Little Sisters of the Poor violate their faith by distributing contraceptives and abortion-causing drugs under Obamacare.\n\nBy a 2-1 vote July 14, the 10th U.S. Circuit ruled the Obama administration can force the nuns to provide their employees with the drugs.\n\nAlso involved in the case are Christian Brothers Employee Benefit Trust, Christian Brothers Services, Reaching Souls International, Truett-McConnell College and GuideStone Financial Resources.\n\nEarlier, the Supreme Court rewrote Obamacare to make the financial burdens \u201ctaxes\u201d instead of \u201cpenalties,\u201d so that it would be constitutional.\n\nIn a second trip to the Supreme Court, the justices ruled that Obamacare subsidies can be given to customers that sign up through the federal exchange as well as state exchanges, even though the law clearly states they are available only through state exchanges.\n\nHere\u2019s the help you\u2019ll need to prepare your household for the realities of living under a centralized health-care system \u2014 order Dr. Lee Hieb\u2019s \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The federal government has conceded that the U.S. Supreme Court needs to review the Obamacare law adopted exclusively by majority Democrats, but Obama administration officials still argue that judges must have the authority to decide whether or not a group\u2019s or individual\u2019s exercise of religion is burdened by the law.
