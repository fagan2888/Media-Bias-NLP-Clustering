The prohibition was later extended to Medicaid, and a number of exceptions have been added for legitimate business arrangements.\n\nIn 2006, as part of rules for the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, CMS first created the exemption for hospitals to help physician practices acquire EHR systems. After originally planning for the exemption to be phased out in 2013, in April 2013 CMS and OIG proposed sunsetting the policy in 2016.\n\nThe American Hospital Association, HIMSS and others encouraged the agencies to make the EHR exceptions permanent.\n\n\"HIMSS is pleased that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the HHS Office of the Inspector General have promulgated extensions to the Stark exemptions and anti-kickback safe harbors for electronic health records through 2021,\" said Thomas A. Leary, HIMSS vice president, government relations, said in a statement. \"We also appreciate the government's decision to use a deeming process for certification \"to ensure coordination between this program and the existing ONC Certification Program.\"\n\n\"To ensure the continued advancement of meaningful use of certified EHR technology and allow for better care coordination and information sharing among clinical providers, treatment facilities and patients, HIMSS has historically supported making permanent and expanding the Stark exemptions and anti-kickback safe harbors beyond software and services used predominantly for EHRs,\" Leary added. \"They should include software and services used for care coordination, quality of measurement, improving population health, or improving the quality or efficiency of health care delivery among parties. Although we encourage the elimination of the sunset provision, we appreciate the extension of the program to 2021 to provide certainty to stakeholders.\"\n\nAlthough it was \u201cimplemented to encourage the adoption of health information technology, it is now a necessity for the creation of new healthcare delivery and payment models,\u201d CMS officials said in summing up the comments in support of the extension. The new sunset of 2021 coincides with the end of the Medicaid EHR incentive program.\n\nCMS and OIG made a few other changes to the policies, including how they determine EHR systems to be interoperable as part of complying with the safe harbor protection.\n\nCurrently, to meet the \u201cdeeming provision\u201d software has to be certified within no more than 12 months prior to hospitals donating the systems to physician practices. Tracking the Office of the National Coordinator\u2019s regulatory schedule, the OIG said that now it will consider the arrangements eligible \u201cif, on the date it is provided to the recipient, it has been certified to any edition of the electronic health record certification criteria that is identified in the then-applicable definition of Certified EHR Technology.\u201d\n\nFor 2013, that would include both the 2011 and 2014 certification editions. \u201cSoftware certified to meet either the 2011 edition or the 2014 edition could satisfy the safe harbor provision,\u201d the OIG wrote. \u201cWe believe our final rule with respect to this condition is consistent with that understanding and our objective of ensuring that software is certified to the current required standard of interoperability when it is donated.\u201d\n\nWhen they proposed the rules in April, CMS and OIG were mulling another change to the Stark/Anti-kickback policy: whether to expand the definition of EHR \u201cprotected donors\u201d to clinical labs, equipment suppliers and home health agencies, or just limit it to hospitals, group practices, drug plan sponsors and Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nThe final rule ended up excluding only laboratory companies, in a hard-fought win for the American Clinical Laboratory Association and the College of American Pathologists, which argued that the \u201cprotected donor\u201d arrangement left labs and pathologists with unnecessary burdens.\n\nFor pathology labs, \u201cthe volume of requests for donations from providers of laboratory and pathology services has escalated, as have the increasingly unsavory tactics employed,\u201d the College of American Pathologists\u2019 regulatory workgroup lead Gerald Hanson, MD, wrote to CMS earlier this year.\n\nCAP members also had concerns about \u201cfunctional lock-ins embedded in the donated EHR preventing full interoperability and access,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cUnfortunately, technical interoperability has not proven to be an adequate safeguard against the donation of software that operates to lock-in referral sources.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, CMS leaders wrote that the decision is \u201cconsistent with and furthers our continued goal of promoting the adoption of interoperable electronic health records technology\u201d while \u201creducing the likelihood that the exception will be misused by donors to secure referrals.\u201d\n\nThe agency argued that the lab exclusion \u201cwill address situations identified by some of the commenters involving physician recipients conditioning referrals for laboratory services on the receipt of, or redirecting referrals for laboratory services following, donations from laboratory companies.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/hhs-extends-stark-law-hospital-exemption", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the HHS Inspector General finalized the Stark law exemption on Friday, which allows hospitals to fund up to 85 percent of EHR costs for physicians.", "title": "HHS extends Stark law hospital exemption"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the HHS Inspector General finalized the Stark law exemption on Friday, which allows hospitals to fund up to 85 percent of EHR costs for physicians.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "HHS extends Stark law hospital exemption"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services and the HHS Inspector General finalized the Stark law exemption on Friday, which allows hospitals to fund up to 85 percent of EHR costs for physicians, and the OIG outlined the related anti-kickback \u201csafe harbor\u201d for \u201cprotected donors.\u201d&#13; The eight-year-old EHR exemption to the physician self-referral and anti-kickback laws have been extended to 2021.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cSoftware certified to meet either the 2011 edition or the 2014 edition could satisfy the safe harbor provision,\u201d the OIG wrote.\nAfter originally planning for the exemption to be phased out in 2013, in April 2013 CMS and OIG proposed sunsetting the policy in 2016.\nIn 2006, as part of rules for the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, CMS first created the exemption for hospitals to help physician practices acquire EHR systems.\nThe American Hospital Association, HIMSS and others encouraged the agencies to make the EHR exceptions permanent.\nThe Stark and anti-kickback laws date back to 1989, when Congress banned self-referrals in Medicare."}
