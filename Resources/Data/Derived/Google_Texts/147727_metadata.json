I am tired of the cover ups,\u201d Fryer wrote.\n\nThe report also accuses Tavenner of deleting her emails in violation of the federal record-keeping rules.\n\nIn an Oct. 5, 2013 email \u2013 just a few days after the botched Healthcare.gov rollout, Tavenner forwarded a complaint from White House advisor Jeanne Lambrew about call center workers giving callers incorrect information and wrote, \u201cPlease delete this email \u2013but please see if we can work on call script [redacted].\u201d\n\nThe Government Accountability Office released a report about security problems with Healthcare.gov, which shows another problem, said House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darnell Issa (R-Calif.).\n\n\u201cEven today, the non-partisan Government Accountability Office informs Congress that CMS refuses to provide reports on 13 Healthcare.gov \u2018security incidents\u2019 for its audit of efforts taken by CMS to ensure the site\u2019s security,\u201d Issa said in a statement. \u201cWhat vulnerabilities to sensitive personal information is CMS still so intent on hiding from an independent government auditor? The new report offers Americans insight into how this administration secretly responded to known security vulnerabilities while plotting to keep the truth from the American people.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration sought secrecy and \u201ccovert ops\u201d in dealing with the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov last year, prompting one federal official to say, \u201cI am tired of the cover ups,\u201d according to a report by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
