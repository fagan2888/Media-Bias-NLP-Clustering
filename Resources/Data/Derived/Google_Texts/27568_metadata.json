Jeb Bush made Ocala a campaign stop Monday as part of a trek through the state. About 500 people came to see the brother and son of two former presidents at Cypress Hall in the On Top of the World retirement community.\n\nDuring an hour-long town hall meeting, Bush never mentioned GOP front runner Donald Trump by name; instead, he focused on how he would improve the federal government. He distanced himself from Trump, referencing the real estate developer\u2019s penchant for name calling.\n\n\u201cMy campaign is about pushing people up instead of pushing them down,\u201d Bush said to a cheering crowd.\n\nHe said he understood people were angry, but that divisiveness was not the answer.\n\nHe said his policy toward ISIS was one of destroying them rather than containment, citing President Obama\u2019s failure fighting ISIS. Bush said he would arm the Kurds and embed US troops with the Iraqi military \u201cto give them a spine.\u201d\n\n\u201cDestroying ISIS is a serious issue which requires a serious leader,\u201d Bush said.\n\nHe said he would create a no-fly zone in Syria.\n\nAs for Russian President Vladimir Putin, Bush called him a \u201cbully,\u201d saying, \u201che should be more afraid of us then we are of him.\u201d\n\nPutin would better respond to a president who\u2019s \u201cconsistent,\u201d not a \u201cblowhard,\u201d Bush said, referencing Trump.\n\nBush said another focus would be the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, citing the scandal in which many veterans died while waiting for medical care.\n\nHe said that if elected, he would make it easier to fire federal career civil servants who were not doing their jobs.\n\nOne question from the audience centered on the Affordable Care Act, to which he said that he would work to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a non-mandatory state exchange. He said people should be offered healthcare plans that focused on covering catastrophic illnesses. The plans would have low premiums but high deductibles.\n\nAnother question from the audience was about Social Security and ensuring it would remain funded in the future.\n\nBush said that at the current rate, Social Security reimbursements would likely have to be reduced 25 percent to 30 percent.\n\nTo keep that from happening, Bush said, he would work to extend retirement age beginning in 2023 by one month each year.\n\nBy pushing retirement back, he would be able to raise reimbursements to a minimum of 125 percent of poverty levels. In addition, he would lower reimbursements to the wealthiest Americans. And if someone is of retirement age and still working, they should not have to contribute financially to Social Security any longer, he said.\n\nMany of those attending the town hall meeting said before the event they were hesitant to support the former Florida governor, saying they came to the meeting to gather information and they were still undecided as to whom they would support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just interested. I\u2019ve never been to a rally,\u201d retired U.S. Army Maj. Lynn Grosvenor said before the event. \u201cI think he has trouble connecting with the public. We need someone who projects tough leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are fed up with the status quo. They\u2019re mad. They don\u2019t trust government. The middle class is not doing well. And Jeb Bush represents another Bush and more status quo,\u201d she said.\n\nBut after the rally, Grosvenor said she was sold on Bush.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s on the (Republican ticket) I would vote for him,\u201d she said, \u201cWhen you see him in person he\u2019s very passionate. He\u2019s very steady. He has answers. He has solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talking about issues instead of himself,\" she said, referencing Trump.\n\nDottie Taylor, 77, said before the rally that she wasn\u2019t convinced by Bush, but adamant she would not vote for Trump.\n\nTaylor, who owned a real estate business before retiring, said before the rally that \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to vote for him. I have to see what he says.\"\n\nAfter the rally, Taylor said, \u201cNobody has my vote yet. But he\u2019s a good speaker and gave good answers.\u201d\n\nBush has struggled since first announcing his candidacy in June as the Republican presumptive frontrunner and wielding the largest financial war chest of any candidate. He and his super Political Action Committee have blown through half of the $133 million that they raised through the first three quarters of this year, according to a Washington Times article. About $37 million of that has gone to campaign ads.\n\nWhen he announced his candidacy he began at 15 percent in the polls and dropped to about 4 percent in the most recent surveys.\n\nWalter Childress, 73, an On Top of the World resident, said that despite spending Bush\u2019s campaign spending, \u201cpeople want someone from the outside. I know he was a good governor but he isn\u2019t resonating with people. People are looking for something new.\u201d\n\nHis wife, Nancy, 74, said that like most politicians she doesn\u2019t trust, she doesn\u2019t trust Bush.\n\n\u201cToo many Republicans get into office and didn\u2019t do what they said they were going to do,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked by a Star-Banner reporter why his poll numbers appear stuck in the single digits, an agitated Bush said \u201cthey\u2019re going to go up.\u201d\n\nHe told the reporter that as the election nears, voters will turn away from \u201cfear mongering\u201d and find his message to be the right one.\n\nAsked whether Trump supporters would come his way rather than to conservative Republican candidate Ted Cruz, if Trump\u2019s campaign falters, Bush replied that he had faith in the voters.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "jeb bush,marion county,presidential campaign,presidential candidate,marion_county,ocala,news,editors_pick", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Commercial", "description": "Presidential candidate and former Florida Gov.
