Beginning Friday and running through Jan. 11, the city of Longmont is providing four drop-off locations for the recycling of Christmas trees.

Those locations are: Roosevelt Park's parking lot south of Eighth Avenue; Garden Acres Park on the west side of the parking lot off 18th Avenue; Kanemoto Park's parking lot off South Pratt Parkway; and Centennial Park's east parking lot off Alpine Street.

People are asked to remove all decorations and lights from the trees before dropping them off.

Longmont residents also can recycle their trees at the Waste Diversion Center, 140 Martin St., between 7:30 a.m. and 4:45 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
