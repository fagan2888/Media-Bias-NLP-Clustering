Lots and lots of lawyers.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve gotten an appointment to the University of Kentucky or University of Louisville board of trustees from Daddy Beshear, there\u2019s a pretty darn good chance that you\u2019ve written a check to the son. My colleague, Tom Loftus, reported that 22 of 31 Steve Beshear appointments to the two boards gave to Andy Beshear this summer.\n\nBeshear has amassed a war chest of $2.7 million using a very structured campaign to go out and hit up friends of his father and people who do business with the state. In the process, he\u2019s piled up more money than anyone has ever piled up in Kentucky for a down-ticket race.\n\nIt has allowed him to go on television early and run ads, touting his family values and his family ties \u2013 which frankly make him much more of a political player than he would be if his name was Andy Smith.\n\nAn outside group calling itself the Bluegrass Alliance for Consumer Rights went up on the air with a $630,000 ad attacking Beshear\u2019s Republican opponent. It gets its money from the Bluegrass Democratic Attorneys General Association, which gets its money from the Democratic Attorneys General Association.\n\nThe Democratic Attorneys General Association gets the vast majority of its money from corporations, according to its most recent filing with the Internal Revenue Service. Its biggest donors this year, contributing $50,000 each, are Monsanto, Visa, Anthem and Pfizer; and eBay, which has given $60,000.\n\nIf you are a pessimist, you\u2019d believe that raising the money that Beshear has raised opens the door for corruption, since many of the people donating to his campaign are still dependent on his father for government contracts and appointments, and many others could have cases involving the attorney general once Andy Beshear is swept into office.\n\nIf you\u2019re an optimist, you might say that if Beshear works half as hard as attorney general as he has raising money, then he could be the best ever.\n\nBut hold on there. A win for Beshear is anything but a certainty. The son doesn\u2019t always also rise.\n\nNew school is Republican State Sen. Whitney Westerfield, who has raised a paltry $151,000.\n\nDon\u2019t cry for him for too long.\n\nSee, instead of going out and asking people for $1,000 checks, the limit one can give to a state campaign in Kentucky, Westerfield is allowing a super PAC to almost completely fund his race.\n\nAccording to fundraising reports filed this week, The Republican Attorneys General Association has sent $2.2 million to the Kentucky Republican Attorneys General Association to help him. The national group gets is funding largely from conservative groups, corporations and wealthy business people.\n\nMost of that money has been spent trying to convince Andy Beshear and Barack Obama are the same person.\n\nAccording to reports filed with the IRS, the national organization\u2019s biggest contributors include the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which has contributed nearly $2.9 million; The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has given more than $2.5 million; and Las Vegas casino operator Sheldon Adelson, who has given $1 million.\n\nNeither the U.S. Chamber of Commerce nor the Judicial Crisis Network disclose the names of their donors. But according to the website opensecrets.org, one group that has contributed to the Justice Crisis Network is a mysterious dark money group called the Wellspring Committee, which has raised more than $24 million in recent years and given money to conservative political causes.\n\nThe Wellspring Committee doesn\u2019t disclose its contributors, either.\n\nMoney, no matter where it comes from, can be a corrupting influence.Democrats believe that the Republican Attorneys General Association is prepared to sink up to $5 million into television ads and mailers in an effort to beat Beshear.\n\nBoth old-style fundraising and new-style fundraising can lead to political corruption. The question becomes, do you prefer the devil you know, or the devil you don\u2019t?\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
