LONDON (AP) — Fashionistas struggled to stay dry and composed Sunday as driving wind and rain hit London Fashion Week, but the miserable weather wasn’t the only thing that caused some to lose their cool.

Reality TV star and model Kendall Jenner whipped up a mini storm as she arrived for Topshop Unique’s show, trailing dozens of paparazzi and fans desperate for a glimpse of her. Elsewhere, designers including Vivienne Westwood, Pringle of Scotland and Jonathan Saunders showcased their latest designs.

Some highlights from Day 3:

PUNK AND POLITICS AT VIVIENNE WESTWOOD

Vivienne Westwood displayed mannish tweed coats, beautifully tailored jackets and draped dresses, her signature tartan and lots of animal prints. But that’s not what she wanted to talk about.

The grand dame of British fashion has one message for her guests, and it’s written loud and clear on her show invitation: Vote Green.

The flame-haired designer, 73, has a reputation for using her fashion shows to promote causes dear to her heart, from campaigning for Wikileaks’ Julian Assange to protesting against fracking (a controversial method of extracting natural gas.)

Moments before her show opened Sunday, Westwood railed backstage about capitalism and inequality. She told The Associated Press that mainstream British politics was a shambles, and the only party worth voting for, come election day in May, was the small, left-wing Green Party.

On the runway, the attitude was just as feisty: Westwood had her models don spiky hairdos, and some wore huge chokers with silver chains and harnesses.

Front row guests included actresses Noomi Rapace and Gwendoline Christie, of “Game of Thrones” fame.
