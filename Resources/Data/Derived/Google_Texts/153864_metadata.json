A new Health Affairs Web First study provides results from the round of the survey that was fielded in the summer of 2013. The survey found that more than 60 percent of the target market for the health insurance exchanges indicated that they did not understand key concepts related to health insurance.\n\nAmong the population targeted by the exchanges, only 39.9 percent of respondents understood all nine key concepts: premiums, deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, maximum annual out-of-pocket spending limits, provider networks, covered services, annual limits on services, and noncovered or excluded services. Only 23.6 percent of uninsured respondents, and less than a third of those ages 18\u201330, were confident that they understood these concepts. The HRMS results are based on a nationally representative, probability-based Internet panel that is fielded each quarter.\n\nAnother important finding: respondents reported their primary source of health insurance information was interpersonal\u2014friends, coworkers, and family members. These sources could share the target population\u2019s confusion about key insurance concepts. Although knowledge gaps appeared across many different types of individuals, confidence in understanding these concepts was lower among young adults, Spanish speakers, the uninsured, and people who had lower levels of education.\n\nAccording to the authors, \u201cconfusion around these concepts would make it difficult for consumers to understand trade-offs between different health insurance plans and to choose the plans that best meet their needs.\u201d Moving forward, they suggest that \u201cassisting people as they attempt to enroll in health coverage will require targeted education efforts and staff to support those with low health insurance literacy.\u201d\n\nAuthors Sharon Long, Genevieve Kenney, Stephen Zuckerman, Dana Goin, Douglas Wissoker, Frederic Blavin, Linda Blumberg, Lisa Clemans-Cope, and John Holahan are affiliated with the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C.; Katherine Hempstead is with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, in Princeton, N.J.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/12/18/most-americans-dont-grasp-basic-health-insurance-concepts/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Most Americans Don\u2019t Grasp Basic Health Insurance Concepts"}, "description": "Most Americans Don\u2019t Grasp Basic Health Insurance Concepts | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The survey found that more than 60 percent of the target market for the health insurance exchanges indicated that they did not understand key concepts related to health insurance.\nThese sources could share the target population\u2019s confusion about key insurance concepts.\nAnother important finding: respondents reported their primary source of health insurance information was interpersonal\u2014friends, coworkers, and family members.\nOnly 23.6 percent of uninsured respondents, and less than a third of those ages 18\u201330, were confident that they understood these concepts.\nTracy GnadingerDecember 18, 2013The Urban Institute\u2019s Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS), initiated in 2013, is a valuable way to obtain early data about the American public\u2019s ability to understand health insurance concepts and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), before federal government survey data are available."}
