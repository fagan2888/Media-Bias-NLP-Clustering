Since the first of the year, new home sales have literally exploded at Terrain, the master-planned community by Starwood Land Ventures, off Founders Parkway three miles east of I-25.\n\n\u201cThis is the quieter side of Castle Rock,\u201d says Cary Garner, who with Gary Frederics will show you the grand opening of the Prelude Collection by TRI Pointe Homes at Terrain \u2013 single-family models priced from just $293,400. But there\u2019s nothing quiet about reaction to this new series, with some walkout sites available that back to Terrain\u2019s showplace Wrangler Park. Between Prelude and a larger Debut Collection that you can see nearby, TRI Pointe sold 17 at Terrain in January alone \u2013 five of them last Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, you really can be one of the first to get a preview tour of Century Communities\u2019 two new models \u2013 still a month from a grand opening, but at pre-model pricing from as low as $324,950. And Century can show you some of the best home sites Terrain has released, including walkouts that back to part of the hundreds of acres of open space. Both Century and TRI Pointe have a few homes that are on track to deliver soon, including a Residence 4015 by Century, with three bedrooms, 2\u00bd bath, around 2,302 square feet, priced at $375,165; and a Residence 2 by TRI Pointe, 3-bedroom, 2\u00bd bath, at $353,449.\n\nWith Terrain\u2019s amenities (it won the Home Builders\u2019 Association\u2019s Community of the Year for the entire Denver-Boulder area last year) builders are moving quickly through their sites here. That leaves only three chances to buy from Lennar Homes \u2013 including a 3-bedroom design a party-sized covered deck, scheduled for March delivery at $424,900; or you can opt for Lennar\u2019s Woodbridge ranch-style designer model home, including a \u2018NextGen\u2019 separate living suite, being sold with its landscaping and decorator touches, at $474,900.\n\nAll of these are close to Terrain\u2019s Sage Canyon Elementary School, set beside Wrangler Park, close to the open space and attractive community swim club. And you can see how close the King Soopers shopping is, and how accessible Castle Rock\u2019s restaurants are.\n\n\u201cYou know about the franchise places nearby, but the secret is to go downtown,\u201d TRI Pointe\u2019s Garner tells his buyers, pointing up the one-of-a-kind dining to be had in Castle Rock\u2019s historic downtown. The town south of Denver Tech Center, he notes, is ranked by Money Magazine as the fourth \u2018Best Place to Live\u2019 in the entire nation this year.\n\nTo reach Terrain, head south on I-25 to Meadows/Founders Parkway, then east three miles to either Rising Sun or Copper Cloud Street and follow the signs to all three builders.\n\nTerrain at Castle Rock, walk-to school, parks & trails, swim club; choice selection of family-sized homes & ranches by 3 builders, some for quick delivery. Lennar Homes, 4012 Whitewing Ln; TRI Pointe Homes, 1760 Tall Tale Ln & 2091 Trail Stone Loop; Century Communities, 2509 Wild Oak Dr., Castle Rock; take I-25 south to Founders/Meadows Pkwy, east 3 mi to Rising Sun or Copper Cloud & follow signs\n\nTRI Pointe from $293,400; Lennar from low $400s; Century Communities pre-model pricing from $325s\n\nToday 11 a.m. until 5 p.m.\n\nLennar 720-608-0796, TRI Point 303-802-1540 or 303-802-1546, Century Communities 303-268-8371\n\nMark Samuelson writes on real estate and business; you can email him atmark@samuelsonassoc.com.
