Rather than hyping the stories of rock star entrepreneurs who never seem to struggle, we focus on the struggle.\n\nOur journalists look for issues and trends that small businesses need to understand. And our bloggers \u2013 most of whom actually own and run businesses \u2013 write about their experiences on the front lines. They share the ups and downs, what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not, the lessons learned. And along the way, they benefit from the feedback of some of the smartest small-business readers around. A sampling:\n\nPaul Downs wrote about how he found a surprisingly good health insurance plan and how he managed to save money on it. He also wrote about what happened when he introduced profit-sharing at his company. And why he decided to hire a sales consultant. And how he decides what to pay his workers. And his search for a fair and reasonable credit card processor. And how much money he took home in 2012.\n\nJay Goltz wrote about a business owner who was too quick to say she\u2019s not a numbers person. And what happened when a couple decided to pursue their lifelong dream and buy that old general store. And how Web retailers threaten local businesses.\n\nEilene Zimmerman wrote about a start-up that sells \u201csprayable caffeine,\u201d the many companies started by the alumni of MySpace, whether Silicon Beach is over-hyped, and whether small businesses understand the customer-relations software they buy.\n\nAdriana Gardella continued to track the ups and downs of the She Owns It group of business owners \u2014 including their efforts to manage sales reps and to get software vendors to complete their projects. They also discussed their tricks for getting things done, and the truth about working from home, and releasing new Web sites, and whether employees can be rehabilitated.\n\nAmi Kassar wrote about his struggle to balance the needs of his start-up and his own health. He explained how one start-up got a $1.9 million S.B.A. loan, and he assessed the deal another start-up made on \u201cShark Tank.\u201d He challenged Mark Cuban\u2019s statement that only a moron would borrow money to start a business, and he challenged alternative lenders to set some standards. He wrote about the price small businesses pay for poor bookkeeping, and he suggested a clever way to direct more capital to small businesses.\n\nRobb Mandelbaum devoted much of his year to covering the impact of the Affordable Care Act, including the many companies that found a way to avoid confronting the new law this year and the many workers who might be better off if their small-business employers do NOT offer coverage. He wrote about whether paid sick leave is as damaging as some businesses fear and what words merchants might use to confront \u201cshowroomers.\u201d He also found a business owner who says that higher taxes make him want to hire more, not fewer, employees.\n\nMelinda Emerson wrote about how social media put a tiny yarn shop on the map. And the problem social media cannot solve. And what social media can do for businesses that aren\u2019t sexy. And where a remodeling business should invest its marketing dollars.\n\nJosh Patrick analyzed a bunch of businesses that were for sale: Would you pay $170,000 for this restaurant? Or $2.5 million for this distributor of electrical components? Or $2.2 million for a long-haul trucking company? Or $6.2 million for a heating and air-conditioning business. He also explained why business owners shouldn\u2019t feel bad about selling their businesses to the highest bidder. And he wrote about the worst two weeks of his business life.\n\nCliff Oxford wrote about the differences between happy-talk cultures and high-performance cultures and why \u201cinnovate or die\u201d is a lie and why he likes to hire \u201cGreat Recession\u201d graduates and why there is no such thing as work-life balance.\n\nColleen DeBaise \u2014 and the Story Exchange \u2014 brought us the story of how an entrepreneur bet her family\u2019s house on a bilingual school she started.\n\nDeb Weidenhamer started writing about her experiences setting up a subsidiary of her auction company in China \u2014 including this post about the biggest mistake she has made there (so far).\n\nRichard Demb wrote about one start-up\u2019s struggle to market its iPhone app.\n\nAnd every day, Gene Marks scours the Web so that you don\u2019t have to \u2014 looking for links to all of the stories that have the biggest impact on small-business owners. On Monday, he selected the best of those stories from the past year.\n\nThis year, we also asked small-business owners to send us photographs that capture the soul of their businesses in a single shot for a feature we called The Small Picture. The one at the top of this post came from Michael Hanna of the Mattress Lot in Portland, Ore.: \u201cWe deliver mattresses by bike,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe started our mattress and furniture store in 2010 at the height of the recession. Yes, we deliver by truck too. But our customers in Portland, Ore. love it when we can deliver by bike.\u201d\n\nYou can see all of our Small Picture photos here. And if you can you capture your business in a single photo, please submit it here.\n\nHappy New Year from all of us at the You\u2019re the Boss team.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140101070045, "twitter": {"url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/the-best-small-business-posts-of-2013/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Another year in the trenches with the You\u2019re the Boss blogging team.", "card": "summary", "title": "The Best Small-Business Posts of 2013"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002628532, "DISPLAYDATE": "January 1, 2014", "keywords": "E-Commerce,Entrepreneurship,Executives and Management (Theory),Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Small Business,Social Media,Start-ups,Work-Life Balance,Uncategorized,_featured", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/boss/The Best Small-Business Posts of 2013 ( 20140101 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "You're the Boss Editors", "SCG": "boss", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "boss", "CLMST": "You're the Boss Editors", "byl": "You're the Boss Editors", "BN": "boss", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/boss/post", "description": "Another year in the trenches with the You\u2019re the Boss blogging team.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 1, 2014", "article": {"tag": "_featured", "published_time": 1388577645, "modified_time": "2014-01-02T01:46:57-05:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20140102014657, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140101, "pdate": 20140101, "des": "E-Commerce;Entrepreneurship;Executives and Management (Theory);Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Small Business;Social Media;Start-ups;Work-Life Balance", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "You\u2019re the Boss Blog", "description": "Another year in the trenches with the You\u2019re the Boss blogging team.", "title": "The Best Small-Business Posts of 2013", "url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/the-best-small-business-posts-of-2013/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/the-best-small-business-posts-of-2013/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Best Small-Business Posts of 2013", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0a2\"", "article_summary": "Our journalists look for issues and trends that small businesses need to understand.\nHe wrote about the price small businesses pay for poor bookkeeping, and he suggested a clever way to direct more capital to small businesses.\nAnd along the way, they benefit from the feedback of some of the smartest small-business readers around.\nAnd every day, Gene Marks scours the Web so that you don\u2019t have to \u2014 looking for links to all of the stories that have the biggest impact on small-business owners.\nHe also explained why business owners shouldn\u2019t feel bad about selling their businesses to the highest bidder."}
