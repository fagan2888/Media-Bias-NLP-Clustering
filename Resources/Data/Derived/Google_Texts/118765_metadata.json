Col. Shannon M. Hancock said in an email. \u201cThis chronic funding shortfall accelerated the near-term phase of the plan that resulted in closure and consolidation of 15 armories. A $200,000 reduction to the (fiscal year) 16 (state) budget also forced a corresponding near-term closure of six additional armories.\u201d\n\nShe said the Guard also had to pay an additional unbudgeted $192,000 in the 2015 fiscal year and $264,000 in 2016 as a result of the Affordable Care Act, resulting in the 2016 budget being $464,000 short of the \u201cabsolute minimum amount just to operate our armories.\u201d\n\nThe Guard announced the planned closures a few weeks ago, catching at least one Wiregrass legislator off guard.\n\nCoupled with the announced closure of a satellite driver\u2019s license office in Geneva , it wasn\u2019t a pleasant surprise.\n\n\u201cYou expect to be called by the governor\u2019s office or his staff and made aware of the closings that are going to be announced in your district,\u201d said State Rep. Donnie Chesteen , R-Geneva. \u201cThat\u2019s usually protocol for announcements that are going to have the impact that these guard closings and the driver\u2019s license office closings had statewide.\u201d\n\nBut what really bugs Chesteen is the lack of action following a constitutional amendment approved by voters last November.\n\nThe amendment allowed the state to borrow up to an additional $50 million for capital improvement to National Guard armories.\n\nThough it was approved last year, no movement has taken place thus far.\n\nSeeking answers, Chesteen called for recent meetings with Guard leadership and members of Gov. Robert Bentley\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cIn speaking with National Guard leadership, two things were talked about. Number one, had the bond been issued, there was a one-to-one dollar match from the federal government,\u201d Chesteen said. \u201cThe $50 million from the state turns into another $50 million, so we\u2019re looking at $100 million in funding had the bonds been issued all at once. The Guard leadership said, had that money been available, there were some units that possibly could\u2019ve been saved.\u201d\n\nHancock said the units picked for closure were chosen based on the costs of operations and maintenance, condition of the armory, and the ability to meet mission support.\n\nChesteen said the governor makes the ultimate decision on when to enact the bond issue and has yet to give a sufficient answer on why a bond was never issued.\n\n\u201cNo decisions have been made regarding this bond issue,\u201d said Bentley spokesperson Jennifer Ardis . \u201cWe are reviewing.\u201d\n\nHancock said only that the National Guard has a plan to use bond money if it becomes available.\n\nSince 1988, Alabama National Guard soldiers and armories have decreased from 21,000 and 157, respectively, to 10,500 and 83.\n\nThe Guard\u2019s master plan \u201cstrategically places armories and units in areas where we can provide rapid response services to all communities across the (state), is based upon a business model that provides the best value to our citizens, benefits from recruiting populations, and ensures the highest levels of unit readiness,\u201d according to Hancock.\n\nChesteen said he understands the functional reasons for the closures.\n\n\u201cWith what we\u2019re asking our National Guard men and women to do nowadays and with the number of deployments, if this will provide better training and provide them with a modernization of military training that they need, I guess that\u2019s the direction we need to be moving,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the closures represent more than just a loss of military presence in their towns.\n\nThe economic impact, Chesteen said, is undeniable.\n\nAbout 110 soldiers stay at the armory in a given month, the legislator said.\n\n\u201cThe local hotel here is booked full for two nights a month, and they count on that every month,\u201d Chesteen said. \u201cThink about the meals the soldiers buy at local restaurants or, in some cases, they are even catered from local restaurants. They might buy a tank of gas on their way out of town or whatever else they want to purchase. That\u2019s a loss of revenue right there that\u2019s hard to recover.\u201d\n\nHe said it\u2019s indicative of a larger trend in Alabama \u2013 small towns getting the short end of the stick.\n\n\u201cIt just seems as though small towns in rural Alabama continue to take a hit on closures,\u201d Chesteen said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s jobs, armories or driver\u2019s license divisions, it continues to be bad news for small towns. Small towns continue to get hit with closures, and it\u2019s really discouraging for the people living here.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not yet ready to throw in the towel on Geneva \u2019s armory.\n\nIf both the Hartford and Geneva armories close, it would leave Geneva County without a National Guard presence.\n\nIn his meeting with Guard leadership, he came away with the impression that a chance remains to save some of the armories with the $50 million bonds, if they are indeed executed.\n\n\u201cOne factor that could change some of these closings would be if the bonds were issued, some of the armories that are scheduled for closing possibly could be renovated and remain open,\u201d Chesteen said. \u201cThere are no guarantees, but National Guard leadership did say that could possibly happen. I was told the Hartford unit was definitely on the list, but there was a possibility, if the funds were available, that Geneva could have remained open.\u201d\n\nHancock said she couldn\u2019t comment on hypothetical situations, but the Guard would reassess the conditions if they change.\n\nAs for the next step, Chesteen said he and other Wiregrass legislators must focus on assuring that one of the planned multi-unit consolidated Guard facilities being planned is located in the Wiregrass.\n\n\u201cWe have to fight as a Wiregrass delegation to make sure the Wiregrass is represented in these multi-unit readiness centers,\u201d Chesteen said. \u201cThe two key components the Guard is looking for are population and infrastructure. If that\u2019s the case, Dothan being the hub of the Wiregrass, we need to make sure we are at the table and we are in line for one of these facilities in the Wiregrass.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Dothan Eagle", "description": "GENEVA \u2014 For more than 50 years, the Alabama National Guard Armory has been a staple of this small Wiregrass city.", "title": "Geneva, Hartford, Eufaula armories to close within two years", "url": "http://www.dothaneagle.com/news/geneva-hartford-eufaula-armories-to-close-within-two-years/article_fad37366-754b-11e5-b210-9706ca2dfb11.html", "image": {"width": 700, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dothaneagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/5a/a5adeade-7545-11e5-b55f-4f44a8392080/56230d69b8a32.image.jpg?resize=700%2C471", "height": 471}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dothaneagle", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "GENEVA \u2014 For more than 50 years, the Alabama National Guard Armory has been a staple of this small Wiregrass city.", "fb": {"app_id": 127957210797}, "keywords": "armory,donnie chesteen,news", "google-site-verification": "FxOwTsXWtkxruLdkniwmNFEqAZKSYYIapDcokfzL5E4", "news_keywords": "armory,donnie chesteen,news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd377c\"", "article_summary": "If both the Hartford and Geneva armories close, it would leave Geneva County without a National Guard presence.\nBut in the next two years, the Geneva National Guard Armory \u2014 and 18 others, including Hartford and Eufaula \u2014 will be closed as part of a statewide consolidation the Guard attributes to continued funding shortfalls.\nGENEVA \u2014 For more than 50 years, the Alabama National Guard Armory has been a staple of this small Wiregrass city.\nThe amendment allowed the state to borrow up to an additional $50 million for capital improvement to National Guard armories.\nSince 1988, Alabama National Guard soldiers and armories have decreased from 21,000 and 157, respectively, to 10,500 and 83."}
