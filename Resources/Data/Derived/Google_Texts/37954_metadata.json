Charles \u201cHondo\u201d Campbell, who died Feb. 8 at age 67, comes from the number of fellow general officers who plan to be at his memorial service today or were at his visitation Sunday. Add up their years of service and you\u2019d likely easily total several centuries of service, longer than time this nation has existed.\n\nCampbell, a California native who grew up in Shreveport and retired here, served 40 years and was the last continually serving general officer with Vietnam War combat experience. The officers honoring him, who could number a half dozen or easily more, all served 35 to 38 years, sometimes under Campbell, sometimes over him.\n\n\u201cThe Army has lost one of its best,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Joe Peterson, who served under Campbell from 2006-2010 at U.S. Army Forces Command, the service\u2019s largest training, organizing and equipping unit. \u201cI know of no one else more dedicated to his country, his soldiers and their families. He loved family, he loved God, he loved his nation and he loved the Army.\u201d\n\nCampbell spoke eloquently about Peterson when the latter retired in 2010, the same year as Campbell, who had been his boss at US FORSCOM. Peterson, who now lives in Arizona, will return the courtesy, as one of several general officers eulogizing Campbell at his memorial today at 11:30 a.m. at St. Paul\u2019s Episcopal Church, 275 Southfield Road.\n\n\u201cHe and I first became close at the command and general staff college in 1984,\u201dPeterson said. \u201cHondo was a rare human being, probably one of the smartest officers we had in our Army, one of the most fit and the most dedicated.\u201d\n\nCampbell suffered a major stroke, one of several medical events that led to his death, returning from Korea after assisting in a mentoring position there. It happened years after Campbell, who served from 1970 to 2010, retired.\n\n\u201cMost of his career was spent outside the continental United States,\u201d said retired Gen. Leon LaPorte, one of Campbell\u2019s bosses, who also will speak at the memorial today. \u201cHe served multiple tours in Vietnam, in Korea, in Germany. No stranger to foreign lands, he was always at the tip of the spear of our forces.\u201d\n\nAn accomplished ballroom dancer, taught by his mother, the late Erena Campbell, he also put off much of a personal life until late in his career, due to the demands of his job, LaPorte said.\n\n\u201cRight after we promoted him to brigadier general he met Dianne in Copperas Cove, Texas, and they ended up marrying,\u201d LaPorte said. \u201cHe was a bachelor brigadier general in the U.S. Army, and that is a very rare individual.\u201d\n\nPeterson said Campbell could have relaxed and enjoyed retirement with a new bride but chose a harder path.\n\n\u201cHe had a lot of choices at the end,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe could have done a lot of things that would have been financially much better. But he served his country. I don\u2019t think he would have done it any other way.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see retired four-star generals and former international stage players such as Tommy Franks or Ray Odierno at the service.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been very good friends over the years, but towards the end we got very close because he helped me all the time when I was commanding general in Korea,\u201d said retired Gen. J.D. Thurman, who succeeded Campbell both at FORSCOM and in Korea. \u201cI\u2019d known Hondo throughout my entire career: We were both armor officers. He was just a great soldier, a great professional soldier and our wives were very close, they used to work together.\u201d\n\nThurman was at the visitation Sunday at Osborn Funeral Home, but a prior commitment in Norfolk, Virginia, will prevent him being at the memorial today. But he said don\u2019t be surprised if there is plenty of glittering brass there to send Campbell off his final billet.\n\nAfter visiting with Campbell and talking with him recently, Thurman saw how Campbell was ailing and alerted Army leadership.\n\n\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cI called the current Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Mark A. Milley, and the former chief, Gen. George Casey, who Hondo worked for. Hondo had many friends. We\u2019re all going to miss him. He always had good sage advice. He was a smart man and a guy you could trust.\u201d\n\nThat trust worked its way down the chain of command as well as up, LaPorte said.\n\n\u201cHondo was special, a servant leader,\u201d LaPorte said. \u201cHe served the needs of his nation. He was thoughtful and caring, yet demanding and firm. He was empathetic, visionary but practical in terms of operational procedure. He was a devout Christian and that set the solid base of the way be behaved as a senior officer. He was a soldier\u2019s soldier. He could relate to me as a four-star and go out into the field and relate to a private at the same time.\u201d\n\nHe set the example, Thurman said.\n\n\u201cHondo was a true man of character. Above all he was a Christian and he always looked after his soldiers. He was a man who dedicated his whole life to his country.\u201d\n\nJohn Andrew Prime wrote for The Times for more than 37 years, from 1978 to late 2015.
