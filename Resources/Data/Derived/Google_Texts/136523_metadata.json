Jeff Sessions (R-AL) took Department of Homeland Sec. Jeh Johnson to task for what he highlighted as the Obama administration\u2019s immigration enforcement failures during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI believe Sen. [Chuck] Grassley (R-IA) is correct to say that we see a lack of will in your department. Before you took the office and from the president, frankly, on down,\u201d Sessions began.\n\nThe Alabama lawmaker, who has been among the most vocal critics of the Obama administration\u2019s immigration policies, offered a laundry list of frustrations with the Obama administration\u2019s immigration enforcement efforts.\n\n\u201cDeportations are down 41 percent over three years. Twenty-five percent over last year,\u201d Sessions said. \u201c160,000 criminal aliens are on the streets and now you announced a program to fly people from Central American countries who apply for refugee and parole status in those countries to the United States of America at the expense of the U.S. taxpayers,\u201d Sessions said, in reference to a recently created program.\n\n\u201cAll this has led, I believe, millions to conclude if they come here illegally they\u2019ll be successful. We\u2019ve got to change that fundamentally. If you do that, I believe we can make progress,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nHe continued to press Johnson to improve.\n\n\u201cJust can\u2019t say Mr. Secretary, that you have led and the president and your predecessors have led effectively, demonstrating a will to do what the American people want, which is a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest, one that we can be proud of. We are not there yet and you need to do more,\u201d Sessions said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
