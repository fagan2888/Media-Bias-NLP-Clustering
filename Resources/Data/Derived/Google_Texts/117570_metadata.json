In the course of questioning, he made this statement, giving an interesting revelation of the agency\u2019s mentality:\n\n\u201cWherever we can, we follow the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWherever we can\u201d? Sometimes it\u2019s simply impossible for a federal agency to follow the law? Yet the IRS is authorized to nail any citizen who violates tax law, knowingly or unknowingly, and frequently takes full advantage of that authority.\n\nMaybe I\u2019ll tell that to the IRS next time I file my taxes. \u201cI followed the law whenever I could, but sometimes, I just couldn\u2019t \u2014 please excuse me.\u201d\n\nReminds me of the letter Donald Rumsfeld sent to the IRS along with his tax return this year. He wrote, \u201cThe tax code is so complex and the forms are so complicated, that\u2026I have absolutely no idea whether our tax returns and our tax payments are accurate.\u201d\n\nJohn Hayward at Breitbart accurately diagnoses Koskinen\u2019s statement as a symptom of a much larger issue:\n\nThe problem is that we have a code of laws so complex, so distorted by political arrogance and special-interest deal-making, that even the gigantic agencies charged with enforcing it can only shrug and say they try to follow the law whenever they can. There might be big problems at some of those agencies, but the system itself is an even bigger problem.\n\nThe tax code, the IRS, and, frankly, the entire federal government need an overhaul. But that doesn\u2019t take the heat off the tax collectors. Recent history shows the IRS does indeed pick and choose when to follow the law. For example, the very issue Koskinen was answering for at the hearing:\n\nNumerous Treasury and IRS staffers have told investigators from the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform that they knew back in 2011 that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t authorize them to issue health-insurance subsidies through Exchanges established by the federal government. But they did so anyway. (And now they\u2019re in court.)\n\nNot to mention disclosing private taxpayer information \u2014 multiple times \u2014 destroying evidence related to a Congressional investigation, and targeting groups for increased scrutiny based on their political beliefs.\n\nKoskinen\u2019s statement is so ludicrous, Chairman Kevin Brady\u2019s initial response was just to laugh. Yet this is a serious matter. \u201cI encourage you to follow the law in all instances,\u201d was Brady\u2019s understated advice.\n\nWe\u2019ll do one better \u2014 the IRS had better follow the law, or face the consequences like anyone else.\n\nSorry, IRS, the American people can\u2019t accept your excuses. No one is exempt from the law, least of all public officials responsible for enforcing it.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1374\"", "article_summary": "Yet the IRS is authorized to nail any citizen who violates tax law, knowingly or unknowingly, and frequently takes full advantage of that authority.\nWe\u2019ll do one better \u2014 the IRS had better follow the law, or face the consequences like anyone else.\nRecent history shows the IRS does indeed pick and choose when to follow the law.\nSometimes it\u2019s simply impossible for a federal agency to follow the law?\nThe tax code, the IRS, and, frankly, the entire federal government need an overhaul."}
