Asked about the cost of his healthcare plan, Bernie Sanders said he would raise taxes but that the middle class would end up better off in the end.

"We will raise taxes, yes we will," Sanders said at CNN's Democratic town hall in Iowa Monday night. "But also let us be clear, Chris: There's a little bit of disingenunity out there. We may raise taxes but we are also going to eliminate private health insurance premiums for individuals and for businesses."

The democratic socialist candidate went on to explain that it is essential for the United States to adopt single-payer as "we are the only country on Earth that allows private insurance to rip us off."

He continued to argue that although his Medicare for all healthcare proposal would significantly raise taxes, it would actually save people money in the long run as they would no longer have to pay private insurance companies.

"If you're not paying any more private health insurance are you going to be complaining about the fact that I've saved you $5,000 in your total bill? So it's demagoguery to complain about raising taxes," Sanders insisted.

Sensing an opening, Hillary Clinton supporters tweeted out Sanders' remark. The former secretary of state plans to expand upon the Affordable Care Act and has pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class, which is often a key concern for Democratic voters.
