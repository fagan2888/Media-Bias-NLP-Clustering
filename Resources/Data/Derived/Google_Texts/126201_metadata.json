It is unremarkable because so many buildings of that kind still stand in this legendary whaling town, many of them abandoned once textiles\u2014for years the economic engine of the city\u2014followed whaling\u2019s earlier decline and nearly vanished. In this building, though, textiles were still being sown into vests and backpacks for the US Army, a nice bit of business in struggling New Bedford, coming as it did with a $132 million contract. Owner Francesco Insolia won the contract with help from city and state officials, took an enormous grant from Massachusetts\u2019 Department of Workforce Development when Mitt Romney was governor, and grew to more than 500 employees to produce his army goods in what was widely known to be a sweat shop. A sweat shop with all the trappings\u2014filthy bathrooms, draconian rules for lateness or talking or breaks, earned overtime pay never paid\u2014an altogether substandard workplace. Insolia could do so for several years because his employees were for the most part undocumented workers, immigrants, mainly from Guatemala and El Salvador. They would work hard for Insolia and the US Army and keep their heads down. It was an open secret, of course, because New Bedford is small and jobs were scarce. But for five years Insolia and his company, Michael Bianco Inc., thrived under the nose of the military officials there and the state and city officials who poured job training funds and tax breaks into his coffers.\n\nThen one day it all came crashing down. On a cold morning late in the winter of 2007, more than 300 agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, known as ICE, raided the factory and rousted 362 Guatemalans, Salvadorans and a sprinkling of other south-of-the-border workers. They were handcuffed and manacled, and over the course of the day were taken from where they sat on the factory floor into buses and driven 94 miles to Fort Devens, an Army Reserve base. Many spent several immobilized hours on that floor, feeling brutalized by the federal police, while others attempted to escape, some even jumping into Clark Cove to get away. Among those taken were parents of small children, about a hundred children in all, who were suddenly without parental care. The new governor, Deval Patrick, spurred by the state\u2019s child welfare agency being denied a role in the \u201cprocessing\u201d after weeks of pleading, called the whole shabby affair \u201ca humanitarian crisis.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed it was. Within hours, before lawyers could be dispatched to Fort Devens, about half of the arrested workers were flown to Texas (either to Harlingen or to El Paso) to be incarcerated in detention centers run by private contractors for the Department of Homeland Security, ICE\u2019s home department. There the possibility of being released, even with an ankle bracelet to monitor movements, was undercut by the lack of \u201ccommunity ties\u201d of the detainees. Months of detention for many of the Michael Bianco workers lay ahead. About 160 would be deported outright.\n\nIn New Bedford, the reaction of the workers\u2019 families and friends was panicked. Over the course of the chaotic day, the abandoned children were identified and placed with neighbors and extended family. Many immigrant families, legal or not, hunkered down in the north-side barrio, calling in sick to the other employers\u2014mostly the fish-packing plants\u2014and keeping their children out of school. No one knew what was coming next. But they gathered together almost instinctively at the Parish of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the one Catholic church that offered a Spanish mass, which is part of the old St. James Church that was less than a mile from the factory. There, Father Richard Wilson and a number of social workers (including Father Marc Fallon and Corinn Williams) ministered to the shocked community and set up a kind of operations center for lawyers and other public advocates to go to work. Senator Ted Kennedy was there within a few days, as was Governor Patrick. The complex and often confused task was to make sure the children were cared for, the fractured families stable (the loss of one breadwinner being a disaster), then unravel the tortuous detention process and sort out the legalities and the prospects for a release before deportation.\n\nThe raid was one of several dozen conducted by ICE around that time, likely a \u201cshow of force\u201d for the benefit of those criticizing President Bush for not keeping illegal immigrants out of the country. The attempt to reform immigration laws\u2014to give the out-of-status families a route to citizenship\u2014 was colliding with a powerful right-wing backlash against any attempt to reshape the laws. The alternative to reform, or possibly a complement to it, is the raid, whether of the workplace (the most dramatic and visible) or of homes. Raid, arrests, detention, imprisonment, deportation\u2014these constitute the raid mentality. In nearly every major raid, human-rights abuses were reported and many lives ruined for what is in effect no greater an offense than a traffic ticket. The raid sets in motion a process of criminalization that sticks with the immigrant forever, stigmatizes children, and disrupts local economies.\n\nThe immigrants themselves see the raid mentality as punitive, intimidating, and even reminiscent of the oppression they had escaped. Assimilation under such circumstances is hindered, at least for one generation, and often more. And while the many raids of the Bush administration were regarded as the high-water mark of the strategy, the numbers of apprehensions and deportations has risen in the Obama years. In 2011, for example, the Department of Homeland Security apprehended 642,000 foreign nationals, three of every four being Mexicans; 400,000 were deported\u2014 all-time highs.\n\nFor the Latinos of New Bedford, the national debate and Washington politics and ICE statistics were far from their concerns in late winter of 2007. They, and the city, had to cope with the sharp economic, political, and emotional disruption of the raid and its aftermath.\n\n* * *\n\nThe raid, as raids do, came suddenly and without warning. One Michael Bianco worker recalled it as follows:\n\nI was inside when they told us to turn the machines off. When I turned to look I saw people running. I thought it was a fire or something, so I ran toward the back exit, but when I looked back I saw Immigration running toward us. There was a helicopter. There were many police. They told us, \u2018Don\u2019t run! Don\u2019t run!\u2019 We turned back. They told us to sit on the floor. I got very nervous and started shaking because a man from Honduras started running in the basement,\u201d she continued, \u201cand seven police surrounded him, they grabbed him at the neck, picked him up and threw him to the floor. They handcuffed him. Then they took us upstairs. They handcuffed us, and pushed us to the floor. Many people could not sit because our hands were tied \u2026 . That was 8 a.m. At around 3 p.m., we asked for water. I saw them bring in many boxes of water. I thought they were for us. I asked an official to give me a little water. Another woman said, \u2018Yes, we want water.\u2019 He looked at me and gave me a little bottle of water. He said, \u2018You know, don\u2019t put your mouth on it, because many people are going to drink from there.\u2019 That little bottle was shared by about twelve people. They treated us as if we were murderers.\n\nMany witnesses told stories about the harshness of ICE officers. A woman working in the factory informed ICE that she had a daughter who would not have anyone to care for her if she were in detention, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t care,\u201d she later recalled; \u201cthey still took me with the group.\u201d \u201cBecause some of the women who had young children, who breastfed,\u201d she continued, \u201c[the officers] even made them take the milk from their breasts to see if it was true that they had young children. They even made fun of them. One of them told another to pass an Oreo cookie to eat with milk, that they were milking the cows.\u201d\n\nOthers reported similarly harsh treatment. \u201cWhen I saw that the agents carried guns, I thought they were going to shoot us,\u201d one worker told a public radio reporter. \u201cI thought we were all going to die that day.\u201d Several described the induced panic and the agents\u2019 callous reaction. \u201cWe saw these people coming and then when they started saying, \u2018Don\u2019t move. Nobody run,\u2019 then we realized immigration was there,\u201d a Salvadoran worker told an interviewer. \u201cThey were trying to grab everybody and people just started running like crazy. They panicked, they fell down. You found that they were pursuing people just like you were an animal. Like you would be running after a dog. They\u2019d go after you that way.\u201d He later told an ICE agent that a seven-months-pregnant woman needed some help; the agent refused and replied that he didn\u2019t care. No food or bathroom visits were allowed, and little if any water, for seven hours or more.\n\n\u201cI live near the plant and went there at once before the ICE raid,\u201d recalled Corinn Williams, who directs the Community Economic Development Center of Southeastern Massachusetts. \u201cThere were helicopters flying overhead and agents everywhere, and a mobile command center across the street. They put up barricades around the plant to keep families away.\u201d The Community Economic Development Center became a nerve center for the lawyers who gradually became involved and others trying to locate the arrested and their loved ones. \u201cAll day,\u201d Williams noted, \u201cwe heard from families about detainees, like the husband who had medications for his wife, who has seizures.\u201d\n\nBecause the whole process of arrest and detention was taking so long and was so opaque, the community activists and family members realized in early afternoon that schools and day-care centers would be releasing children shortly, yet there was no word from federal agents as to who among the parents were detained. So the scene at Our Lady of Guadalupe was fraught with anxiety about the children, about infants without their mothers who were nursing, about older children getting out of school and going to an empty home, and about men suddenly assuming the role of two parents. As Williams pointed out, this was the first major ICE raid in which a majority of detainees were women\u2014and young, child-bearing women at that. Father Fallon was told by ICE that Massachusetts\u2019 Department of Social Services (DSS) had been part of the planning and would make amends, but people at that agency claimed they were \u201cnot in the loop\u201d and therefore weren\u2019t prepared.\n\nBethany Tour\u00e9, an activist who had been on the scene, recalled that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a lot of outpouring of emotion or crying.\u201d \u201cIt was really like vacant looks; vacant stares, kind of almost being in a state of shock,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a people who have been so traumatized before and here is trauma again.\u201d Several of the workers recalled the helicopters as reminding them of military assaults in the highlands of Guatemala or the civil war in El Salvador.\n\nGradually, the arrested were loaded onto gray, unmarked buses with dark-tinted windows and driven the nearly 100 miles to Fort Devens; none were allowed to speak with family members. \u201cIt was like the hunter carting away his prey,\u201d recalls Father Fallon, \u201creturning time and again.\u201d \u201cThat day was like the end of the world for me,\u201d said one worker who was eventually deported to Guatemala.\n\nThrough the long day of the raid and the confusion and trauma of the days and weeks ahead, the city of New Bedford and its mayor came in for some sharp criticism for their placid cooperation with ICE (Mayor Scott Lang had known of the plans for the raid in advance) and their lack of preparations for the children. Lang blamed others. \u201cWhere was the mayor? That\u2019s what we were asking,\u201d Corinn Williams recalled. Ken Hartnett, then recently retired from editing the Standard-Times, the area\u2019s largest newspaper, echoed that years later: \u201cMayor Lang was terrible. Talk Radio\u2014the Ken Pittman show\u2014was stoking ideas that the Guatemalans were taking jobs and ripping off the system. Lang was on his show weekly, and should have denounced that.\u201d The chief of police was, as one would expect, cooperative with ICE, but had not pursued illegal immigration as an issue for his department before.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When ICE agents raided a New Bedford factory, 362 Latinos' lives were upended and the results were devastating", "author": "John Tirman", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "When ICE agents raided a New Bedford factory, 362 Latinos' lives were upended and the results were devastating", "title": "\u201cThey treated us as if we were murderers\u201d: The trauma of an ICE raid", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/05/they_treated_us_as_if_we_were_murderers_the_trauma_of_an_ice_raid/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/ice_agents.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When ICE agents raided a New Bedford factory, 362 Latinos' lives were upended and the results were devastating", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/ice_agents.jpg", "title": "\u201cThey treated us as if we were murderers\u201d: The trauma of an ICE raid", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cThey treated us as if we were murderers\u201d: The trauma of an ICE raid", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Editor's Picks, ICE, Immigration, New Bedford", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf9b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Editor's Picks, ICE, Immigration, New Bedford, Life News, Politics NewsNothing illustrates the \u201craid mentality\u201d of immigration enforcement like an actual raid.\n\u201cI live near the plant and went there at once before the ICE raid,\u201d recalled Corinn Williams, who directs the Community Economic Development Center of Southeastern Massachusetts.\nAs Williams pointed out, this was the first major ICE raid in which a majority of detainees were women\u2014and young, child-bearing women at that.\nAmong those taken were parents of small children, about a hundred children in all, who were suddenly without parental care.\nThe raid sets in motion a process of criminalization that sticks with the immigrant forever, stigmatizes children, and disrupts local economies."}
