Then we headed south, where Kristen had work to do in the Tetons. By that point in our trip, my self-imposed assignment was simply to explore a park that I was long overdue to visit.\n\nOur trip was the first week of June. For being relatively early in the summer, I was surprised to find Yellowstone already feeling as busy as it does at the peak of tourist season. As soon as we exited Yellowstone, and entered the John D. Rockfeller Jr. Memorial Parkway, which sits between Yellowstone and Grand Teton, the crowds seemed to evaporate into thin air. There were no more bear jams. Roadside pullouts weren\u2019t filled with cars. When we checked into our cabin at Colter Bay Village, the area seemed mostly deserted.\n\nI had done little research ahead of time about possible hikes to do in the Tetons, so after checking in to our cabin, I made my way to the ranger station, where I picked up a map and some advice on a quick evening hike.\n\nThe ranger recommended a 3-mile loop that would take me to Swan Lake and Heron Pond.\n\nThe Falcon Guide hiking book for Grand Teton National Park, which I neglected to bring on the trip, describes the loop as easy and the traffic as heavy. It was an easy hike, with only about 300 feet of climbing, but traffic wasn\u2019t heavy at all. I only saw a couple other hikers on the trail.\n\nI didn\u2019t see any swans or herons as the name implies, but I did see a pelican and lots of Canada geese hanging out on the lily pad-covered Swan Lake. Even more exciting, was spotting a grizzly bear across Heron Pond.\n\nAs the trail looped back toward the trailhead, it offered glimpses of Jackson Lake and the mountains lined up behind it.\n\nThe next morning, Kristen wanted a pre-dawn start to catch the Tetons in the best morning light. I took in the alpenglow on Mount Owen and Grand Teton reflecting in Jenny Lake. Once the sun was in the sky, I headed out on another hike, this time along String Lake to Paintbrush Canyon.\n\nThe trail was beautiful but isolated. I didn\u2019t see any other hikers or any sign of them. After an hour of hiking, yelling \u201chey bear,\u201d singing out loud and jumping at every noise I heard, I decided to turn around and find a slightly more trafficked trail.\n\nI went back to the trail junction where I previously headed north the Paintbrush Canyon. This time I took the trail south toward Cascade Canyon and along the west shore of Jenny Lake.\n\nThe views were spectacular as I kept getting closer and closer to the park\u2019s iconic, towering mountains.\n\nThe trail took me to a boat dock on the west side of the lake, where hikers can catch a shuttle to the south shore. Instead, I carried on up the trail, hoping to reach Hidden Falls.\n\nJust before the falls, I ran into a trail crew working to remove a huge downed tree. A fierce wind storm a couple days before was likely to blame, another hiker explained.\n\nI waited a few minutes while the crew cut through the trunk with a chain saw. From my spot on the trail, I could just make out Hidden Falls. I watched the falls and watched the crew work, then turned around and headed back down the trail.\n\nAn hour or so later, I was back at Jenny Lake Lodge, and Kristen and I were headed home. It was hard to leave the park, feeling like I had just scratched the surface after rediscovering it.\n\nEven now, as I write this and look at the map of Grand Teton National Park, I\u2019m itching to go back and explore deeper into the park.\n\nMy stay in Grand Teton National Park lasted less than 24 hours, but it reminded me what an amazing national park lies just beyond Yellowstone. The short visit whet my appetite for more time exploring the Tetons.\n\nTake a hike in Grand Teton National Park\n\nHeron Pond and Swan Lake\n\nDistance: 3 miles round trip\n\nElevation gain: 300 feet\n\nDifficulty: Easy\n\nHighlights: Good place to spot birds, good views of Jackson Lake\n\nTrailhead location: Colter Bay, near boat launch\n\nHidden Falls\n\nDistance: 5.2 miles round trip\n\nElevation gain: 550 feet\n\nDifficulty: Moderate\n\nHighlights: Follow Jenny Lake\u2019s south shore before climbing to the waterfall.\n\nTrailhead location: Leigh and String Lake Trailhead, near Jenny Lake Lodge\n\nAlternate option: Take the boat shuttle across the lake from Jenny Lake Visitor Center for a 1.2-mile hike.\n\nPaintbrush Canyon to Holly Lake\n\nDistance: 13 miles round trip\n\nElevation gain: 2,900 feet\n\nDifficulty: Strenuous\n\nHighlights: This is a great place to see wildflowers and the hike ends at an alpine lake.\n\nTrailhead location: Leigh and String Lake Trailhead, near Jenny Lake Lodge\n\n___\n\nThe original story can be found on the Great falls Tribune\u2019s website:\n\nhttp://gftrib.com/1KOAxmm", "article_metadata": {"description": "The last time I visited Grand Teton National Park was in 2002.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The last time I visited Grand Teton National Park was in 2002.", "title": "Grand Teton National Park offers hiking, beauty", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/18/grand-teton-national-park-offers-hiking-beauty/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/e188d6358af8381f7c0f6a706700cf11.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/15/e188d6358af8381f7c0f6a706700cf11.jpg", "description": "The last time I visited Grand Teton National Park was in 2002.", "card": "summary", "title": "Grand Teton National Park offers hiking, beauty"}, "Author": "ERIN MADISON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyoming (AP) - The last time I visited Grand Teton National Park was in 2002.\nMy stay in Grand Teton National Park lasted less than 24 hours, but it reminded me what an amazing national park lies just beyond Yellowstone.\nTrailhead location: Leigh and String Lake Trailhead, near Jenny Lake LodgeAlternate option: Take the boat shuttle across the lake from Jenny Lake Visitor Center for a 1.2-mile hike.\nEven now, as I write this and look at the map of Grand Teton National Park, I\u2019m itching to go back and explore deeper into the park.\nThe Falcon Guide hiking book for Grand Teton National Park, which I neglected to bring on the trip, describes the loop as easy and the traffic as heavy."}
