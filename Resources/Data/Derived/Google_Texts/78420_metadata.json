The good news for the Rams is Wyoming\u2019s defense yeilds 429 yards per game so CSU should be able to move the football. Cashing in with touchdowns instead of field goals will be critical.\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State\u2019s offense must keep up with Wyoming\u2019s", "title": "Colorado State\u2019s offense must keep up with Wyoming\u2019s", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/19/colorado-states-offense-must-keep-up-with-wyomings/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131012_013049_colorado-state.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131012_013049_colorado-state.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-19T11:47:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:22:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s because the Rams (2-4, 0-1 Mountain West) must find a way to keep up with Wyoming\u2019s high-powered offense.\n\u2014 In order for Colorado State to end Wyoming\u2019s four-year reign of holding the Bronze Boot, the focus will be on CSU\u2019s offense Saturday at War Memorial Stadium.\nThe Cowboys (4-2, 2-0), led by junior quarterback Brett Smith, average 37.7 points per game and rank 10th nationally in total offense with 518.8 points per game.\nSmith has thrown for as many 511 yards in a game (56-23 win at Air Force) and ranks third nationally in total offense (379.0).\nThe good news for the Rams is Wyoming\u2019s defense yeilds 429 yards per game so CSU should be able to move the football."}
