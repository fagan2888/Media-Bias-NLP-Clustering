Denver Police officers and members of the Volunteers in Policing Unit will hand out crime alert fliers Sunday afternoon in the City Park area.

The officers and volunteers will go door-to-door passing out fliers with information about seven recent incidents of a man inappropriately touching female joggers.

Since Jan. 5, there have been seven reports of a man who appears to be targeting women who jog alone in the neighborhoods near City Park.

The unidentified man is described as being 18 to 24 years old, is about 5-foot-8 and weighs 140 to 150 pounds.

The suspect has short, dark hair, dark eyes with dark circles under them and thick, dark eyebrows.

Officers have increased patrols in the area.

Police say people in the area should be aware of their surroundings, travel on major sidewalks and streets, avoid shortcuts and stay in well-lit areas at night. They add that it is safer to walk or jog in pairs.
