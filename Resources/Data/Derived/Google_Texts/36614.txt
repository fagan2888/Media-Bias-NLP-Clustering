A 26-year-old Shawnee resident is facing child pornography charges.

Authorities accuse Shane DeRyckere of using social media to get nude photographs of girls under the age of 16.

Experts in internet crime said what DeRyckere is believed to have done is common among child predators, using social media sites that are frequented by their targets and often posing as someone they're not.

"You don't really know who it is that you are talking to," Steve Tanner, an OSBI agent who spent years working with the Internet Crimes Against Children unit, said.

In this case, authorities claim DeRyckere created fake profiles under the names "Brooke Tanner," "Autumn Henderson," and "affireman635" on various social media sites to encourage underage girls to send him nude photos.

"They will pose as anything in order to get people to send them pictures," Tanner said.

He explained sites, like meetme.com, often report suspicious behavior to authorities. The activity under DeRyckere's alias on the site is what ultimately led to a state investigation.

According the case agent, DeRyckere also had accounts on ourteennetwork.com and Kik, an instant messaging app for cell phones.

Court records show DeRyckere sent messages to users asking, "Got any pics of young nude girls? Like 10-15? ;)." He also asked for users to "Only send them if they're young ;) like idc if they're 10 hehe."
