Manning participated in the team stretches before heading to the locker room for treatment on his strained thigh. He later returned and was formally listed as limited on the injury report.\n\n\u201cAt this time of year everybody, not just me, is dealing with different things physically,\u201d Manning said after Thursday\u2019s practice. \u201cSo if you can get a little extra time to take care of your body, treatment or what not, I think guys take advantage of that, and hopefully that will pay off for us.\u201d\n\nManning, who played while sick with flu symptoms Sunday at San Diego, appeared to be injured on the last drive of the second half. Backup quarterback Brock Osweiler finished the first half for the Broncos before Manning returned in the third quarter and finished the game, something even he wasn\u2019t sure would happen at the time.\n\n\u201cI was in some discomfort and had some limitations, so obviously if you feel like you can\u2019t do your job and you can\u2019t move to protect yourself, you\u2019re going to hurt the team,\u201d Manning said after the victory Sunday. \u201cI felt I got a little relief there at halftime and was able to go the second half.\u201d\n\nThursday, Manning said he no longer is experiencing the flu symptoms, but remained tight-lipped about the health of his thigh, offering only, \u201cI feel OK,\u201d and, \u201cI certainly hope so,\u201d when asked if he\u2019ll be ready to play Monday.\n\nAlthough Manning is known for adhering to a strict practice regimen, a day off for him isn\u2019t unusual. He did not participate in padded Wednesday practices the latter part of last season after injuring his ankle.\n\nThe Broncos travel to Cincinnati for a Monday night game against the Bengals, a matchup that has playoff implications for both teams. A victory would clinch a bye for the Broncos in the playoffs. A victory for the Bengals, who lead the AFC North with a 9-4-1 record, would likely seal a postseason berth.\n\n\u201cThis game means a lot to us, but it means a lot to them, as well,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThey\u2019re playing at home, Monday Night Football, it\u2019ll be a great atmosphere, so, yeah, I definitely think it\u2019ll be rocking there, and both teams have a lot on the line.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals are coming off a 30-0 rout of the Browns in Johnny Manziel\u2019s first game as a starter, having shown their defensive tenacity in holding Cleveland to only 107 yards, picking off Manziel twice and sacking him three times.\n\n\u201cThey played really well,\u201d Manning said of the Bengals\u2019 defense. \u201cDominating is a good word. From the start, defenisvely they didn\u2019t give Cleveland any type of momentum, barely let them move the ball.\u201d\n\nWhile Manning was open to looking back into the Bengals\u2019 past, the same did not apply to the Broncos. There will be no more talk about his thigh and his teammates\u2019 bruises and rest: \u201cWe\u2019re full speed ahead, trying to win this game, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really all we\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\n\nManning masterfully deflected questions about Terrance Knighton\u2019s recent guarantee the Broncos will win the Super Bowl: \u201cTerrance has a lot of confidence, that\u2019s a good quality about him. As far as me though, I\u2019m on to Cincinnati.\u201d\n\nAnd enough with the flu questions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m past talking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re on to Cincinnati.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or at twitter.com/nickijhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning leaves practice to get treatment on thigh", "title": "Peyton Manning leaves practice to get treatment on thigh", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/18/peyton-manning-leaves-practice-to-get-treatment-on-thigh/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141218_114044_peyton-manning-3.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141218_114044_peyton-manning-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-18T11:32:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:21:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning left the team\u2019s practice Thursday almost as quickly as he arrived.\n\u201cAt this time of year everybody, not just me, is dealing with different things physically,\u201d Manning said after Thursday\u2019s practice.\nManning participated in the team stretches before heading to the locker room for treatment on his strained thigh.\nAlthough Manning is known for adhering to a strict practice regimen, a day off for him isn\u2019t unusual.\n\u201cThis game means a lot to us, but it means a lot to them, as well,\u201d Manning said."}
