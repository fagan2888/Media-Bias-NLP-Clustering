You don\u2019t get, however, any of the subsidies that American citizens get.\u201d\n\n\u201cMartin O\u2019Malley says they should. Why not?\u201d Stephanopoulos asked.\n\n\u201cWell, I disagree with him,\u201c she said. \u201cI think part of comprehensive immigration reform should be looking at all of these issues, but as things stand right now, under the Affordable Care Act, if you have the money, and you are undocumented, you can buy into it but without the subsidies. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important we continue to support community health centers. We continue to support our hospitals, because those are often the places that undocumented people and poor people go.\u201d\n\nStephanopoulos reminded viewers at the start of the interview that he once worked for her husband Bill Clinton in the White House and made donations to the Clinton Foundation, a story first uncovered by the Free Beacon.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Hillary Clinton was asked to explain the drastic shift in her health care policy with regards to illegal immigrants Sunday on This Week, as she now supports them being allowed to buy into health care", "title": "Clinton Called Out by Stephanopoulos for Flip-Flop on Health Care Policy for Illegal Immigrants: \u2018Why The Shift?\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/clinton-called-out-by-stephanpoulos-for-flip-flop-on-health-care-policy-for-illegal-immigrants-why-the-shift/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton was asked to explain the drastic shift in her health care policy with regards to ill", "creator": "@DavidRutz", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/freebeacon.png", "title": "Clinton Called Out by Stephanopoulos for Flip-Flop on Health Care Policy for Illegal Immigrants: \u2018Why The Shift?\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn the past, you\u2019ve said that undocumented immigrants would not be covered by your health care proposal,\u201d host George Stephanopoulos said.\n\u201cNow you say that undocumented immigrants should be able to buy into the exchanges, so why the shift?\u201d he asked.\nBY: Follow @DavidRutzHillary Clinton was asked to explain the drastic shift in her health care policy with regards to illegal immigrants Sunday on This Week, as she now supports them being allowed to buy into health care exchanges but wouldn\u2019t cover them in her first campaign.\n\u201cHere\u2019s an exchange we had in 2007.\u201dStephanopoulos then rolled tape of Clinton saying on the same show during her first, failed campaign for the presidency that no illegal immigrants would be covered under her health care plan.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important we continue to support community health centers."}
