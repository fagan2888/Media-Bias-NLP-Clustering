Brookings, SD

An early Saturday morning crash south of Brookings has left one Brandon man dead.

Twenty-year-old Adam Bauer of Brandon was driving north on Interstate 29 around 4:30 a.m. Saturday when his vehicle traveled into the southbound lane and struck a semi-truck and trailer heading south.

The driver of the semi, 36-year-old Markus Spiertz of Canada says he pulled to the side of the road, but was still struck by Bauer's vehicle, which eventually ended up in the west ditch. Bauer was pronounced dead at the scene.

Spiertz and his wife, who was a passenger in the semi, were not injured. Highway Patrol is still investigating the incident.
