Jerry Brown's staff hosted more than a dozen Assembly members recently to take their temperatures on hotly contested environmental legislation.\n\nInstead, the meeting became a gripe session about the California Air Resources Board, the powerful government regulator that would implement proposed rules for slashing the use of gasoline on state roads.\n\n\"There was some anger,\" said Assemblyman Mike Gatto (D-Glendale), one of the participants. He said the administration response was, \"Get back in line, you naughty kids.\"\n\nNEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>\n\nThe tension reflected the degree to which concerns about the board, a favorite among environmentalists and a boogeyman for industry opponents, have threatened to scuttle legislation to advance California's pathbreaking policies on climate change.\n\nThe debate turns on questions of how the state can meet its environmental goals with the right balance between the executive branch, which prizes the ability to act independently, and state lawmakers, who want their own stamp on government programs.\n\nWith the regular legislative session set to end Friday, state Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills) has added more board oversight to a measure she is carrying that would set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSimilar steps are being considered by Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles), who has legislation setting three goals for the next 15 years: generating half of the state's electricity from renewable sources, doubling energy efficiency in existing buildings and cutting in half the amount of petroleum used for transportation in California.\n\nBoth bills have passed the Senate but are facing resistance in the Assembly, where lawmakers are debating how much leeway the Air Resources Board should be allowed in pursuit of environmental targets.\n\nOil companies that oppose the legislation say regulators may resort to gas rationing or penalties for those who drive more than others \u2014accusations that board officials deny. They say the goal could be met by ramping up existing programs supporting initiatives such as electric vehicles, mass transit and fuels that contain less carbon.\n\nMary Nichols, the board's chairwoman, said she knows lawmakers, many of whom will be serving longer in the Capitol because of term limits changes that voters approved a few years ago, want to play a larger role in how regulators do their job.\n\n\"We have a new generation of legislators who are not just going to sign a blank check,\" she said.\n\nNichols is a longtime ally of Brown \u2014 she served in his first administration in the 1970s \u2014 and the governor's office is wary of attempts to constrict the board's powers.\n\n\"There's a wide gulf between ensuring appropriate legislative oversight \u2014 which the administration is, of course, willing to discuss \u2014 and erecting real barriers that prevent the hard work necessary to fight climate change,\" said Evan Westrup, a spokesman for the governor.\n\nThe board, created in 1967 under Gov. Ronald Reagan, has a record of pace-setting environmental action, including the imposition of stringent standards on fuel efficiency and tailpipe emissions.\n\nSupporters view the board as a champion for green policies and don't want to see it constrained by political considerations.\n\n\"Why make it harder to do the mission the public wants to see done?\" said Kathryn Phillips, director of Sierra Club California. \"And what the public wants is clean air.\"\n\nSome Assembly members want to force the air board to seek legislative approval before implementing new regulations. De Le\u00f3n has ruled that out, obtaining a memo from the Legislature's lawyer saying that any \"legislative veto \u2026 would be unconstitutional\" and violate the separation of powers.\n\nDe Le\u00f3n said he sympathizes with concerns about oversight, saying he's had his own \"battle royale\" with the air board over how money is spent on anti-pollution programs.\n\nBut he described questions about the regulators' power as \"an incredible narrative that's been perpetuated by Big Oil\" to derail the legislation.\n\nGatto disagreed, noting that he's never taken campaign money from the oil industry but remains skeptical about the measure.\n\nHe said legislative attempts to rein in the board can be difficult, noting that the agency successfully opposed his proposal to tweak an ethanol program to guard against certain negative effects.\n\n\"That's tremendous arrogance,\" Gatto said. \"I think every member [of the Legislature] has had an experience like this.\"\n\nAssemblyman Ian Calderon (D-Whittier) said lawmakers are ready to reassert their authority in a Capitol that has been dominated by Brown in recent years.\n\n\"I don't want to give up any of my authority to an unelected bureaucracy,\" Calderon said.\n\nInterested in the stories shaping California?

There's an ongoing legal battle over whether the board exceeded its authority in imposing those fees, and business interests are wary of new regulations.\n\nRob Lapsley, president of the California Business Roundtable, said the experience with cap and trade \"gives us pause on what could be coming next on a whole host of new policies that would be needed to achieve the goals.\"\n\nWith just days left for lawmakers to finish their work, environmental advocates are nervous about whether the Air Resources Board will emerge with enough authority to keep pushing the state toward lower gasoline use.\n\n\"Accountability is one thing,\" said Steve Chadima of Advanced Energy Economy, an association of clean energy companies. \"Micromanagement is another thing.\"\n\nchris.megerian@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "State lawmakers challenge Air Resources Board's power over climate change rules", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Top members of Gov.
