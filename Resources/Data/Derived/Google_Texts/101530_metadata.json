The author, Jim Weidman, provocatively titled his piece, \u201cThe American People Rose Up To Repeal A Health Care Law Once Before. They Can Do It Again.\u201d\n\nWeidman\u2019s thesis is that the health law\u2019s bumpy rollout \u2014 including the one-two punch of a dysfunctional website that\u2019s preventing Americans from signing up for insurance and insurance companies canceling millions of individual policies that don\u2019t meet Obamacare\u2019s coverage requirements \u2014 could foretell its eventual demise. But there are several major problems with this comparison.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan proposed the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in his 1986 State of the Union address. Signed in 1988, the law provided new medical benefits for elderly Medicare beneficiaries, including \u201ca ceiling on hospital and doctor bills, expanded payments for nursing home care and prescription drugs,\u201d and other similar reforms.\n\nIn short, the law expanded the types of benefits available to Medicare beneficiaries and capped how much money they\u2019d have to pay out-of-pocket for said benefits. As Weidman points out, that\u2019s similar to the health law, which requires individual policies sold in the Obamacare marketplaces to cover ten broad categories of essential health benefits while limiting Americans\u2019 contributions towards their monthly premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses depending on their annual income.\n\nBut that\u2019s where Weidman\u2019s comparison breaks down. Seniors were incensed by the fact that Congress paid for the Catastrophic Coverage Act purely by increasing premiums on every Medicare beneficiary and imposing an additional progressive surtax on retirees. That\u2019s a pretty lopsided way of funding benefits in a government entitlement that only exists because Americans pay into over the course of their working years so that they may enjoy it once they\u2019re elderly.\n\n\u201cThis [funding mechanism] would have represented a hefty burden on some, and, unlike the rest of the Medicare program, the additional benefits mandated by the act would have been financed entirely by the elderly,\u201d wrote researchers in a 1990 \u201cpost-mortem\u201d of the Act published in Health Affairs. What made matters worse is that many of these benefits were redundant, since existing retiree plans already covered them for many beneficiaries.\n\nBy contrast, Congress funded Obamacare largely through a combination of savings derived from changes in how Medicare pays hospitals and doctors and revenue collected from a tax on the wealthiest Americans\u2019 investment income (and a variety of other industry fees and penalties). Over $200 billion of Obamacare funding comes from simply reducing the number of uninsured Americans and thereby reducing hospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs.\n\nObamacare\u2019s benefits also include essential coverage that isn\u2019t available in the types of junk insurance plans sold in the pre-ACA individual market. Almost 10 percent of these plans excluded basic protections like prescription drug coverage. Over 60 percent of individual policies left out maternity coverage, and 18 percent didn\u2019t cover mental health care. So unlike many Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 complaints about the Catastrophic Coverage Act, Americans gaining insurance under Obamacare will enjoy protections that they never had in the past.\n\nThe backlash against the Catastrophic Coverage Act also came from a far larger constituency than the one that\u2019s upset over cancelled policies under Obamacare. There were just under 33 million Americans enrolled in Medicare coverage in 1988. That constituted 13.5 percent of the U.S. population at the time. Experts estimate that somewhere between seven million and 12 million of the 15 million Americans with individual policies will have their plans canceled under the health law \u2014 which means that 3.79 percent of Americans, at most, will be affected by cancellations.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) also estimates that about half of the Americans with individual policies will qualify for government subsidies to pay their monthly premiums under Obamacare. That means that many of the Americans getting their plans canceled could feasibly get better and cheaper coverage thanks to the health law.\n\nWeidman is right to point out Americans\u2019 frustrations with the dysfunctional Healthcare.gov website. But to compare that tech debacle to the Catastrophic Coverage Act is an apples-to-oranges comparison. In fact, three in five Americans who haven\u2019t visited an Obamacare marketplace or didn\u2019t enroll a plan in October say they still plan on enrolling in the future, according to a survey the Commonwealth Fund. Opposition to the law still remains widely divided, with strong majorities consistently saying they\u2019d rather fix the law than scrap it. That doesn\u2019t sound like voters are ready to bring out the pitchforks quite yet.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "In the latest attack on Obamacare, the Heritage Foundation compares it to a deeply unpopular Reagan-era health law that Americans revolted against.
