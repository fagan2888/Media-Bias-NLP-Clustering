Rick Scott used his veto pen Tuesday to slash $461 million from the lawmaker-approved state budget, a move that drew an openly hostile reaction from senators who have been feuding with the governor since his November re-election.\n\nSenate President Andy Gardiner, an Orlando Republican, said that Scott was playing \u201cpolitics\u201d with his veto list in an attempt to help frame his future political ambitions, which could include a 2018 run for U.S. Senate.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that the messaging strategy needed to achieve the governor\u2019s political agenda comes at the expense of the most vulnerable people in our state,\u201d Gardiner wrote in a statement.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Bill Galvano of Sarasota said that Scott\u2019s massive veto list will impact relationships with the Legislature heading into next session, which begins in just three months.\n\n\u201cThe cuts will still be fresh in members' minds when they return to Tallahassee,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Steve Crisafulli took a much different tone, underscoring his chamber\u2019s better relationship with Scott\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Governor Scott for swiftly signing the budget into law,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThis year\u2019s legislative session was marked by a fight in which House Republicans and Scott\u2019s office together opposed a Senate plan to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe $461 million in vetoed spending is the most since Scott cut $615 million in 2011, his first year in office. Scott signed the budget behind closed doors, which is contrary to the public signing ceremony that usually comes with finalizing the state spending plan.\n\n\u201cI went through the budget saying, what is a statewide priority, can I get a good return on investment, has it gone through a state process?\u201d he said of his veto rationale.\n\nHe said \u201cabsolutely not\u201d when asked if his veto list was designed to retaliate against those who opposed his policy positions. During an availability with reporters, Scott touted the budget\u2019s $427 million in tax cuts, nearly $20 billion for public education\u2014a record overall number\u2014and a record $45 million for springs restoration.\n\nAmong the projects that did not make the final cut are $15 million for a downtown University of Central Florida campus in Orlando, a big priority Gardiner; $2 million for IMG, a private sports academy in Galvano's district; and $1 million for a marina in Palm Beach County sought by powerful Republican state Sen. Jack Latvala of Clearwater.\n\nScott also vetoed more than $20 million in local water projects, which are politically important for lawmakers who use them as concrete examples of state cash they can bring home to their districts.\n\nSenate budget chief Tom Lee says members are already calling him about potential veto overrides.\n\nHe specifically pointed to a $27 million veto for \u201cwater farming,\u201d or using contracts with private land owners to store water, and a handful of vetoes to funding for developmental programs championed by Gardiner, whose son has Down syndrome.\n\nLee said he thinks his chamber\u2019s hostile reaction is tied to meetings held during regular session in which Scott threatened individual senators with vetoes.\n\n\u201cExpectations were set among members of the Senate that the governor is going to be punitive,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIf he had not foreshadowed that, I don\u2019t think senators would be reacting this way.\u201d\n\nThe final spending plan was signed just days after it was passed by lawmakers last Friday, a quick turnaround that surprised many.\n\n\u201cI was not given a heads-up,\u201d Galvano said.\n\nThe time between final budget passage and the governor's signature is traditionally used by both lobbyists and lawmakers to make the case for their budget items. They provide the governor\u2019s budget staff with background information and more details about projects to try and avoid the veto ax.\n\nScott\u2019s budget staff had been asking a handful of lobbyists for backup information on projects early, because the special session was going to give him a shorter turnaround time to sign the spending plan.\n\n\u201cInsiders should not be too surprised,\u201d said Nick Iarossi, a lobbyist and Scott fund-raiser. \u201cOur firm was providing information requested about our client\u2019s projects back during regular session.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Lawmakers surprised by quick signing.", "title": "Senators see 'political agenda' in Scott's budget vetoes", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/senators-see-political-agenda-in-scotts-budget-vetoes-119334.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/23/150623_rick_scott_gty_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "florida state senate,Andy Gardiner,tom lee,jack latvala,Bill Galvano,steve crisafulli,Florida,Rick Scott,florida house", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Lawmakers surprised by quick signing.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Senators see 'political agenda' in Scott's budget vetoesTALLAHASSEE \u2014 Gov.\nScott signed the budget behind closed doors, which is contrary to the public signing ceremony that usually comes with finalizing the state spending plan.\nLee said he thinks his chamber\u2019s hostile reaction is tied to meetings held during regular session in which Scott threatened individual senators with vetoes.\n\u201cI want to thank Governor Scott for swiftly signing the budget into law,\u201d he said in a statement.\nThey provide the governor\u2019s budget staff with background information and more details about projects to try and avoid the veto ax."}
