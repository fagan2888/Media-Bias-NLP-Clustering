Smart Plugs

For non-overhead lights that make use of an outlet, and anything else that needs to be plugged in, like a window air conditioner, the Belkin WeMo Insight Switch can help smarten up ordinarily dumb devices. Not only can you remotely control power being directed to your appliances (say, your slow cooker when you’re held up at work), but you can also see when these appliances are being used. In addition, the switch monitors electricity usage, giving you the power to save money. The WeMo Insight Switch retails for about $50, but that’s just for one unit. If you really are keen on building an awesome smart home, you’ll need to get at least a few of them.
