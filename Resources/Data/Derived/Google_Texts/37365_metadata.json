It has the shape and feel, at first, of many other true-crime stories\u2014indeed, set as it is on the Gulf Coast, it has a whiff of the meditative investigation and rural mystery of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d The investigators sport cowboy hats and bristle-brush mustaches. It feels more like a news network\u2019s salacious prime-time programming than an HBO documentary.\n\nBut then things start deviating from the script: The murdered party\u2019s upstairs neighbor is a mute woman. She is described as \u201cugly.\u201d A man is found picking up a prescription found in her apartment. The man flees. The man walks into a Wegman\u2019s in Pennsylvania and tries to steal a hoagie, despite having more than $500 in his pocket and $38,000 in the car. And the man, whose name is Robert Durst, insists he has done nothing wrong.\n\nIs Robert Durst jinxed? The possibility is where HBO\u2019s six-part documentary series, debuting Sunday night, gets its name. The wealthy scion of a New York City real estate mogul, Durst has been linked to three different unsolved cases\u2014the 1982 disappearance of his wife in New York, the murder of a journalist in Beverly Hills in 2000, and, most recently, the 2001 murder and dismemberment of an elderly man in Galveston. He has only been charged once, for the Texas murder; he was acquitted. Today, Durst walks free, albeit with some limitations on his movement. \u201cThe Jinx\u201d is an attempt to tell the story of this man and the mysteries surrounding him\u2014it\u2019s subtitled \u201cThe Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\u201d\u2014with one major trump card: Durst himself, who sat down with director Andrew Jarecki for a face-to-face interview.\n\nJarecki is best known for the critically acclaimed 2003 documentary \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d also produced by HBO, which examined the case of a father and son both being arrested for child molestation and eventually pleading guilty. It\u2019s a chilling documentary\u2014not just because of the nature of the crimes, but because of how difficult it becomes to pin down any one truth about the guilt or innocence of these men. Stories conflict; testimony is tampered with; home video is excavated and examined. The viewer doesn\u2019t leave \u201cCapturing the Friedmans\u201d thinking that justice has been served; the viewer leaves wondering if anything they\u2019ve just seen is real.\n\n\u201cThe Jinx\u201d is Jarecki\u2019s attempt to do something similar for the case of Robert Durst\u2014a man who displays breathtaking arrogance and self-delusion along with real pain and confusion. In one of the oddest twists of the story, Durst actually came to Jarecki with his story, instead of the other way around. Jarecki produced a feature film based on Kathleen Durst\u2019s disappearance in 1982, and in an interview clip included in \u201cThe Jinx,\u201d he says his mission was to create a story that Robert Durst himself would have an emotional reaction to. Apparently, on some level, he succeeded. Durst called Jarecki and offered him not just an interview, but the interview\u2014exclusive access and full cooperation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new docu-series mixes \"True Detective\" and \"Serial\" in this true story of a man connected to three murders", "title": "\u201cThe Jinx\u201d: HBO investigates the unsolved crimes of New York millionaire Robert Durst", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The new docu-series mixes \"True Detective\" and \"Serial\" in this true story of a man connected to three murders", "title": "\u201cThe Jinx\u201d: HBO investigates the unsolved crimes of New York millionaire Robert Durst", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/08/the_jinx_hbo_investigates_the_unsolved_crimes_of_new_york_millionaire_robert_durst/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/the_jinx.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new docu-series mixes \"True Detective\" and \"Serial\" in this true story of a man connected to three murders", "title": "\u201cThe Jinx\u201d: HBO investigates the unsolved crimes of New York millionaire Robert Durst", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/the_jinx.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, andrew jarecki, Editor's Picks, HBO, robert durst, Serial, the jinx, True crime, true detective, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2ce\"", "article_summary": "Is Robert Durst jinxed?\nTopics: andrew jarecki, Editor's Picks, HBO, robert durst, Serial, the jinx, True crime, true detective, TV, Entertainment NewsThe first episode of \u201cThe Jinx\u201d starts with the discovery of a gruesomely dismembered body off the coast of Galveston, Texas.\nAnd the man, whose name is Robert Durst, insists he has done nothing wrong.\nToday, Durst walks free, albeit with some limitations on his movement.\nThe man walks into a Wegman\u2019s in Pennsylvania and tries to steal a hoagie, despite having more than $500 in his pocket and $38,000 in the car."}
