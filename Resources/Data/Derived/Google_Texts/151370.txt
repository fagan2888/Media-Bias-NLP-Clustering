Despite the increase in the penalty for not purchasing health insurance, nearly three in four uninsured consumers who used TurboTax filed an exemption in January.

The passage of the Affordable Care Act requires that all consumers purchase health insurance or face a penalty of either $325 or 2% of their household income, whichever was greater in 2015. The data from TurboTax, the San Diego-based tax preparation software company, revealed that 70% of uninsured or partially uninsured TurboTax users claimed an exemption from the tax penalty through January 31. This figure is “in line with last year’s overall tax season data," said Debra Hammer, TurboTax’s ACA spokesperson. The two most common reasons were the lack of affordability through their employer or geographic region.

Consumers who faced financial difficulties qualify for the health care exemption and do not have to pay the tax penalty, including people with extremely low income where filing a federal tax return is not required, the lowest-priced coverage available either through a marketplace or job-based plan would cost more than 8.05% of their household income or hardships such as being evicted or facing foreclosure, filing for bankruptcy or receiving a shut-off notice from a utility company.

The data from TurboTax are “consistent with what we see among health insurance shoppers who don’t qualify for Obamacare subsidies,” said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealth.com, a health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif.

The cost of health insurance has risen across the board for consumers. Between 2013, the year before the ACA mandates came into effect and 2015, the average monthly health insurance premiums for an unsubsidized, single adult increased by 45% or from $197 to $286, he said.
