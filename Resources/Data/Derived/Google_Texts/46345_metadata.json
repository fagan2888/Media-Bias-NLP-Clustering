One of those famous people was Jim Carrey, who came out to help introduce some of the best Oscar nominated animation films we\u2019ve seen over the years.\n\nWhile out on stage though, Carrey took his time to point out Bruce Dern and mimic his performance in Nebraska. Dern is at the Oscars for that performance in Nebraska, and for all his hard work he got to see Carrey imitate him on stage in front of millions of people.\n\nIt\u2019s not everyday that Jim Carrey makes fun of you and it\u2019s something that not many people will be able to say has happened to them. Dern doesn\u2019t look like he has an Ace Ventura poster hanging in his room, but Carrey singled him out and that in itself is an honor.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "FanSided", "twitter": {"domain": "http://fansided.com", "description": "The Oscars are tonight which means that we're going to see all the famous people in Hollywood come out to celebrate one another.
