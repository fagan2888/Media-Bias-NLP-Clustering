During that time, I\u2019ve seen the media misinform the public more times than I can count.\n\nIn the past this was often done through ignorance, or to line someone\u2019s pockets. These days, however, misinformation is more likely to arise from those with a political ax to grind.\n\nSuch is the case with the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.\n\nWhich leads us to this week\u2019s question.\n\nI\u2019ll be signing up for Medicare very soon. Do you know if Medicare will continue to pay for cataract surgery that is recommended by an eye doctor in 2014 and beyond? I heard something about Obama changing this as part of his Obamacare program. Thank you. \u2014 Miki\n\nYou certainly can\u2019t blame Miki for asking this question. I did a Web search and came up with several sources that would make any reader concerned.\n\nExample: From an editor\u2019s note at Money Morning:\n\nHip replacements, knee replacements, and cataract surgery will be especially hard to get from Medicare in the months ahead \u2026 Which is why you should get some of those procedures done NOW if you can. As President Obama once said to an elderly woman at a town hall meeting: \u201cMaybe you\u2019d be better off not having the surgery and taking a painkiller instead.\u201d\n\nThis comment, especially the last sentence, is obviously ridiculous. But like many falsehoods spread online, there\u2019s a kernel of truth behind it.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act will reduce payments to doctors and hospitals for the care of Medicare patients. For some who hate the law, this is proof that Medicare patients will soon be getting worse care, or be unable to get some procedures. After all, the logic goes, if you\u2019re trying to treat the same number of people with less money, the result has to be seniors receiving fewer services.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to look far to find someone advancing this argument. According to MediaMatters.org, former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey said this on Fox News a few weeks ago:\n\nThis law [the Affordable Care Act], as written, is designed to vastly expand Medicaid and pay for it by eviscerating Medicare, taking $700 billion out of Medicare and moving it over to fund this expansion of this entitlement. It\u2019s like robbing Grandma to spread the wealth.\n\nMcCaughey is one of many arguing that a decline in Medicare reimbursement will result in procedures being eliminated, care being rationed, and health care providers, including hospitals, refusing to take Medicare patients at all.\n\nBut that\u2019s likely a gross exaggeration. From FactCheck.org:\n\nAs we have written many times, the law does not slash the current Medicare budget by $500 billion. Rather, that\u2019s a $500 billion reduction in the future growth of Medicare over 10 years, or about a 7 percent reduction in growth over the decade. In other words, Medicare spending would continue to rise, just not as much. The law stipulates that guaranteed Medicare benefits won\u2019t be reduced, and it adds some new benefits, such as improved coverage for pharmaceuticals.\n\nIn summary, while Miki\u2019s concern is understandable, it\u2019s unfounded. If she needs it, she\u2019ll be able to get cataract surgery under Medicare.\n\nShe can read more about the Affordable Care Act and Medicare at this page of Medicare.gov. She might also like to read \u201cWill Obamacare Affect Medicare? Myths and Facts\u201d from U.S. News & World Report.\n\nBecause of the sheer volume of misinformation out there about the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s easy for people like Miki to become confused. So let\u2019s take a step back and see exactly what this law is, and what it isn\u2019t.\n\nWhat the Affordable Care Act is\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is a law designed to make health insurance more available and affordable.\n\nIt attempts to accomplish this in five ways:\n\nIt expands the Medicaid program so more low-income Americans are covered.\n\nIt requires insurance companies to cover those with pre-existing conditions, thus allowing more Americans to buy health insurance.\n\nIt establishes online marketplaces to promote competition among private insurance companies, hopefully leading to lower prices. (The marketplaces are where people who don\u2019t get affordable insurance through their workplace can buy insurance on their own.)\n\nIt establishes minimum requirements for health insurance.\n\nIt requires many of the uninsured to get coverage by using both carrot and stick. The carrot is income-based subsidies for those who buy insurance on the marketplaces. The stick is penalties for those who refuse to buy insurance.\n\nWhat the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is not a government-run health care plan. By the way, Medicare, which has had relatively few complaints, is a government-run health care plan.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act does not provide government health insurance. The health insurance offered on health care exchanges is offered by private companies.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t ration health care, establish \u201cdeath panels,\u201d or prevent seniors or anyone else from getting necessary medical procedures.\n\nThe law\u2019s not simple, and it\u2019s not perfect. Whether it will accomplish its objective \u2014 to bring more Americans affordable health care \u2014 has yet to be seen. So both scrutiny and criticism of this complex law, as well as its execution, are justified.\n\nWhat\u2019s not justified is frightening senior citizens, or anyone else, with lies designed to do nothing more than advance a political agenda.\n\nGot a money-related question you\u2019d like answered?\n\nYou can ask a question simply by hitting \u201creply\u201d to our email newsletter.
