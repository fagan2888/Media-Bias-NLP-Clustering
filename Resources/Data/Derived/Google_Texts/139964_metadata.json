His aide, Rick Shaftan, is on the left.\n\nUPDATED | An aide to Republican senate candidate Steve Lonegan said he regretted a racy, expletive-laden interview he gave to political blog Talking Points Memo Friday.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be talking anymore,\u201d Rick Shaftan, a chief aide to Mr. Lonegan, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal Friday evening.\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t mouth off like that. It\u2019s not representative of Lonegan, it\u2019s representative of Rick Shaftan,\u201d he said about his remarks.\n\nMr. Lonegan, the former mayor of Bogota, N.J. and a conservative, is running against Democrat Cory Booker in a race for New Jersey\u2019s open U.S. Senate seat Wednesday. The battle has become especially heated in recent days.\n\nIn the article posted Friday, Mr. Shaftan referenced tweets exchanged between Mr. Booker and an Oregon exotic dancer, Lynsie Lee. Mr. Shaftan alleged that Mr. Booker could be gay because his tweets supposedly didn\u2019t reflect what a straight man would say to a stripper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like like there was no sexual interest at all. I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Shaftan said.\n\nMr. Shaftan didn\u2019t say whether he realized if the interview was on or off the record, but said it was \u201cnot the right thing to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it hurts Steve, I regret it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s representative of my crude self, not Steve. It\u2019s how I talk, good or bad.\u201d\n\nOn Friday evening, Mr. Lonegan campaign released a statement saying Mr. Shaftan had been fired.\n\n\u201cMr. Shaftan\u2019s comments are not reflective of my views or that of my campaign,\u201d the candidate said. \u201cHis comments are distasteful and offensive, and his contract as a vendor for my campaign will be terminated immediately.\u201d\n\nCorrections & Amplifications: An earlier version of this story said that Mr. Lonegan was making an implication about Mr. Booker\u2019s sexual orientation. It has been revised to say that Mr. Shaftan was making the implication.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "An aide to Republican senate candidate Steve Lonegan said he regretted a racy, expletive-laden interview he gave to political blog Talking Points Memo Friday.
