The training is being funded through a $173,870 state grant.\n\nA series of 10 information sessions about the program will be held over the next three months, beginning Wednesday. Some classes will begin in January, and others will start in February and March.\n\nForsyth Tech said 138 out of 154 students completed the back-to-work training during the 2012-13 school year.\n\nThe 2012-13 grant period was limited to Forsyth and Stokes residents who had exhausted their unemployment benefits.\n\nThe 2013-14 grant provides funding to any North Carolina resident who is unemployed, underemployed or meets income guidelines.\n\nThe new grant period puts a special focus on unemployed military veterans and members of the N.C. National Guard.\n\nThe college said additional courses and training are available to those individuals for such positions as emergency medical technicians, firefighters and pharmacy assistants.\n\nAlso included in the overall training are employability skills testing, academic advising, counseling and career coaching. Participants can earn industry-recognized third-party credentials.\n\nThere has been significant demand among Triad hospitals and physician practices for electronic health-records specialists as health care groups are changing from paper to electronic records to meet requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBusiness-specific training programs at Triad and Northwest North Carolina community colleges are projected to grow as they train the airplane mechanics, welders and machinists that the Triad needs to bolster its advanced manufacturing cluster.\n\nSeveral prominent Triad manufacturers, including Caterpillar Inc., Deere Hitachi Construction Machinery Corp. and Timco Aerosystems, have expressed consistent need for welders as part of expanding production.\n\nFor example, the American Welding Society said the welding industry is facing a shortage of skilled workers in the country and expects a need for more than 238,000 new and replacement welders by 2019.\n\nThe average age of a welder is 55, according to Monica Pfarr, the society\u2019s corporate director of workforce development.\n\nFor more information about the sessions, call 336-734-7430, 336-593-5402, ext. 1101, or go to http://www.forsythtech.edu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FORSYTH COUNTY, N.C. -- Forsyth Technical Community College is launching its second roll-out of a job-training initiative aimed at connecting unemployed or underemployed residents with unfilled skilled jobs in the Triad.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "myfox8.com", "description": "FORSYTH COUNTY, N.C. \u2014 Forsyth Technical Community College is launching its second roll-out of a job-training initiative aimed at connecting unemployed or underemployed residents with unfille\u2026", "title": "Forsyth Tech to offer free job-training program", "url": "http://myfox8.com/2013/12/02/forsyth-tech-to-offer-free-job-training-program/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/529bd5eee6a00-preview-300.jpg", "height": 232}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://localtvwghp.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/529bd5eee6a00-preview-300.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@myfox8", "card": "photo", "creator": "@myfox8"}, "keywords": "news,", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Weather, Sports and more from WGHP Fox 8 Television", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=576468704", "fb": {"pages": 66055982622}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "myfox8.com", "google-site-verification": "Yn8rglGvxxL_bChOFSZTPKslhj-7-DDnVf-rpVixhQs", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news", "published_time": "2013-12-02T12:13:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-02T12:13:58+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox8news"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://myfox8.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/d6825caa4f715bb372290d2344aae986?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde28f\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 Forsyth Tech to offer free job-training programFORSYTH COUNTY, N.C. \u2014 Forsyth Technical Community College is launching its second roll-out of a job-training initiative aimed at connecting unemployed or underemployed residents with unfilled skilled jobs in the Triad.\nThe back-to-work program provides free, short-term training for jobs that include electronic health-records specialists, electrical linemen, facility-maintenance technicians and welders.\nThe 2013-14 grant provides funding to any North Carolina resident who is unemployed, underemployed or meets income guidelines.\nForsyth Tech said 138 out of 154 students completed the back-to-work training during the 2012-13 school year.\nA series of 10 information sessions about the program will be held over the next three months, beginning Wednesday."}
