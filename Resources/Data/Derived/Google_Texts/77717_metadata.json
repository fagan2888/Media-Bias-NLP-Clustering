The poll showed that the number of Americans who want his policies to succeed dropped 12 points since last year to 58 percent.\n\nMany more Americans want programs like Obamacare to fail, the poll found.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a solid majority but nowhere near the 70% last January who wanted Obama\u2019s presidency to be a success. One-third of all Americans, and three-quarters of all Republicans we questioned, say they hope Obama\u2019s policies will fail,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.\n\nObama seems aware that his approval rating and voter fears over Obamacare are carrying over to Congressional Democrats. On Friday, he spoke to House Democrats during a three-day retreat, trying to allay fears that the botched Obamacare rollout could hurt them in upcoming elections.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has seen his approval ratings level off from lows last year, but polls show that many Americans remain skeptical of Obamacare, and a growing", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "President Obama has seen his approval ratings level off from lows last year, but polls show that many Americans remain skeptical of Obamacare, and a growing", "title": "Obama Approval Rating: Obamacare Support Falling Apart, Democrats Worried", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1135807/obama-approval-rating-obamacare-support-falling-apart-democrats-worried/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-Approval-Rating1.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-16T10:36:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-16T11:01:57+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-Approval-Rating1.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-02-16T10:36:07+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "obamacare,obama,obama approval rating,obamacare approval,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Obama-Approval-Rating1.jpg", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Obama has seen his approval ratings level off from lows last year, but polls show that many Americans remain skeptical of Obamacare, and a growing"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf920\"", "article_summary": "Obama seems aware that his approval rating and voter fears over Obamacare are carrying over to Congressional Democrats.\nBut at the same time, voters were increasingly losing confidence in Obama\u2019s policies.\nOne-third of all Americans, and three-quarters of all Republicans we questioned, say they hope Obama\u2019s policies will fail,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.\nOn Friday, he spoke to House Democrats during a three-day retreat, trying to allay fears that the botched Obamacare rollout could hurt them in upcoming elections.\nMany more Americans want programs like Obamacare to fail, the poll found."}
