With deep skills in market positioning, media relations and branding, public relations experts are powerful agents to help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to groups that matter to them.\n\nI have a lot of experience in this industry and know most public relations professionals honestly put a clients best foot forward with clutter-free clarity in a gauzy, garbled world.\n\n\"PR\" is a behemoth in the service sector, generating around $5 billion a year in fees to bend, shape, position and advance public attitudes about key issues of our time.\n\nThat is why I was interested in the recent survey hosted by the publication The Guardian, along with the Climate Investigations Center, a watchdog of climate deniers\u2019 disinformation campaigns, in their survey of the world's 25 largest public relations firms and their attitudes about climate change.\n\nThe survey is designed in part to help determine whether top communications agencies would go beyond informational \u201cspin\u201d and actually propagate disinformation as professional deniers of Climate Change.\n\nOnly 10 of the 25 largest agencies responded to the survey, including Shandwick, Burson Marsteller, Ogilvy Public Relations and a few brave others.\n\nThat is a troubling signal that the PR industry knows climate deniers have a lot of money to spend and that they would consider helping them spend it.\n\nAgencies won\u2019t alienate prospective clients by answering questions that cast doubt on their loyalty to their clients. And besides, the industry knows everyone deserves his or her day in court.\n\nThe danger is that a small number of communications experts are spin-doctors that would intentionally confuse the public with half-truths, deflections or calculated stonewalling of the facts in the name of their clients (and their own ) avarice or power.\n\nBut professional message makers are smart people. Most are perfectly aware that the United Nation\u2019s latest report states the scientific debate about human-caused climate change is effectively over; that, in its 5th iteration, there is at least a 95% certainty of accuracy of the research.\n\nPublic relations firms need to be wary of the so-called research being cooked up by the industrial brands that stand to lose when the public has the real facts on climate. The \u201cdenier\u201d industry is small but packs a wallop with outsized budgets at its fingertips, for use as an obfuscator of facts, a reviser of history and rejector of scientific conclusions.\n\nThe way large communications firms choose to manage established truths on climate against the shallow claims of large carbon emitters will have long-term implications for communications ethics. Denial of vetted climate science is fast becoming the industrial equivalent to Big Tobacco denials of cancer-causing agents in their products.\n\nCommunications firms of integrity don't want to be tarred by such a brush.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Can PR firms avoid the pitfalls of climate pseudo-science?", "title": "Climate change and Public Relations", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/climate-change-and-public-relations/270818281/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Can PR firms avoid the pitfalls of climate pseudo-science?", "title": "Climate change and Public Relations", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/climate-change-and-public-relations/270818281/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Can PR firms avoid the pitfalls of climate pseudo-science?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd971a\"", "article_summary": "The \"public relations\" industry helps many of the world\u2019s top brands respectfully communicate their positions, products and points-of-view.\nThat is why I was interested in the recent survey hosted by the publication The Guardian, along with the Climate Investigations Center, a watchdog of climate deniers\u2019 disinformation campaigns, in their survey of the world's 25 largest public relations firms and their attitudes about climate change.\nPublic relations firms need to be wary of the so-called research being cooked up by the industrial brands that stand to lose when the public has the real facts on climate.\nWith deep skills in market positioning, media relations and branding, public relations experts are powerful agents to help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to groups that matter to them.\nOnly 10 of the 25 largest agencies responded to the survey, including Shandwick, Burson Marsteller, Ogilvy Public Relations and a few brave others."}
