Tribes, Goldmark noted, are rightfully at the forefront of this debate.\n\n\u201cTribal leaders bring unique perspective and concern about threats to our treasured landscapes,\u201d Goldmark said in the statement issued jointly with the 10 tribes. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to join them in this important message about the growth of oil train traffic in our state and the threat it poses to public safety, environmental sustainability, and our quality of life.\u201d\n\nSwinomish Tribe Chairman Brian Cladoosby said it was time to move away from the Northwest\u2019s \u201cpollution-based economy\u201d in general and oil trains in particular.\n\n\u201cWe are the first peoples of this great region, and it is our responsibility to ensure that our ancestral fishing, hunting and gathering grounds are not reduced to a glorified highway for industry,\u201d said Cladoosby, who is also president of the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), in the statement posted at the website of the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. \u201cOur great teacher, Billy Frank, Jr., taught us that we are the voices of the Salish Sea and salmon, and we must speak to protect them. If we cannot restore the health of the region from past and present pollution, how can we possibly think we can restore and pay for the impact of this new and unknown resource?\u201d\n\nBesides Cladoosby, Goldmark and Quinault Nation President Fawn Sharp, the statement was signed by Lummi Nation Chairman Tim Ballew II; Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation Jim Boyd; Cowlitz Indian Tribe Chairman William B.
