Lindsey Graham predicted Thursday that the GOP will lose the 2016 presidential election unless they win over Hispanic voters by supporting a \u201clong, hard path to citizenship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were president of the United States, I would veto any bill that did not have a pathway to citizenship,\u201d the South Carolina Republican told USA Today. \u201cYou would have a long, hard path to citizenship \u2026 but I want to create that path because I don\u2019t like the idea of millions of people living in America for the rest of their lives being the hired help. That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham argued that his party risks losing the presidency with its current hard line on immigration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll lose,\u201d he told USA Today. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve got a big hole we\u2019ve dug with Hispanics. We\u2019ve gone from 44 percent of the Hispanic vote (in the 2004 presidential election) to 27 percent (in 2012). You\u2019ll never convince me \u2026 it\u2019s not because of the immigration debate.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham also lashed out at Republicans who believe securing the border is the first priority.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not practical,\u201d he said. \u201cNo Democratic Congress is going to give the Republican Party everything we want on border security until you tell them what happens to the 11 million.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham said he was \u201c98.6 percent sure\u201d he would seek the presidency next year and is expected to deliver a formal announcement in the coming weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Likely Republican presidential candidate Sen.
