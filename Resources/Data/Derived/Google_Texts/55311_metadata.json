Half the town of Pierson is sprawled across the outfield grass of a Little League ballpark, eating pork sandwiches and cupcakes as a country band plays atop a flatbed crowded with hay bales. As the sun begins to dip into the surrounding cornfields, Ted Cruz climbs onto the stage to make his pitch for the presidency.\n\nThe centerpiece of Cruz\u2019s stump speech these days is a denunciation of what the Texas Republican calls the \u201cWashington cartel.\u201d This is the Senator\u2019s term for the alliance of powerful interests and pliable politicians who, he says, conspire to control the country at the expense of the people. K Street lobbyists are a big part of Cruz\u2019s cartel. So are big corporations, career politicians, the liberal media and the leaders of both parties. The newest members are the apostates on the Supreme Court, whose back-to-back rulings on Obamacare and same-sex marriage Cruz condemned at each stop on his most recent two-day swing through Iowa.\n\n\n\nCruz is known as a bomb thrower, and his most trip to Iowa illustrated why. He ripped rivals for the 2016 nomination for feigning outrage while privately \u201cpopping champagne\u201d at the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThey stand for nothing!\u201d he spat. He whacked party leaders for supporting illegal \u201camnesty.\u201d He called for a constitutional amendment that would force Supreme Court Justices to stand in elections. He even slammed Chief Justice John Roberts, a longtime friend from conservative legal circles.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not calling balls and strikes,\u201d Cruz tells TIME, invoking the umpire metaphor that Roberts deployed at his confirmation hearings to describe the role of a Justice. \u201cYou\u2019ve joined a team.\u201d\n\nThe important thing to understand about Cruz is that nothing he says is by accident. For all his florid rhetoric, he is as disciplined a speaker as any in the presidential field. His stump speech \u2014 delivered without notes or teleprompters \u2014 is carefully honed, with the same canned jokes at each stop, the same pauses for emphasis, the same cadences and delivery. The conservative crowds in this heavily evangelical swath of Iowa eagerly gobbled the red meat Cruz tossed, including jabs at \u201cliberal intolerance\u201d and warnings of the coming \u201cvicious assault on religious liberty.\u201d\n\nBut in some ways the crucial part of the routine is a more subtle argument, one aimed at voters around the country who remain skeptical that a candidate like Cruz has a real shot at winning the presidency. This, he explains, is a lie perpetrated by the cartel.\n\n\u201cThe game of the Washington cartel,\u201d Cruz tells crowds, \u201cis to convince conservatives you can\u2019t win.\u201d\n\nTo prove otherwise, Cruz points to money. \u201cWe launched the campaign on March 23,\u201d Cruz tells about 60 people in a drab community center in Sheldon, Iowa, on Friday. \u201cWe set a goal of raising $1 million in a week. Frankly, I thought that was a pretty audacious goal.\u201d He paused for emphasis. \u201cWe raised $1m in one day.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the week, Cruz adds, his campaign had raked in more than $4 million \u2014 \u201cmore money than any Republican [campaign] has raised in the opening week in modern history.\u201d Including Establishment types like Mitt Romney and John McCain.\n\nCandidates rarely get into granular fundraising details on the stump. But these stats are not just a point of pride (or a product of insecurity). They are central to Cruz\u2019s case that a true conservative can harness grassroots energy to beat the cartel. The cartel is supposed to control the party\u2019s purse strings, Cruz says \u2014 and yet here he is, a Tea Partyer despised by the GOP establishment, raking in serious dollars.\n\nCruz has collected more than $40 million since announcing his campaign, with most of that coming from a constellation of super PACs backing his bid. That\u2019s far less than a \u201ccartel\u201d candidate like Jeb Bush, who is soon expected to report raising in the neighborhood of $100 million so far. But it\u2019s enough to put him snugly in the next tier, along with candidates like Scott Walker and Marco Rubio, on upcoming fundraising reports.\n\nMore importantly, the tally underlines Cruz\u2019s ability to compete financially, which most movement conservatives cannot. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen a grassroots conservative with serious fundraising ability since 1980,\u201d Cruz told a small group of voters in the Dutch Bakery in Orange City, whose specialty almond patties retail for $1.50. Cruz\u2019s stump speech builds to this argument: that he is the rare true believer with the fundraising firepower to withstand a long and grueling primary. The campaign\u2019s actions bear out this strategy. Cruz has trekked to places like Massachusetts and staffed up in states like Michigan, Nevada and North Carolina. He is trying to build a national infrastructure that can capitalize on early momentum.\n\nAn early consequence of this long view is that Cruz has spent less time in Iowa so far than expected. He has just a skeleton staff here, led by conservative activist and former pastor Bryan English. Cruz is actually polling lower by some measures in the first-in-the-nation Hawkeye State, an evangelical stronghold well suited to his style, than he is nationwide.\n\nCruz promises crowds that he\u2019ll be spending \u201ca lot of time in the great state of Iowa.\u201d In Orange City on Friday, he gamely submitted to the retail ritual the caucuses require. He toured a store filled with Dutch-style wooden shoes, glad-handed retirees and knelt to take photos with children. \u201cHe stands up and fights,\u201d says retiree Patricia Boonstra, after taking a picture with Cruz on her iPad. On Saturday, the candidate delivered a sermon-style speech, titled \u201cBelieve Again,\u201d on the campus of Drake University in Des Moines.\n\nSteve King, the conservative congressman who represents northwest Iowa, tells TIME that Cruz has the chops to win the caucuses. \u201cHe\u2019s a natural-born, full-spectrum conservative,\u201d King says. \u201cThe voters are starting to follow him.\u201d\n\nCruz has an uphill climb to win the nomination. He\u2019s polling around 6% nationally over the past month, behind not only Bush, Walker and Rubio but also former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, the winner of the 2008 Iowa caucuses, and fellow freshman Senator Rand Paul, who is hoping to build on his father\u2019s robust network in Iowa and elsewhere. It\u2019s not only the Washington cartel that dislikes Cruz. Many of the party\u2019s moderate voters are put off by his slashing style.\n\nBut the Texan draws optimism from the success of two candidates who were also written off in the early going. One is Barack Obama, who toppled Hillary Clinton in 2008 with a guerrilla campaign Cruz speaks of with awe. (Cruz admired Obama\u2019s battle plan so much he bought staffers a copy of the now President\u2019s campaign manager David Plouffe\u2019s memoir.) The other is Ronald Reagan. \u201cI think 2016,\u201d he says, \u201cis going to be an election like 1980.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas Senator Ted Cruz's plan in Iowa is to show that a conservative can win the presidential election", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "He's making the case while meeting with Iowa voters.", "title": "Ted Cruz Tries to Prove a Conservative Can Win", "url": "http://time.com/3939274/ted-cruz-iowa-conservative/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/ted-cruz-faith-freedom.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/ted-cruz-faith-freedom.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594"}, "description": "He's making the case while meeting with Iowa voters.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ted Cruz Tries to Prove a Conservative Can Win"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "iowa, 2016 election, ted cruz, ted cruz conservative", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iowa, 2016 election, Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz conservative"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd48\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe game of the Washington cartel,\u201d Cruz tells crowds, \u201cis to convince conservatives you can\u2019t win.\u201dTo prove otherwise, Cruz points to money.\nSteve King, the conservative congressman who represents northwest Iowa, tells TIME that Cruz has the chops to win the caucuses.\nOne is Barack Obama, who toppled Hillary Clinton in 2008 with a guerrilla campaign Cruz speaks of with awe.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not calling balls and strikes,\u201d Cruz tells TIME, invoking the umpire metaphor that Roberts deployed at his confirmation hearings to describe the role of a Justice.\nCruz\u2019s stump speech builds to this argument: that he is the rare true believer with the fundraising firepower to withstand a long and grueling primary."}
