But the insurance department rejected the proposal and asked the company to resubmit its plan using different calculations.\n\nThe result: An average premium decrease of 0.1 percent for Anthem customers.\n\nThe actual change will vary by plan. People who bought catastrophic policies -- which are limited to people under 30 or those whose old plans were discontinued -- will see a 15.47 percent rate decrease.\n\nThe highest approved increase was for people with one high-level gold plan, who will see their premiums rise by 4.23 percent.\n\nThe new rates cover plans sold through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT, as well as those sold outside the exchange.\n\nAnthem\u2019s rate proposal was the most high-profile of those filed by insurance carriers for next year. It was the subject of a public hearing in June and drew nearly 150 written comments from customers who urged the department to reject the request.\n\nIn rejecting Anthem\u2019s initial proposal, Insurance Department Actuary Paul Lombardo determined that the company should reduce or remove several factors used in calculating premiums, including the estimate of how much the cost of covering medical services will rise. He also concluded that insurers will be eligible for more federal aid in the case of large medical claims than companies assumed when calculating their rates. Lombardo provided new guidelines for Anthem to use in recalculating its rates.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Anthem said it has \u201cdemonstrated a strong commitment\u201d to working with the insurance department and Access Health to bring coverage to more state residents.\n\n\u201cAnthem has proudly served our members for more than 75 years and we look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with our members, the [insurance department], and others to provide access to quality health care coverage and plans in Connecticut,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe insurance department is allowing ConnectiCare to raise its rates by an average of 3.1 percent next year, a significant decrease from the company\u2019s initial proposal. HealthyCT received approval to lower its rates by 8.5 percent -- down slightly from decrease the company initially proposed.\n\nThe insurance regulator also rejected UnitedHealthcare\u2019s initial proposal for 2015 individual-market rates and later approved lower premiums. The carrier does not currently offer plans in the individual market.\n\nHere's how plans sold on the exchange will be affected:\n\nPremium changes for Anthem's exchange plans These changes apply to plans sold through the exchange in 2015 Plan name Tier Costs would By\u2026 HMO Catastrophic Pathway X Enhanced 6600/0% Catastrophic Decrease 15.47 percent HMO Bronze Pathway X Enhanced 0% for H.S.A.
