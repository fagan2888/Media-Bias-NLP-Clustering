It’s time to start thinking about getting taxes done. And groups like the United Way and Care Community Center are working together to offer free tax preparation to those who are considered low income. But who qualifies as low income under the groups’ definition might be a bit surprising.

People making less than $58,000 qualify for getting tax experts to help out free of charge.

And new this year, the IRS has new procedures for handling the Affordable Care Act which could make filing taxes more difficult.

Experienced volunteers, trained by the IRS, will help sort through those issues and look to find the various credits and tax breaks available.

Here are just a few of the spots available to help out with free tax prep in Northwest Arkansas this year.
