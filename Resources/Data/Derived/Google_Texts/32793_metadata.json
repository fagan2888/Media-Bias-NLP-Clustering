Turkey has been rocked in recent weeks by allegations of graft that have beleaguered Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling party.\n\nThe issue at hand in the Saturday parliament session was a bill that would grant the government greater control in the appointment of judges and prosecutors, which, to be fair, is a useful tool to have when you're enmeshed in a corruption scandal. When a lawmaker tried to submit a petition calling the government bill \"anti-constitutional\" and was told he wouldn't be allowed to speak, things got a little bit crazy.\n\n\"One MP leapt on a table and launched a flying kick as others wrestled and punched at each other, with document folders, plastic water bottles and even an iPad flying through the air,\" according a Reuters reporter who was present. (There is some grainy accompanying footage.)\n\nWhile this was going on inside of parliament in Ankara, tens of thousands of Turkish citizens were protesting outside against Erdogan. Despite reshuffling his cabinet and firing several ministers, the nearly month-old corruption scandal continues to weaken Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003. In a bid to quell the protests, the government also submitted a bill this week that would tightened its control over the internet in Turkey.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A heated debate in Turkish parliament relating to a massive corruption scandal turned into a full-on melee today with punches, flying kicks, and thrown iPads.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "A heated debate in Turkish parliament relating to a massive corruption scandal turned into a full-on melee today with punches, flying kicks, and thrown iPads.", "title": "There Was a Massive Brawl in Turkish Parliament Today", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/01/11/turkey/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/global/2014/01/there-was-massive-brawl-turkish-parliament-today/356913/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A heated debate in Turkish parliament relating to a massive corruption scandal turned into a full-on melee today with punches, flying kicks, and thrown iPads.", "title": "There Was a Massive Brawl in Turkish Parliament Today", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/01/11/turkey/lead_large.jpg", "creator": "@allmychandler", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc0f\"", "article_summary": "A heated debate in Turkish parliament relating to a massive corruption scandal turned into a full-on melee today with punches, flying kicks, and thrown iPads.\nWhile this was going on inside of parliament in Ankara, tens of thousands of Turkish citizens were protesting outside against Erdogan.\nDespite reshuffling his cabinet and firing several ministers, the nearly month-old corruption scandal continues to weaken Erdogan, who has been in power since 2003.\nTurkey has been rocked in recent weeks by allegations of graft that have beleaguered Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling party.\nIn a bid to quell the protests, the government also submitted a bill this week that would tightened its control over the internet in Turkey."}
