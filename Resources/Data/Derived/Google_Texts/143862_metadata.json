He believes his mission is to steer Russia toward its past glory as a global superpower.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s why Americans who view this complicated world leader through a simplified lens do so at their peril, said Katusa. \u201cPutin is less of an ogre [than we think] but far more dangerous than politicians and the media would lead you to believe.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things most people don\u2019t know about Putin:\n\n1. Putin, 62, is divorced from his wife, Lyudmila Putin, 57, a linguist and former flight attendant whom he married in July 1983. \u201cWe practically never saw each other. To each his own life,\u201d Putin said when the couple announced their split in 2014.\n\nRelated: With Putin Still Missing, Things Get Weird in Russia\n\n2. Putin has two daughters, Maria (born in 1985) and Katerina (born in 1986), both rarely seen in public. They reportedly attended German-language secondary schools and St. Petersburg State University. Maria studied biology; Katerina, Asian studies. No official family portrait has ever been published. Putin\u2019s personal life gets almost no attention in Russia. \u201cAverage Russians believe in the privacy of their leader,\u201d said Katusa.\n\n3. Then again, many journalists in Putin\u2019s Russia have died horrible, excruciating deaths. \u201cA free press seems to mean pitifully little to [Putin]. You investigate? You report? You die, unavenged,\u201d wrote Peter Preston in The Guardian.\n\n4. Putin was born October 7, 1952, in St. Petersburg, or Leningrad as it was then known. \u201cI come from an ordinary family,\u201d Putin himself has written. \u201cI lived as an average, normal person.\u201d Putin\u2019s mother, Maria, was a factory worker and his father, Vladimir, wounded in World War II, worked as a laborer on train cars. Putin\u2019s older brother died as a child.\n\n5. In the years following the Siege of Leningrad, which nearly killed his mother, the family was forced to move to a vermin-infested communal building. Putin spent hours chasing rats with a stick in the stairwell. Four adults and two children squeezed into a single 200-square-foot room on the fifth floor with no hot water, bathtub or toilet.\n\nRelated: Putin and Kim Jong-un Declare Themselves Besties\n\n6. In the 1930s Putin\u2019s father was drafted into the Soviet Navy, serving on a submarine fleet and later, the front lines against Germany in World War II. Putin has said, \u201cMy father had been assigned to a demolitions battalion [and was] engaged in sabotage behind German lines.\u201d In one operation, Putin\u2019s father blew up a munitions depot before the group ran out of food. The Germans ultimately cornered them.\n\n7. \u201cThey had almost no chance of surviving,\u201d said Putin. \u201cOnly a few people, including my father, managed to break out. Then the chase was on.\u201d Putin said his father jumped into a swamp and \u201cbreathed through a hollow reed until the dogs passed by. Only four of 28 men survived.\u201d Returning to combat, Putin\u2019s father nearly had his legs blown off by a German grenade and was disabled the rest of his life.\n\n8. Putin was greatly influenced by his paternal grandfather, Spiridon Ivanovich Putin, a skilled cook who worked for Lenin, then Stalin. \u201c[Putin\u2019s grandfather] managed to outlive the tyrants he fed so well,\u201d writes Katusa in The Colder War. \u201cIt required sensitive political instincts and nimble balancing\u2026 He passed what he learned to a grandson eager to hear such things.\u201d Spiridon, reportedly trained by the NKVD (the KGB\u2019s predecessor), died when Putin was 13.\n\n9. Putin grew up a troublemaker. \u201cHe was a schoolyard punk prone to violence,\u201d says Katusa. A poor student, Putin was even hauled before a neighborhood \u201ccomrades\u2019 court\u201d for acts of petty delinquency.\n\nRelated: A Desperate Putin Makes a Private Sector Power Grab\n\n\n\n10. At age 12 he started boxing and moved on to judo, karate and sambo, a Soviet martial art. Sports gave Putin a focus and helped him compensate for his slight 5\u20197\u201d frame.\n\n11. But \u201ceven that was not enough for maintaining my status, so to speak, for very long,\u201d Putin has said. \u201cI realized I also needed to study well.\u201d When he \u2013 interested by now in the spying life \u2013 learned law school was a key entry path for the KGB, his life took a decisive turn.\n\n12. Putin enrolled at Leningrad State University in 1970, earning his law degree five years later. At age 22 he was recruited into the KGB \u2013 and for the next 16 years worked as a self-described \u201cspecialist in human relations.\u201d\n\n13. Fluent in German and able to pass for Nordic, Putin was posted to Dresden in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in 1985 and spent five years undercover. He was promoted several times. \u201cHe was expert at reading and manipulating people and was unfazed by violence,\u201d writes Katusa. \u201cThese were indispensable qualities for anyone out to make his way to the top of the Russian political pile.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin Risks It All on Korean Nukes and Cheap Vodka\n\n14. When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, Putin\u2019s undercover days were over and he returned to university. In his doctoral thesis he argued that Russia\u2019s economic success would ultimately depend on exploiting its energy resources. He entered politics and rose meteorically.\n\n15. In 1999 Boris Yeltsin selected Putin to be prime minister \u201cwith prospects.\u201d Putin himself has said, \u201cI thought, If I can do something to help save Russia from falling apart, this would be something to be proud of.\u201d He served two terms as president, returned to the prime minister role but still pulled the levers of power \u2014 and is now serving a third term as president despite protests in Moscow. He has said he might want a fourth term.\n\n16. Putin almost always acts militarily from calculation, not reaction. \u201cHe carefully weighs the costs and risks of acting against the likely benefit to the homeland\u2026 Nevertheless,\u201d warns Katusa ominously, \u201cit is best not to poke him in the eye.\u201d\n\n17. Putin reportedly likes The Beatles. His favorite Beatle is Paul McCartney \u2013 and his favorite Beatles tune is \u201cYesterday.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you think Russian President Vladimir Putin (who has apparently", "title": "Vladimir Putin: 17 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Russia\u2019s President", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/13/Vladimir-Putin-17-Things-You-Didn-t-Know-About-Russia-s-President", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-08-05T152804Z_1_LYNXMPEA740OE_RTROPTP_2_UKRAINE-CRISIS-USA-PUTIN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/13/Vladimir-Putin-17-Things-You-Didn-t-Know-About-Russia-s-President", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-08-05T152804Z_1_LYNXMPEA740OE_RTROPTP_2_UKRAINE-CRISIS-USA-PUTIN.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you think Russian President Vladimir Putin (who has apparently", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "To each his own life,\u201d Putin said when the couple announced their split in 2014.\nThen again, many journalists in Putin\u2019s Russia have died horrible, excruciating deaths.\nPutin, 62, is divorced from his wife, Lyudmila Putin, 57, a linguist and former flight attendant whom he married in July 1983.\nPutin was greatly influenced by his paternal grandfather, Spiridon Ivanovich Putin, a skilled cook who worked for Lenin, then Stalin.\nIn the 1930s Putin\u2019s father was drafted into the Soviet Navy, serving on a submarine fleet and later, the front lines against Germany in World War II."}
