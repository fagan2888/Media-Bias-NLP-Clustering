The most common sin against \u201cleadership\u201d that Obama commits, in Fournier\u2019s reckoning, is his refusal to pursue centrist-conservative policies that prioritize slashing entitlements in the name of debt reduction. But other issue areas often get woven into his \u201cObama must lead!\u201d one-note symphony, and with the president poised to deliver a big speech on how the U.S. will confront the Islamic State (ISIS) in Iraq and Syria, Fournier has figured out how Obama can lead.\n\nTo show true leadership, Fournier writes, Obama must indulge the \u201canger and fear\u201d of the American public and let them know he\u2019s ready to embark upon another expensive, unpopular military adventure in the Middle East:\n\nWe\u2019re angry and scared now. We want to fight. History suggests that we will rally behind the commander in chief in the immediate aftermath of tonight\u2019s address. But it wasn\u2019t that long ago\u2014a matter of weeks, really\u2014when \u201cwar-weary\u201d was the go-to adjective for \u201cAmericans.\u201d We will grow weary again, and Obama may need to draw on tonight\u2019s speech to remind people, \u201cThis is why we must fight.\u201d\n\nI honestly don\u2019t understand this. If the polls are to be believed, it\u2019s true that huge portions of the American public are both angry at ISIS and scared. And that is precisely what ISIS intended to achieve by committing horrific acts of violence on defenseless Americans and posting videos of the murders on YouTube. \u201cThe video [of James Foley\u2019s beheading], surely meant to sow fear and breed over-reaction, succeeded magnificently,\u201d Dave Weigel wrote for Slate. \u201cThe panic showing up in polls, in which the number of Americans favoring airstrikes in Iraq and Syria has surged, has been matched by a return of panic-first politics.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpanic-first\u201d instinct has left everyone convinced that ISIS presents an imminent threat to the United States, despite no real indication that this is the case. This sentiment has nevertheless been amplified by careless media coverage and seized upon by the newly invigorated hawks to agitate for more war.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He wants Obama to indulge public's \"anger and fear\" to justify another long Middle East slog.
