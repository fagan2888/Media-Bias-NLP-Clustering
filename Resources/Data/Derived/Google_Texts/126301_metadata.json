But investigators dispute that number and say the agency is turning a blind eye to its vulnerabilities.\n\n\u201cSSA should not downplay large-scale fraud; it must acknowledge that the threat of another massive scheme is real and that criminals will always look for the next vulnerability \u2014 poking and prodding until they find a weak spot in the system to attack.\u201d\n\nThe disability system has come under intense scrutiny following major fraud cases in New York City, Puerto Rico and West Virginia. The West Virginia case involved a Social Security administrative law judge who, congressional investigators say, conspired with a lawyer to approve hundreds of bogus cases.\n\nAs of this spring, Social Security still hadn\u2019t gone back to review that judge\u2019s cases to try to revoke bogus claims, members of Congress said.\n\nThe New York City case, meanwhile, involved retired police officers and firefighters who were coached on how to file bogus claims.\n\nIf the agency had an automated analysis tool in place, it could have caught up to 90 percent of the fraudulent claims from New York, West Virginia and Puerto Rico, said Rep. Sam Johnson, the Texas Republican who requested the inspector general\u2019s review.\n\n\u201cCrime pays in the disability world because Social Security has failed to stop fraud by taking such steps as modernizing its systems, its penalties or its rules on who can work in today\u2019s modern era of medicine and technology,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.\n\nIn a statement responding to the report, Social Security said it tries to take a zero-tolerance policy toward fraud.\n\n\u201cIt is regrettable that people will try to take advantage of Social Security programs; however, that is the reality. Thus, all Social Security employees receive comprehensive and extensive training on fraud detection,\u201d the agency said.\n\nThe agency also repeated the 1 percent fraud rate statistic, but the inspector general called that misleading.\n\nInvestigators said SSA is only counting the 1 percent of cases that were referred for prosecution for potential fraud in a 2006 sample. But in another 18 percent of cases from that sample, beneficiaries were overpaid or had their benefits stopped because they weren\u2019t eligible \u2014 each of which could be evidence of fraud.\n\nMembers of Congress have identified a number of changes that could help spot fraud, including letting judges look at online social media profiles of disability applicants.\n\nCurrently, the judges are banned from doing anything other than looking at the case file.\n\nIn the New York City case, some of the bogus applicants had posted pictures of themselves flying helicopters, sport fishing or riding a Jet Ski \u2014 all activities that investigators said were inconsistent with their disability claims. Those photos would have been available to see had adjudicators been allowed to scour the web.\n\nSocial Security\u2019s disability system is separate from the pensions program that provides payments to most seniors, which is known as the Old-Age & Survivors Insurance program.\n\nWhile the Old-Age program has been paying out more than it\u2019s been taking in from taxes over the last few years, it is considered solvent because of interest payments on its trust fund. The disability trust fund, however, is poised to go bankrupt by 2016, according to the latest estimates.\n\nIf Congress doesn\u2019t boost the disability trust fund, disability payments will be cut across the board.\n\nLawmakers said that precarious financing makes it all the more important that Social Security do a better job of rooting out fraud.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Social Security's disability payments systems are so old and dependent on handwritten records that it makes it difficult to weed out fraud, an inspector general concluded in a major report last week that said the agency doesn't appear to be taking the issue seriously.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Social Security\u2019s disability payments systems are so old and dependent on handwritten records that it makes it difficult to weed out fraud, an inspector general concluded in a major report last week that said the agency doesn\u2019t appear to be taking the issue seriously.", "title": "Social Security\u2019s outdated records systems invite disability fraud: IG report", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/14/social-securitys-outdated-records-systems-invite-d/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/14/social-security-admin.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/14/social-security-admin.jpg", "description": "Social Security's disability payments systems are so old and dependent on handwritten records that it makes it difficult to weed out fraud, an inspector general concluded in a major report last week t", "card": "summary", "title": "Social Security\u2019s outdated records systems invite disability fra"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Social Issues, Congress, Social Security Administration, New York City"}, "article_summary": "If Congress doesn\u2019t boost the disability trust fund, disability payments will be cut across the board.\nThe Social Security Administration regularly dismisses accusations of widespread fraud, saying the rate is less than 1 percent a year.\nIn a statement responding to the report, Social Security said it tries to take a zero-tolerance policy toward fraud.\n\u201cIt is regrettable that people will try to take advantage of Social Security programs; however, that is the reality.\nLawmakers said that precarious financing makes it all the more important that Social Security do a better job of rooting out fraud."}
