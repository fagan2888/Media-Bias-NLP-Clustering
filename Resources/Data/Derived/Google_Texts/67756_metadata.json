(WANE) Representative Todd Young is one of three candidates running for U.S. Senate representing Indiana. If elected, he said repealing Obamacare would be the first item on his agenda.\n\nYoung is originally from Indianapolis and currently lives in Bloomington with his wife and four young children.\n\n\u201cIn so many ways, I\u2019m a regular Hoosier who grew up with great parents who told me if I dream big, if I worked hard, I could do anything in life,\u201d Young said.\n\nAccording to Young, that motto led him to the U.S. Naval Academy and the Marine Corp. He served as an intelligence officer and was trained in counter-terrorism.\n\nYoung then served as representative for Indiana\u2019s 9th district.\n\n\u201cIt informs my work on a daily basis. We are in a time of war. It\u2019s an unconventional sort of war against terror, but I would agree we need more people who have worn the uniform, who understand what it means to come up with a genuine military strategy. This president has not put forward a winning strategy to help win that war on terror and keep Americans safe and secure. So, that\u2019s another area where I feel like I can continue that value over in the United States senate,\u201d Young said.\n\nYoung said during his time in the district, he\u2019s proud of his work with leading regulatory reform in the republican party, noting the REINS Act, which every republican presidential candidate is running on, his efforts to find ways to finance higher education, repeal a major provision of Obamacare, changing the welfare system in order to encourage churches and non-profit organizations to help the poor and vulnerable opposed to the government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019re a conservative, it\u2019s another thing to be able to actually fight and win in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Young said. \u201cI want to go to Washington and the U.S. Senate to actually get things done and not just talk a big game.\u201d\n\nIf elected, Young said the first item on the agenda would be to repeal Obamacare.\n\n\u201cEvery American deserves access to affordable healthcare, accessible healthcare and we need to make sure that we continue to make advancements to cure diseases and make sure that people stay healthier longer. It also impacts our economy and our economic growth,\u201d Young said. \u201cSo, jobs in the economy is the issue along with national security that I hear most from Hoosiers about and healthcare costs are just killing our employers and one of the reasons why we haven\u2019t seen more businesses started and expanding and more good paying jobs aren\u2019t being created. So, I want every Hoosier to have access to a quality education that turns into a good paying job that ultimately leads to a meaningful career in places like Fort Wayne, Indiana.\u201d\n\nYoung said if he could use one word to describe himself, it\u2019d be \u201cpatriot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love this country, I love what it stands for, I\u2019m proud of our history, I have been prepared to fight and if necessary, die, to ensure that America remains the greatest, the free-est, the most opportunity-filled country in the wolrd,\u201d Young said.\n\nYoung is running against Republican Representative Marlin Stutzman.
