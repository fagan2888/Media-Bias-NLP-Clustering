This forest of nanowire arrays is populated with microbial populations that produce enzymes known to selectively catalyze the reduction of carbon dioxide.\n\nRelated: What Tesla\u2019s Home Battery Means for Your Electric Bill\n\nThe nanowire array \u201cprotects the bacteria like Easter eggs buried in tall grass,\u201d the press release colorfully explains, enabling them to survive even in an environment like flue gas.\n\nThe Berkeley Lab project is one of several worldwide seeking to harness photosynthesis for renewable energy.\n\nScientists at the California Institute of Technology, for instance, have created a lab scale device for converting sunlight into fuel at a much greater efficiency than natural photosynthesis in plants, according to a post last month on the\n\nScience Behind Sustainability Solutions blog sponsored by Arizona State University in the Guardian.\n\nThe goal is to use artificial photosynthesis to produce methanol, a simple hydrocarbon that is already widely used in gasoline mixtures.\n\nRelated: Why You Won't Be Driving an Electric Car in 2040\n\nDespite the breakthroughs, the challenge remains to develop a process that is affordable and can operate on a commercial scale. One of the most efficient and stable catalysts for splitting water into its hydrogen and oxygen components, Guardian contributor Debbie Carlson notes, is platinum, one of the most costly elements on the planet.\n\nAnother research project, at the Solar Fuels Institute at Northwestern University, is developing a prototype to combine the processes of splitting water and carbon dioxide into their respective components, which current methods do separately.\n\nThese researchers hope to bring their technology to market within five years, Carlson reports.\n\nIf liquid fuel could be produced on a commercial scale within five to 10 years, the technology could pose a challenge for the nascent electric-vehicle industry.\n\nCaltech and Berkeley Labs collaborate on research in the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis (JCAP), an energy innovation hub established in 2010 and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nIn April, the DOE announced a $75 million renewal of funding for another five years.\n\n\u201cJCAP\u2019s work to produce fuels from sunlight and carbon dioxide holds the promise of a potentially revolutionary technology that would put America on the path to a low-carbon economy,\u201d Under Secretary for Science and Research Lynn Orr said in a statement.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com.\n\nRead more from OilPrice:\n\nWho Will Take The Energy Storage Crown?\n\nElectric Vehicles To Become Mainstream In Short Period Of Time\n\nForget The Noise: Oil Prices Won\u2019t Crash Again", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "U.S.", "title": "This Renewable Fuel Can Drive Electric Vehicles Out of Business", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/15/Renewable-Fuel-Can-Drive-Electric-Vehicles-Out-Business", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01222013_Electric_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/15/Renewable-Fuel-Can-Drive-Electric-Vehicles-Out-Business", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01222013_Electric_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "U.S. researchers are reporting breakthroughs in artificial photosynthesis that could result in a new source of renewable liquid fuels for cars, ships and planes.\nThe goal is to use artificial photosynthesis to produce methanol, a simple hydrocarbon that is already widely used in gasoline mixtures.\nThis forest of nanowire arrays is populated with microbial populations that produce enzymes known to selectively catalyze the reduction of carbon dioxide.\nElectric Vehicles To Become Mainstream In Short Period Of TimeForget The Noise: Oil Prices Won\u2019t Crash Again\nArtificial photosynthesis seeks to mimic the action of plants in capturing energy from the sun to produce biomass by breaking down water and combining it with carbon dioxide."}
