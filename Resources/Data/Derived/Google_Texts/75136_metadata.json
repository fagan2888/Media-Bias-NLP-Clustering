Martin E. Dempsey, told Congress on Wednesday.\n\nLater in the day, President Obama hosted about 90 House Democrats at the White House for what he had hoped would be a lengthy back-and-forth about the Iran deal, but the lawmakers ended up leaving after just 30 minutes because a series of votes were rescheduled on legislation dealing with highway aid and veterans\u2019 health.\n\nGeneral Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the nuclear deal did not prevent the United States from striking Iranian facilities if officials decide that Tehran is cheating on the agreement. But if it sticks to the terms of the pact, such a strike \u2014 with attendant retaliation \u2014 is far less likely, he said.\n\nIn his trademark to-the-point style, General Dempsey answered a barrage of questions from Republican senators that appeared intended to make him criticize the pact. The general \u2014 appearing alongside Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew \u2014 neither praised nor condemned the nuclear agreement.\n\nInstead, he gave an assessment of both the potential and the limitations of the pact. \u201cIf followed, the deal addresses one critical and the most dangerous point of friction with the Iranian regime,\u201d General Dempsey said. \u201cBut as I\u2019ve stated repeatedly, there are at least five other malign activities which give us and our regional partners concern,\u201d including the pursuit of ballistic missile technology, weapons trafficking, the use of surrogates and proxies, the use of naval mines, and undersea activity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhen Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi, accused General Dempsey of \u201cdamning\u201d the pact \u201cwith faint praise,\u201d the general was again brief.\n\n\u201cFirst, Senator, I would ask you not to characterize my statement as tepid, nor enthusiastic, but rather pragmatic,\u201d he said. \u201cRelieving the risk of a nuclear conflict with Iran diplomatically is superior than trying to do that militarily.\u201d\n\nThe three-hour hearing was the first chance that Senate Republicans who support a resolution of disapproval of the Iran pact have had to publicly question Mr. Obama\u2019s top military officials on the deal. When Mr. Kerry, who along with Mr. Moniz negotiated the agreement, spoke, the hearing at times got antagonistic.\n\nToward the end, Mr. Kerry and Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, got into a heated exchange over whether Mr. Kerry should apologize to families of American military forces who were killed in Iraq by Shiite forces using weaponry provided by Iran.\n\nMr. Cruz, a presidential candidate, misquoted Mr. Kerry, saying the secretary of state had apologized to those families. Mr. Kerry corrected him, and Mr. Cruz then pressed Mr. Kerry about why he had not apologized to them.\n\nAt the White House, the Democratic lawmakers were given Champagne and soft drinks and were briefly entertained by a piano player before filing into the East Room around 4:30 p.m. to hear the president give an intensive 30-minute seminar on the details of the Iran agreement. Several cabinet members were in the audience.\n\nThe president promised that he would explain the details of the agreement to everyone in the room for as long as anyone wished, and he said he would get more detailed answers from others if any were needed.\n\n\u201cHe is leaving no doubt that this is his top priority,\u201d said Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, except maybe during the Affordable Care Act debate in 2010.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s message, lawmakers said, was the same as he has given elsewhere: While not perfect, the deal is better than any alternative.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the abrupt end to the meeting, many in the room were persuaded, Ms. Schakowsky said.\n\n\u201cI feel very confident that we will have sufficient votes to sustain a veto,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150729160727, "twitter": {"description": "Gen.
