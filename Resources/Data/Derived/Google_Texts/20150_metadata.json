In the past, the tax was simply a giveaway, mostly to the hospitals.\n\nHowever, state Rep. Larry Metz, R-Yalaha, managed to get a bill through the Legislature several years ago that forced the hospitals and other recipients of the tax money to file claims for each individual treated.\n\nThe bill also gives voters the chance to abolish the district on November's ballot.\n\nHere are some observations by readers on how the taxing district and how they may vote:.\n\nI can't foresee any situation today where I will vote for taxing. Taxing authorities do not use or handle our money wisely.\n\nJean Kaminski\n\nTavares\n\nI am sick of seeing hospitals and hospital associations crow about all the good they do while earning three times what most professionals could ever hope to. Someone should hold them accountable.\n\nThe CEO of Baycare Health System in Florida earns $2.5 million a year, and million-dollar salaries are far too common, in these \"not for profit\" organizations.\n\nJerry Palmer\n\nWinter Park\n\nWhen I moved from Seminole County in 2003 to Lake County, I was shocked beyond belief at the existence of that taxing district. It should never have come into existence.\n\nNow, with Obamacare, Medicaid and all the other socialist taxation, it is beyond time for it to go away.\n\nWilliam Overbay\n\nHowey in the Hills\n\nFriday's article about the hospital tax is 100 percent on the money. It needs to go. The idea that the administrator can make \u2014 I didn't say earn \u2014 more than, $700,000 per year and still call the hospital \"nonprofit\" is an insult to the taxpayers.\n\nGene Smith\n\nTavares\n\nI'm not voting to tax myself any longer, now that I have some information about the hospitals' cash cow! The only conclusion I can come to is this \u2014 greed. When is enough money enough?\n\nEverybody but the hospitals are being taxed to death in Florida. What started out as a worthy cause has ballooned into something out of control.\n\nThere is no longer any justification for Leesburg Regional Medical Center and Florida Hospital Waterman getting tax money. The bottom line for me is this: If hospitals are exempt from paying taxes, then some of the major medical services they provide should be free, and they certainly shouldn't be making a profit.\n\nI applaud Rep. Metz for introducing legislation that actually benefits the people \u2014 he has earned my respect in this instance.\n\nLarry Turnbow\n\nEustis\n\nLritchie@tribune.com.
