U.S. school kids from pre-K through 12th grade, on average, take eight standardized tests every year. That\u2019s almost one test a month during the school year.\n\nIn a Facebook video yesterday, the president said teachers have told him the pressure to teach to those tests \u2014 quote \u2014 \u201ctakes the joy out of teaching and learning.\u201d\n\nHis administration has now released a testing action plan with new guidelines.\n\nFor more insight on that, I\u2019m joined by Kate Zernike of The New York Times.\n\nWelcome.\n\nKATE ZERNIKE, National Correspondent, The New York Times: Thank you.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, this is a pretty big statement from the president on this very contentious issue. Why \u2014 why is he coming out now?\n\nKATE ZERNIKE: Well, I think they wanted to get past the spring testing push last year, or this \u2014 or this year.\n\nBut I think, also, there was a report coming out from the Council of the Great City Schools, which is a coalition of about 70 urban school districts. And they have generally been pro-testing. But their superintendent set out to find out how many tests the kids are taking.\n\nAnd what they found, the report also came out yesterday \u2014 or Saturday \u2014 was that there are just are \u2014 that, as you said, there are, you know, eight tests a year. There\u2019s just so many \u2014 so many people are calling for so many different tests, that a lot of these tests are \u2014 they\u2019re not only onerous, but they\u2019re sort of pointless and purposeless. They\u2019re not really tied to what we want them to be tied to, to learning in the classroom.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, the president acknowledges maybe we have too \u2014 testing kids too much. He even acknowledges that his administration might be part of the problem.\n\nWhat is he proposing as a possible solution to that?\n\nKATE ZERNIKE: Well, I think the thing that is going to jump out at people is this \u2014 he wants a cap on the time spent on testing. So, no more than 2 percent of classroom time should be spent on testing.\n\nAnd that is a reduction from what the Council of the Great City Schools found. But they also are proposing things like not \u2014 they\u2019re saying no one \u2014 no teacher should be evaluated solely on a test, no child should be \u2014 no child\u2019s high school graduation or any cutoff should be attached solely to a test. So, that is a big deal.\n\nA lot of proponents of testing will say that the thing that got us in trouble, they wanted testing. The problem is, we started tying it to too many things. We started saying, teachers weren\u2019t going to get tenure if they didn\u2019t pass a test, or, if their kids didn\u2019t pass the test, school \u2014 kids wouldn\u2019t graduate from high school if they didn\u2019t pass the test.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, those advocates of testing say, OK, maybe a little bit of reform is useful, but don\u2019t throw the baby out with the bath water.\n\nKATE ZERNIKE: Absolutely.\n\nI mean, we have to remember that before \u2014 this has sort of been a 20-year approach, or a 15-year approach. Before this was happening, there was a lot of \u2014 a lot of kids, and particularly in urban schools, were not learning anything.\n\nAnd so \u2014 they\u2019re not learning anything may have been a little too harsh, but that there was no \u2014 there was no accountability, and we had no standards, and we weren\u2019t \u2014 they were just being passed from grade to grade. So, this was really an effort to make sure that we were \u2014 that we had some accountability.\n\nThis is a $600 billion industry, public schooling in America. It is reasonable to expect that we would want some accountability, but I think the problem is, we have just \u2014 as in many things, the pendulum has swung too far.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is obviously a huge, contentious issue across the country. A lot of parents and school districts have been in a real uproar over this testing.\n\nDo you think this effort by the president, this initiative, is going to put a \u2014 is going to satisfy the critics?\n\nKATE ZERNIKE: You know, I really don\u2019t think it is. I think a lot of people are already saying this is too \u2014 too little too late.\n\nYou know, the question really has been in suburban districts, where people felt like, our schools are fine. Why is there this push? We are doing everything fine. This is not our problem.\n\nThe opt-out movement that we have seen has largely been in suburban districts. We have \u2014 we have seen very few opt-outs in urban districts.\n\nSo, I think it\u2019s going to be \u2014 the other problem is going to be, they\u2019re saying, we want this 2 percent cap on testing, but then what kind of tests are we going to be allowed to use? There has always been a problem \u2014 schooling in this country is a very, very local tradition.\n\nAnd so is the \u2014 is the federal government going to way, well, you should use this test or you shouldn\u2019t use that test? That is the problem. It\u2019s going to be \u2014 we are going to see this again. People will call it a federal takeover.\n\nWILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Kate Zernike of The New York Times, thank you so much.\n\nKATE ZERNIKE: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama on Saturday called on states to cut back on standardized testing for U.S. school kids, who, on average, take eight of them every year, from pre-K through 12th grade every year.
