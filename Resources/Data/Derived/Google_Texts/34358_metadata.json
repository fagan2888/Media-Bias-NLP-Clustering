Despite recent distortions caused by bad weather, the same is true of the manufacturing industries, where the capacity utilization rate is approaching its long-term average of 80 percent.\n\nThe U.S. economy is underpinned by growing real incomes, increasing employment, record-low borrowing costs and an easing access to credit facilities as banks continue to open up their channels of consumer financing.\n\nBalanced policy mix\n\nAll these developments are taking place in the context of an appropriately supportive policy mix, where the tightening fiscal policy is offset by an expansionary credit stance.\n\n\n\n(Read more: Economy takes $50B winter weather hit: CNBC survey)\n\nThat policy configuration has allowed the U.S. to achieve a relatively fast and substantial fiscal consolidation in an environment of a growing economy. Indeed, this year's budget deficit is expected to come in at 3 percent of GDP and to decline 24 percent from the previous fiscal year \u2013 a feast that euro area austerity advocates can only dream about.\n\n\n\nThe Treasury's declining borrowing requirements are making it possible for the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) not only to safely scale back its monthly asset purchases, but also to maintain its highly accommodative policy stance to compensate for the falling public sector outlays.\n\n\n\nHere are some numbers to illustrate the point: in the course of December and January, the Fed's balance sheet expanded by a monthly average of only $22 billion \u2013 a huge drop from a monthly average of $98.8 billion in the previous two months.\n\n(Read more: US economy may be stuck in slow lane for long run)\n\n\n\nThe Fed did that without creating any adverse effects in bond and mortgage markets. Last Friday, for example, the yield on the benchmark ten-year Treasury note traded at 2.74 percent, compared with 2.84 percent in the early December of last year. Mortgage costs followed the same pattern.\n\nThe rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.32 percent last Friday, down from 4.41 percent a month ago and 4.46 percent in December.\n\n\n\nThis is encouraging, and we may soon begin to see a gradual shrinking of the Fed's $3.7 trillion balance sheet. The Fed will, however, maintain its easy credit stance as long as the inflation pressures are kept at bay by the prevailing slack in labor and product markets.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "While operating more than an entire percentage point below its potential growth rate, the U.S. economy still raised its business sector employment by nearly 2 million people over the last twelve months.", "author": "Dr. Michael Ivanovitch", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The U.S. economy up its employment by nearly 2 million people over the past year, despite operating at a percentage point below its growth rate.", "title": "Stop whining!
