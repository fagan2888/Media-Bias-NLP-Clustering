Between 50 percent and 75 percent of oncology drugs are being administered off-label, according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, whose guidelines and statements are considered to be standard consensus in oncology.\n\nImbruvica \u2014 an oral treatment first approved in November 2013 for mantle-cell lymphoma (MCL), which is a rare and aggressive type of immune system cancer that hits 3,900 people in the U.S. per year \u2014 was once in the mix, but is now expected to be moving away from off-label use, in light of its second FDA approval for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a more common type of blood cancer that hits 15,720 people in the U.S. per year.\n\nBetween its first FDA approval and this second approval on Feb. 12 of this year, an estimated 35 percent of Imbruvica\u2019s sales were for off-label usage in CLL treatment \u2014 and this was while the drug was in the early stages of clinical trials for CLL \u2014 according to Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas. Back in January, Karnauskas had anticipated Imbruvica\u2019s off-label sales to increase beyond 35 percent, on the heels of positive results from a late-stage CLL clinical trial.\n\nFor Imbruvica, off-label usage for CLL stemmed from initial belief that the first approval would have been for CLL, not the more rare MCL, and was further boosted by favorable CLL clinical trial results.\n\nThis is not always the case behind off-label oncology prescriptions. The driver often is practicality. Some cancers are especially rare, making it difficult for pharmaceutical companies to obtain enough subjects to perform the clinical trials necessary to gain FDA approval.\n\nDesperate patients are acutely aware that a potential treatment may never gain FDA approval, and in oncology, early access to a treatment can be life saving. Patients often are willing to test new regimens that may benefit them, the drugs are there \u2014 albeit for a different patient demographic, type of illness or dosage \u2014 and physicians are legally able to prescribe as they see fit. This creates an environment especially conducive to off-label usage.\n\n\u201cWhile there is good scientific rational and clinical evidence for efficacy and safety in many indications beyond the label, use will be dependent upon the conversation between the physician and patient,\u201d said Gregory Wade, an analyst with Wedbush Securities\u2019 San Francisco office. \u201cPhysicians who prescribe drugs off-label possess the training and knowledge to do so safely.\u201d\n\nEven so, the practice undermines FDA standards, which stress rigorous studies and evidence to ensure safety and efficacy for each specific situation. By bypassing a complete FDA review, there always remains the possibility of inefficacy or harm from off-label use, experts say.\n\nOff-label usage also poses potential benefits for pharmaceutical companies. Whether or not their drug is being clinically tested for the use for which it is being prescribed off-label, they benefit from the additional sales generated by a wider range of patients. Pharmaceutical companies whose drugs are not in clinical trials for additional uses stand to benefit even more. They can bypass the time and monetary costs of running clinical trials for off-label usage.\n\nGiven the potential incentives held by off-label usage for pharmaceutical companies, there is a caveat to the practice. Off-label prescribing \u2014 the physician side of the practice \u2014 is legal, but off-label promotion by pharmaceutical companies is illegal.\n\nPharmaceutical companies must maneuver a fine line between providing physicians with information about all possible treatments of a drug and promoting the drug for such off-label usage.\n\n\u201cOff-label marketing isn\u2019t the norm and evidence suggests that companies spend a great deal of effort in compliance,\u201d analyst Wade said.\n\nThose that do engage in off-label marketing, though in the minority, face heavy fines. In September 2008, and January and September 2009, pharmaceutical companies Cephalon, Inc., Eli Lilly & Co. and Pfizer, Inc. each paid steep fines for off-label promotion, to the tune of $425 million, $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.\n\nPharmacyclics\u2019 senior director of public relations and corporate communications, Manisha Pai, said in an interview: \u201cWe don\u2019t promote or track off-label use.\u201d\n\nEven without the role of off-label promotion, an estimated 20 percent of prescription drug sales are off-label, according to liability firm, Gilbert, LLP.\n\nIn the Feb. 12 conference call announcing Imbruvica\u2019s second FDA approval, executive vice president of Pharmacyclics\u2019 sales and marketing, Paula Boultbee, addressed the matter of off-label Imbruvica use in CLL patients, stating, \u201cWe don\u2019t know very much about the patients that have been treated in spontaneous fashion by physicians without the label \u2026 but we do expect that with Imbruvica approved in the CLL space, it (off-label use) will change quite dramatically.\u201d\n\nImbruvica\u2019s approval for CLL treatment eliminates room for off-label prescribing in that specific population; but that does not mean that Imbruvica might not be prescribed off-label for another demographic, such as elderly patients who have not undergone chemotherapy, or for another type of cancer, such as Waldenstrom\u2019s \u2014 a rare type of blood cancer that affects 1,500 people in the U.S. annually.\n\n\u201cAs we don\u2019t track off-label use, I can\u2019t really speculate about whether Imbruvica\u2019s off-label use in relation to CLL treatment has diminished, but I can say that Imbruvica is being tested in many clinical trials for other uses at this time,\u201d Pai said.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This article has been updated from an earlier version to clarify a quotation.\n\nHomepage image screenshot via imbruvica.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "drugs,FDA,Gianni Sun,Imbruvica,medical,medicine,off-label drug use,pharmaceutical,pharmaceuticals,Pharmacyclics,prescription drugs,Sunnyvale,Business & Money,Frontpage Featured,Health,Science & Tech", "description": "Prescription drugs that are on the market have all attained stringent approval by the FDA, but not all of the drugs are prescribed in manners that adhere to FDA\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd80\"", "article_summary": "In the realm of oncology drugs, off-label prescribing is even more common than in the world of prescription drugs as a whole.\nOff-label prescribing \u2014 the physician side of the practice \u2014 is legal, but off-label promotion by pharmaceutical companies is illegal.\nGiven the potential incentives held by off-label usage for pharmaceutical companies, there is a caveat to the practice.\nBack in January, Karnauskas had anticipated Imbruvica\u2019s off-label sales to increase beyond 35 percent, on the heels of positive results from a late-stage CLL clinical trial.\nPharmaceutical companies must maneuver a fine line between providing physicians with information about all possible treatments of a drug and promoting the drug for such off-label usage."}
