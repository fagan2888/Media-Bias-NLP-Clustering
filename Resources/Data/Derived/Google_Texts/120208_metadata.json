The brewery closed in 1995, and the beer maker sold the park to investors in 2009.\n\n\u201cWe have been approached about having a more in-depth meeting,\u201d Redner said in an email, without getting into detail. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a second meeting.\u201d\n\nAn Anheuser-Busch spokesman declined comment, saying the company does not discuss its merger and acquisition strategy.\n\nAcquiring Cigar City, founded in 2009, would be a coup for the 163-year-old Anheuser-Busch as its older, established brands fight for market share with upstarts in Florida and elsewhere.\n\nNot that the big beer makers are necessarily hurting.\n\nIn 2013, craft beer held close to 8 percent of market share compared to domestic products \u2014 Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors among them \u2014 which held a whopping 78 percent share, according to the Boulder, Colorado-based Brewers Association.\n\nStill, in 2013 alone, craft beer enjoyed a 17 percent increase in sales to $14 billion of the country\u2019s $100 billion beer market, the association reported.\n\nFlorida\u2019s craft brewers produced nearly 130,000 barrels and contributed $875 million in direct and indirect impact to the state\u2019s economy, the report said.\n\nCigar City\u2019s beers, including its \u201cJai Alai\u201d India pale ale, have won awards and gained a national following.\n\nAnheuser-Busch is the U.S. subsidiary of Belgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s biggest brewer.\n\nIts red-labeled \u201cBud\u201d and Busch, the flagship labels, have lost cachet among the latest generation of beer drinkers.\n\nThe 60-second Super Bowl television commercial fought back, calling Budweiser a beer not to be \u201cfussed over.\u201d\n\nAs the text rolls across the screen, a man in glasses with a mustache sticks his nose into a snifter filled with craft beer.\n\nBud is \u201cbrewed for drinking, not dissecting,\u201d the ad says.\n\nThe commercial struck craft beer aficionados as ironic. A week earlier, the company announced it had closed on Seattle\u2019s craft beer maker Elysian Brewing for an undisclosed sum.\n\nIt has also gobbled up Chicago\u2019s Goose Island Brewery and Blue Point Brewing Co. in Long Island, New York.\n\nCraft beer insiders have said it was simply a matter of time before the \u201cmacro beer\u201d Goliath set its sights on Florida, which now has more than 70 breweries operating or getting ready to open.\n\nOther potential targets include Florida Beer Co. in Cape Canaveral, Due South Brewing in Boynton Beach and Intuition Ale Works in Jacksonville, according to brewers and business analysts.\n\nThose companies produce enough beer and have been around long enough to have developed the brand loyalty that attracts buyers.\n\nIf Anheuser-Busch does come calling, \u201cI\u2019d be very flattered, but I have no interest in selling,\u201d Intuition founder and owner Ben Davis told the Tribune.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to make Intuition a great brand that I am proud of,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Anheuser-Busch would be able to continue that.\u201d\n\nMore Florida breweries are opening, and others, including Intuition, are growing, said Josh Aubuchon, executive director of the Florida Brewers Guild, the state\u2019s craft beer lobby.\n\n\u201cI jokingly say there are three types of brewers: The artisans, the businessmen and the guys that got together with their buddies and said, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s make some beer,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think the artisans would never consider a sale because that\u2019s \u2018selling out,\u2019 \u201d Aubuchon added. \u201cThe businessmen would look at it and consider it.\u201d\n\nThe guys who just wanted to make beer could go either way, he said, but likely wouldn\u2019t ever get big enough to be targets of anyone\u2019s acquisition team.\n\nAubuchon agrees Anheuser-Busch \u201csees the market growth that\u2019s happening in craft brewing, and they are interested in adding that to their portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking at the core brands and not seeing much room for growth.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Davis might put himself in that first set of beer makers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to use the term \u2018sell out,\u2019 but let\u2019s just say we\u2019re too \u2018punk rock\u2019 to do that,\u201d he said.\n\nRedner is taking another approach: Anheuser-Busch seems \u201cto have been very strategic, so I don\u2019t think they would buy just any brewery,\u201d he said.\n\nAs to its interest in his own craft beer juggernaut and those of others, he added, \u201cI always figured it was inevitable so I am not surprised.\u201d\n\njrosica@tampatrib.com\n\n(850) 765-0807\n\nTwitter: @jlrosicaTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 08 Feb 2015 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, buy\u2019 em.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, buy\u2019 em.", "title": "Anheuser-Busch interested in buying Tampa\u2019s Cigar City Brewing", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/politics/anheuser-busch-interested-in-buying-tampas-cigar-city-brewing-20150208/", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150208/ARTICLE/150209373/EP/1/2/EP-150209373.jpg", "height": 1481}, "updated_time": "2015-02-07T23:33:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 If you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, buy\u2019 em.", "title": "Anheuser-Busch interested in buying Tampa\u2019s Cigar City Brewing", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20150208/ARTICLE/150209373/AR/0/AR-150209373.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2015-02-08T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2015-02-07T23:33:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a0e\"", "article_summary": "Despite its snarky Budweiser ad during the Super Bowl poking fun at craft beer, Anheuser-Busch has been steadily buying craft breweries around the country.\nAubuchon agrees Anheuser-Busch \u201csees the market growth that\u2019s happening in craft brewing, and they are interested in adding that to their portfolio,\u201d he said.\nA week earlier, the company announced it had closed on Seattle\u2019s craft beer maker Elysian Brewing for an undisclosed sum.\nStill, in 2013 alone, craft beer enjoyed a 17 percent increase in sales to $14 billion of the country\u2019s $100 billion beer market, the association reported.\nFlorida\u2019s craft brewers produced nearly 130,000 barrels and contributed $875 million in direct and indirect impact to the state\u2019s economy, the report said."}
