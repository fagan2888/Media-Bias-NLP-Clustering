(AP) \u2014 Gasps can be heard by tourists on a swamp boat tour in south Louisiana as their guide jumps in the water to feed chicken and marshmallows to two alligators. At one point the guide puts a marshmallow in his mouth and lets one of the gators snatch it away.\n\nThe scene was captured on video by Stacy Hicks of St. Helens, Oregon, who visited the area in May.\n\n\u201cWhen he jumped in I was a little scared, more for him than us though,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cI am surprised at the attention this video has gotten. I just thought that this was a thing that happens all the time on the tours.\u201d\n\nThe video has been shared more than 100,000 times on Facebook.\n\nIt also has attracted attention of local and state wildlife officials.\n\nThere is no state law prohibiting luring and feeding of alligators, but it\u2019s against local law in Jefferson Parish, where the Airboat Adventures tour company is based.\n\nAn Airboat Adventures spokesman declined to comment.\n\nBo Boehringer, a spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, said wildlife agents and parish officials are reviewing the video to determine if there was any wrongdoing.\n\nNo charges had been filed as of Tuesday.\n\nLegal or not, wildlife officials say the video shows the unidentified guide took a risk.\n\n\u201cThere is no taming an alligator,\u201d said Aleutia Scott, a supervising ranger at Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve. The preserve includes the swamps in Jefferson Parish, just outside New Orleans.\n\nScott said alligators are \u201ceating machines,\u201d and a big one has massive force in its jaws. The alligators in the video appear to be about 5 feet long, indicating they are still growing, Scott said. Alligators are roughly a foot in length at birth and at full maturity, females can reach lengths of 8 to 10 feet and males 12 to 14 feet, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tourist video captured gator-feeding frolic", "author": "Stacey Plaisance", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tourist video captured gator-feeding frolic", "title": "Tourist video captured gator-feeding frolic", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/12/tourist_video_captured_gator_feeding_frolic/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/feeding-alligators.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tourist video captured gator-feeding frolic", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/feeding-alligators.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Tourist video captured gator-feeding frolic", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Tourist video captured gator-feeding frolic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0038\"", "article_summary": "The scene was captured on video by Stacy Hicks of St. Helens, Oregon, who visited the area in May.\nThe alligators in the video appear to be about 5 feet long, indicating they are still growing, Scott said.\nIt also has attracted attention of local and state wildlife officials.\nLegal or not, wildlife officials say the video shows the unidentified guide took a risk.\nAt one point the guide puts a marshmallow in his mouth and lets one of the gators snatch it away."}
