You cannot stop Von Miller from dancing. If we’ve learned anything about the Broncos this season, it’s that.

And it was a point that reiterated Sunday, when the Broncos’ outside linebacker turned the end zone into a dance floor after DeMarcus Ware’s game-sealing sack in the fourth quarter of Denver’s divisional playoff victory over the Steelers. The ball popped out of Ben Roethlisberger’s hands, and Miller scooped it up and ran it back into the end zone. (Coach Gary Kubiak said Monday he felt the play should have been ruled a touchdown.)

The first sequence is a favorite of Miller, as evidence but his unsolicited dances at practices. But the ending — that was new.

“It comes from (Derek) Wolfe,” Miller said. “Derek, when he signed his new contract, that was the dance that he hit. Let me ring it up. What a better time to do it? I thought it was a touchdown. It was a great game, great day. Happy for all my guys, as usual.”
