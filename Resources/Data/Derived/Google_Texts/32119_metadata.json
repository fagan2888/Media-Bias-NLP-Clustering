[Expected 0.1% vs. -0.1% in July.]\n\nTHE BREAKFAST BRIEFING\n\nAlcoa Inc.\u2019s results could be a bad omen for what\u2019s to come for stocks.\n\nThursday the aluminum giant kicked off third-quarter earnings season with results that missed analyst expectations. Shares of the company are down 4.2% premarket Friday, and if losses hold through the close, they could bode poorly for stocks over the next several months.\n\nAlcoa lost its bellwether status years ago and was dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in September 2013.\n\nBased on data compiled by Schaeffer\u2019s Investment Research, Alcoa\u2019s results suggest investors shouldn\u2019t count on a fourth-quarter rally.\n\nWhen Alcoa\u2019s stock price fell the session after it reported quarterly results, the S&P 500 was only positive 56% of the time one and three months later over the past decade. In the 25 times that\u2019s happened since 2005, the index rose an average 0.1% a month later. But it fell an average 0.1% three months out.\n\nConversely, when Alcoa shares rose the day after earnings, the large-cap S&P index typically gained a month and three months later, advancing an average 1.7% and 3.1%, respectively, according to Schaeffer\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much I would base my trading on this one particular data point, but it has been a pretty good forecast for the market,\u201d said Rocky White, a quantitative analyst at Schaeffer\u2019s.\n\nThe fourth quarter is a seasonally strong time and Wall Street strategists predict the S&P 500 will finish the year 6.4% higher than where it closed Thursday, according to 21 strategists followed by Birinyi Associates. But there are a batch of headwinds that could keep a lid on equities the next few months, including lackluster earnings, slow global growth, a potential showdown in Washington over the debt ceiling and geopolitical developments.\n\nProfits for the S&P 500 are expected to decline 5.5% in the third quarter, according to FactSet. That would lead to an earnings recession (two straight quarters of negative growth) and represent the biggest decline in quarterly profits since the third quarter of 2009 when they fell nearly 16%.\n\nWhile past performance is never a perfect indicator of future returns, Alcoa\u2019s results, which showed a year-over-year drop in earnings and revenues, resemble the weakness expected from third-quarter profits. And they could be a harbinger for market performance over the next several months.\n\nMorning MoneyBeat Daily Factoid: This day in 1967, Che Guevara, an Argentine socialist revolutionary and guerilla leader, was killed by the Bolivian army at the age of 39.\n\n-By Kristen Scholer\n\nSTOCKS TO WATCH\n\nAlcoa shares dipped in thin premarket trade after the aluminum producer said it now expects 2015 automotive production growth in China to be in the range of 1% to 2%, down from a previous outlook of 5% to 8% growth.
