Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 will work 438 miles above the earth\u2019s surface, measuring CO2 levels in order to prove once and for all to climate deniers that man-made global warming is happening.\n\nJust kidding, we know that already. We also know that humans release about 100 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere each day, and that those emissions are contributing to climate change. Half of those emissions end up trapped in the atmosphere, where concentrations of CO2 are astoundingly high \u2014 they\u2019ve been above 400 ppm for a record-shattering three months in a row \u2014 and a quarter are absorbed by the oceans. But the rest is sucked up by trees, a process that scientists are still struggling to understand. Hence the satellite.\n\n\u201cSomewhere on earth, on land, one-quarter of all our carbon emissions released through fossil fuel emissions is disappearing,\u201d David Crisp, a senior research scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, explained to the New York Times. \u201cWe can\u2019t identify the processes responsible for this.
