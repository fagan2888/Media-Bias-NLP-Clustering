Mitchell, SD

A jury in South Dakota has ruled in favor of Avera Health in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by an ophthalmologist.



The Daily Republic reports the decision came following a trial in Mitchell prompted by the lawsuit Dr. Sonia Hernandez filed after she was fired from Avera Queen of Peace Hospital in 2012.



Hernandez's lawsuit claimed her termination was a breach of her three-year contract guaranteeing her $300,000 a year. The jury denied her request for $765,000 in reparation.



Attorneys for Avera said Hernandez was fired after complications arose from three of six cataract surgeries she performed on October 2011. Defense attorney Lisa Marso says safe patient care is of primary importance to Avera.



Hernandez attorney argued the hospital's equipment, instruments and staff were to blame for the complications.
