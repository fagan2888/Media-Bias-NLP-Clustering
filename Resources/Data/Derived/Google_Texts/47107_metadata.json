He said he has already received reports that compliance is under question at some of those facilities.\n\nHe did not say which, or how many facilities, may not to be in compliance. That means the problems alleged in Phoenix could be happening at an unknown number of other VA facilities around the country.\n\nAsked if people were cooking the books, Shinseki testified he was not aware of that, except in isolated cases. But, he said, that is reason to take a thorough look.\n\nSenators told Shinseki he had already ignored repeated warnings that his department was in trouble.\n\nSen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., clearly frustrated and angry, pointed out that the committee had been told two years ago that gaming the system at the VA was so widespread, employees would look to get around regulations as soon as the rules were implemented.\n\nMurray sharply warned Shinseki: \u201cWe have come to the point where we need more than good intentions.\u201d\n\nThe VA chief said he was \u201cmad as hell\u201d and would like to use even stronger language to express how he felt about the possibility that veterans had died due to neglect.\n\nSenate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said he was troubled by reports that some veterans have to wait up to six months to see a doctor. He pointedly warned the VA chief that \u201ca pattern of intimidation and cover-up has to change today.\u201d\n\nSanders said if he discovered the VA was running an illegal second set of books, the committee would \u201cdeal with it.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the hearing, Shinseki was asked if he had abandoned veterans.\n\n\u201cI have not abandoned you,\u201d he told vets, and said the vast majority of patients were receiving good care, mentioning VA facilities handled 85 million outpatient appointments last year.\n\nShinseki was asked about reports that whistleblowers at VA facilities were afraid to come forward.\n\nHe replied that the VA is encouraging employees to tell investigators \u201cwhat\u2019s really going on.\u201d\n\nShinseki said the law protects whistleblowers and he will follow the law.\n\nAsked if he wanted Attorney General Eric Holder to look into the allegations, the general said he first wanted to see a report from the VA Office of Inspector General, or OIG, which is currently investigating the Phoenix facility.\n\nShinseki said he will support an FBI investigation if that\u2019s what the OIG recommends.\n\nThe scandal began when CNN reported allegations last month by a former VA doctor who said the department\u2019s Phoenix health clinic developed a secret system to hide treatment delays.\n\nAs many as 40 patients may have died while waiting for treatment at the Phoenix facility, according to a former clinic director.\n\nOther whistleblowers have since come forward to verify the claims.\n\nAlso, USA Today has reported the VA\u2019s Office of the Medical Inspector said the Fort Collins, Colorado, medical center falsified appointment records to give the impression that staff doctors had seen patients within the department\u2019s goal of 14 to 30 days.\n\nVA facilities in South Carolina, Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Washington state are also known to be under review.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers have called for Shinseki to resign, as has American Legion National Commander Daniel Dellinger.\n\nDellinger said the Phoenix scandal was not the only reason for a leadership change, but it was the last straw.\n\nThe most pointed question came when Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., asked, given all the VA chief has learned, why should he not resign?\n\nThe retired four-star army general replied \u201cthis is not a job\u201d but a mission for him to provide the critical care needed by those with whom he has gone to war.\n\nShinseki vowed to continue until he has reached his goal or until the commander in chief tells him his time is up.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., who has called for Shinseki\u2019s resignation, accused him of conducting \u201cdamage control\u201d rather than taking steps to fix his department.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Obama assigned White House deputy chief of staff Rob Nabors to review policies for patient safety rules and the scheduling of patient appointments.\n\nThe Senate committee will convene again once the OIG report is completed, to review the findings.\n\nShinseki wouldn\u2019t tell senators what changes the VA plans to make, because the Office of Inspector General has \u201cadvised VA against providing information that could potentially compromise their ongoing review.\u201d\n\nBut, two senior executives at the Phoenix VA already have been placed on administrative leave until further notice.\n\nThe VA system is the largest health care system in the country, treating 9 million veterans a year at 152 hospitals and more than 1,500 other facilities.\n\nPatients are generally satisfied with their care at VA hospitals, according to surveys.\n\nThe Phoenix VA Health Care System serves about 80,000 veterans.\n\nSanders noted \u201cthere are going to be problems\u201d with any system so large.\n\nBut the questions, he said, are, \u201cDo we have enough doctors and nurses and nurse practitioners at that site?\u201d and, \u201cIf not, why not?\u201d\n\nFollow Garth Kant on Twitter @DCgarth", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 In his opening statement at a heated Senate hearing, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki admitted cover-ups of patient deaths may be more widespread than previously feared.
