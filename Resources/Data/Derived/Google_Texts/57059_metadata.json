We\u2019ll honor that trust by listening to you, by making your priorities our priorities. That means focusing first on helping middle-class families still struggling to pay the bills and find good-paying jobs. We\u2019ll start by debating and voting on the many jobs bills the House has acted on with bipartisan support. We\u2019ll work to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which will mean lower energy costs for families and more jobs for American workers. We\u2019ll advance the Hire More Heroes Act, which will encourage employers to hire more of our nation\u2019s veterans. And we\u2019ll take on ObamaCare regulations that threaten the 40-hour workweek and the pay and peace of mind of so many Americans. These types of common-sense solutions, so long ignored by the outgoing Senate majority, offer a good starting point.\n\nHere is what Boehner\u2019s agenda really means.\n\nSpeaker Boehner\u2019s jobs bills aren\u2019t really jobs bills. The 40+ pieces of legislation that the House calls jobs bills are a collection of regulatory rollbacks, tax breaks, and benefits for corporations. These isn\u2019t a single job creation plan in their list of jobs bills. What the Republican jobs bills are missing is jobs.\n\nRep. Boehner was lying about the impact of the Keystone XL pipeline. The project would do the exact opposite of what Boehner suggested. Keystone XL will only create 2,000 temporary jobs, and it will raise the cost of gas by ten to twenty cents a gallon in the Midwest.\n\nA return to the 40-hour work week is a stealth attack on the Affordable Care Act. The impact of what the Republicans are proposing is that 1 million working Americans would lose their employer provided health insurance. So far, Republicans have offered the American people tax breaks for corporations, a loss of health insurance and higher gas prices.\n\nThe American people are about to get what the Koch brothers paid for when they bought the Senate for the GOP. The Republican agenda is focused solely on benefitting their donors, and Boehner\u2019s efforts \u201cfor the middle class\u201d will almost certainly make millions of lives worse.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker John Boehner outlined his plan to \"help\" the middle class during the Republican weekly address today, and his plan involved taking away health insurance from 1 million people and raising gas prices.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Speaker John Boehner outlined his plan to \"help\" the middle class during the Republican weekly address today, and his plan involved taking away health insurance from 1 million people and raising gas prices.", "title": "John Boehner Plans To Help The Middle Class By Taking Away Healthcare and Raising Gas Prices", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/11/08/john-boehner-vows-middle-class-healthcare-raising-gas-prices.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/boehner-middle-class.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-08T15:35:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Issues,John Boehner,middle class,republican weekly address,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2014-11-08T15:35:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-08T15:35:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "John Boehner, middle class, republican weekly address"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfbe\"", "article_summary": "Speaker Boehner\u2019s jobs bills aren\u2019t really jobs bills.\nSpeaker John Boehner outlined his plan to \u201chelp\u201d the middle class during the Republican weekly address today, and his plan involved taking away health insurance from 1 million people and raising gas prices.\nWe\u2019ll start by debating and voting on the many jobs bills the House has acted on with bipartisan support.\nWhat the Republican jobs bills are missing is jobs.\nSo far, Republicans have offered the American people tax breaks for corporations, a loss of health insurance and higher gas prices."}
