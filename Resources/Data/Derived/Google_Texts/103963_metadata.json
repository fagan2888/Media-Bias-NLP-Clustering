But not too shabby for a first attempt.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt that was the most difficult thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life,\u201d Krar said upon crossing the finish line at an elevation of 10,152 feet. \u201cI did not expect this halfway through the race. I honestly don\u2019t know how I did it.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Scenes from the 2014 Leadville 100 trail run\n\nThe relative newcomer to century racing has been lighting up the circuit this summer with a similarly astounding result at the Western States 100 in California on July 2, where he posted the second fastest time in that race\u2019s 41-year history as well. Ultrarunning Magazine\u2019s 2013 male Ultra Runner of the Year is also a three-time TransRockies Champion.\n\nBut halfway through Saturday\u2019s race, the Leadville course with elevations ranging from 9,200 to 12,600 feet and a total climb of 17,000 feet nearly got the best of him.\n\n\u201cOne of the fascinating things about ultras is that you can have incredibly low points and somehow bounce back,\u201d Krar said. \u201cThis particular race, I was struggling a lot very early in the race, the earliest I ever have. I was having some cramping and I really thought I was going to retire from the race. I was considering turning around and going back to the aid station, but somehow I pulled it together about 2 miles before Twin Lakes and was able to keep going. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d\n\nBy the final aid station at May Queen, about 12 and a half miles from the finish, it had become clear that the only race remaining among the field of 700 runners was for second place. That one was won by Arvada resident and Western Colorado State University graduate Michael Aish, who passed eventual third-place finisher Ian Sharman with less than a mile remaining.\n\nAish, 38, finished in 16:38:35 while 2013 LT100 champion Sharman of Walnut Creek, CA, crossed the uphill finish at 16:41:38. Both men flirted with the race lead before Krar found his stride somewhere between miles 70 and 80.\n\n\u201cIt was a good race,\u201d Aish said. \u201cObviously, Rob is one of the very best in the world. But someone has got to stick it to him. It\u2019s always nice to finish well, but I\u2019d rather run a brave race than just run for second. I pushed it too hard at the start and blew up.\u201d\n\nAfter walking the notorious hill up Hope Pass, Aish posted the race\u2019s fastest split time from the May Queen aid station to take second place, completing the leg in about hours and finishing the entire race two hours faster than he did in 2013.\n\n\u201cI just put myself in that position to do or die, and I swear I was on the verge of dying so many times,\u201d Aish said.\n\nThe pace of this year\u2019s race was enough to make both of the top finishers rethink their return in the future.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m done with hundreds,\u201d Aish said. \u201cI\u2019m getting too old for this stuff. It hurts, man.\u201d\n\nThe newly crowned champion alluded that Carpenter\u2019s record remains safe for a while as well.\n\n\u201cOut and back courses are certainly not my favorite. I think I learned that today,\u201d Krar said. \u201cBut the history of this race is incredible and it is a beautiful course. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be back or not, but I\u2019m very, very glad I did it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rob Krar wins Leadville Trail 100 ultramarathon race", "title": "Rob Krar wins Leadville Trail 100 ultramarathon race", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/16/rob-krar-wins-leadville-trail-100-ultramarathon-race/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140816__leadville100p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140816__leadville100p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-16T21:52:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:09:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1da3\"", "article_summary": "LEADVILLE \u2014 In his first attempt at the legendary Leadville Trail 100, Rob Krar of Flagstaff, Ariz., posted the second fastest time ever run in the 32nd annual Race Across the Sky.\n\u201cIt was a good race,\u201d Aish said.\nIt\u2019s always nice to finish well, but I\u2019d rather run a brave race than just run for second.\nBoth men flirted with the race lead before Krar found his stride somewhere between miles 70 and 80.\n\u201cThis particular race, I was struggling a lot very early in the race, the earliest I ever have."}
