Or a thug. Some sort of monster perhaps.\n\nDon\u2019t get the wrong impression, Finley is not a bad guy. Far from it. Classmates at the University of Wyoming call him \u201ca gentle giant.\u201d At 6-foot-8 and 395 pounds, though, he must be the nation\u2019s biggest theater major. A top contender to claim the NCAA championship next month in the discus, and a potential Olympian, he would like to become an actor when his career as an athlete is over.\n\n\u201cWith my size, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be playing Romeo or Hamlet,\u201d Finley said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll have a niche. I can get roles that others can\u2019t \u2014 if they need a football-type player or a big, bad guy.\u201d\n\nLou Anne Wright, a distinguished professor and acting coach at Wyoming, would prefer Finley not typecast himself. He may seem larger than his Colorado hometown of Buena Vista, but there\u2019s a big, wide world out there. And Wright believes Finley has the potential to make a name for himself in show biz.\n\n\u201cWatching Mason act, and the way he conducts himself, I always thought, \u2018This guy has the heart of an athlete but the soul of an actor,\u2019 \u201d Wright said.\n\nHaving the experience of being an elite athlete will serve Finley well as an actor, she said.\n\n\u201cOne feeds off the other,\u201d Wright said. \u201cMason has been in front of people and failed. Athletes have to do that. It doesn\u2019t bother him.\n\n\u201cA lot of people that go into acting face the terror of, \u2018What if I fail? What if I make a fool of myself?\u2019 Mason is past that. He\u2019s not afraid of failure.\u201d\n\nOf course, Finley knows well the sweet taste of success. At Buena Vista High School, he set a national high school record in the discus with a throw of 236 feet, 6 inches and a Colorado high school record of 71-8\u00bd in the shot put.\n\nHeavily recruited, Finley chose Kansas and competed there for three years. Including the indoor and outdoor seasons, he earned a total of four individual Big 12 Conference championships. He was a four-time NCAA runner-up \u2014 twice in the discus, twice in the shot put \u2014 but something was missing.\n\n\u201cI had some really good times at Kansas,\u201d he said, \u201cand met some great people. (But) I wasn\u2019t really improving after three years, so I decided to make a change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI finally found it\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2012, Finley transferred to Wyoming, where his father, Jared, had been a standout discus thrower. After sitting out a year because of NCAA transfer rules, Finley has earned two All-America honors with the Cowboys. He aims to add another at the June 11-14 NCAA track and field championships in Eugene, Ore., assuming he advances past regional competition this week.\n\nHe has been concentrating on the discus during the outdoor season this year, and his throw of 210-6 with the heavier college discus ranks fifth nationally, second best all-time at Wyoming.\n\nHe\u2019s glad he made the move to Laramie.\n\n\u201cI feel like athletes are like puzzle pieces and you\u2019re not going to fit everywhere,\u201d Finley said. \u201cYou have to find a place you\u2019re comfortable in. I finally found it at Wyoming.\u201d\n\nPaul Barrett, Wyoming\u2019s longtime throwing coach, must have set a personal best in jumping for joy after receiving word that Finley would become a Cowboy. Barrett recruited Finley out of high school. \u201cBut Mason was getting offers from all the big schools, and I knew for us it was a longshot,\u201d he said.\n\nFinley initially signed with UCLA. But he asked for a release from that letter of intent before enrolling, because the Bruins\u2019 throwing coach resigned.\n\n\u201cI think Mason, coming from a small mountain town, really likes the atmosphere at Wyoming,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cHe\u2019s a very quiet guy, very humble. He has zero ego. You would never know he was an elite athlete. Being a small-town guy, he\u2019s not looking for a lot of outside activities. In Laramie, he can concentrate on school and athletics. He\u2019s not going to get distracted.\u201d\n\nThe best-case scenario, Barrett said, is that Finley wins the NCAA title in Eugene and then gets selected by the U.S. Olympic Committee to be a resident athlete at the USOC track and field training center in Chula Vista, Calif., near San Diego.\n\nA golden opportunity\n\nAs much as Finley loves the challenge of theater, he likely has a long career as an athlete ahead of him. World-class weight throwers usually do not reach their peak until after their 30th birthday. Finley plans to focus on the discus to make the Olympics.\n\n\u201cMason definitely has gold medal potential,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cI think he should make the Olympic team in 2016. And in 2020, I could see him vying for the gold.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to trim him down. That\u2019s where he will make his biggest jump. Mason is still going to be a big guy. But he got really heavy at Kansas. That, in my opinion, hurt his progress. He is incredibly mobile and coordinated for somebody that size. But he knows he needs to get quicker and more explosive to reach the top.\u201d\n\nIt has not gone unnoticed that Hollywood is only about a 2\u00bd- hour drive from Chula Vista. Finley said training for the Olympics will take precedence in all that he does, but it would be wonderful if he could find time to take some acting classes.\n\nHis background as an athlete has enabled him to anticipate and appreciate the work required to become a successful actor. Great actors, like great athletes, make it look easy.\n\n\u201cI can see Mason becoming a pretty sophisticated actor,\u201d Wright said. \u201cHe has the ability to work with people and to listen. He wants to explore. He wants to become an actor. He wants to do this stuff. You can see into his soul. The camera will love him.\n\n\u201cI think he has a really good chance. I do.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nLaramie legends\n\nMason Finley is attempting to become the fourth individual NCAA track and field champion in Wyoming history:\n\n1974: Wesley Maiyo, men\u2019s 1,000 yards, indoor, 2:08.00\n\n1996: Ryan Butler, men\u2019s weight throw, indoor, 71 feet, 1\u00bd inches\n\n2005: Shauna Smith, women\u2019s 400-meter hurdles, outdoor, 54.32\n\nSource: University of Wyoming\n\nRing of fame\n\nMason Finley\u2019s career-best performances:\n\nCOLLEGE INDOOR\n\nShot put: 66 feet, 3\u00bc inches (2014, Wyoming record)\n\nCOLLEGE OUTDOOR\n\nShot put: 67-11\u00bd (2013, unattached)\n\nDiscus: 210-6 (2014, second-best throw in Wyoming history)\n\nHIGH SCHOOL\n\nDiscus: 236-6 (national record)\n\nShot put: 71-8\u00bd (Colorado state record)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wyoming\u2019s Mason Finley: From one big stage to another", "title": "Wyoming\u2019s Mason Finley: From one big stage to another", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/24/wyomings-mason-finley-from-one-big-stage-to-another/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__20140525_C1_SP25TRACKFINLEYp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140524__20140525_C1_SP25TRACKFINLEYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-24T22:53:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:43:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7f5\"", "article_summary": "Once Mason Finley is finished smashing records as a track and field giant, he\u2019d love to be a bouncer.\nHe may seem larger than his Colorado hometown of Buena Vista, but there\u2019s a big, wide world out there.\n\u201cBut Mason was getting offers from all the big schools, and I knew for us it was a longshot,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI can see Mason becoming a pretty sophisticated actor,\u201d Wright said.\nAnd Wright believes Finley has the potential to make a name for himself in show biz."}
