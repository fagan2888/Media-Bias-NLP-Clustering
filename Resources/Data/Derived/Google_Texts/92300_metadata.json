In fiscal 2014, the IRS spent $183 million in user fees on taxpayer services \u2014 just 44 percent of the user fee account.But in fiscal 2015, \"the IRS plans to spend only $49 million on customer service, or 10 percent of the user-fee account,\" the report said. \"This decision amounts to a 73 percent reduction in user fees allocated to customer service, and a 6 percent decrease in total funding for taxpayer assistance.\"For the 2015 filing season, the IRS estimated that it would receive 48.8 million calls seeking live assistance but would only answer 16.8 million \u2014 slightly more than one of every three \u2014 leaving 32 million taxpayer calls unanswered.Moreover, spending decisions \"entirely under the IRS' control led to 16 million fewer taxpayers receiving IRS assistance this filing season,\" said the report. \"Other spending choices, including prioritizing employee bonuses and union activity on the taxpayers' dime, used up resources that otherwise could have been used to assist another 10 million taxpayers.\"The IRS' spending decisions \"and mismanagement of resources raise serious questions about the nature and extent of the agency's self-described budget crisis and its commitment to serving the taxpayer,\" according to the staff report.Koskinen, the report continues, noted that the effect of IRS' budget allocations \"will hurt taxpayers\"; described IRS customer service for the 2015 filing season as \" abysmal\"; and called cuts to his agency's budget \"a tax cut for tax cheats.\"For fiscal 2015, the IRS \"has said publicly it will conduct 46,000 fewer audits.\" IRS enforcement agents in Dallas, Texas, said \"they would not audit anyone who owed less than $1 million in taxes.\"According to the \"supervisory revenue officer\" for Dallas, if a person owed $900,000, \"I have to say, 'sorry, we can't get that money.'\"The reasoning behind these public announcements is \"hard to understand,\" the Ways and Means report said. \"It is like a sheriff announcing that anyone driving under 85 miles per hour would not be pulled over.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "IRS, malfeasance, blame, budget cuts, GOP, Ways and Means, user fees, Koskinen, bad decisions", "pubdate": "2015-04-27T15:49:18", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "For months, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and the agency's defenders have warned that taxpayers \"would suffer longer waits on the phone, receive less help from the agency, and experience a delay in refunds because of the budget cuts Congress passed...", "title": "Report: Malfeasance, Not Budget Cuts, to Blame for IRS Failures", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/IRS-malfeasance-blame-budget-cuts/2015/04/27/id/641043/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/IRS-malfeasance-blame-budget-cuts/2015/04/27/id/641043/", "title": "Report: Malfeasance, Not Budget Cuts, to Blame for IRS Failures", "description": "For months, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and the agency's defenders have warned that taxpayers \"would suffer longer waits on the phone, receive less help from the agency, and experience a delay in refunds because of the budget cuts Congress passed...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1430149758, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "IRS, malfeasance, blame, budget cuts, GOP, Ways and Means, user fees, Koskinen, bad decisions", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2015-04-27T15:49:18"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/IRS-malfeasance-blame-budget-cuts/2015/04/27/id/641043/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "For months, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen and the agency's defenders have warned that taxpayers  would suffer longer waits on the phone, receive less help from the agency, and experience a delay in refunds because of the budget cuts Congress passed..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b24\"", "article_summary": "\"Questionable agency decisions on allocating the user fees resulted in cuts to customer service.\n\"This decision amounts to a 73 percent reduction in user fees allocated to customer service, and a 6 percent decrease in total funding for taxpayer assistance.\n\"Other spending choices, including prioritizing employee bonuses and union activity on the taxpayers' dime, used up resources that otherwise could have been used to assist another 10 million taxpayers.\nIRS enforcement agents in Dallas, Texas, said \"they would not audit anyone who owed less than $1 million in taxes.\n\"For fiscal 2015, the IRS \"has said publicly it will conduct 46,000 fewer audits.\""}
