Sales were down 4 percent and the profit margin fell by 40 basis points to 16.3 percent last year.\n\nLower prices in its health-care system business, including imaging equipment such as X-ray and magnetic resonance machines, were a key reason, according to its annual report.\n\nGovernment funding pressures, uncertainty related to Obamacare, market saturation, and pricing pressures all hindered sales growth, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Karen Ubelhart.\n\n\"Margins were hurt by all of the above and cost pressures which GE was slow to respond to,\" she said via email.\n\nTo offset the decline in equipment sales, GE Healthcare is turning to data analysis services and its life sciences business, which sells products and services for drug research and bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n\nThe company's digital business will enjoy the fastest growth as GE Healthcare seeks to integrate its installed equipment with software packages.\n\nFlannery expects at least 30 to 50 percent growth from GE Health Cloud, launched last year to develop the company's ability to operate its traditional imaging business in a cloud-computing environment.\n\n\"We are really trying to move from being just a technology provider to being a partner with our customers,\" he said.\n\nThe software margins are very high, Bloomberg Intelligence's Ubelhart said. While that segment of the business is too small to help the $18 billion GE Healthcare unit much now, \"growing at more than 20 percent, it could be meaningful in five years,\" Ubelhart said in an email.\n\nGE Healthcare also expects to sell more pre-made biopharmaceutical factories like the one the company just built in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. It was shipped from Germany in September in 62 containers and assembled in eight days.\n\nA project like that will probably yield about $100 million in revenue over its lifetime, and will generate further revenue as the company supplies consumable products for its operations, according to Flannery. He expects several more such projects in the next year or two at a minimum.\n\n\"There's a lot of potential for this in China,\" Flannery said. \"We have a very strong pipeline of interest.\"\n\nTo win market share in developing countries, the company has been developing products with more basic functions and lower prices. Such products will suit day-to-day needs at county hospitals in China where doctors only conduct routine scanning, according to Rachel Duan, president and CEO of GE China.\n\nChina has vowed to support local equipment makers, urging public hospitals to buy from Chinese brands. Growth in the country's public hospital market slowed after a government-led corruption crackdown in the past two-and-a-half years and is now bottoming out, Duan said.\n\nThe fast-growing private hospital sector will create more opportunities in China, she said.\n\nSales in China will probably expand by a percentage in the mid- to upper-single digits, Flannery said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Flannery built a reputation as a prolific rainmaker in his previous role as head of business development at General Electric Co., logging more than $26 billion in deals, yet acquisitions are far from his ...", "copyright": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "author": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "title": "GE Healthcare CEO to seek growth from within", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/shared/assets/img/tribune1200x630.jpg", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/home/3898322-155/ge-healthcare-ceo-to-seek-growth", "article": {"section": "Home", "tag": "Growth,Company,Flannery,Healthcare,Business,China,Percent,Products,Equipment,Sales,Bloomberg News"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Flannery built a reputation as a prolific rainmaker in his previous role as head of business development at General Electric Co., logging more than $26 billion in deals, yet acquisitions are far from his ...", "title": "GE Healthcare CEO to seek growth from within", "url": "http://www.sltrib.com/home/3898322-155/ge-healthcare-ceo-to-seek-growth", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "SL Tribune", "iphone": "The Salt Lake Tribune", "googleplay": "The Salt Lake Tribune"}, "id": {"ipad": "id434734447", "iphone": "id396990949", "googleplay": "com.sltrib.news"}}, "site": "@sltrib", "image": "http://www.sltrib.com/csp/mediapool/sites/shared/assets/img/tribune1200x630.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/saltlaketribune"}, "news_keywords": "Growth,Company,Flannery,Healthcare,Business,China,Percent,Products,Equipment,Sales,Bloomberg News", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "GOOGLEBOT": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "GE Healthcare has committed to raising its profit margin by 50 basis points this year with a goal of reaching 18 percent by 2018.\nThe company's digital business will enjoy the fastest growth as GE Healthcare seeks to integrate its installed equipment with software packages.\nGE Healthcare also expects to sell more pre-made biopharmaceutical factories like the one the company just built in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\nGovernment funding pressures, uncertainty related to Obamacare, market saturation, and pricing pressures all hindered sales growth, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Karen Ubelhart.\nSuch products will suit day-to-day needs at county hospitals in China where doctors only conduct routine scanning, according to Rachel Duan, president and CEO of GE China."}
