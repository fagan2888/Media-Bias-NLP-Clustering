The Oasis Cafe attracted national attention for charging a \"minimum wage fee\" to offset costs from a newly increased state minimum wage and Honour was there to voice support. (Photo: AP )\n\nA recent story about a restaurant in Stillwater, Minnesota, called the Oasis Cafe, caught my attention.\n\nComing from a family of Midwestern farmers and small business owners, I\u2019m a huge fan of small business. I\u2019m also a fan of being as upfront and honest as possible about your beliefs, though as you read below, you\u2019ll see it can get you in hot water real quickly.\n\nHere\u2019s where Craig and Deb Beemer, owners of the Oasis Cafe, cooked up some trouble for themselves. Maybe they did it unknowingly, but in this age of instantaneous opinion and speed-of-light digital soapboxes, they shouldn\u2019t have been too surprised.\n\nThe back story: The Land of 10,000 Lakes recently raised the Minnesota minimum wage to $8 an hour from $7.25. Many states are wrestling with the same issue, as lawmakers look to boost the spending power of workers without unfairly socking it to business owners in a free market.\n\nThe Beemers, admittedly conservative but reportedly usually rather quiet in their politics, earlier this month began adding a 35-cent \u201cminimum wage fee\u201d to their customers\u2019 food bills noting their additional business expense initiated by state lawmakers.\n\nThat line item on customers\u2019 bills quickly created a Land of 10,000-plus opinions.\n\nI unsuccessfully attempted to contact the Beemers last week, but because the story went national, they\u2019ve been steamrolled with media requests, not to mention backlash, so it probably wasn\u2019t surprising I didn\u2019t get through.\n\nIf I were to guess \u2014 and this is based on nothing but what I\u2019ve been able to cherry pick through news stories and social media \u2014 it\u2019s that the Beemers just wanted to operate a simple mom-and-pop eatery, grew frustrated at the seemingly casualness to which more operating expense was added to their business\u2019s bottom line, so they decided to make a statement.\n\nI remember a while back, customers at several Gator\u2019s Dockside casual eateries in Florida discovered a 1 percent surcharge on their checks to \u201cgenerate the additional revenue needed to cover the costs of\u201d complying with the the Affordable Care Act \u2014 aka \u201cObamacare.\u201d The corporate office disavowed the move and said the Obamacare fee was a decision by a franchisee.\n\nHere is what the Oasis Cafe put on their Facebook page:\n\n\u201cOur decision to offset the recent increase in minimum wage was what we believed to be the most honest and transparent way to communicate a significant increase in our operating cost. Rather than raise menu prices, we decided to charge a flat fee per guest check.\n\n\u201cWhile our family is conservative in our views, it was never our intent to make some grand political statement about the minimum wage debate. My comment about thumbing my nose at the law is being quoted out of context.\n\n\u201cWith regards to how much we pay our employees, our servers average more than $20 per hour when you consider the tips they receive. Our dishwashers make $10 to $11 and our cooks make $12 to $16 per hour. Anyone familiar with restaurant wages in our market knows we\u2019re paying our staff a more-than-competitive wage.\n\n\u201cTo those who have supported our restaurant with your business and positive comments ... thank you...your support is appreciated more than you\u2019ll ever know.\n\n\u201cTo those customers who we\u2019ve offended with our minimum wage fee, please know it was not our intent to be offensive and that we hope you\u2019ll find a way to forgive us.\u201d\n\nItemizing fees and taxes isn\u2019t new. State and federal taxes are spelled out quite clearly at gas stations and on your cable, cell phone and utility bills.\n\nBut restaurants, particularly successful ones, are weirdly influential when it comes to politics and can become a flashpoint.\n\nRemember \u201cFreedom Fries,\u201d to protest against France for not supporting the United States\u2019 effort in Iraq? In World War I, sauerkraut became \u201cliberty cabbage\u201d at some eateries to thumb the nose at Germany.\n\nIn 2008, a place called Geno's in Philadelphia placed a sign in its window reading, \u201cThis is America. When ordering, please speak English.\u201d That brought the owner an investigation by the city\u2019s Human Relations Commission, which issued a ruling that the sign did not convey a message that service would be refused to non-English speakers.\n\nThen there were the comments on traditional marriage not so long ago by the head of Chick-fil-A, which ended up creating traffic jams of supporters.\n\nAnd can you recall any modern-day president who hasn\u2019t had some type of bologna sandwich named after him?\n\nAll of it, I guess is gastronomical democracy in a sense. Customers, like owners, can make a statement by electing not to patronize an establishment if they feel offended by a restaurant\u2019s point of view. Or, as someone told me several years ago, \u201cYou can be a \u2018Soup Nazi,\u2019 but you better make some damn good soup to back it up.\u201d\n\nFinally, this reminds me that some enterprising local restaurant, looking to score some buzz this election season, should sponsor a contest and ask their customers to come up with sandwiches for our candidates for governor. It would be interesting to see what would be on a Charlie Crist or a Rick Scott.\n\nNot taking sides, but I imagine there would be some cheese, ham, turkey and, quite possibly, bologna involved.\n\nPrice is FLORIDA TODAY\u2019s business editor.
