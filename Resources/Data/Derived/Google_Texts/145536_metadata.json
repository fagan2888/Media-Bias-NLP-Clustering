Sadoff said that the changes were \u201creally drastic,\u201d and would result in a net loss of 40 percent, or $2.6 million in reimbursement to the hospital.\n\nUnder the new proposed contract, Regence wants to reimburse MRH on a fixed-fee for services basis, as opposed to the current operating model, where the hospital is reimbursed on a percentage of costs.\n\nSadoff said that the per-diem, or fixed-fee model, works in urban areas that provide a high volume of services. But a fixed fee reimbursement is unsustainable for small, rural, \u201cCritical Access Hospitals\u201d (CAHs), given the small margins under which these hospitals operate, Sadoff said.\n\nThe parties have been in negotiation ever since. But in late October, the hospital notified Regence that it would terminate negotiations by Nov. 15, in order to give its patients time to find new, in-network coverage before the contract expired. When that deadline came and went, Sadoff said the hospital realized it needed to keep communication open.\n\n\u201cWe want to give people every opportunity to change plans in the event that an agreement isn't reached,\u201d Sadoff said.\n\nSadoff said the hospital's first priority is its patients, and that it is exploring options to ensure effective, affordable services for those who will be out of network.\n\n\u201cWe are currently networking with other hospitals that have gone out of network to see what options are available for ensuring that patients don't get caught in the middle of this negotiation,\u201d she said.\n\nSadoff added that patients covered by Medicare will not be affected, as Medicare operates under a different contract with Regence.\n\nLocal resident and retired senior Roy Vaughn said he was initially very worried that he and others like him who receive Medicare benefits through Blue Cross would be affected.\n\n\u201cI found out through talking with Jennifer (Sadoff) that Medicare has a different contract with Blue Cross than the hospital does,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cBut there are a whole bunch of old people like us who don't have a clue that they don't need to worry.\u201d\n\nVaughn was relieved that he didn't have to worry but he feared for other residents in the community.\n\n\u201cHow unfair this is to this community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don't have any other options than going to another carrier. This is so typical. It's about making money, not about providing good health care coverage.\u201d\n\nBoth Regence and MRH have sent letters to their clients informing them that they have been unable to reach an agreement on rates for reimbursement of services.\n\nIn its letter, Regence states that, \u201cThe reimbursement requested by the hospital is significantly higher than prices for the same services available from other community providers.\u201d\n\nMoab Regional Hospital CEO Robb Austin said that, \u201cRegence reimburses substantially less than other insurers.\u201d\n\nHe wrote a letter to Regence carriers on behalf of the hospital to dispute Regence's claims, including its assertion that MRH charges more for its services than other hospitals. He cited the Utah Department of Health Hospital Comparison Tool that shows MRH's charges to be 44 percent below other Utah hospitals.\n\n\u201cIn 2014, Moab Regional Hospital received the honor of being named one of the top 100 Critical Access Hospitals in America,\u201d he said. \u201cA primary consideration for this award is affordability, and it was one of the categories that we ranked highest in.\u201d\n\nThe MRH letter also encourages customers to explore other healthcare coverage options so they can continue to remain in network.\n\nMoab Regional Hospital has changed insurance providers for its 100 employees, as has the city of Moab. Some private employers, such as Intrepid Potash, have been unable to do so because they are national companies with employees in other states.\n\nRenee Troutt, insurance agent for Central Utah Insurance, said that she is trying very hard to roll over their clients to an in-network carrier, but that in many cases they aren't competitive.\n\n\u201cIf people are on a grandfathered plan with Blue Cross, they often find that new carriers are more expensive because they have to go with a new (Affordable Care Act) compliant plan,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said that large group plans have more flexibility in their rates, but that small group and individual rates can't be adjusted without approval from the state.\n\nOf concern for those who aren't able to change plans are higher co-pays and deductibles, as well as higher costs for procedures, as the hospital may be forced to \u201cbalance bill\u201d patients for the difference that Regence is unwilling to pay.\n\nLou Riepl, strategic communications manager for Regence, said that by his company's reading of Utah's Rural Healthcare Law, it believes that Regence customers will be safeguarded.\n\n\u201cUnder the law, Moab Regional Hospital would be prohibited from 'balance billing' our members, even if the hospital is not contracted with Regence,\u201d Riepl said. \u201cThis means that their deductible or copay/ coinsurance under their benefit plan, plus the reimbursement we allow Moab Regional Hospital as an out-of-network hospital, will be all that it can collect.\u201d\n\nAustin said that there are different interpretations of the law but that he ultimately doesn't want it to come to that.\n\n\u201cThat's a burden on the whole community,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would like to see an acceptable agreement with Blue Cross that doesn't put the hospital at financial risk.\u201d\n\nRiepl said his company has offered proposals to address the hospital's concerns, but that its first priority is its members.\n\n\u201cAs the state\u2019s first health insurer, Regence\u2019s commitment to Utah members, whether urban or rural, has been well-proven,\u201d he said. \u201cOur priority is to look out for the health care affordability, quality and sustainability interests of our members.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "moabnewssun.com", "description": "With a looming deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, Moab Regional Hospital (MRH) and Regence Blue Cross / Blue Shield have not yet reached a contractual agreement to provide in-network health care for Moab residents and visitors.", "title": "Dispute between hospital/ insurer unresolved as deadline looms", "url": "http://www.moabsunnews.com/news/article_b8f4349a-8090-11e4-9fa1-d74f0a80f295.html", "image": "moabsunnews.com/resources/images/_site/moabsunnewsfb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "With a looming deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, Moab Regional Hospital (MRH) and Regence Blue Cross / Blue Shield have not yet reached a contractual agreement to provide in-network health care for Moab residents and visitors.", "fb": {"app_id": 176896259007058}, "keywords": "newsfront,news,top_story", "news_keywords": "newsfront,news,top_story"}, "article_summary": "Moab Regional Hospital has changed insurance providers for its 100 employees, as has the city of Moab.\n\u201cUnder the law, Moab Regional Hospital would be prohibited from 'balance billing' our members, even if the hospital is not contracted with Regence,\u201d Riepl said.\n\u201cIn 2014, Moab Regional Hospital received the honor of being named one of the top 100 Critical Access Hospitals in America,\u201d he said.\nHe cited the Utah Department of Health Hospital Comparison Tool that shows MRH's charges to be 44 percent below other Utah hospitals.\nWith a looming deadline of 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, Moab Regional Hospital (MRH) and Regence Blue Cross / Blue Shield have not yet reached a contractual agreement to provide in-network health care for Moab residents and visitors."}
