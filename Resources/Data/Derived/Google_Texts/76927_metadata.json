If you\u2019re the only shop in town, you can charge whatever you like, and insurance companies have no choice but to accept those prices. But it wasn\u2019t clear what happens when smaller doctors\u2019 offices join hospitals.\n\nHannah Neprash and her colleagues from the Harvard Medical School Department of Health Care Policy tracked how many doctors switched from private practices to hospitals in 240 American cities between 2008 and 2012, linking those numbers to the health care spending records of more than 7 million Americans with private insurance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey saw no significant change in the price of inpatient services. But the more that doctors joined hospitals, the more expensive outpatient visits became.\n\nPatients weren\u2019t getting more services, however. They were simply paying more for each visit. And the authors, who reported their findings Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, point the finger at doctors and hospitals for the higher costs.\n\nIt\u2019s normal for outpatient services to be priced a bit higher in a hospital than they are in an independent doctor\u2019s office. Because hospitals have higher overhead costs, Medicare, the federal insurer of the elderly and people with disabilities, pays an average of $68 more for an outpatient service performed in the hospital than for a service performed in a doctor\u2019s office.\n\nBut if a hospital wants even more money, it\u2019s out of luck \u2014 these prices aren\u2019t negotiable. \u201cMedicare can usually call the shots,\u201d said Elizabeth Bradley, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health who specializes in health care costs.\n\nPrivate insurers don\u2019t have as much power as Medicare. They have to negotiate prices with each health care provider. And if a hospital employs most of the doctors in a city, then insurance companies don\u2019t have much choice but to accept the hospital\u2019s prices, even if they are higher than what Medicare is willing to pay.\n\nThe same goes for physicians who join big hospitals. They suddenly gain the institution\u2019s bargaining power, and can charge more.\n\nAll this helps explain why costs go up \u2014 and why physicians have been flocking to hospitals in droves. Over the past quarter-century, the percentage of US physicians who own their own practice has declined by about 2 percent every year.\n\nThe steady march of doctors into hospitals could continue thanks to the Affordable Care Act. That law encouraged the integration of different parts of the health care system in the hope that it will reduce costs. But Neprash warns that it could unintentionally have the opposite effect.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s concern that this trend may accelerate as providers reorganize to meet the challenges of new payment models,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.820372209", "eomportal-id": 382881, "description": "The cost of visiting the doctor is climbing as hospitals scoop up a growing number of physicians\u2019 groups.", "eomportal-instanceid": 14, "og": {"city": "Boston", "site_name": "BostonGlobe.com", "description": "The cost of visiting the doctor is climbing as hospitals scoop up a growing number of physicians\u2019 groups.", "title": "When hospitals buy doctors\u2019 practices, patients pay - The Boston Globe", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com//2015/10/19/when-hospitals-buy-doctors-practices-patients-pay/bsK3hRYRyCNQFnqsD18WKK/story.html", "country": "US", "image": "http://c.o0bg.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/10/20/BostonGlobe.com/ReceivedContent/Images/GettyImages-57260724.jpg", "longitude": "-71.0597732", "state": "MA", "latitude": "42.3584308", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 95431448, "card": "summary", "site": "BostonGlobe"}, "robots": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "doctors,health care,costs,harvard,studies, Stuart Altman,Harvard University, Harvard Medical School, Health Department, Twitter", "eomportal-lastUpdate": "Fri May 27 08:46:40 EDT 2016", "fb": {"admins": 507486035, "app_id": 103933749691726, "pages": 5637143257}, "keywords": "doctors,health care,costs,harvard,studies, Stuart Altman,Harvard University, Harvard Medical School, Health Department, Twitter", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/globe"}, "flashsale": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "eomportal-uuid": "eff7589a-769f-11e5-9894-3a5e13bcf08f"}, "article_summary": "Researchers found that when small doctors\u2019 practices join large hospitals, their patients pay an average of $75 more every year for outpatient services like check-ups, even though the number of appointments stays the same.\nThat law encouraged the integration of different parts of the health care system in the hope that it will reduce costs.\nThe steady march of doctors into hospitals could continue thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\nIt\u2019s normal for outpatient services to be priced a bit higher in a hospital than they are in an independent doctor\u2019s office.\nThe study found that if a hospital employs most of the doctors in a city, then insurance companies often have to pay more."}
