This gave me a little sick feeling. I tried to be clearheaded as I edited which furniture from my home and DC\u2019s would make the cut in our new blended home. Many items landed on the exit ramp, which felt healthy and right, like a vegetable-juice cleanse.\n\nBut I was having a hard time parting with the chairs. I liked them. They were well-made, in good condition, and solidly comfortable. The only sin they had committed was that they no longer went with the new home\u2019s d\u00e9cor.\n\nThe look DC and I had agreed on for the happy yellow house was transitional, a tricky d\u00e9cor style that bridges traditional with contemporary. Some traditional items, just like people, move forward better than others. And these gold and blue upholstered chairs looked, well, I had to be honest, when I sized them up critically, fusty.\n\nTheir overtly traditional lines and old-world European-style fabric looked pass\u00e9. Keeping them would be like playing Beethoven at a jazz festival.\n\nSo the chairs sat in my garage awaiting the next bus to the Sharing Center. And that nagged at me. I had a strong case of furniture guilt. I know how I would feel if someone showed me the curb just because I didn\u2019t fit in.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s my Scottish heritage, but I am frugal at my core. I\u2019m philosophically opposed to replacing something inherently good, with something likely to be inferior \u2014 even if it is more stylish. I believe in reusing, repurposing and rehabilitating when possible, in taking care of what\u2019s mine, not just ejecting it for a newer model tempting as it can be. So I took my own advice for a change.\n\n\u201cI thought we were getting rid of those,\u201d DC said when he saw the chairs back in the house with swatches of fabric samples spread on them.\n\n\u201cI decided we should recover them not replace them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you said they wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI changed my mind,\u201d I said, exercising my female prerogative. \u201cBesides, putting a contemporary fabric on a traditional chair is a perfect transitional statement.\u201d I tried to sound convincing, so my ambivalence wouldn\u2019t seep through.\n\n\u201cIs it worth it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nDC adjusted his eyebrows, which had been perpetually raised since we started the process.\n\n\u201cWe live in such a throw-away society,\u201d said Dean Stills, co-owner of Stills Upholstery, a family business in Longwood, FLa., which has been resurrecting and transforming furniture for 36 years. \u201cPeople give away a high quality sofa that their grandparents paid $3,500 for in 1975, and buy something that isn\u2019t real wood from IKEA because they think it\u2019s cooler.\u201d\n\nAs Stills and I talked, I felt better about recovering, not replacing these good old chairs. And then we hashed over all the considerations folks should make before showing a piece of upholstered furniture the door:\n\nQuality: \u201cNot every piece is worth recovering,\u201d Stills said. Much depends on the quality of the frame, and the piece\u2019s condition. \u201cIf it\u2019s a cheap piece from Costco, throw it away and start over. If you aren\u2019t sure how well made a piece is, pick it up. Heavier usually means better made. Also sit in it and scooch. If it\u2019s rickety, it\u2019s not well made. Better made pieces feel stable, and are made of hard wood like oak, ash or maple, not soft material like pine, plastic or composite. Pieces put together with doweled joints hold up better than butted joints. Also note age. In this case, older is better. \u201cAnything made before 1985 usually has a high-end wooden frame,\u201d he said. \u201cWood gets harder as it gets older.\u201d\n\nConnection: Do you have a family attachment? If grandma\u2019s sofa or the chair you sat in with dad isn\u2019t a decorative fit anymore or it\u2019s worn, new upholstery can give it a new life for another generation.\n\nComfort: If it\u2019s your favorite chair, and no other chair feels quite like it, it might be worth a chairlift.\n\nCost: If a piece was expensive, recovering it will be cheaper than replacing it with something equally well made. Reupholstering is often 50 to 60 percent of the cost of replacing, said Stills. My armchairs would cost around $800 to $1,000 each to replace. Recovering cost $500 per chair ($320 for labor, $180 for fabric).\n\nConfiguration: If the lines are good and the item is integral to your d\u00e9cor and only the color or fabric pattern are wrong, recover.\n\nCustomization: If you like choice, you will have more if you reupholster. When buying a chair from a furniture store, fabric selection is limited. Reupholstering lets you choose from literally a million options, and lets you mix fabrics to customize pieces to fit your d\u00e9cor. (This much choice is a mixed blessing, as you\u2019ll see in next week\u2019s column.)\n\nConvenience: Shopping for new furniture is time consuming. If you have a piece you know works but needs a refresh, recovering lets you avoid the hassle of starting from scratch.\n\nConscience: Repurposing just feels better than replacing, and is better for the planet.\n\nSyndicated columnist Marni Jameson is the author of two home and lifestyle books, and the forthcoming \u201cDownsizing the Family Home: What to Keep, What to Let Go\u201d (Sterling Press).
