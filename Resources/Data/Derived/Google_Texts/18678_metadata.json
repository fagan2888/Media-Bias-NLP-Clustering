What you may not know is that working out can have financial benefits too.\n\nPlenty of research suggests that overweight people spend more on health care, but it\u2019s not just the thin who stand to save. Fact is, regardless of your weight, if you\u2019re a couch potato you\u2019re likely missing out on earning and saving opportunities.\n\nThe Payoff in Your Paycheck\n\n\n\nHealth care costs aren\u2019t the only way physical activity is a benefit. People who work out regularly, as in at least three times per week, are more productive at work than those who don\u2019t, according to research published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Those who get sufficient exercise also miss fewer workdays, according to the same study. Those absences can translate to lost income and lost opportunities for advancement.\n\nAnother study published in the Journal of Labor Research found that men who work out regularly can expect to make 6% more than their sedentary counterparts, on average. For women, the pay boost is higher: Fitness-savvy females make 10% more, on average.\n\nA Nudge From the Boss\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re not already working out, it doesn\u2019t have to cost an arm and a leg to start.\n\nFor starters, some employers just flat-out pay their employees to work out as part of workplace wellness initiatives. For example, IBM offers cash to employees who meet certain fitness goals. Employees at Google and Zappos can use on-site fitness classes and facilities, enabling them to skip membership fees at traditional gyms. Even if your company doesn\u2019t currently offer wellness benefits, it might soon: Under the Affordable Care Act, employers can receive grants to get one started.\n\nYour employer may have a deal worked out with a local gym where employees can get discounted rates. Even if your company doesn\u2019t offer such an incentive, chances are that your health insurance provider does. UnitedHealthcare offers reimbursements of $20 per month to members who use one of many participating gyms, while Blue Cross Blue Shield has worked out a $25 membership fee for their members at over 8,000 gyms nationwide. These insurance giants aren\u2019t the only ones in on the game\u2014most health care insurers offer some type of fitness benefit for members.\n\nJust Do It\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, skipping the gym altogether may be your biggest money saver. If a participating fitness center isn\u2019t available near you, or you\u2019re just not the gym-going type, there are plenty of ways to get in shape for free. You can use the myriad online videos in the comfort and privacy of your own home, such as those offered on Bodyrock.TV or YouTube\u2019s workout channel. If you like mobile apps, try Daily Workouts free app, or iPump. If you\u2019re close with your co-workers you can start a lunchtime walking group. Your boss may just end up rewarding you for it.\n\nRead more from NerdWallet Health, a website that empowers consumers to find high quality, affordable health care and lower their medical bills.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Investing in fitness can generate financial rewards as well as health benefits.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Investing in fitness can generate financial rewards as well as health benefits.", "title": "How Working Out Can Really Pay Off", "url": "http://time.com/money/3573272/exercising-make-more-money/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/141110_ff_exercisemoney.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/141110_ff_exercisemoney.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Investing in fitness can generate financial rewards as well as health benefits.", "site": "MONEY", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Working Out Can Really Pay Off"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MoneyMagazine"}, "keywords": ", careers, earnings, employee benefits, exercise, fitness, gym membership, health care, health insurance, insurer, salary, wellness, wellness benefits", "google-site-verification": "nFxFQf8F4Xgg0b9Ap9rOUJzg7MY74LicbBIzsLo8yIg", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "careers, earnings, employee benefits, exercise, fitness, gym membership, health care, health insurance, insurer, salary, wellness, wellness benefits"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8fa8\"", "article_summary": "Read more from NerdWallet Health, a website that empowers consumers to find high quality, affordable health care and lower their medical bills.\nPlenty of research suggests that overweight people spend more on health care, but it\u2019s not just the thin who stand to save.\nEven if your company doesn\u2019t offer such an incentive, chances are that your health insurance provider does.\nThese insurance giants aren\u2019t the only ones in on the game\u2014most health care insurers offer some type of fitness benefit for members.\nWhat you may not know is that working out can have financial benefits too."}
