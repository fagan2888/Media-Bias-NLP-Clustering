Critics say it\u2019s a tax on essentials, not luxuries. It\u2019s getting attention now because employers plan ahead for major costs like health care.\n\nWith time, an increasing number of companies will be exposed to the tax, according to a recent study. The risk is that middle-class workers could see their job-based benefits diminished.\n\nFirst to go might be the \u201cflexible spending accounts\u201d offered by many companies. The accounts allow employees to set aside money tax-free for annual insurance deductibles and out-of-pocket health costs. That money comes out of employees\u2019 paychecks, and they\u2019re not able to use it for other expenses. Savvy consumers see it as a way to stretch their health care dollars.\n\nThe catch is that under the law those employee contributions count toward the thresholds for triggering the tax.\n\nThere are other wrinkles: Companies in areas with high medical costs, such as San Francisco, are more likely to be exposed to the Cadillac tax than those in lower-cost areas like Los Angeles. Ditto for employers with unionized workers who won better benefits through bargaining.\n\nRepublicans in Congress and a sizable contingent of Democrats are calling for repealing the tax. Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner Democratic presidential candidate, says she\u2019s concerned and would re-examine the tax. Since it doesn\u2019t take effect right away, it\u2019s an issue for the next president.\n\n\u201cAs currently structured, I worry that it may create an incentive to substantially lower the value of the benefits package and shift more and more costs to consumers,\u201d Clinton said in response to a candidate questionnaire from the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nThe Cadillac tax has two purposes: to act as a brake on health care spending and to raise money for covering the uninsured.\n\nThe value of employer-sponsored health insurance is tax-free to workers and tax-deductible for companies. It amounts to an income tax break worth $206 billion this year, according to the president\u2019s budget. Many economists call that an indirect subsidy that encourages wasteful spending. They argue that if not the Cadillac tax, some other kind of limit is needed. Major Republican health overhaul plans have also proposed curbs.\n\nA recent study from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 26 percent of all employers would face the tax in at least one of their plans during its first year, 2018. Nearly half of larger companies would face the consequences of the tax that same year, because they tend to offer better benefits.\n\n\u201cIt is a pretty broad-based tax that has a powerful effect on controlling the growth of premiums,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a co-author of the study. \u201cThe downside is workers may see an increase in their out-of-pocket costs.\u201d\n\nBecause the tax is indexed to general inflation, which rises more slowly than health insurance premiums, over time it would affect a growing share of health plans.\n\nThe Obama administration says such studies overstate the potential impact. The Treasury Department said in a statement that only \u201ca small fraction of workers\u201d would be affected. Regulations to implement the tax could soften some feared consequences, but proposed rules aren\u2019t expected until late this year or early next.\n\nThe Cadillac tax is 40 percent of the value of employer-sponsored plans that exceeds certain thresholds: $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. The tax is levied on insurers and plan administrators, who are expected to pass it back to employers. The 40 percent rate is well above the income tax rates that most workers face.\n\nJoe Kra of the benefits consultancy Mercer said he believes many employers will be required to make fundamental changes in their health plans to mitigate the tax\u2019s impact. Measures such as ditching flexible spending accounts may not be enough. That would accelerate a shift to high-deductible plans that require workers to pay a bigger share of health costs before insurance kicks in.\n\nHere are some other potential twists:\n\n\u2022 The Treasury Department says it is considering an exemption for flexible spending account contributions for dental and vision care, which are two popular uses.\n\nThe health care law already limited FSA contributions and without such accommodations, the Cadillac tax could lead to their demise.\n\n\u201cA benefit that you are offering your employees so they can save money on taxes is going to wind up costing you money,\u201d said economist Paul Fronstin of nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\n\u2022 Treasury is also trying to figure what do about a different kind of workplace arrangement called a \u201chealth savings account.\u201d\n\nA growing number of workers have high-deductible health insurance that comes with tax-sheltered health savings accounts, or HSAs, that they and their employer can contribute to.\n\nBut if an employee has his or her contribution deducted from their paycheck, it could potentially trigger the tax.\n\nOfficials say they\u2019re considering options.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The last major piece of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law could raise costs for thrifty consumers as well as large corporations and union members when it takes effect in 2018.
