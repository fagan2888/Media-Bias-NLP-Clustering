We have a really good network of support services for patients, including social work and nutrition. It is often hard to get private insurance to cover these,\u201d said Dr. Rebecca Jackson, chief of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at ZSFG.\n\nAccording to Jackson, approximately 80 percent of ZSFG\u2019s patients are covered by Medicare or Medi-Cal. Five percent pay their own bills. The remainder, including undocumented immigrants, are uninsured. Sixty percent of the hospital\u2019s patients are Latino; many of whom speak only Spanish. ZSFG \u201cmeets patients where they are,\u201d Jackson said, by having many staff members who are bilingual Spanish-English speakers, with cultural competency serving Latino populations.\n\n\u201cMany of our patients are immigrants, and quite a number of our mothers are isolated. They don\u2019t have a lot of family members and friends around. Some had to come without their other children. It brings up a lot of conflicting emotions. We provide a lot of social support and care,\u201d said Dr. Pooja Mittal, a family medicine physician at ZSFG.\n\nAccording to a 2014 The New York Times article, ZSFG is women and children friendly. The hospital now features private, art-adorned lactation rooms and a large, open Intensive Care Unit for babies. There are 19 beds and 14 rooms for expecting and new mothers on the old building\u2019s fifth floor; the new structure contains 21 private rooms for this purpose on its second floor.\n\nA 2014 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development study found that ZSFG\u2019s approach to labor and delivery resulted in approximately 18 percent of mothers giving birth by Cesarean-section. The City and County of San Francisco averages a 21 percent C-section rate, California has a 29 percent average, with a 32 percent average nationally. Vaginal births tend to result in no adverse outcomes to babies, and lower morbidity rate for women, according to a 2014 Pacific Business Group on Health report.\n\nMargy Hutchison, a nurse-midwife who has worked at ZSFG for 25 years, said expecting mothers in a normal pregnancy can choose a nurse-midwife or a doctor as a primary caregiver. Women who choose a nurse-midwife are guaranteed that a midwife will be with them during the childbearing process.\n\nAs part of the Centering Pregnancy program, ZSFG\u2019s nurse-midwives walk five blocks south to the Homeless Prenatal Program\u2019s (HPP) 18th Street office, where they guide small groups of low-income pregnant women through prenatal support sessions. \u201cI think the providers at ZSFG truly care. They make an effort to see that the poorest of the poor here in the City receive the same care that somebody who has tremendous means would also get,\u201d said Martha Ryan, HPP\u2019s founder and executive director. ZSFG staff regularly refer Black mothers-to-be to the San Francisco Black Infant Health Program, run by the City\u2019s Department of Public Health, for group classes and support.\n\nAccording to Dr. Melanie Thomas, a psychiatrist and health services researcher at ZSFG, effective and culturally-tailored mental health services are a critical component of treating women in Potrero Hill and the Mission District, the two neighborhoods the hospital straddles.\n\n\u201cThe cumulative effects of chronic stress, which are increased with homelessness and other aspects of poverty, are often linked to mental health difficulties,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cMental health services are undergoing a time of rapid change. Many of the shifts are driven by the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. We\u2019re integrating behavioral health services into primary care. I think we are headed in the right direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor our homeless population, it\u2019s clear that women and children are especially vulnerable,\u201d said Dr. Melissa Nau, a UCSF faculty psychiatrist who focuses on women\u2019s health at ZSFG. \u201cWe work as a multidisciplinary team to connect women in need to appropriate medical, mental health, and social services. Our leadership is committed to helping all providers continue to improve care delivery and find efficient and productive ways to meet our patients\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nDr. Misa Perron-Burdick, medical director of ZSFG\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Center, said ZSFG offers more to women than an ordinary hospital because it provides specialty care on-site. \u201cWe have cancer specialists, a urogynecological clinic, high-risk obstetric services, and a clinic that examines abnormal pap smears on premises. Often (elsewhere) female patients must be referred out for these services,\u201d said Perron-Burdick.\n\nPerron-Burdick added that ZSFG is establishing a Patients Advisory Council (PAC) for the Women\u2019s Health Center, which will be in place by this summer. The council will provide opportunities for patients and their families to assist ZSFG staff improve clinic management and patient care.\n\nZSFG offers an open access clinic, where patients can call and get same-day appointments for such services as emergency contraception, sexually transmitted disease testing, breast problems, and pelvic pain. \u201cWe started that a couple months ago and now it\u2019s really gaining traction,\u201d said Perron-Burdick.\n\nAccording to Jackson, transgender patients are welcome at ZSFG, where staff is committed to incorporating care and sensitivity into treatment for those who are transitioning. \u201cThey\u2019ve struggled living their lives in a body that does not feel like their body. We\u2019ve trained our staff to call them by the name of their choice and refer to them using the pronoun of their choice,\u201d she said.\n\nOnouwem Nseyo, a second-year resident at ZSFG, said she\u2019s enjoyed her rotation at the campus. She believes female patients are well-served by close relationships with staff. \u201cA lot of the advice we give our patients isn\u2019t hot air. It is preventative medicine,\u201d said Nseyo.\n\nNseyo added that at ZSFG she\u2019s learned a focus on obstetrics means treating a new or expectant mother affects other people. \u201cWorking in obstetrics, you have an influence on the mom, the future baby, her marital partner, and his health,\u201d said Nseyo.\n\nBrent Andrew, ZSFG chief communications officer, said the new facility will benefit female patients in many ways. \u201cThe entrance is a welcoming space with a lot of light and color. The new emergency exam rooms take up more (space) so patients get more privacy. It\u2019s also calmer and quieter in the ER pods. The Acute Care for Elders unit has a meditation garden, private rooms with natural light, and landscape paintings in the hallways. The labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum rooms are private. They have space and furniture for family members to visit. They are designed to look as much as possible like a normal hotel room,\u201d said Andrew.\n\n\u201cI think we offer the best care in the City,\u201d said Mittal. \u201cI think any of our providers who work here would have liked to come here for our own pregnancies if we could have. I can\u2019t tell you how many times people have gone above and beyond their normal area of care. I\u2019ve seen staff pool money to help a patient who is dying visit their home country. I saw a woman come in who had no family or friends, and the nurses all got together and threw her a baby shower. That is not unique. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital is a place where people feel really cared for.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"secure_url": "http://www.potreroview.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SFGH_3.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.potreroview.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/SFGH_3.jpg"}}, "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.potreroview.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-form_masthead-270x270.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital is a place where people feel really cared for.\u201d\nZSFG staff regularly refer Black mothers-to-be to the San Francisco Black Infant Health Program, run by the City\u2019s Department of Public Health, for group classes and support.\nThe Acute Care for Elders unit has a meditation garden, private rooms with natural light, and landscape paintings in the hallways.\n\u201cMental health services are undergoing a time of rapid change.\nThe council will provide opportunities for patients and their families to assist ZSFG staff improve clinic management and patient care."}
