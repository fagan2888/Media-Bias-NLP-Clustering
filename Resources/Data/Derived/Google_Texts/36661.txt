I feel like a milk carton with an expiration date, he told the audience after being hammered with tough questions from people like the Deltas most famous fisherman, Bobby Barrack, who criticized the restoration of habitat and the governors pet project, twin water tunnels to divert fresh water from the Delta.

I want to fix as many things as we can fix in however long Im director, said Mr. Bonham. I agree you have a system around Sacramento that even in the best days confuse a highly migratory fish  on the way up and then on the way back. One of the things I find most exciting is on the way out if you can get them up on the flood plains, the salmon will grow bigger because they are in a better food situation. If you can get them bigger and they go out to the ocean, the percentages of them coming back will go through the roof.

Mr. Barrack, a fisherman who lives in the Delta city of Oakley, began by reading an article by Dan Bacher in The Fish Sniffer newspaper. It told how everything is less for fish like stripers and steelhead  with populations down by as much as 90 percent or more.

We all know it is water diversions, said Mr. Barrack. If I was a football coach, all of you guys would be out.

Sitting with Mr. Bonham were Chief Warden David Bess, Acting Deputy for Wildlife and Fisheries Division Stafford Lehr and Eric Loft, chief of the Wildlife Division.

Do you have a question? interjected Mr. Bonham.

Yes, I do, said Mr. Barrack. Thats when he asked about a bill in Congress sponsored by Rep. David Valadao, R-Hanford, that proposes to eliminate non-native fish in the Delta ranging from catfish to bass. The bill, called the Western Water and American Food Security Act of 2015 places blame for lack of water in Southern California on the protections for salmon and other threatened species like the Delta smelt.

I believe the Brown Administration has an objection to that bill and gone on record that its not helpful to Congress to legislate when it is farmer against fishermen and diversions against others to benefit another group. It would be more useful if Congress avoided legislation in that arena, Mr. Bonham said.

Steve Carson, a well-known fisherman and member of the California Outdoors Hall of Fame, said other states call non-native species like bass naturalized citizens.

Mr. Bonham told Mr. Barrack that Sen. Diane Feinstein introduced her own water bill last week that is up for discussion this Thursday. Mr. Bonham urged the sportsmens community to weigh in because these topics are so important to all Californians. He added that they shouldnt cherry pick winners and losers.

Then Mr. Bonham addressed the football coach remarks of Mr. Barrack. At the same time weve been in leadership, weve all been experiencing the worst drought ever. We are now seeing zero of Delta smelt when were out surveying for them. That does not mean there is zero everywhere  just that location where weve been looking at year after year. But Bobby is right  many of our salmon and native fish are at their lowest number ever. Bobby is wrong on how we manage water and consumptive use of taking water out of our river and streams contribute to this economy.

Mr. Barrack had criticized the habitat programs, saying that Fish & Wildlife is focused on islands without access to boaters and fishermen just to pacify people with numbers.

Ill debate you but youve got to know your facts, said Mr. Bonham, and then asked if anyone in the audience knew where Knights Landing is and several raised their hands.

Did you know that the Knights Landing outfall gate year after year we have winter run salmon coming up stream and they are likely to be diverted at that point and get lost in the Colusa Basin and get stranded? The winter run is the most imperiled salmon fishery in Sacramento. As the winter run goes, so goes the fall run for John McManuss commercial boats and the recreational fishermen. This year because of the Departments leadership, we sat down with the Reclamation District and fixed the entrain problem.

Entrain is when fish get trapped and have nowhere to go.

Two years ago in 2013 we lost 600 winter run salmon straying into Colusa Basin. The problem is fixed as of this year. Thats not miniscule. Thats not appeasement. Thats restoration that will benefit winter run salmon right now, Mr. Bonham said.

Master of ceremonies Sep Hendrickson from Vacaville, who operates Seps Outdoors Inc., asked, If you catch a fish and it must be released when youre fishing in the ocean, can you use a separate pole to drop that fish down to a depth that it has a chance to survive?

My answer would be no but please feel free to catch me afterwards and Id be happy to have a dialogue on it, said California Department of Fish and Wildlife Chief Warden David Bess, seated next to Mr. Bonham. I have a bunch of game wardens here today that work in that area.

Mr. Hendrickson said there is a device on the market to drop fish down and Mr. Bonham said, The spirit of the question is awesome. How can I get a fish back that is least harmful to it?

Ken Brown, who has a show on Ultimate Bass Radio, and represents Triton Boats on the West Coast, said he agrees with Mr. Barracks views on the politics of conservation. Were rescuing 600 salmon in front of the media, began Mr. Brown. Its a feel-good thing like were out there doing something. Maybe you can tell me how they got up there.

The next thing weve got to fix is downstream in the Fremont Weir (a low dam built across a river to raise the level of upstream water), said Mr. Bonham. Then well come down to the beginning of the bypass and figure out what were going to do to the bypass relative to flood control and fish habitat. At the same time we just authorized and improved one of our grants to finally screen the biggest last unscreened diversion to a new humongous structure on the river there.

He said the department has a Top 10 hit list for the biggest unscreened diversions that they are trying to get screened.

Mistakes have been made, Mr. Bonham admits

After a disastrous experience with wrong information being received on temperature gauges in the Mt. Shasta Reservoir, Mr. Bonham said, the Department of Reclamation will change the way it gauges and monitors the temperatures of the pool in Shasta.

Two years ago the involved parties and agencies thought we had a temperature management structure agreed upon on for the Sacramento River below Redding, said Mr. Bonham. And the Bureau of Reclamation and our department lost control of the water in the river. So when you have hot temperatures, it can be lethal. After that we recovered to see how wed manage 2015. That was an even harder discussion. It turned out we got it wrong.

The gauging system to monitor the system on Shasta was broken. About that time the runoff coming into the reservoir was running about five degrees hotter. We had a very dry, incredible period. We lost temperature control again. So my departments view is youve got to fix your information system if you are going to rely on it. It is a heck of a dilemma how to use a limited amount of cold water in Shasta and manage the upper Sacramento River system when that water is often needed to push out salt water (in the Delta). If salt water moves into the Delta and gets into your drinking water, there goes your drinking water.

There were several comments from Dave Hurley and others about how the fishermen and hunters do not feel properly represented by the California Fish and Game Commission. Jim Kellogg, a respected sportsman, recently resigned after 15 years on the commission. Fisherman and other outdoors sports people have said they fear the appointees are now becoming just political appointees with no background in hunting and fishing. Currently the commission has three members and two vacancies.

Anthony Williams, a recently appointed commissioner, is an attorney and Democratic consultant from Huntington Beach who is the first black person appointed in the commissions 145 year history.

When he was named to the commission, the governors press office noted that Mr. Williams has been director of government relations at the Boeing Company since 2014. His bio also includes stints at the Office of California State Senate President pro Tem Darrell Steinberg from 2010 to 2014; founding partner at Wada Williams Law Group LLP from 2006 to 2010; director of government affairs at the State Bar of California from 2004 to 2006 and principal consultant for California State Senate President pro Tem John L. Burton from 2000 to 2004.

Eric Sklar, another recent appointee, does enjoy hunting birds. He is in the winery business and served as a member of the St. Helena City Council from 2003 to 2010 and the city of St. Helena Planning Commission from 2002 to 2003. He was also the founder and chief executive officer at Burrito Brothers Inc. from 1989 to 1999.

State Fish & Game Commission members get paid just a per diem rate when they attend meetings. Each of the three current members owes their appointment to the governor. The Commission also has one of the strongest veto powers on the governors pet project of building massive water tunnels beneath the Delta to divert water from the Sacramento River before it can enter the Delta.

Mr. Bonham praised Jacque Hastler-Carmesin from McKinleyville, who is one of the commissioners. She comes from a very sports driven part of our North Coast. She has commercial and recreational fishermen in her immediate family.

The Commission makes its decisions based on an open process using democracy. No matter what their conclusion, I support them. I live with their decisions because it becomes law, he said. One thing I find curious is some of our community always says that they cant stand it when the Legislature in California decides a fish and wildlife issue. They argue that those decisions should be with the Commission. And then when the Commission makes the decision and they dont like it, they complaint about the Commissions decisions.

Finally, several fishermen said they just dont trust the Fish & Wildlife Department even when they ask fishermen to fill out report cards on their fishing and send them to the department.

Dave Hurley, publisher of the Hurley Chronicles, an online fishing report, said sports people dont even trust how the information will be used. Mr. Bonham said they have a public outreach program to improve this through interacting at such events as the International Sportsmens Expo and local organizations.

Anna Swenson, an activist with the Clarksburg-based group North Delta Community Area Residents for Environmental Stability (North Delta CARES), said after the event that she asked Mr. Bonham to speak at their Clarksburg organization, and he agreed to appear there.

Mr. Hendrickson said it is very important now, if sportsmen know good candidates for the Commission, to communicate their credentials to the Governors office to be better represented.

Perhaps Mr. Bonhams most telling comment during the lively interchange with sportsmen was, I feel I could use a hug.
