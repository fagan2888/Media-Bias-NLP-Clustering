But more than 40 percent also reported \u201chigh levels of discrimination at school, in the workplace, and from health care providers and law enforcement officials,\u201d the study said,\n\nThe study is based on responses to the 2014 California Well-Being Survey. Researchers surveyed 1,066 people who had previously reported mild to serious psychological distress.\n\nOther findings:\n\n81 percent of respondents who had previously suffered a mild to moderate or serious level of psychological distress said the public discriminates against mental illness.\n\nJust 41 percent said that people are \u201ccaring and sympathetic\u201d to people with mental illness.\n\nMore than two in three said they would definitely or probably hide a mental health problem from coworkers or classmates.\n\nMore than one in three said they would hide a problem from family or friends\n\n\u201cThe lack of safety or comfort with disclosure raises concerns about the degree to which individuals are able to obtain sufficient support in school or in the workplace, as well as from those with whom they may be closest,\u201d the study said.\n\nStill, just 20 percent of respondents said they might delay treatment for fear of others finding out about a mental health problem. And 88 percent had sought treatment at some point.\n\nIn addition, about 70 percent of those surveyed said that they are satisfied with life.\n\nThe survey was administered in English and Spanish.\n\nThe study said that previous findings have shown \u201ca large majority of individuals with mental health problems eventually obtain treatment but with significant delays to first contact.\u201d It said delaying treatment is a pervasive problem in the country as a whole, where those suffering can wait years or even decades to get help.\n\nRAND completed the study as part of an evaluation of the California Mental Health Services Authority\u2019s prevention and early intervention programs, designed to improve mental health outcomes.\n\nCalMHSA Executive Director Wayne Clark says the group is making some headway into changing attitudes about mental health, with a broad-based statewide campaign. But with one Californian taking his or her own life nearly every two hours, Clark says making mental illness as easy to discuss as a broken arm will still be a project for the long haul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take that kind of longer-term investment to change how people deal with emotional issues in their families, how they deal with them in their neighborhoods and in their schools and in their workplace,\u201d he said.\n\nSara Hossaini contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study by the RAND Corporation finds that nearly 9 in 10 Californians who reported having a mental health problem in the past 12 months said they had", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Californians With Mental Health Issues Report Discrimination, Stigma\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/04\\/23\\/californians-with-mental-health-issues-report-discrimination-stigma\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-23 11:49:38\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-04-24 07:01:32\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":25049,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/04\\/mentalhealth.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "A new study by the RAND Corporation finds that nearly 9 in 10 Californians who reported having a mental health problem in the past 12 months said they had exper", "title": "Californians With Mental Health Issues Report Discrimination, Stigma", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/04/23/californians-with-mental-health-issues-report-discrimination-stigma/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/04/mental-health2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "RAND completed the study as part of an evaluation of the California Mental Health Services Authority\u2019s prevention and early intervention programs, designed to improve mental health outcomes.\nMore than two in three said they would definitely or probably hide a mental health problem from coworkers or classmates.\nCalMHSA Executive Director Wayne Clark says the group is making some headway into changing attitudes about mental health, with a broad-based statewide campaign.\nMost often, respondents reported discrimination in intimate social relationships.\nStill, just 20 percent of respondents said they might delay treatment for fear of others finding out about a mental health problem."}
