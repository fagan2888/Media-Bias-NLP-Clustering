With the exception of possible exogenous events, a president\u2019s first term defines his second one. The enormous difficulties that Obama is having with his signature issue, the health care law, are the shining example of how that can work. Almost everything that has gone wrong with the program was set in motion in the early years of his presidency.\n\nThe first term is when the president makes fateful decisions about what kind of people he wants in his White House, how he wants them organized, the nature and role of his cabinet members (are they essentially staff, as most tend to be in the Obama administration?), which initiatives he selects as his most important, whether he builds a strong cadre of outside allies, how he deals with the Congress and how hard he is willing to fight for what he wants.\n\nNot unlike some other presidents, Obama essentially surrounded himself in the White House with his campaign staff, or others he knew well, rather than finding people experienced in governing. Newly elected presidents pay a heavy price if they are themselves inexperienced in governing and select top staff who lack a broad sense of what it means to run a federal government.\n\nThe shock of adjusting to the presidency\u2014the myriad amounts of information and decisions to be made thrown at them\u2014hits most newcomers. Where to begin? Which decisions to tell your staff are presidential-level ones and which ones are they to work out on their own? How much authority to give to the cabinet\u2014a set of relationships that is almost always fraught. Only if a newly elected president has served as vice president or in a tiny number of other high offices can he have been given a prior sense of the vast chasm between running for president and being president. There is a lot of talk these days that former governors are the only ones who are truly prepared to occupy the oval office. But that\u2019s hogwash. To my knowledge none have a Pentagon to run, or a raft of foreign policy decisions coming at them every day, or fifty sub-states and a potentially obdurate Congress to deal with. There is no training for the presidency.\n\nBarack Obama had an unfathomable inability, beginning in his early years in office, to grasp the difference between campaigning and governing\u2014and for that he\u2019s been paying a fearful price in his second term. Campaigning and governing call for different kinds of rhetoric. For some reason, Obama never got control of the health care argument. He cited its attractive provisions many times, but he just didn\u2019t get through.\n\nAs for his promise that if people liked their health insurance policy they could keep it, former aides say that they were uneasily aware that it was misleading, or oversimplified. But they figured that it represented a small slice of the probably large group who would eagerly sign up for the new plan. They also figured that if the federal website was working the way it should, most people would be aware they had access to better options. They didn\u2019t come clean that some people were going to lose out under the new plan. The president, now on the defensive, and almost groveling, remained unable to get across the enormous benefits of providing some 30 million uninsured people with coverage.\n\nFateful decisions made in the first term reflected Obama\u2019s lack of understanding of what it meant to govern. Early on, I received a startling insight into how the Obama White House approached working with Congress. I asked a senior presidential aide why the White House hadn\u2019t sent up its own health care legislation, so that there would be something coherent to start with and more leverage. His reply: \u201cBecause any time we lost a provision that would be seen as a loss.\u201d This was a most unusual way to deal with Congress\u2014tying one\u2019s own hands at the outset.\n\nAs the health care legislation moved through Congress, Obama and his top aides became swallowed up in the details. Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s first chief of staff, had much to recommend him: he\u2019d served in the Clinton White House and been a member of Congress. But he was an inside man, buried in the maw of the legislation\u2014and apparently unable to see the big picture. Moreover, it\u2019s virtually impossible for Congress to write a coherent complex piece of legislation. In this case, particularly large interests are at play: the insurance companies (who would still play the major role as insurers), manufacturers of medical equipment, hospitals, drug companies, religious organizations\u2014and without its own bill the administration had limited leverage over numerous strong-minded legislators. Five hundred and thirty five people are unlikely to produce a fine Swiss watch.\n\nBut Obama and his staff\u2019s failures at governing led to the disastrous roll-out of the exchanges. Simply put: they went about it all wrong. Such a major part of the president\u2019s signature initiative should never have been assigned to the multilayered bureaucracy, however honorable and well-intended its people are. Obama needed to put in charge a single strong figure who could go straight to him and was known to have his backing\u2014and, obviously, knew enough about the complexities of such a large high tech program. The president needed to be kept very informed as to where matters stood. (The White House put about after the calamity became clear to the public that the president had occasionally asked how things were going; this wasn\u2019t reassuring.) Short of appointing a strong outside person, the president could have relied on a figure such as Joe Califano, Lyndon Johnson\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser, to be on top of the implementation and raise hell if the people charged with building the exchanges weren\u2019t doing the job.\n\nIt remains unclear to this day who in the Obama White House was responsible for seeing to it that the program was on schedule and working as it should\u2014or if anyone was. There\u2019s no sign that the president\u2019s serial chiefs of staff\u2014after Emanuel, who left in October, 2010, and then Bill Daley, Jack Lew, and now Denis McDonough\u2014were engaged in any meaningful way.\n\nAnother misfire was the brobdingnagian nature of the Obama plan, like that of the Clintons\u2019 plan before it: wonks were in charge and there seems to have been little checking to see if real people could handle it. While the Affordable Care Act was moving through Congress, White House aides explained that it would all be very simple: the consumer would go online and pick out a health plan from among choices\u2014just as, they said, people do with Expedia. Quite apart from the federal web site\u2019s own flaws, the Obama plan suffered from an overestimation of computer literacy among the public at large.\n\nFinally, the president\u2019s offhanded way of dealing with Congress in the first term has weakened his hand with members of his own party in the second term, at precisely the point when he needs them most. The very self-contained Obama, less needy than many of his predecessors, and his impatience with some of the folderol of politics\u2014albeit it\u2019s his chosen line of work\u2014left him with few senators or House members, or even outside groups, who would go to the barricades for him when he needed them in the second term. One can understand and even sympathize with Obama\u2019s view of listening to tedious people who lecture him on how things should be done (they might actually know more than he, but he doesn\u2019t care to be told), but it\u2019s been very costly for him.\n\nThe health care law is a delicate instrument, built on sets of assumptions which may not pan out, or which could be undermined if out of panic the president or Congress fiddles with the law. The anecdotes about people losing their policies have frequently been over-simplified, but make for more dramatic news stories than the advances already achieved under the law; there\u2019s been little attention to the already slowing rate of growth in the cost of health care\u2014one of the law\u2019s major goals.\n\nObama\u2019s governing style in his first term lit the fuse for his second term. Politically-driven decisions on the health care law along with a failure to understand some of the rudiments of governing have resulted in his current difficulties. It\u2019s far from over of course, but should his proudest achievement fail to work\u2014its outcome not at all certain at this point\u2014the rest of what he does in his second term may not matter much.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Elizabeth Drew", "og": {"site_name": "The New York Review of Books", "description": "Despite all the lamentations about Barack Obama having second-term blues and bad luck, it\u2019s what happened during the first term that matters most.
