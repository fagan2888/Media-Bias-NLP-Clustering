Many rely on the recommendation of a lawyer, real-estate agent or mortgage broker.\n\nThe executives said expenses don\u2019t cross over into an improper effort to buy business that is paid for through excessive insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cYou market your product so you have a fair shot at getting the business,\u201d said Joseph DeSalvo, a senior legal counsel representing First American at the hearing set up by New York\u2019s top financial-services watchdog, Benjamin Lawsky. \u201cIt\u2019s not a quid pro quo,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf not entertainment, we\u2019d have to market in some other fashion,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New York regulators pressed the two big insurers on whether their sales people actually talked business during the course of a sporting event, and whether the insurers\u2019 sales people always accompanied the real estate lawyers to the events\u2013or if tickets qualified as a gift.\n\nThe insurers said it is their practice for sales people to be in attendance and played down the value of the transactions.\n\n\u201cA lot of these are $20 lunches,\u201d not something extravagant, said Steven Day, an executive with Fidelity National.\n\nNew York DFS associate counsel Ellen Buxbaum asked First American if its entertainment budget included \u201ctaking clients to gentlemen\u2019s clubs.\u201d Mr. DeSalvo responded, \u201cnot under the present administration.\u201d\n\nMs. Buxbaum said the department had received information from its recent information requests of the insurers indicating such an expenditure.\n\nIn a subsequent interview, Mr. DeSalvo added: \u201cAll I know is that this type of expense isn\u2019t authorized by the company.\u201d He said: \u201cI can\u2019t say if it occurred.\u201d\n\nMr. Lawsky\u2019s staff has been analyzing information hauled in from subpoenas served on dozens of agents who sell title insurance, as well as information requests dispatched to insurers, as the department seeks to determine if rates are reasonable to consumers.\n\nTypically, title insurers pay little in claims costs because the agents and insurers typically catch problems in advance. The industry says much of the premium goes to cover the upfront title search.\n\nIn most states, agents carry out the title searches for the insurers because local public records to be searched\u2014deeds, mortgages, wills, court judgments. The agents retain the bulk of the premium paid by the consumer.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Big title insurers defended their spending millions of dollars on meals and sporting events, as regulators grilled them about whether home buyers are wrongly being stuck with the entertainment costs.", "title": "Title Insurers Defend Practices as Scrutiny Heats Up", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/10/title-insurers-defend-practices-as-scrutiny-heats-up/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Title Insurers Defend Practices as Scrutiny Heats Up", "description": "Big title insurers defended their spending millions of dollars on meals and sporting events, as regulators grilled them about whether home buyers are wrongly being stuck with the entertainment costs.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Leslie Scism", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Big title insurers defended their spending millions of dollars on meals and sporting events, as regulators grilled them about whether home buyers are wrongly being stuck with the entertainment costs.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2013-12-10T19:55:57-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/10/title-insurers-defend-practices-as-scrutiny-heats-up/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-13086", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Big title insurers defended their spending millions of dollars on meals and sporting events, as regulators grilled them about whether home buyers are wrongly being stuck with the entertainment costs.", "title": "Title Insurers Defend Practices as Scrutiny Heats Up", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/12/10/title-insurers-defend-practices-as-scrutiny-heats-up/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-13086", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-12-10T19:59:14-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99c4\"", "article_summary": "Typically, title insurers pay little in claims costs because the agents and insurers typically catch problems in advance.\nProperty buyers obtain title insurance to guarantee clear ownership of real estate, paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars for the protection depending on the property\u2019s value.\nBig title insurers defended their spending millions of dollars on meals and sporting events, as regulators grilled them about whether home buyers are wrongly being stuck with the entertainment costs.\nIn most states, agents carry out the title searches for the insurers because local public records to be searched\u2014deeds, mortgages, wills, court judgments.\nThe insurers said it is their practice for sales people to be in attendance and played down the value of the transactions."}
