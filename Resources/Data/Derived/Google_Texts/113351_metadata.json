It took 10 years and the zeal and commitment of old and new leadership to bring the chapter back together to advocate for health-care needs that directly affect minorities throughout the region and state. It is composed of registered nurses, LPNs, student nurses and retirees.\n\n\u201cPeople have been asking for it for some time,\u201d Haney said. \u201cWe saw the need in our community.\u201d\n\nHaney works as director of Cardiology Services and Respiratory Care Services at Progress Hospital in O\u2019Fallon and Barnes-Jewish St. Peters Hospital. She leads and manages cardiac catheterization labs, cardiopulmonary rehab teams, invasive and non-invasive cardiology, and respiratory therapy teams at each location.\n\nThe association works on health policy, community health and scholarships.\n\n\u201cThere is a true lack of advanced, prepared minority nurses \u2013 nurses who have their PhDs, their MSNs \u2013 and that impacts our nursing students and our next generation of leaders,\u201d Haney said.\n\nShe is a strong advocate for nurses going back to school to get their master\u2019s and doctorate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that you can become a nurse as an associate\u2019s degree nurse, or a licensed practical nurse, but I also want us to teach and continue to climb and move, because they are looking for us,\u201d Haney said.\n\n\u201cThere is a true need for nursing faculty of all demographics, especially when it comes to minority populations and minority representation.\u201d\n\nHaney earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a Master of Science in Nursing from University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. She is currently pursuing a doctor of Nursing Practice from the University of Virginia.\n\nShe urged the public to seek preventive care, now accessible under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis is something that so many organizations have wanted for so long, because if we can get our patients, regardless of race, to doctors and that yearly physical \u2013 get that blood draw, find out if there is anything that looks off \u2013 that is so imperative,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOne thing that any doctor, any nurse, hates to see is somebody come into the emergency room for something that we know could have been managed months before \u2013 weeks before \u2013 and we are seeing them in a crisis state.\u201d\n\nHaney is past president of the National Black Nurses Association and the National Student Nurses Association (NSNA). Haney served as a member of the American Nurses Association Congress on Nursing Practice and Economics and as trustee for the Missouri Nurses Foundation. Haney currently serves as vice president of the Foundation of the NSNA.\n\nIn the community, BNA of Greater St. Louis is involved in health fairs, expos, health screenings and educational forums. The front-line nursing organization also works with area first-responders in North St. Louis County. They partner with the Black Jack Fire Protection District, holding meetings in their space.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve personally worked with them to pass some initiatives,\u201d Haney said, \u201cand they are good colleagues and allies in taking care of the community in North County.\u201d\n\nThe association educates and lobbies to reduce health disparities among underserved communities. It advocates for legislative passage of Medicaid expansion in Missouri and for more mental health services.\n\n\u201cI think about mental health services that continue to be reduced and how this impacts our black nurses and how it impacts our African-American population\u201d Haney said. \u201cAnd I know there is a huge stigma in the African-American community about mental health, but we desperately need it. I worry about our access to health care.\u201d\n\nYou can find the Black Nurses Association of Greater St. Louis on Facebook and at its website at http://www.bnastlouis.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe are back on the scene \u2013 we never went away,\u201d Kenya Haney said of the Black Nurses Association of Greater St. Louis, where she serves as president. \u201cThe black nurses have always been here, but we are back to help.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "St. Louis American", "description": "\u201cWe are back on the scene \u2013 we never went away,\u201d Kenya Haney said of the Black Nurses Association of Greater St. Louis, where she serves as president. \u201cThe black nurses have always been here, but we are back to help.\u201d", "title": "Black Nurses president pushes for professional development", "url": "http://www.stlamerican.com/business/article_92aaf7da-e952-11e4-a90f-4723b958c569.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/stlamerican.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/82/482b4490-e94c-11e4-997e-1f72ab46fd1f/5538370087d4a.image.jpg?resize=620%2C413", "height": 413}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@stlouisamerican", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 157786209183}, "keywords": "business", "news_keywords": "business"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e25\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are back on the scene \u2013 we never went away,\u201d Kenya Haney said of the Black Nurses Association of Greater St. Louis, where she serves as president.\nI worry about our access to health care.\u201dYou can find the Black Nurses Association of Greater St. Louis on Facebook and at its website at http://www.bnastlouis.org.\n\u201cThe black nurses have always been here, but we are back to help.\u201dAging took its toll on the initial St. Louis chapter of the National Black Nurses Association, founded in 1972, which caused the chapter to dissolve in 2004, Haney said.\nHaney served as a member of the American Nurses Association Congress on Nursing Practice and Economics and as trustee for the Missouri Nurses Foundation.\n\u201cI think about mental health services that continue to be reduced and how this impacts our black nurses and how it impacts our African-American population\u201d Haney said."}
