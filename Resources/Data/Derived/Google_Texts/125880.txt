Denver firefighters quickly doused a huge blaze that could be seen for miles and destroyed construction for a multifamily apartment complex at South Dexter Street and East Kentucky Avenue overnight.

No one was injured in the blaze.

The three alarm fire broke out at about 11:30 p.m. and was under control by 12:10 a.m.

“The fire consumed the entire project,” Denver Fire Department Division Chief Joseph Gonzales said.

Investigators have not confirmed reports that something exploded at the scene, Gonzales said, but “it was a construction site so there may have been some compressed gas.”

“The fire was brought under control pretty quickly,” Gonzales said.

There was a little damage to the exterior of the Kentucky Ridge complex to the south and some damage to another complex to the east.

The complex was approximately 150 feet long and 100 feet deep, he said.The fire is under investigation.
