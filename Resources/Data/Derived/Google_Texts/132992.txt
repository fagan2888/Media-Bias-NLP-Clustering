SNYDER — Among Ted Cruz’ goals while in office are to stop the Affordable Care Act and secure the country’s borders, a spokeswoman for the U.S. senator said Wednesday morning.

Shea Woodard-Hall, Cruz’s West Texas outreach director, said during a public meeting in Snyder that Cruz remains strongly opposed to Obamacare. The Houston Republican is concerned the act has caused Americans to lose jobs and pay higher premiums for their health plans — if they’re able to keep those plans at all — she said.

“He’s always said he’ll never rest until it’s gone,” she said. “He thinks every last word of it should be repealed.”

She identified his other main concerns as:

Immigration

The senator opposes amnesty for residents who are in the country illegally and does not support the arrival of anyone else without permission, Woodard-Hall said.

“We’re not enforcing the laws we already have on the books. We have got to shut the border down,” she said on Cruz’s behalf.

Foreign policy

Cruz supports three main tenets for American policy with other countries, his representative said, including “secure our people, defend our national security interest and not partner with the Islamic republic of Iran.”

“It is critical to reimpose Obama-relaxed sanctions to protect Americans from a nuclear-armed Iran,” she said.

Veterans Affairs

The senator supported a bill President Barack Obama signed Aug. 7 to help overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs, Woodard-Hall said.

“At least it was an interim solution to the veterans crisis,” she said. “Veterans are fighting to keep us safe here and abroad. To come home and not have access to care is a problem to the nation.”

Woodard-Hall’s stop in Snyder was part of a three-city tour Wednesday in West Texas that included Post and Littlefield, according to a statement from the senator’s office.
