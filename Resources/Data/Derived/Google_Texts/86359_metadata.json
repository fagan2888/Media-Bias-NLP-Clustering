Connor has lost nearly 100 pounds since last year when he began having difficulty keeping food down due to a cancer tumor in his esophagus.\n\nJim Connor earned between $50 and $75 a week delivering pizzas in Summerville until a cancer diagnosis sidelined him late last year.\n\nFor help The Access Health Tri-County Network connects uninsured patients in the Lowcountry to the health care services they need. For more information, call 743-2777.\n\nThe problem is \u2014 one of many problems, in fact \u2014 Connor has no health insurance.\n\nHe can\u2019t get a federal discount to purchase an Obamacare policy. He\u2019s 12 years too young for Medicare. His employer doesn\u2019t offer any coverage.\n\nOn Dec. 14, when Connor tried to apply for the low-income Medicaid program at the Dorchester County office, an employee told him he wouldn\u2019t qualify for a policy because he wasn\u2019t disabled or blind.\n\nA spokeswoman for the state Medicaid agency said federal and state requirements prohibit her from discussing the alleged conversation, but as Connor recounts it, the Medicaid employee suggested that he drink some green tea and research his cancer diagnosis online.\n\n\u201cI was in tears,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has no clue.\u201d\n\nIn her Republican address to the nation earlier this month, Gov. Nikki Haley called President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law a disaster. She said it\u2019s a \u201chealth care plan that has made insurance less affordable and doctors less available.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the case for millions of Americans. In South Carolina alone, more than 211,000 men and women have purchased insurance policies through HealthCare.gov since November. The vast majority of them qualify for a substantial federal discount to lower the cost they pay for health coverage.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was designed, in part, to help poor and sick patients pay for health coverage, but Haley\u2019s critique of the health care law isn\u2019t completely off-base. Obamacare isn\u2019t working for everyone, including Jim Connor.\n\nHe\u2019s one of an estimated 123,000 South Carolinians who continue to fall through the cracks of the health care system.\n\nWhile the health care law\u2019s advocates blame Haley and her Republican colleagues for this \u201ccoverage gap,\u201d Connor is more concerned about getting the cancer treatment he needs to survive.\n\nOnly hospital charity can save him now.\n\n\u2018Going to die\u2019\n\nMore than a year ago, Connor started losing weight. That was the first sign something was wrong.\n\nIn July, when he hit 190 pounds \u2014 down from his normal 220 pounds \u2014 he decided he should see a doctor. He\u2019d put off scheduling an earlier appointment because he wasn\u2019t insured and couldn\u2019t afford to pay cash for an office visit.\n\n\u201cThey wanted like $400 or $500 bucks, and I didn\u2019t have that kind of money,\u201d he said.\n\nConnor finally called the Fetter Health Care Network, which accepts low-income, uninsured patients, but found out he wouldn\u2019t be seen at the Summerville clinic until October. So he waited and he kept losing weight.\n\nThe Fetter physician ultimately prescribed Connor some medicine to control his chronic vomiting. The clinic also referred him to a local gastroenterologist. Connor waited another two months for that appointment.\n\n\u201cI was down to 130-something (pounds),\u201d he said.\n\nIn December, an endoscopy and follow-up biopsy revealed that Connor had esophageal cancer.\n\nHe remembers the oncologist told him, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get your chemo and radiation, you\u2019re going to die.\u201d\n\n\u2018Nothing for me\u2019\n\nIf Landmark Pizza offered its employees health insurance, or if the Affordable Care Act had been left untouched by the U.S. Supreme Court, or if South Carolina leaders had expanded Medicaid eligibility, or if the 2010 federal law had been written differently to begin with, Connor might not have cancer today.\n\nIn other words, if any one of those things had happened, it\u2019s likely that Connor would have had health insurance when he needed it. He could have seen a doctor when he first suspected he was sick. Maybe his physicians could have caught the cancer during an earlier stage.\n\nThis is speculative. Even now, Connor can\u2019t predict the outcome of his case. His doctors have not yet offered a prognosis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell,\u201d he said.\n\nConnor\u2019s boss, Bill Olson, owns Landmark Pizza in Summerville. Olson said he noticed Connor\u2019s weight loss about a year ago.\n\n\u201cHe was telling me that he was having a hard time keeping food down,\u201d Olson said. \u201cEveryone was saying, \u2018You need to go check that out.\u2019 \u201d\n\nConnor tried to buy an Obamacare policy on HealthCare.gov, but he couldn\u2019t afford any of the plans.\n\n\u201cIt was going to be like $400-something-dollars a month,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ll get a subsidy.\u2019 Nothing for me, though.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Connor, that\u2019s how the health care law works. The precise language of the Affordable Care Act only provides subsidies to patients whose income falls between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThat means a single man, like Connor, could earn between $11,770 and $47,080 a year and qualify for a tax credit to buy health insurance through the federal marketplace.\n\nBut the 53-year-old earns far less than $11,770 a year. Because his income falls outside that specific range, he is technically too poor to qualify for the financial aid.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s architects intentionally wrote the law this way, although, in retrospect, the language has become problematic. They agreed that the very poorest patients shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything for health insurance. They wouldn\u2019t need a subsidy. Instead, they would qualify for Medicaid.\n\nIn many states, that\u2019s exactly how the law works.\n\nBut a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision rendered \u201cMedicaid expansion\u201d an optional provision of the Affordable Care Act. South Carolina Republicans have opted out.\n\nHaley contends that this state can\u2019t afford for the program to grow any larger \u2014 even if the federal government pays for South Carolina to expand eligibility.\n\nMore than 1 million South Carolinians, mostly children, are already enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, 15 other states aren\u2019t adopting Medicaid expansion, either. Three states are still discussing the issue.\n\nFor now, eligibility rules in South Carolina remain fairly strict. With few exceptions, adults who aren\u2019t raising dependent children don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid coverage in South Carolina.\n\nConnor, whose only son is 28, learned that the hard way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been independent all my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to take care of myself, and I don\u2019t like to be a burden or get a hand-out from anybody, you know? I\u2019ve always been a hard worker. I never planned on something like this to happen.\u201d\n\nCharity care\n\nSouth Carolina hospitals also disagree with Haley\u2019s hard line on Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been advocating for the Medicaid expansion for years now and hope that it will still be a possibility and a reality someday,\u201d said Mark Dickson, the vice president for mission at Roper St. Francis. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a simple matter of logic.\u201d\n\nIn theory, Medicaid expansion would reduce the amount of charity care that hospitals now provide for their indigent patients. The government reimburses hospitals for some of this uncompensated care, but not all of it.\n\nIn 2014, Roper St. Francis estimates it provided $48 million worth of charity care to the community. Medical University Hospital reports that unpaid patient debt and patient financial assistance cost the hospital $80 million that year.\n\nThe only reason Connor has reason to hope that his cancer will be cured is because of hospital charity. He qualified for free treatment through a program called Access Health.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve helped over 3,000 patients over the last year,\u201d said Renee Linyard, program director for the Access Health Tri-County Network. Six of those patients, like Connor, have been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nAccess Health screens uninsured patients in the Lowcountry who can\u2019t afford to pay for health care services. The program connects them to doctors and hospitals in the community to provide the care free of charge.\n\nIn Connor\u2019s case, Roper St. Francis will cover the cost of his cancer treatment.\n\nScott Broome, the hospital system\u2019s director of cancer services, estimates Connor\u2019s bill alone will exceed \u201ctens of thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s probably a conservative estimate.\n\nOn Friday, Connor had already spent one week in Bon Secours St. Francis Hospital in West Ashley, hooked up to a feeding tube. His physicians need to figure out why his stomach keeps filling up with fluid. Until then, they can\u2019t treat the cancer with chemotherapy and radiation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just the most wonderful people in the world, the nurses and the doctors and the staff here,\u201d Connor said. \u201cThey\u2019re really just good people.\u201d\n\n\u2018Good enough reason\u2019\n\nWhen the Medicaid employee told Connor in December that he wouldn\u2019t qualify for coverage, he applied for the program anyway and returned his paperwork to the office.\n\nApparently, they never processed it.\n\nIn early January, Connor received a phone call from a stranger named Gale Deckard.\n\nDeckard, who also lives in Summerville, explained that she had tried filling out an application of her own, but an employee at the Medicaid office had inadvertently given her the paperwork that Connor had already completed. It included his employment history, financial records, social security card and contact information.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the paperwork, and saw Landmark Pizza, I thought, \u2018I bet we know him,\u2019 \u201d Deckard said. \u201cHe delivered pizzas to us for quite a few years.\u201d\n\nDeckard wanted to let Connor know that the Medicaid office had violated his privacy.\n\n\u201cI was just so grateful for what she did,\u201d Connor said.\n\nColleen Mullis, a spokeswoman for the state Medicaid agency, did not indicate if the department had been made aware of this privacy breach.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act prohibits state agencies, hospitals, health insurance companies and health care providers from disclosing a patient\u2019s personal information. All agency employees are trained to understand the patient privacy law, Mullis said.\n\nThe S.C. Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Medicaid in this state, processed two privacy complaints filed by beneficiaries or applicants in 2015, Mullis said.\n\nWhen Connor found out his own privacy had been breached, he said he was frustrated. But he\u2019s not mad \u2014 not about any of it, he said.\n\nThese days, he\u2019s leaning on his faith and has been encouraging friends with acid reflux to see a doctor. He believes his own acid reflux caused the esophageal cancer.\n\n\u201cI have strong faith in God. ... Things happen for a reason. We just don\u2019t know what the reason is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this has happened so I can help somebody, that\u2019s good enough reason for me.\u201d\n\nReach Lauren Sausser at 843-937-5598.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare \u2018coverage gap\u2019 excludes 123,000 South Carolinians from health insurance, including Jim Connor, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,Health insurance,Medicaid expansion,Obamacare,Roper St. Francis", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Jim Connor earned between $50 and $75 a week delivering pizzas in Summerville until a cancer diagnosis sidelined him late last year.", "title": "Obamacare \u2018coverage gap\u2019 excludes 123,000 South Carolinians from health insurance, including Jim Connor", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160123/160129774/obamacare-x2018-coverage-gap-x2019-excludes-123000-south-carolinians-from-health-insurance-including-jim-connor", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160123/PC16/160129774/AR/0/AR-160129774.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160123/PC16/160129774/AR/0/AR-160129774.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jim Connor earned between $50 and $75 a week delivering pizzas in Summerville until a cancer diagnosis sidelined him late last year.", "title": "Obamacare \u2018coverage gap\u2019 excludes 123,000 South Carolinians from health insurance, including Jim Connor", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160123/PC16/160129774/AR/0/AR-160129774.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160129774}}, "keywords": "Obamacare \u2018coverage gap\u2019 excludes 123,000 South Carolinians from health insurance, including Jim Connor , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Affordable Care Act,Health insurance,Medicaid expansion,Obamacare,Roper St. Francis", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T17:19:00Z", "author": "Lauren Sausser"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Jim Connor earned between $50 and $75 a week delivering pizzas in Summerville until a cancer diagnosis sidelined him late last year."}, "article_summary": "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act prohibits state agencies, hospitals, health insurance companies and health care providers from disclosing a patient\u2019s personal information.\nHe\u2019s one of an estimated 123,000 South Carolinians who continue to fall through the cracks of the health care system.\nNikki Haley called President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law a disaster.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ll get a subsidy.\u2019 Nothing for me, though.\u201dUnfortunately for Connor, that\u2019s how the health care law works.\nFor help The Access Health Tri-County Network connects uninsured patients in the Lowcountry to the health care services they need."}
