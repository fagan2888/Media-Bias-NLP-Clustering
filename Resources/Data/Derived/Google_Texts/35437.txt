Yesterday, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month, the White House was illuminated pink.

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies are now restricted from charging women higher costs simply because they are women, or because of any pre-existing conditions, including breast cancer. And, preventive care, such as well-women visits and mammograms, are now free for women with no out-of-pocket costs.

These preventive services are critical to keeping women healthy. For example, breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women and the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the US, after lung cancer. But when breast cancer is caught early and treated, survival rates can be near 100 percent.
