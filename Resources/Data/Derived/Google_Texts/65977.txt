A Vernon High School student who lost her leg in a hunting accident last weekend is showing signs of improvement.

Andrea Wright accidentally shot herself in the right leg as she was trying to get onto a four-wheeler to go duck hunting.

She was life-flighted to Pensacola where doctors had to amputate her leg, but besides a slight fever Sunday, doctors say she's doing better than they expected.

On Thursday, they asked her to take 50 steps and she took 200 instead.

Fundraisers raised more than $2,700 dollars for Andrea and her family, but it's not too late.

A car wash and cook-out benefit for Andrea next Saturday is moving from the Old Tom Thumb in downtown Vernon to the VHS bus loop.

The event starts at 10:00 a.m.

On February 13th, Vernon High School softball players will be wearing matching camo-jerseys at their game.

All the gate proceeds will also go to Andrea.
