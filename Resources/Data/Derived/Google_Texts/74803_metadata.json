Unfortunately for UnitedHealth, there aren\u2019t as many ObamaCare customers who are willing to pay up for broad provider networks, and those who are tend to be high-cost patients.\n\nInvestors greeted Centene\u2019s earnings news by bidding up shares 6.1% to 66.71, the highest since Jan. 5. Likewise, shares of Molina Healthcare (MOH), another low-cost insurer with Medicaid roots, got a 3.4% lift to a six-month high ahead of its earnings report on Thursday.\n\nWhile UnitedHealth had amassed 795,000 exchange customers in its 34 states at the end of the first quarter, Centene said it had 683,000 customers in 15 states where it participates, up roughly 55% from a year earlier, according to ACASignups.net. The total includes exchange customers of Health Net, which Centene snapped up in a $6 billion merger that recently landed the company on the S&P 500.\n\nThe generally accepted view is that Centene has simply outsmarted UnitedHealth, but there\u2019s more to the story than that. There\u2019s growing recognition among industry experts and even the Obama administration that the deck has been stacked against insurers like UnitedHealth and nonprofit Blue Cross Blue Shield, with plans which have attracted sicker customers.\n\nCustomer risk was supposed to be balanced among all insurers through ObamaCare\u2019s permanent risk-adjustment program that transfers funds from carriers which attract low-cost customers to those that are a magnet for the sick. But risk-adjustment isn\u2019t working as intended for a variety of reasons, including the failure to consider customer use of prescription drugs in weighing an insurer\u2019s risk.\n\nTo the extent the rules shift, the changes may take some of the wind out of the sails of Centene.\n\nOne potential red flag comes from New Hampshire, where Minuteman Health said it plans to hike 2017 ObamaCare premiums by 45% \u2014 if it faces a $3,000-per-customer risk-adjustment charge, as it expects. HHS will report risk-adjustment results for 2015 on June 30. That may also be a big day for Centene.\n\nAnother part of the Centene story is more complicated than it appears. The company, through its Ambetter plans, is the lowest-cost insurer in places like Seattle, Miami, Atlanta and Jackson, Miss. But its pricing decisions don\u2019t always seem to be in the best interest of customers.\n\nWhile the cheapest annual bronze-plan premium (before subsidies) rose about $250 in Mississippi for a $25,000-earner this year, the subsidy fell $300, yielding a $550 increase. That came about because the subsidies are tied to the cost of the second-cheapest silver plan, and Centene cornered the market on low-cost plans in a number of states this year by attaching bronze-like deductibles ($5,500 and $6,500) to silver plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Centene looks like the mirror image of UnitedHealth when it comes to the ObamaCare exchange business, but the truth is more complicated.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Centene looks like the mirror image of UnitedHealth when it comes to the ObamaCare exchange business, but the truth is more complicated.
