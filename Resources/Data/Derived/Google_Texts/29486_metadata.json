He is still in campaign mode. He is the Prime Minister of the country. He should act as the Prime Minister, not as a Leader of Opposition,\" said party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed.\n\nAddressing BJP workers in Panaji, Modi had earlier said, \"I have taken over the reins of the country in circumstances when there is nothing left behind by the previous government. They left everything empty. The country's financial health has hit the bottom.\"\n\nAhmed also hit out at the BJP-led NDA government over a circular reportedly issued by the Prime Minister's Office asking ministers to give a notice 10 days prior to undertaking a foreign tour and submit an outcome report upon their return.\n\n\"Modi government has begun hoodwinking people. Such directions (are intended) to throw dust into people's eyes. No minister goes to a foreign country all of a sudden without the consent of the Prime Minister.\n\n\"A proposal is moved and then it is okayed by the PMO (and) the Ministry of External Affairs. The PMO is always informed, nobody goes all of a sudden,\" Ahmed said.\n\nAccording to reports, a circular issued by the Cabinet Secretariat says that proposals seeking approval of the Prime Minister for official visits abroad should be forwarded 10 days in advance as against the earlier stipulation of five days.\n\nIt also said that, unlike the earlier practice of just informing the PMO about such visits, the proposal seeking Prime Minister's approval should incorporate details of the tasks to be accomplished as part of the tour.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remarks that the previous UPA dispensation...", "author": "PTI", "og": {"site_name": "The Financial Express", "description": "Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remarks that the previous UPA dispensation...", "title": "Narendra Modi still in \\'campaign mode, can\\'t believe he is PM\\': Congress", "url": "http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/narendra-modi-still-in-campaign-mode-cant-believe-he-is-pm-congress/1260532", "image": "http://static.financialexpress.com/pic/uploadedImages/mediumImages/M_Id_473286_Narendra_Modi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Last-Modified": "Sat Jun 14 2014. 20:41 hrs", "keywords": "Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, Congress, UPA, BJP government", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Narendra Modi still in \\", "news_keywords": "Narendra Modi, Prime Minister, Congress, UPA, BJP government"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda00a\"", "article_summary": "\"It seems Modi-ji still can't believe that he is the Prime Minister.\nHe should act as the Prime Minister, not as a Leader of Opposition,\" said party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed.\nTaking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remarks that the previous UPA dispensation led by it had \"left everything empty\", Congress today said he is still in \"campaign mode\" and cannot believe that he is now leading the government.\nNo minister goes to a foreign country all of a sudden without the consent of the Prime Minister.\nHe is the Prime Minister of the country."}
