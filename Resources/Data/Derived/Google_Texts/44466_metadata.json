Getty Images\n\nUsers unhappy with Apple\u2019s gift can\u2019t return it, but they now can make it disappear.\n\nIn what CEO Tim Cook described as \u201cthe biggest release in the history of music,\u201d Apple last week said it would give away as many as 500 million copies of \u201cSongs of Innocence,\u201d the 13th album from Irish rock band U2.\n\nThe album automatically appeared in users\u2019 iTunes library, and on their \u201cpurchased\u201d page in the iTunes store. Users had to click on it to download the album. But even if they didn\u2019t download it, the album remained in the library and on the \u201cpurchased\u201d page without a way to delete it.\n\nThat incited protests from users who are not U2 fans, or Apple\u2019s ability to control what appears in iTunes.\n\nI personally find the iTunes auto-add of \u2018Songs of Innocence\u2019 creepy and invasive. Give people a choice, don\u2019t force it on them.
