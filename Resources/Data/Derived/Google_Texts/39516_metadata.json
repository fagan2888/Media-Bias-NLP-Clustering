Not in 2016 MORE on global trade.\n\nCramer said the United States has been bested on every trade deal going back to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which was completed more than 20 years ago during President Clinton's first term.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe argues that Trump is finally shedding light on how bad the United States has been at negotiating trade agreements over the years.\n\n\"Look, we lose on every trade deal,\" Cramer said Thursday on \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"I always ask all these people from either party: Name me one trade deal we have had a surplus on in the last decade. They can't name any,\" he said.\n\n\"I always find it amusing to think people don't seem to mind that we lose in these deals because we're able to export a lot of premium products that are not made necessarily by people in our workforce.\"\n\nCramer said Trump was the only person to discuss the trade deficit before hitting the campaign trail.\n\nDuring his show \"Mad Money\" on Wednesday, Cramer said the U.S. government has been \"horrendous\" at negotiating deals and that U.S. workers have been \"bamboozled\" for years into thinking that if the trade deals were good for large multinational corporations then they must benefit them and the broader economy, too.\n\nCramer said \"there are very few people I have met, and I've seen it on both sides, that know how to negotiate.\n\n\"Say what you want about Trump, I agree with him totally about these trade deals,\" he said during Wednesday's show.\n\nTrump has said repeatedly he would scrap and renegotiate all U.S. trade deals if he wins the White House.\n\nHe said that Trump has been talking about trade for years and his stance shouldn't surprise anybody.\n\n\"People should understand this has been his view from day one,\" Cramer said. \"It has always been pro-worker,\" he said.\n\n\"Have people not been paying attention to what this man has been saying about the trade deals? He's been right the whole way.\"\n\nDemocratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton Hillary Rodham ClintonWhy superdelegates shouldn't support Sanders Young Turks host offers million for Trump, Sanders debate An all-female ticket?
