Within a few months, the century-old newspaper had decided radical change was needed: abandoning daily printing and diving headfirst into the web. Although the Monitor was always an unusual newspaper \u2014 distributed by mail, global in scope, subsidized by the Church of Christ, Scientist \u2014 it was a harbinger for some of the print-reductions we\u2019ve seen in places like New Orleans, Portland, Cleveland, and Toronto since. The Monitor has indeed built traffic to csmonitor.com to many multiples of its previous level, as well as expanded into speciality paid-products like the Frontiers Market Monitor.\n\nThis month, Yemma steps down after five years as editor. Before his editorship, he also spent 20 years working for news organizations including The Boston Globe, The Dallas Morning News, and United Press International. \u201cI think the Monitor is in amazingly good hands and we\u2019re on a pretty good glide-path too. It seemed like a good time to step down,\u201d Yemma told me.\n\nI recently spoke with Yemma about the early days of the print-to-digital transition of the Monitor, the role of quizzes and games in serious journalism, and how the Monitor has diversified its revenue stream and decreased its subsidy from the church. Here\u2019s an edited transcript of our conversation.\n\nJustin Ellis: The Monitor was one of the first American newspapers to shift away from daily print. When you moved from the rhythms of a print production cycle to something web-centric, what was the biggest challenge?\n\nJohn Yemma: It was the speed. Everything really moves faster. We were doing five-days a week in print. We had a website \u2014 it was a pretty good website, but it wasn\u2019t a robust website. So when you put the website first and then go through the process of learning SEO and all the best practices for web-first journalism \u2014 and there\u2019s some cultural growing pains in this \u2014 you learn how to do things faster. : It was the speed. Everything really moves faster. We were doing five-days a week in print. We had a website \u2014 it was a pretty good website, but it wasn\u2019t a robust website. So when you put the website first and then go through the process of learning SEO and all the best practices for web-first journalism \u2014 and there\u2019s some cultural growing pains in this \u2014 you learn how to do things faster. We were known for moderately longform journalism \u2014 I\u2019d say the 1,000- to 1,500-word analytical article about some international news. The articles shortened, but the trick was to figure out how to make the same value in 500\u2013700 words, or even shorter sometimes. Or multiple posts during the day of 200 or 300 words that accumulated and ended up telling the story. I\u2019d say the biggest shift was the acculturation in the newsroom. We didn\u2019t go into it with a full idea of what the best practices were. This was 2008 \u2014 there were of course many web-oriented journalistic operations, from Slate to Huffington Post, but we had to adapt it to our values and our culture, and that was this humane, thoughtful, analytical, globally-oriented coverage.\n\nEllis: Where do you start a process like that?\n\nYemma: Where you start is you take an inventory of what your capabilities are, what your talent is \u2014 you really have to look at the staff. We don\u2019t have a big staff. I think when I came in we had 90 people on the journalism side, and now I think we are at 79 or 78. Part of that staff reduction is because we went from five-days a week in print to one-day a week in print. We didn\u2019t need quite as many production people on the paper side. : Where you start is you take an inventory of what your capabilities are, what your talent is \u2014 you really have to look at the staff.

Part of that staff reduction is because we went from five-days a week in print to one-day a week in print. We didn\u2019t need quite as many production people on the paper side. Basically, understand your talent pool and understand that you\u2019re gonna have to do some sorting of that over time. There\u2019s gonna be new hires, those hires are probably going to be younger people, and if they\u2019re younger they\u2019re probably a little more web-oriented. That mix changes over time. We didn\u2019t try to force that mix. We didn\u2019t say goodbye to a lot of older people and just hire younger people. Trending stories, for us, they act as the top of a very wide funnel that attracts people to our journalism through aggregators and social media and other places. Then the trick is to build in enticements and referrals so that they get interested in our longer-form journalism. So those journalists that are good at the longer-form journalism, that\u2019s their opportunity to develop. There are intermediate steps. There are multipliers along the way, like quizzes and lists, and so forth. And we do those. But if you take a look at our site, you see that our quizzes and lists aren\u2019t the \u201c20 things your cat did this summer,\u201d it\u2019s the \u201c5 things you need to know about the Affordable Care Act,\u201d or \u201cHow much do you know about the Middle East?\u201d That\u2019s the intermediate step. The top of the funnel, the wide part, is trending news, the intermediate step is those multipliers. What we\u2019re trying to do is bring people into a deeper relationship with our in-depth stories. Those are the ones we would typically do for the weekly magazine, which we\u2019ll post online after the due date of the magazine. That\u2019s the kind of piece, if we can get people to really read it \u2014 those cover stories, the deeper pieces, researched out of Baghdad or Afghanistan \u2014 those are the ones that are really our signature pieces we\u2019re trying to bring people into a relationship with.\n\nEllis: As a newspaper veteran, what was your first reaction to doing things like lists and quizzes?\n\nYemma: Even if you end up as a journalist doing big important stories over time, you start to know you have to have all of it. Whether you\u2019re at the Globe or The Dallas Morning News, you have to have a robust sports operation, because that\u2019s something that draws people in \u2014 and maybe they\u2019ll read the story from city hall because of that. : Even if you end up as a journalist doing big important stories over time, you start to know you have to have all of it.

So I think it\u2019s just a matter of the type of list or the type of multiplier you\u2019re doing. If you can teach with it, if you can help educate people about parts of the world that it would be good for them to know about, or policies, or social issues they need to know about, I think that\u2019s a form of journalism. It\u2019s just a different form of storytelling. It\u2019s a more interactive form, and just because it\u2019s fun doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not useful. I don\u2019t think I was averse to that. I went through the same evolution that everyone did in the middle of the \u201990s on as the Internet came in: staring in awe at Netscape and wondering how this works; going through the whole process of thinking the Internet was interesting but not necessarily seriousg and finding out it\u2019s this huge disruptor that was going to change our industry completely.\n\nEllis: Break down for me the revenue mix for the Monitor.\n\nYemma: We have subscriptions to our weekly news magazine \u2014 we have about 50,000 subscribers. We have a paid newsletter called : We have subscriptions to our weekly news magazine \u2014 we have about 50,000 subscribers. We have a paid newsletter called The Daily News Briefing , and it\u2019s delivered by email every day. About 10,000 people read it; 2,500 are pure-play subscribers, and another 10,000 read it as part of a bundled package. The people who read it with a bundled package tend to be people who are subscribing to other Christian Science publications, all of which are bundled in one package. We get a cross-charge on that. It\u2019s another form of revenue for us. We get revenue from advertising in print. We get revenue from advertising on the web. We have syndication. We still have some traditional syndication, which is other newspapers taking our news service. That\u2019s been re-sorted over the last few years and a lot of our syndication growth is in B2B sales to databases like EBSCO and ProQuest. We pioneered the development of a ProQuest daily summary drawn from our website. They\u2019re the ones who sell microfiches to libraries all over the country, of newspapers. So if you were doing archival research, or academic research, you would access the newspapers that way. It seems like an old-fashioned business, but not all newspaper content from more than 20 years ago is digitized. When we announced we were going web-first, we worked with ProQuest to develop a replica edition of our website every day, which we generate as an XML feed that goes to ProQuest. That was turned into a microfiche. Then we\u2019re developing these new products, like Frontiers Market Monitor and World Business Monitor, which are using our database of international correspondents that we\u2019re working with all the time for our mainstream publications, to do more specialized reporting for business and NGOs and other audiences that really care about international news in a more granular way. And we do get a subsidy from the Christian Science church. It depends on how you calculate it \u2014 I guess you could say it\u2019s about $2.5 million of direct subsidy, and about $5 million that comes from an endowment fund, not unlike an endowment fund a university would have, that throws off that much per year.\n\nEllis: Where did the drive behind the B2B stuff come from?\n\nYemma: It was looking around at the resources we had. Our head of syndication is a guy named : It was looking around at the resources we had. Our head of syndication is a guy named Norm Williams , who worked for EBSCO at one time. He had some sense of what the appetite might be on the business end. He\u2019s working with a guy named Matt Clark , who had been on our international news desk as deputy international news editor, and went back and got an MBA at Babson. The two of them together have really been in charge of developing those products. It takes a lot of knowledge of your audience. You have to understand where the audience is, and you have to think about how you\u2019re going to deliver to them. These are just pure feeds. They aren\u2019t print magazines or print newsletters or anything like that. You can either subscribe to them directly, or a company might buy a certain number.

It\u2019s not unlike what Bloomberg does, where 500 people at IBM, maybe you buy 60 [terminals], and they get the feed every day. But these are very new. It took us a year-and-a-half to develop them and get everything lined up. We went live with content in the late summer, early fall of this year. So we\u2019re just out on the market with them. It\u2019ll probably take several years before they gain a lot of traction.\n\nEllis: The Monitor has had success in attracting audiences through search and you\u2019ve grown traffic over the years. How is the Monitor trying to figure out ways to get at audiences through social media?\n\nYemma: Social is growing, but it\u2019s growing slowly. We have a Facebook feed, and we encourage our reporters and editors to tweet and post things on Facebook. : Social is growing, but it\u2019s growing slowly. We have a Facebook feed, and we encourage our reporters and editors to tweet and post things on Facebook. I think that social media everywhere is becoming more significant, but it\u2019s doing it very slowly. It\u2019s important to be out there. But you have to be really genuine about how you show people social media content. You can\u2019t just throw things up there or spam people. Even if it\u2019s good content, it\u2019s got to be relevant to their lives somehow. It\u2019s a much less direct way. The old model is one-to-many publishing. We\u2019ve learned how to segment the markets now so that we understand what the demographic of our key reader is, and we\u2019re trying to look at them and serve them more. We\u2019re slicing that up into these finer slices, feeds to B2B areas, and even in sponsor plays that we have.\n\nEllis: You guys still have a relatively robust foreign reporting corps. How have you been able to maintain that? What\u2019s the appetite like for foreign coverage?\n\nYemma: We have a mix of fully-paid staff correspondents in foreign bureaus, contractors in foreign bureaus, and then people that we turn to regularly. : We have a mix of fully-paid staff correspondents in foreign bureaus, contractors in foreign bureaus, and then people that we turn to regularly. I think the change over the past few years has been that we have reduced the number of full-fledged bureaus. But there are certain places in the world where you\u2019ve gotta have a full-fledged bureau. China, for instance. You can\u2019t really operate there using a contractor or freelancer. You have to really have a person fully paid up, all the expenses, the translators, all of that. Same in a war zone. Happily, that\u2019s decreasing now, but during the height of the Iraq war we had fully-paid correspondents there. We have a correspondent in the Middle East and Jerusalem. We think it\u2019s good to have our person there right now. In other places, Moscow, we have a great correspondent. For all intents and purposes, he\u2019s on staff, but he\u2019s on contract. Several places in Africa we\u2019ve done that too. You\u2019re always changing what your emphasis is. In the mid-part of the last decade, definitely. We were in Iraq and we were going to stay in Iraq. But everybody has shifted now because the news cycle has changed. We\u2019re committed to international news. We\u2019re trying to keep the expenses down \u2014 it\u2019s very expensive. The New York Times is able to do these fully-funded bureaus everywhere, and that\u2019s great. But even they have contractors and stringers. We just have a different proportion of those. We\u2019re a smaller operation. You\u2019re always changing what your emphasis is.

We\u2019re a smaller operation. These are things an editor always says, but it\u2019s no less true because of it: It\u2019s a global economy. And things like the war on terror and environmental issues, these are all global issues that affect us. The pollution coming out of northern China, or Fukushima, is not insignificant to American readers. But you don\u2019t just want to be American-centric. You want to try to understand those issues because they\u2019re of concern to local people too.\n\nEllis: The Monitor is going through a redesign, and one of the things I noticed is you want to : The Monitor is going through a redesign, and one of the things I noticed is you want to give readers options to take action based on stories. Why shift the relationship between a news organization and readers that way?\n\nYemma: We think that readers, our readers in particular, are oriented toward taking action already. But not all of them see a direct line between news stories they\u2019re reading and the possibility of action they could take. We\u2019re already working with vendors like : We think that readers, our readers in particular, are oriented toward taking action already. But not all of them see a direct line between news stories they\u2019re reading and the possibility of action they could take. We\u2019re already working with vendors like Shoutabout , and we have modules at the bottom of certain pages, saying Do you want to write your congressman, or Would you like to contribute, or whatever. We also are doing a little bit more interactive content with our readers, in a section we call DC Decoder, where we ask readers if they\u2019re interested in telling us what kind of story we should do now. I think we just feel as though we need to get closer to our audience. I think everybody does. I think in the first generation of web-first journalism, we, like everybody else, experimented with comments after articles. And we found that just to be not very useful or enlightening type of process. Our default setting is comments are off. We can turn them on, and we do allow people to turn them on when they want. But it just feels as though that\u2019s not a productive form of interactivity. So we\u2019re trying to develop other forms of interactivity where we have a little bit higher level of engagement with readers. We think that taking action, or inviting them to tell us what stories we should pursue, those are vehicles that might deepen engagement. That\u2019s why we\u2019re moving in that direction.\n\nEllis: Why step down now? What made this the time for you to step back?\n\nYemma: I write a column for the weekly and I write a column for our daily news briefing. I really enjoy writing, and I\u2019m gonna continue writing. : I write a column for the weekly and I write a column for our daily news briefing. I really enjoy writing, and I\u2019m gonna continue writing. I\u2019ve done this for five-and-a-half years, I\u2019ve really enjoyed it. I really respect Marshall Ingwerson, who\u2019s our managing editor, who\u2019s gonna step up to be editor. I think it\u2019s just time for me to pass the torch. I would like to deepen the writing I\u2019m doing, both for the Monitor and other places. There\u2019s some practical considerations too: I wouldn\u2019t mind ending my commute. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m retiring, per se, but I\u2019m trying to shift to do more creative work. And I think the Monitor is in amazingly good hands and we\u2019re on a pretty good glide-path too. It seemed like a good time to step down.\n\nPhoto of Christian Science Monitor newspaper box in 2009 by AP/Lisa Poole.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I think the Monitor is in amazingly good hands and we're on a pretty good glide-path too.
