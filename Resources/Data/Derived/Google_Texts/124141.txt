Kenneth “Tres” McEastland III beamed with pride as he showed off the blue ribbon he won at the 24th annual Special Olympics.

“It’s great,” the Rock Springs Middle School student said.

He was among 436 athletes competing at the Area 16 game, held last week at MTSU’s Dean A. Hayes Track and Soccer Stadium. Organizers said it was the largest crowd ever for the event.

Maknika McEastland said the day is a special one for her 13-year-old son.

“When I woke him up (Thursday) morning, I played the Olympics theme song and he got up and said, ‘It’s Special Olympics!’ His teachers said he would just sit in the stands the first few years he came, but now he’s involved,” the mother said.

The student athletes from Rutherford County Schools and Murfreesboro City Schools, along with adults from Journeys in Community Living and Stones River Center, competed in the softball throw, standing and running long jumps, and 50- and 100-meter dashes. A 25-meter developmental walk and a 25-meter wheelchair race were available for athletes whose disabilities prevent them from walking.

MTSU coaches and athletes run the Special Olympics.

Lou Paschall, co-director of the games, said the event grows every year.

Maknika McEastland said this year’s games are the first she’d ever attended.

“I never knew how big of a deal this was,” she said.

Athletes participate at no charge, thanks to donations from area businesses.
