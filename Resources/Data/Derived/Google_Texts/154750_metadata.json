Clementa Pinckney and eight others were slain June 17 during a Bible study at the historic black Charleston church .\n\nEmanuel AME Church already was among South Carolina\u2019s most well-known churches long before someone entered the ground floor and shot its pastor and eight others to death during a June 17 Bible study.\n\nBut the unspeakable crime \u2014one that led to an outpouring of support and unity from across the nation \u2014 has changed the church in ways that are still playing out.\n\nIn coming months, the church\u2019s leaders, members and supporters are expected to discuss not only how to memorialize the nine victims on the site but also what repair work is needed. They\u2019ll need to decide how to conduct the repairs to the sanctuary and ground floor, where the crime occurred, while also tending to the spiritual needs of the church.\n\n\u201cOur focus is \u2014 as it has been since June 17 \u2014 to make sure those families and their concerns, their immediate needs \u2014 monetary, spiritual and emotional \u2014 are met,\u201d said the Rev. Dr. Norvel Goff, Emanuel\u2019s interim pastor.\n\n\u201cThis is an ongoing process. We haven\u2019t been here before. Where we lost nine of our members to a horrific, evil act. We have not been there.\u201d\n\n\u2018Always something to do\u2019\n\nThe church expects to finish one major construction project later this summer, the addition of an elevator off the eastern facade. Scaffolding currently rings the stuccoed addition.\n\nWhen the project is done, for the first time, elderly and disabled parishioners will be able to get to the sanctuary without climbing stairs. Many no longer will have to watch from a closed-circuit television feed on the ground floor.\n\n\u201cThat will be a good day,\u201d said Liz Alston, a longtime member who is the church\u2019s historian.\n\nMeanwhile, Goff said in addition to the elevator, the vision of the late Rev. Clementa Pinckney was to make other improvements to the church\u2019s physical plant, and these improvements may support new programs.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, my goals over the next months will include putting an administrative team in place to handle the volume of inquiries and visitors received by Mother Emanuel, assessing and expanding the security system and executing a complete renovation of the first floor,\u201d he said.\n\nThe church also has received a state grant and is working with Bennett Engineering to analyze the structural condition of its historic 1891 building, which has some termite damage and other issues common among historic buildings.\n\nGoff said this ongoing preservation and maintenance was in the works before June 17 and is an ongoing process.\n\n\u201cThe church is doing just fine, and we\u2019re going to continue to do the work that is necessary on an ongoing basis. I think our needs are consistent with a facility of this age, and when you\u2019re that mature in years, there\u2019s always something that one must do.\u201d\n\nEmanuel member and Charleston City Councilman William Dudley Gregorie said most of the church property is in good shape. \u201cNow is time to pay attention to the sanctuary so we can preserve it for another 200 years,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing is insurmountable, but it is going to cost.\u201d\n\nPlanning a memorial\n\nAnother aspect the church will grapple with is a memorial to the nine lives lost.\n\nMayor Joe Riley said he thinks such a memorial is \u201cessential\u201d and should occur \u201cobviously with the input and leadership from the church and the family members of those who perished, and the community.\u201d\n\nGoff said he has given only brief thought to that, but added, \u201cAt some point in time, I\u2019m quite sure I\u2019ll initiate conversations not only with Mother Emanuel\u2019s officers and members but also to get input from Mayor Riley and others who have expressed similar kinds of concerns to have a lasting memorial to those nine.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how that process might unfold, but Goff said, \u201cI think it\u2019s important to take an inclusive view of all of those who have expressed interest. It will happen.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the church is gathering up the many mementos, memorials and other items that well-wishers have left outside its stairs at 110 Calhoun St.\n\nRiley said efforts to create a memorial at the church \u201cshouldn\u2019t languish,\u201d and the city\u2019s planned International African American Museum also will reflect the crime in the larger context of the role of the black church.\n\n\u201cThirty years from now, 50 years from now, it\u2019s important that this tragic event be presented as a very sad, heartbreaking part of Charleston\u2019s history,\u201d he said.\n\nAlston, whose office at the church is full of cardboard boxes containing items that well-wishers have donated to the families of the nine, said this summer\u2019s events \u2014 the horrific crime and the outpouring of faith and compassion \u2014 rank up there with the most momentous moments in the church\u2019s history, such as Denmark Vesey\u2019s planned slave uprising and the church\u2019s subsequent closure in 1834.\n\nPreserving the church \u2014 and growing its congregation and expanding its mission \u2014 will be its own kind of tribute.\n\n\u201cI still am feeling the loss of the nine,\u201d Alston said, \u201cbut then we have a lot of work to do. I don\u2019t want their deaths to be in vain. I hope we can move ahead with the church so they too will be proud of what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nGoff said the church will continue to offer counseling services at off-site locations with the Charleston Dorchester Mental Health Center and other possible partners.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, we ask the people of the city, state and nation to continue praying for us, especially the children, senior citizens and family members of the victims,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all need time to heal.\u201d\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Mother Emanuel looks to the future, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Calhoun Street,Emanuel AME Church,historic buildings,Liz Alston,Mayor Joe Riley,Norvel Goff,preservation", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Emanuel AME Church already was among South Carolina's most well-known churches long before someone entered the ground floor and shot its pastor and eight others to death during a June 17 Bible study.", "title": "Mother Emanuel looks to the future", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150712/150719905/mother-emanuel-looks-to-the-future", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150712/PC16/150719905/AR/0/AR-150719905.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150712/PC16/150719905/AR/0/AR-150719905.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Emanuel AME Church already was among South Carolina's most well-known churches long before someone entered the ground floor and shot its pastor and eight others to death during a June 17 Bible study.", "title": "Mother Emanuel looks to the future", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150712/PC16/150719905/AR/0/AR-150719905.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150719905}}, "keywords": "Mother Emanuel looks to the future , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Calhoun Street,Emanuel AME Church,historic buildings,Liz Alston,Mayor Joe Riley,Norvel Goff,preservation", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-12T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-12T20:40:00Z", "author": "Robert Behre"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Emanuel AME Church already was among South Carolina's most well-known churches long before someone entered the ground floor and shot its pastor and eight others to death during a June 17 Bible study."}, "article_summary": "Goff said this ongoing preservation and maintenance was in the works before June 17 and is an ongoing process.\n\u201cThe church is doing just fine, and we\u2019re going to continue to do the work that is necessary on an ongoing basis.\n\u201cNow is time to pay attention to the sanctuary so we can preserve it for another 200 years,\u201d he said.\nClementa Pinckney was to make other improvements to the church\u2019s physical plant, and these improvements may support new programs.\n\u201cI still am feeling the loss of the nine,\u201d Alston said, \u201cbut then we have a lot of work to do."}
