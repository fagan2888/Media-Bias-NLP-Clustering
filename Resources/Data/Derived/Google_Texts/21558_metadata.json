But at this stage, the polls are meaningless, or at least, they don\u2019t tell us much. What counts are the less glamorous parts of election season: endorsements, fundraising, and policy.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nOn policy, the Democratic field has been active. The front-runner, Hillary Clinton, has made proposals for reducing college debt, defending the right to vote, and raising middle-class incomes. In the wake of protests from Black Lives Matter and other activists, her immediate challenger, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has issued a robust program for \u201cracial justice,\u201d ranging from criminal justice reform to greater redistribution, with an eye toward shrinking disparities in wealth and education. Even the least visible candidate, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, has released a thorough plan for police and criminal justice reform. Between the three contenders, Democratic voters have clear choices for the kind of liberal governance they want.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWith 17 candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, you\u2019d think Republicans would enjoy an even greater quantity of ideas and policies. But as Darren Samuelsohn found for Politico, that\u2019s just not the case:\n\nA POLITICO Agenda analysis of the 17 GOP campaigns\u2019 websites found that nearly half lacked a specific \u201cissue\u201d page at all. The absence of a clear, one-stop spigot of policy information was especially notable at the top of the field. Front-runners Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker don\u2019t have policy tabs of any kind. For the rest of the pack, the policy pages of their websites are largely afterthoughts, light on significant detail.\n\nAs Samuelsohn notes, there are exceptions: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \u201cgets deep into the issues and pushes the bounds of where a Republican might go,\u201d with proposals for ending domestic surveillance of American citizens, shrinking the prison population, and limiting the use of force in foreign affairs. Likewise, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u201coffers multi-pronged plans on education, the economy, and entitlement reform.\u201d Even then, the ideas come with more breadth than depth. And that\u2019s just as true for candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio and Bush, who emphasize reform and \u201cwonkiness.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think Republicans are bereft of plans or ideas; for starters, there\u2019s the legislative agenda of the congressional GOP, which will influence whichever Republican is nominated, and will influence his choices if he\u2019s elected next November.\n\nBut, so far, the GOP primary isn\u2019t an ideas fest\u2014with few exceptions, the candidates aren\u2019t talking policy. Yes, last week\u2019s debate was entertaining, but no one on stage could give\u2014or even hint to\u2014a coherent governing agenda. At most, we had two hours of conservative boilerplate, as everyone promised to cut taxes, repeal Obamacare, stop the Iran deal, and get rid of \u201cjob-killer\u201d regulations.\n\nIf you asked me to name one thing Clinton would do in office, I could describe her plan to change the capital gains tax and encourage long-term investment. If you asked me the same of Sanders, I could explain his plan to fund college tuition with a financial transaction tax, or his plan to tax carbon emissions and use the gains to help consumers and spur renewable energy sources. If you asked me that of Bush, I could give you a guess\u2014based on the GOP platform and his own interests\u2014but I wouldn\u2019t have a great answer. I might even shrug.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The Republican Party has 17 presidential candidates.
