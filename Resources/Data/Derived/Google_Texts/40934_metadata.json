The project is meant to ease traffic woes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2015 budget includes $10.6 million for the road project. The first phases were completed in fall 2010. Broomfield will have to spend about $1.4 million more than originally thought to start the next phase of the project. The project came in about $2.8 million over budget, and Broomfield likely will split the extra cost with the Colorado Department of Transportation, said Deputy City and County Manager Kevin Standbridge.\n\nThe proposed budget also includes several projects requested by or supported by residents, including a field expansion at Broomfield County Commons. The budget calls for $3.69 million to construct a new athletic field area, dubbed the \"yellow pod.\"\n\nThat funding covers the athletic field improvements, but doesn't cover adding more parking, Soderberg said.\n\nParking for the future field is in front of the current dog park, she said.\n\nResidents sent in numerous letters supporting a plan to build the field, including parents who wanted their children to have a field where they could play lacrosse.\n\nResidents can still comment at Tuesday's meeting, and comments will be logged for next year's budget process.\n\nSoderberg said the public had several chances to give suggestions or feedback on the proposed budget, either at council meetings or via email.\n\nDuring the 2015 budget process, most residents who commented did so via email, and the majority asked for funding to put in more turf fields at Broomfield County Commons.\n\n\"There was a lot of interest in that,\" Soderberg said.\n\nOther recreation projects are in the works for 2015, including repairs and upgrades to the Broomfield Community Center locker rooms, according to the budget report.\n\nSmaller maintenance projects also are in the 2015 budget, such as fixing 35 miles of roads and replacing 5,000 feet of water mains.\n\nThe budget also calls for adding hours to several existing jobs and creating a few new jobs.\n\nBroomfield will add the equivalent of 8.45 full-time positions in 2015 to make up for 26 positions cut or unfilled during the recession, according to the budget report.\n\nThose positions include an additional police patrol officer, an additional engineering construction inspector and more staff in the Community Development Department, because of Broomfield's growing multi-family housing developments, the report states.\n\nThe budget also includes $306,000 to provide health insurance coverage to 38 part-time employees who work about 30 hours a week.\n\nThe new health care costs are part of Affordable Care Act requirements, Soderberg said.\n\nThe budget also includes $85,000 to replace 200 smaller, sickly ash trees to help ward off the emerald ash borer, an insect that has killed ash trees across the country.\n\nThe emerald ash borer is not in Broomfield right now, but is expected to start infecting trees in the city in one to three years, according to the capital improvement budget.\n\nContact Enterprise Staff
