LM Otero) L.M. Otero/Associated Press\n\nThere are some eye-popping numbers in health plans\u2019 proposals for 2016 insurance premiums in some states under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nAs today\u2019s Wall Street Journal reports, the biggest insurers in some of the states that have made the plans\u2019 requests public are seeking average increases such as 51.6% in New Mexico, 36.3% in Tennessee and 30.4% in Maryland \u2014 enough to make a 14.5% proposed raise here, or an 8.4% boost there, look almost tame.\n\nBut what does that actually mean for the amount that a person would pay each month if these rates are approved? And don\u2019t insurance rates vary by state, as well as by health plan?\n\nThe Wall Street Journal scrubbed the biggest health plans\u2019 proposals to see what they might mean for a 40-year-old nonsmoker living in their state capital who picked the lowest-cost, mid-range \u201csilver\u201d plan available.\n\nUnder the 2010 federal health law, insurers have to charge everyone the same, regardless of their medical history or gender. Older people can be charged up to three times more than younger people. In most parts of the country, smokers can also be charged more and rates vary by geographic area, too.\n\nThe rules apply to most plans sold to individuals or families \u2014 in other words, to folks who don\u2019t get coverage through their job or a government program such as Medicare. The rules apply whether or not the consumers use the health law\u2019s exchanges, where they can also apply for subsidies from the federal government to offset the price of their premium.\n\nPremiums are, of course, just one way of calculating individual health insurance costs. Plans often keep premiums in check by imposing deductibles and limiting the network of providers available. (A silver plan typically has a deductible of between $1,000 and $3,000.) But premiums are, for better or worse, one of the ways supporters and opponents judge the health law.\n\nHere are the average rate increases by state, included in the Journal story, as well as what the plans are proposing for a 40-year-old capital-living nonsmoker in 2016 and the comparable 2015 rate. In some cases, the across-the-board percentage increase for all the health plan\u2019s products isn\u2019t the same as the change specifically affecting mid-level \u201csilver\u201d plans that cover, on average, 70% of medical costs.\n\n(The only one we couldn\u2019t deduce from the publicly available records was the Health Care Service Corp. 2016 rate in New Mexico, and the health plan said it couldn\u2019t provide it. In most of the other cases, health plans confirmed our calculations or supplemented them.)\n\nYou\u2019ll see that some of the plans seeking the biggest increases had some of the lowest prices in the country in previous years. We\u2019ll know in coming weeks whether that makes a difference as consumers and regulators debate the proposals. But we already know that it\u2019s a factor that played a role in the insurers\u2019 moves.\n\nAs we\u2019ve explained before, health plans had to make some pretty big guesses going into 2014, and didn\u2019t know much more as they headed into 2015, so they say that strategy played into their decisions as well as math.\n\n\u201cOne of those rationales why they have a higher rate increase is maybe they were too low the first time,\u201d said David Axene, a fellow of the Society of Actuaries, who also works with health plans to set premiums but didn\u2019t work with the big ones cited in our story.\n\nYou\u2019ll also see that there are some parts of the country where health insurance has just always been more expensive. We\u2019ll find out soon how that affects the way people feel about a smaller percentage increase.\n\nYou can weigh in, in the comments section, or share your story.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A close look at the premium increases some health insurers are requesting for 2016 policies under the health law.", "title": "Sorting the Numbers: Insurers\u2019 Huge Requests for 2016 Obamacare Premiums", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/05/22/sorting-the-numbers-insurers-huge-requests-for-2016-obamacare-premiums/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IH701_acaenr_P_20150507164550.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Sorting the Numbers: Insurers\u2019 Huge Requests for 2016 Obamacare Premiums", "description": "A close look at the premium increases some health insurers are requesting for 2016 policies under the health law.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Louise Radnofsky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "A close look at the premium increases some health insurers are requesting for 2016 policies under the health law.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-05-22T15:18:45-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/05/22/sorting-the-numbers-insurers-huge-requests-for-2016-obamacare-premiums/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-55450", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A close look at the premium increases some health insurers are requesting for 2016 policies under the health law.", "title": "Sorting the Numbers: Insurers\u2019 Huge Requests for 2016 Obamacare Premiums", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/05/22/sorting-the-numbers-insurers-huge-requests-for-2016-obamacare-premiums/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IH701_acaenr_P_20150507164550.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-55450", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-05-22T15:43:13-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd596\"", "article_summary": "Otero/Associated PressThere are some eye-popping numbers in health plans\u2019 proposals for 2016 insurance premiums in some states under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\nYou\u2019ll also see that there are some parts of the country where health insurance has just always been more expensive.\nIn most of the other cases, health plans confirmed our calculations or supplemented them.)\nAnd don\u2019t insurance rates vary by state, as well as by health plan?\n(A silver plan typically has a deductible of between $1,000 and $3,000.)"}
