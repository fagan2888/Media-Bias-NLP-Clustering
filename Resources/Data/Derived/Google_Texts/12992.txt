A 20-year-old man has pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in a drive-by shooting in Topeka.

The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Damieon Michael Ortega-Brown entered the plea Friday in Shawnee County District Court. He also pleaded guilty to criminal discharge of a firearm at an occupied dwelling or vehicle, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

The charges were tied to the June 2014 killing of 19-year-old Patrick M. Lightbourn Jr. Senior assistant district attorney Matt Patterson said Ortega-Brown was at a party before the shooting but left after there was a fistfight. Patterson said Ortega-Brown later returned and fired at people who had been involved in the altercation.

Under the plea, Ortega-Brown faces a sentence of nearly 19 years in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 2.
