It is the health organization\u2019s first presidential primary endorsement in the 100 years since its foundation. According to Brigid Leahy, director of government relations at Planned Parenthood Illinois Action, the nonprofit\u2019s political arm in the state, not only is Clinton framing her policies on women\u2019s health in continuity with President Barack Obama\u2019s, but she also promises to move forward and do more.\n\n\n\n\u201cObama has been wonderful in his support of reproductive freedom and the services that Planned Parenthood provides, not only as a president but also as senator of Illinois,\u201d Leahy said, referring to Obama\u2019s recent veto on an early January House bill that would have repealed the Affordable Care Act and defunded Planned Parenthood. \u201cBut unfortunately, he has to leave office. Hillary Clinton is a leader. We hope that she will build on what Obama did to make even more proactive choices.\u201d\n\nLeahy said that while many male elected officials are very supportive of reproductive freedom and Planned Parenthood, Clinton being a woman means that she knows better her male counterparts what is at stake in the right to seek an abortion or use birth control.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to discount men,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cBut I do think that there\u2019s something to be said about a woman fighting for reproductive freedom. She would bring perspective on the issue as the first female president.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action recently published a side-by-side comparison of Clinton\u2019s and Sanders\u2019 records on women\u2019s health issues. The nonprofit concludes its overview of the candidates\u2019 policies by saying that while they are both \u201cgood on reproductive health,\u201d Clinton \u201cpushes harder.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Bernie were to get the eventual nomination, we would continue to fight to put a supportive politician in the White House,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cHe has a pro-choice record and defends Planned Parenthood, so we would work with him. But our choice to endorse Hillary has to do with the depth and breadth of her record on women\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nBailey said Clinton has been bringing women\u2019s rights to the table way more than Sanders. To back up their endorsement of Clinton with support from voters in the primary, she and other NARAL activists have been canvassing in Iowa and across the country since last spring to put the issue of reproductive freedom under the spotlight on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cIowans have been incredibly receptive. We knocked on door after door and we had a yes rate of over 50 percent,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThat means over 50 percent of people we talked to pledged to caucus for reproductive freedom.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, from their rally podiums in Iowa, both Clinton and Sanders stood in support of reproductive freedom and called the Republican candidates out for advocating policies that would deny women basic reproductive rights.\n\nClinton referred to Republican efforts to pass anti-abortion legislation and suspend federal funding to Planned Parenthood as an attack on human rights. \u201cI fundamentally disagree with them,\u201d she said at a rally in Cedar Rapids the weekend before the Feb.1 caucuses.\n\nSanders threw a sarcastic jab at candidates in the opposing party for touting themselves as champions of American families while in truth, he said to a crowd of supporters in Davenport, \u201cwhat they\u2019re telling you is that if you\u2019re a woman you cannot and must not control your body.\u201d\n\nSome Republican caucus-goers in Iowa did not deny that, and were fierce in condemning Democratic support of a woman\u2019s right to choose for herself and her own body. \u201cLife begins at conception and Ted Cruz supports that wholeheartedly,\u201d said Mary Jane Woodward, an independent Baptist who came out in support of the Texas senator at a rally in Iowa City on the eve of the caucuses.\n\nIn arguing her anti-abortion stances, Woodward said women who choose to have pre-marital intercourse and get pregnant as a result are automatically forfeited the subsequent choice of whether to keep the baby or not. \u201cIt\u2019s your fault for doing that, not the baby\u2019s fault,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a woman sleeps with a man outside the boundaries of a marriage without protection, there\u2019s a deviant soul inside of her, and then it becomes too late for another choice.\u201d\n\nWoodward said women should give the baby to a Christian home instead of seeking an abortion. She added that according to her, there\u2019s something deeply wrong about Planned Parenthood, and \u201cGod is going to judge America for that.\u201d\n\nFor Bailey, the right to choose whether and when to start a family is fundamental, and so is supporting a presidential candidate who recognizes that right.\n\n\u201cWe need a leader like Hillary Clinton in the next administration,\u201d Bailey said, \u201cbecause it will determine how women and families fare in decades to come.\u201d\n\nPhoto at top: Hillary Clinton speaks at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, on Feb. 1 as she enjoys a slight lead over Bernie Sanders at the caucuses.
