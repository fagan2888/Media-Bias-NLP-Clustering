Before entering politics, Romney founded the private equity firm Bain Capital.\n\nDodd-Frank is unpopular among Republicans, who have dubbed it \u201cObamacare for banks,\u201d but it is still popular among liberals. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), who supports the bill, has said it does not go far enough to break up big banks.\n\nClinton has been criticized by some liberals who say she is too cozy with big banks and Wall Street.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Hillary Clinton has staked out the same position on the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulates financial institutions, as 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
