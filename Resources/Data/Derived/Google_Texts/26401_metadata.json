The Hornets are 4-1 on their seven-game home stand, which concludes with games against the Bucks and defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors. The Hornets, led by owner Michael Jordan, recently extended coach Steve Clifford's contract for three years. Charlotte hired Clifford in the summer of 2013, and he also interviewed with the Bucks that summer. \"He changed this whole team around from Day 1,\" center Al Jefferson said. \"He works harder than any head coach I've been around. He demands you play hard and play together.\" Former Wisconsin star Frank Kaminsky is playing significant minutes off the bench and has appeared in all 16 games. The rookie power forward scored 11 points in a Hornets victory over Brooklyn on Nov. 18.\n\nLINEUPS\n\nPROBABLE HORNETS STARTERS\n\nG Kemba Walker, 6-1, Connecticut\n\nG Nicolas Batum, 6-8, France\n\nF P.J.
