It's one of the most successful undercover child sex sting operations in the state.

But, the Canadian County sheriff says there are people who think investigators are going too far by posing as teens online.

The Canadian County undersheriff told News 9 people have told them when it comes to their undercover sexual predator busts, they're entrapping innocent citizens and violating their constitutional rights.

For the past five years, the Canadian County Sheriff's Office along with OSBI has successfully gotten 120 accused child predators off the street.

“We don’t put the idea in these people’s head, these suspects that chase after children on the internet, they have the notion to do this,” said Lt. Adam Flowers, Canadian County Sheriff’s Office.

But investigators said they are getting incredible backlash from people who oppose what they're doing.

“Well, this is all make believe, that guy hasn’t even done anything,” said Undersheriff, Chris West. “Well you know what, there are true life stories just like this. And we also know for a fact that a lot of the people that we arrest, they have priors.”

The latest arrest was just a couple of days ago. Investigators said 20-year-old Keith Parks responded to an undercover social media post.

A conversation between Parks and a 14-year-old decoy turned from innocent to filthy within minutes.

“He gave us a full confession, and his plan was to take this 14-year-old girl back to Bethany to his apartment and fulfill all of his sexual fantasies with her,” said West.

“We can’t rest. Bad guys don’t rest. We go 100 miles an hour, seven days a week,” said Flowers.

Right now, Keith Parks is in the Canadian County Jail on a $50,000 bond.
