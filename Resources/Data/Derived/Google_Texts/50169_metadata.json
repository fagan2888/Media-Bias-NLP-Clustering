Crews are expected to work throughout out the night.\n\nOne salt barn in Delaware County is almost down to the walls with just one mound of salt left.\n\nMaryFran Cassidy of Delaware says she measured 5 inches of snow at her doorstep, so she put on her high heels, grabbed a shovel and starting making a clearing.\n\nShe says this is nothing like the storm in 1978 when she was living in Cambridge.\n\n\" We had 5 days of school the whole month of January to so that was a bad one,\" Cassidy said.\n\nThe storm is keeping tow truck drivers busy, and some say wait times may extend two hours depending on the numbers of calls for service.\n\nStay with 10TV and refresh 10TV.com for continuing coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heavy snow caused problems for drivers on Delaware County roads.
