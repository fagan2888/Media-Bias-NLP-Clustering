For the eighth straight year, October is Dining Month on OnMilwaukee.com, presented by Locavore, the newest restaurant at Potawatomi Hotel & Casino. All month, we're stuffed with restaurant reviews, delectable features, chef profiles and unique articles on everything food, as well as the winners of our "Best of Dining 2014."

This week, OnMilwaukee.com asked the Social Circle a simple question: what's your favorite doughnut shop? The responses, as usual, were varied and not surprisingly, no one said the gas station.

What's your favorite doughnut shop â€“ in Milwaukee or beyond? Feel free to chime in via the Talkback feature.
