Last night Stephen Colbert spoke to New York Times columnist and author Thomas Friedman on climate change, and how it can lead to violence. (“I know that when someone talks about it, I want to punch them,” Colbert jokes.)

Friedman appears on the James Cameron-produced “Years of Living Dangerously,” which airs on Showtime. The show tackles the global repercussions of climate change — not just what will happen in the future, but how climate change is already adding to the world’s woes. Friedman’s example on the show is a drought in Syria.

The two discuss what to do about climate change and “global weirding.” (“Have last night on earth sex?” Colbert suggests.) Friedman quotes a climate scientist saying, “We have exactly enough time starting now.”
