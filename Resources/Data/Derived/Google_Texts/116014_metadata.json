I've been following her throughout the health reform saga. She has had two different plans in two years of enrollment, switching after her initial insurer sought a 52 percent premium increase for Year 2. This year she has higher deductibles and copays, less inclusive drug coverage and gets a subsidy of nearly $400-a-month for a $550-a-month plan.\n\nShe's fed up with the bureaucratic hassles and said she gets treated like a stepchild by doctors and providers when they see she's on an Obamacare plan.\n\nShe also got an unwelcome surprise at tax time: a hefty fine because she underestimated her 2014 income when she enrolled the previous year.\n\nBoehler got an unexpected pension dividend last year. That meant her 2014 subsidy was incorrectly calculated. Instead of recalculating and asking her to return the difference (which would have been a few hundred dollars), the government imposed a $750 fine.\n\n\"You get fined a flat $300, $750 or $1250, based upon where you fall [above] the poverty level,\" Boehler wrote in an email. \"Insanity!\"\n\nAdd it all up and she says, \"I'm sick of the words Affordable Care Act.\" Even though she has benefitted, she doesn't find the health-care system any more affordable than before the bill passed in 2010.\n\nJames Farrell, who co-leads the Health Care Practice Group for the Shutts & Bowen law firm in West Palm Beach, calls the ACA \"a work in progress\" and says premiums for Obamacare plans are rising \"significantly.\"\n\n\"If premiums keep going up, what good does a tax credit do?\" Farrell said.\n\nAnd that's why the jury is still out on President Barack Obama's signature achievement. It has cut the ranks of the uninsured and expanded coverage, as insurers can no longer turn down consumers because of pre-existing health issues.\n\nBut the American health-care system is still a tangled, frustrating place, with opaque, inconsistent pricing.\n\nMany doctors are demoralized, with shortages in many fields, as their take has been cut by middlemen and overseers. With insurers, drug makers and hospital chains operating in the interests of profits and shareholders, the system is often at odds with individuals' health and well-being.\n\nBoehler said she can't wait until she turns 65 next year and qualifies for Medicare, the government-run program for seniors.\n\nWhat does it say that most Americans consider Medicare, a single-payer government program, the Promised Land?\n\nmmayo@sunsentinel.com, 954-356-4508.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "After Obamacare ruling, dissent from past supporter", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "author": "South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "Sun-Sentinel.com", "description": "In a big win for Obamacare and Floridians, the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld subsidies for enrollees who buy health insurance through the federally-run Healthcare.gov website.", "title": "After Obamacare ruling, dissent from past supporter", "url": "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-obamacare-mayocol-b063015-20150701-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55944e16/turbine/fl-obamacare-mayocol-b063015-20150701", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.17", "twitter": {"site": "@sunsentinel", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Obamacare ruling Affordable Care Act health insurance", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402230662, app-argument=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/deeplinkid/83909509", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 64829476886, "app_id": 728754867160252}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-07-01", "Description": "The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Obamacare subsidies last week, but beneficiary Ramona Boehler of Sunrise has soured on the Affordable Care Act, saying health insurance is still expensive and frustrating, Michael Mayo writes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Obamacare ruling Affordable Care Act health insurance"}, "article_summary": "Boehler, 63, is a retired widow with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who regained health insurance with the help of the Affordable Care Act.\nAdd it all up and she says, \"I'm sick of the words Affordable Care Act.\"\nIn a big win for Obamacare and Floridians, the U.S. Supreme Court recently upheld subsidies for enrollees who buy health insurance through the federally-run Healthcare.gov website.\nEven though she has benefitted, she doesn't find the health-care system any more affordable than before the bill passed in 2010.\nBut the American health-care system is still a tangled, frustrating place, with opaque, inconsistent pricing."}
