Socks, for most, are an afterthought, more for comfort than style.

But for hundreds of Topekans, having socks is a luxury they simply can’t afford, said Wayne Ireland, director of Topeka Rescue Mission’s distribution center. “You wouldn’t how much a simple pair of socks would do to making someone happy.”

In a year, the mission distributes nearly 10,000 pairs of socks to those in need.

That is why a group of eight enterprising Girl Scouts from Tecumseh and Shawnee Heights elementary schools raised money and sought donations to collect as many socks as they could. On Saturday morning they delivered 1,564 pairs to the distribution center in North Topeka.

“That’ll be enough to last us awhile,” Ireland told troop leader Michelle McDaniel as he looked into a giant bin full of socks.

Earlier this year the girls toured the shelter where many of them learned that homelessness could affect children too, McDaniels said.

“They realized that kids from their school could have been in the shelter,” she said. “I think it was really moving for them.”

The girls decided to make the shelter a part of earning a Bronze Award, an achievement in Girl Scouts for recognizing a need in the community and working to raise money or supplies. McDaniels said the girls were going to build personal hygiene packs for shelter guests originally, but the mission had plenty of those, so they chose socks.

In May, they began raising money and seeking donations of new, not used, socks.

Knowing children like her would benefit made 11-year-old Joy Childs proud.

“I just think that would be really hard to cope with,” Childs said. “We want to do whatever we can.”
