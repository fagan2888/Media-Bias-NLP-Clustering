To ease the man\u2019s excruciating pain, the young nurse pumped morphine into his body, small dose by small dose, careful not to stop his breathing.\n\nDecades later, Dr. Jeffries received a phone call from that patient, who had recognized her name in a local newspaper article.\n\n\u201cYou saved my life,\u201d he told her. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d\n\nShe did.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just one reward of the nursing profession,\u201d Dr. Jeffries said in an interview. \u201cThere is a special relationship between nurses and their patients.\u201d\n\nNow in her fourth month as dean of the George Washington University School of Nursing (SON), Dr. Jeffries says that nursing has undergone immense shifts since she started her career in the late 1970s. But one aspect of the job that has not changed is the nurse\u2019s role as a patient advocate.\n\n\u201cNowadays, nurses are case managers. They\u2019re helping patients navigate through the health care system, which can be pretty complex,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can make a huge difference as a nurse. Sometimes it\u2019s just bringing that human response\u2014talking and asking questions and providing support.\u201d\n\nPatient-centered care is the foundation of Dr. Jeffries\u2019 vision for the School of Nursing as she leads it into its fifth year.\n\nSince its establishment in 2010, the school has doubled its enrollment to more than 750 students and is recognized among the top 50 schools of nursing in the country by U.S. News & World Report. Its online Master of Science in Nursing (M.S.N.) program is ninth among more than 130 programs nationwide. Under founding Dean Jean Johnson\u2019s leadership, the school became an early adopter of online programs, increased educational access for military service members and forged partnerships with Virginia community colleges.\n\n\u201cJean [Johnson] built the school at this level. She put the \u2018GW School of Nursing\u2019 sign in the ground,\u201d said Dr. Jeffries, who joined GW in May. \u201cNow, I feel ready to take the school to the next level.\u201d\n\nFor Dr. Jeffries, that \u201cnext level\u201d includes expanding the school\u2019s online programs, preparing nursing students to better address societal needs and developing a nursing Ph.D. program.\n\n\u201cI tend to have an \u2018anything is possible\u2019 attitude,\u201d she said. \u201cThe glass half full versus half empty.\u201d\n\nPreparing Nurses for the 21st-Century Workforce\n\nAfter graduating from Ball State University in 1976, Dr. Jeffries worked in the cardiovascular intensive care unit at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, earned her M.S.N. degree and instructed part-time. In 1996, she obtained her Ph.D. after completing her research dissertation in Indonesia, where she studied health behaviors and lived with her family for four years.\n\nIn 2009, Johns Hopkins University recruited Dr. Jeffries to serve as the School of Nursing\u2019s associate dean for academic affairs and vice dean of faculty. She led the school in its online education initiative, launching more than 40 courses and two online master\u2019s programs. Dr. Jeffries became the university\u2019s inaugural vice provost of digital initiatives in 2013, in which she promoted and coordinated the university\u2019s online programs.\n\nMuch of Dr. Jeffries\u2019 research has focused on developing ways to incorporate technology and online components to enhance classroom learning or to increase educational access for students. In the 1990s, Dr. Jeffries helped to create some of Indiana University\u2019s very first online programs. And at Johns Hopkins, she developed and taught a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) called \u201cUniversity Teaching 101.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnline education is very important,\u201d Dr. Jeffries said. \u201cIt\u2019s an affordable and practical way to provide education, mobility and career advancement.\u201d\n\nAs president of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare, Dr. Jeffries advocates for how simulations help bridge classroom learning and real-life clinical experience. In 2014, she consulted on a national, multi-site study funded by the National Council State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN), which found that up to 50 percent of real clinical time could be substituted with clinical simulations. In September, a simulation framework she created will be presented as a mid-range simulation theory at the National League for Nursing\u2019s Teaching Summit.\n\nWith Dr. Jeffries\u2019 background in online education and simulation research, the GW School of Nursing seemed like a natural fit. Among the School of Nursing\u2019s 750 plus students, nearly 500 are enrolled in online programs. The school offers five specialties within the M.S.N. program and nine tracks within the Doctor of Nursing Practice program, which combine online courses and clinical practice. The school\u2019s Skills and Simulation Laboratories offer students the chance to have true-to-life patient interactions prior to and as a complement to their clinical education in real medical settings. The lab houses 21 simulated patients, ranging in age from infants to the elderly.\n\nDr. Jeffries is seeking to increase the presence of GW\u2019s online programs and to continue to ensure the existing nursing curricula address the changing health care landscape.\n\nIn particular, she said that she wants to ensure that GW\u2019s graduate nursing programs are teaching students to assess and meet the needs of patients who live in rural communities and other underserved populations in Maryland and Virginia. That includes emerging methods like telemedicine, in which nurse practitioners provide care and advice to patients in distant communities via texting, Skype and mobile apps.\n\n\u201cNot everyone can drive six hours to a health care facility, particularly for things like mental health counseling,\u201d Dr. Jeffries said. \u201cBut telemedicine provides a pretty rich way to assess and intervene. We have to make sure we\u2019re giving nurses the skill sets and competencies to contribute in these ways.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2014, nurses and nurse practitioners are playing an increasing important role in health care. Not only will nurses need to contribute to gaps in the primary care workforce\u2014in order to care for the estimated 27 million Americans expected to gain health insurance by 2019\u2014but they will also need to learn how to work on teams where many health professionals have equal levels of authority.\n\n\u201cNew nursing students have to be savvy in policy and in leadership. We need to teach them to make quick decisions and to speak up without penalty when something isn\u2019t right,\u201d Dr. Jeffries said. \u201cThere is less of an authority gradient and more of a team-level approach to health care.\u201d\n\nIncreasing Scholarship\n\nAnother tenant of Dr. Jeffries\u2019 vision for the School of Nursing is to hire new research faculty members and to eventually develop a Ph.D. nursing program at GW.\n\nThe Ph.D. is one of two doctorate degrees offered in nursing. While the D.N.P. degree is a practice doctorate that provides students with skills necessary to translate research-based evidence into practice, the Ph.D. prepares nurse scientists to develop new knowledge for the field.\n\nResearch areas for nursing scientists might include studying health behaviors, health promotion, nurse education, health disparities, chronic care management, domestic violence and an almost endless number of other topics.\n\n\u201cNursing research is essential, whether it\u2019s figuring out a way to better feed newborns who are premature, promoting healthy behaviors in certain populations or looking at global intervention strategies,\u201d Dr. Jeffries said. \u201cNurses have a unique perspective on an interprofessional team of researchers.\u201d\n\nWhether it is focusing on nursing scholarship or enhancing online programs, Dr. Jeffries said her primary goal as dean is to make the School of Nursing a \u201cdestination place\u201d as it moves forward into the second half of its first decade.\n\n\u201cMy mission is to create an environment where students want to learn and where faculty can flourish professionally and personally,\u201d she said, \u201ca place that is known for both high-quality nursing education, practice, research and health policy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "George washington university, gwu, gw, gw university, george washington, dc universities, dc colleges, education, higher education", "MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10cd\"", "article_summary": "She put the \u2018GW School of Nursing\u2019 sign in the ground,\u201d said Dr. Jeffries, who joined GW in May.\nIn 2009, Johns Hopkins University recruited Dr. Jeffries to serve as the School of Nursing\u2019s associate dean for academic affairs and vice dean of faculty.\nDecades later, Dr. Jeffries received a phone call from that patient, who had recognized her name in a local newspaper article.\nWith Dr. Jeffries\u2019 background in online education and simulation research, the GW School of Nursing seemed like a natural fit.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just one reward of the nursing profession,\u201d Dr. Jeffries said in an interview."}
