But that\u2019s where the relatively good news ends. Our lame duck-in-chief is underwater by double digits on every issue polled, from race relations, to foreign policy, to the economy. Note well the two issues on which he achieves the highest levels of public disapproval:\n\nRoughly six in ten Americans oppose the president\u2019s handling of healthcare and immigration, both of which have been in the news lately. Given the choice between keeping Obamacare intact and repealing the whole law, voters choose the latter option by a wide margin (38/58). This suggests that liberals\u2019 excitement over other polling indicating broad support for \u2018fixing\u2019 or changing Obamacare, rather than scrapping it altogether, is misplaced. A substantial majority of Americans know that on balance, this law is fundamentally flawed. That\u2019s not a \u201cbranding\u201d problem, as Kathleen Sebelius would have us believe, nor is a product of Obamacare\u2019s historically botched rollout (Harry Reid\u2019s preferred delusion). The law simply is not working. Fox\u2019s survey finds that twice as many Americans have been directly harmed by the law than have been helped by it, which is right in line with other polling on that question. There\u2019s no spinning direct harm:\n\nMany in the \u201cno difference\u201d crowd are likely people with employer-sponsored coverage, who haven\u2019t lost their plans under Obamacare. Just wait awhile, guys. The Obama administration\u2019s own internal projections anticipated that 93 million Americans will eventually be stripped of their \u2018grandfathered\u2019 coverage, Jon Gruber helpfully explained that the so-called \u2018Cadillac tax\u2019 will encroach on many more plans than Democrats indicated, and then there\u2019s this:\n\nSanta Claus is going to be bringing lots of presents in a couple of weeks, but lower health-insurance costs for most Americans won\u2019t be one of them. People with insurance through an employer\u2014that is, most people with health coverage\u2014are paying \u201cmore in premiums and deductibles than ever before\u201d as those costs outpace the growth of wages, a new report finds\u2026despite a recent slowdown in costs that coincided with the adoption of the Obamcare health-care reform law in 2010, the price of job-based coverage is still rising faster than incomes, according to the report.\n\nAs for immigration, while 63 percent of respondents continue to support a legal path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants, a majority (43/51) disapproves of the policy outcome of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. Even fewer Americans are fans of the process by which the president went about \u201cchanging the law,\u201d as he put it:\n\nIronically, Obama would have been with the 54 percent majority on that second question until quite recently. Fully 74 percent of voters believe Obama\u2019s actions will \u201cresult in more people entering the United States illegally,\u201d while 68 percent say they are at least somewhat concerned that Obama\u2019s arrogation of executive power is permanently altering the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers. Which is why we might as well close by revisiting this clip:\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Reverse Midas.", "title": "Fox News poll: Public overwhelmingly disapproves of Obama\u2019s handling of immigration, healthcare", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/12/11/fox-news-poll-public-overwhelmingly-disapproves-of-obamas-handling-of-immigration-healthcare/", "image": "https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7571/15998935495_d3c77eed9f.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, executive amnesty, lame duck, ObamaCare, polls,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-12T01:36:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-11T23:58:13+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d86\"", "article_summary": "Given the choice between keeping Obamacare intact and repealing the whole law, voters choose the latter option by a wide margin (38/58).\nOur lame duck-in-chief is underwater by double digits on every issue polled, from race relations, to foreign policy, to the economy.\nA substantial majority of Americans know that on balance, this law is fundamentally flawed.\nNote well the two issues on which he achieves the highest levels of public disapproval:Roughly six in ten Americans oppose the president\u2019s handling of healthcare and immigration, both of which have been in the news lately.\nAs for immigration, while 63 percent of respondents continue to support a legal path to citizenship for many illegal immigrants, a majority (43/51) disapproves of the policy outcome of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty."}
