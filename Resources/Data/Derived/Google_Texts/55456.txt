Kansas lawmakers passed a No-Call Act to protect consumers' cellphones from unwanted telemarketing calls.

The House of Representatives today approved the bill 117 to 0. The Senate earlier approved it 38 to 0. The legislation, proposed in January by Attorney General Schmidt and others, now goes to the Governor for his consideration.

Complaints about telemarketers violating the Kansas No-Call Act are the single largest group of complaints received by the attorney general's Consumer Protection Division. During 2013, the attorney general filed 17 lawsuits to enforce the No-Call Act, and obtained $3.4 million in judgments as well as injunctions against violators.

To register a consumer cellphone or landline number on the do-not-call list, or for more information, go to the attorney generalâ€™s consumer protection website at www.InYourCornerKansas.org or call (800) 432-2310.
