Now there are unanswered questions about a 2012 trip to New York City.\n\n\"I don't collect his check. I don't talk to him. I don't deal with him on a day-to-day basis.\"\n\nAdam Cloud\n\nThe big issue originally raised by Hartford school officials was whether treasurer Cloud steered city business to O'Garro, a man who does business with Cloud's family. Cloud denied any wrongdoing. But the city's auditors have said that he, at least, had an apparent conflict of interest.\n\nIn an interview last month, we asked Cloud what he knew about O'Garro. \"I really don't know his business,\" he said. \"I don't know what his business is and what it does.\"\n\nCloud told WNPR he didn't interact with O'Garro when it came to the Lewis Street office that O'Garro's company, Hybrid Insurance Group, rented from the Cloud family. \"I removed myself from the operations of Lewis Street right before I took the oath of office of treasurer,\" he said. \"So I left all of that operational stuff. I don't collect his check. I don't talk to him. I don't deal with him on a day-to-day basis.\"\n\nBut then there's this. Records obtained from the city include a receipt for an August 2012 stay at the W Hotel in New York City. O'Garro and Cloud were booked as guests in the room, according to the receipt. The reservation appears to have been made and paid for the same night it was used.\n\nIn emails to WNPR, Cloud said that the hotel bill was originally paid with a city credit card, and that O'Garro later paid the city back. But what were they doing in New York?\n\nO'Garro won't talk to WNPR. So we asked Cloud if he was in New York on a business trip. In an email, he said, \"Yes.\" We asked him if he would elaborate. He said, \"No.\"\n\nThe treasurer referred further questions to his private attorney, John Droney. In an email, Droney confirmed what we already knew: Cloud was in the city on business, and O'Garro reserved a hotel room that was \"charged to Adam by mistake.\"\n\nThis leaves two questions. Was it city business that brought Cloud to New York, or some other kind? And how could a private citizen charge a hotel room on the city treasurer's credit card by mistake?\n\nWe called Droney to ask. He declined to comment.\n\nOne last note. Kevin Rennie writes that O'Garro was arrested on November 7 by state police.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "Hartford continues to buzz with questions about insurance broker Earl O'Garro, city treasurer Adam Cloud, and nearly $700,000 of missing taxpayer money.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/unanswered-questions-about-cloud-ogarro-and-trip-nyc", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201310/Adam_Cloud.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hartford continues to buzz with questions about insurance broker Earl O'Garro, city treasurer Adam Cloud, and nearly $700,000 of missing taxpayer money.", "title": "Unanswered Questions About Cloud, O'Garro, and a Trip to NYC"}, "story_id": 245891996, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jeffcohenwnpr"}, "author": "Jeff Cohen", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Unanswered Questions About Cloud, O&#039;Garro, and a Trip to NYC"}, "nid": 12500, "datePublished": "2013-11-17", "keywords": "The Daily, insurance, ethics, Hartford Region", "wordCount": 588, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9635\"", "article_summary": "Hartford continues to buzz with questions about insurance broker Earl O'Garro, city treasurer Adam Cloud, and nearly $700,000 of missing taxpayer money.\nNow there are unanswered questions about a 2012 trip to New York City.\nAdam CloudThe big issue originally raised by Hartford school officials was whether treasurer Cloud steered city business to O'Garro, a man who does business with Cloud's family.\nCloud told WNPR he didn't interact with O'Garro when it came to the Lewis Street office that O'Garro's company, Hybrid Insurance Group, rented from the Cloud family.\nIn emails to WNPR, Cloud said that the hotel bill was originally paid with a city credit card, and that O'Garro later paid the city back."}
