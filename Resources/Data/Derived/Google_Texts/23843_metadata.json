Her medical chart showed she had an advance directive that would explain the type of end-of-life care she wanted, but it had been written eight years earlier.\n\nThe woman\u2019s son said she\u2019d told him recently that she wanted to get better. To him, that meant that the advance directive shouldn\u2019t apply -- a view one of the woman's other children opposed.\n\nThe hospital's risk management department told the woman's doctors to do what they needed to do to keep her alive and talk to the probate court when it opened Monday, recalled Dr. Joanne Kuntz, one of the physicians involved in the woman\u2019s care.\n\n\u201cWhich is really not how you want to provide health care,\u201d said Kuntz, who spent two decades as an emergency room physician and is now director of palliative services at UConn Health.\n\nPeople who provide emergency medical care say situations like this are common: A dying patient\u2019s wishes aren\u2019t known or are in dispute, leaving her relatives to agonize over what to do. Or a terminally ill patient comes to the hospital with no record of his treatment wishes and ends up getting more aggressive care than he'd wanted.\n\nKuntz and others say there\u2019s a better way: A process for terminally ill patients to discuss their options with a health care provider, determine what sort of end-of-life care they want, and document it in a form that would serve as a medical order for emergency responders, physicians and others in the health care system to follow. It would make clear patients\u2019 wishes: Would they want CPR? A feeding tube? Treatment solely to relieve pain and suffering, limited medical interventions such as antibiotics and fluids if needed, or full treatment that could include intubation and intensive care?\n\nA proposal now under consideration in the state legislature would create a pilot program for the process, referred to as medical orders for life sustaining treatment, or MOLST. It would be voluntary and available only to patients approaching the end stage of a serious \u201clife-limiting\u201d illness or with advanced, progressive frailty.\n\nTalk of end-of-life issues in the legislature this year has largely focused on a high-profile and controversial bill that would allow physicians to prescribe lethal doses of medication to mentally competent, terminally ill patients.\n\nBut many people believe the MOLST bill is the one that has a good chance of becoming law. It has the support of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, who has not taken a position on the assisted suicide bill.\n\nAnd it has the backing of two groups that fought a similar measure last year out of concern that the medical orders could be used to deny care. Members of Second Thoughts Connecticut, an organization representing people with disabilities, endorsed this year\u2019s proposal because it includes safeguards they say address their concerns, although they're still cautious about the model.\n\nSimilarly, the Connecticut Catholic Public Affairs Conference opposed the proposal last year but supports the concept of this year's bill.\n\nThe proposal was developed through a lengthy process led by the state Department of Public Health that included people with disabilities.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be really cutting edge, in fact a model that other states ought to aspire to,\u201d said Catherine Ludlum, a member of Second Thoughts Connecticut, who fought the previous bill but helped develop this year's proposal.\n\nA delicate topic\n\nMore than 40 states have similar medical orders programs in place or efforts under way to create them. But end-of-life care has historically been a politically delicate subject.\n\nIn 2009, as Congress debated proposals that became the federal health law now commonly known as Obamacare, opponents used the term \u201cdeath panels\u201d to describe a provision that would have paid doctors to counsel Medicare patients about end-of-life treatment options. The provision never made it to the final bill.\n\nAnd this year\u2019s assisted suicide proposal has produced strong reactions. Supporters, who call it \u201caid in dying,\u201d say it\u2019s a matter of compassion and peace of mind for people facing terminal illnesses, while opponents warn it could leave people vulnerable, particular those who are elderly or have disabilities.\n\nAsked about the MOLST proposal, Tim Appleton, who is directing the campaign for the aid in dying bill for the advocacy group Compassion & Choices, focused instead on the bill his group favors, citing a recent Quinnipiac University poll that found broad support for assisted suicide in the state.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about the Quinnipiac poll, and the great thing about organizing for this issue in the state, is any number of different end-of-life conversations are happening, not only at the state Capitol but in the media as well, and [in] families all around the state as a result of the reporting done on end-of-life issues and end-of-life choice,\u201d Appleton said.\n\nSome MOLST supporters have described their proposal as an alternative to assisted suicide, while others have tried to distance the two concepts, noting that the medical orders would allow patients to undergo a natural death but wouldn\u2019t allow them to end their lives.\n\nLimits of advance directives\n\nThe concept behind developing medical orders for end-of-life care began in Oregon close to 25 years ago.\n\n\u201cWhat the recognition was was that people were being given treatment that they either didn\u2019t want or might not have been appropriate for them, especially when they were transitioning from one type of health care facility to another,\u201d said Paul Drager, an attorney who has been involved in establishing similar programs in several states.\n\nConnecticut law allows people to complete advance directives that explain what type of care they would want and designate a person to make health care decisions if they can\u2019t.\n\nBut advance directives don\u2019t carry the force of medical orders, and research suggests they\u2019re often misinterpreted by medical personnel. They\u2019re often vague and completed without a medical expert. And people who work in emergency rooms say it can be difficult to know if an advance directive is still in effect or if it\u2019s been amended or revoked.\n\nSupporters say MOLST would complement advance directives by turning them into medical orders tailored for people near the end of their lives. And they would be designed to be easily transferred across medical settings.\n\nMany states use bright-colored paper to make the forms easily identifiable. In Oregon, people are encouraged to put their forms on their refrigerators, and emergency responders are trained to look there. Some states suggest people keep them in medicine cabinets. And some have registries that store the orders centrally, said Amy Vandenbroucke, executive director of the National POLST Paradigm, which promotes the programs. (Many states use the acronym POLST, or physician orders for life sustaining treatment.)\n\nWithout a formal process or document, Kuntz said, a patient could have a meaningful conversation with a doctor at St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford about the sort of care he or she would want. \u201cBut if they show up at UConn sick, we have no way of knowing or following through with whatever conversation they may have had at the hospital across town,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen the risk is not enough care\n\nUma Ramiah / The CT Mirror\n\nOfficially, MOLST is neutral on what people choose. Someone with the orders could ask for aggressive life-saving care or comfort measures only, or something in between.\n\nBut some people with disabilities see the process as largely aimed at limiting treatment -- a particular concern because many people with disabilities say they're at greater risk of not being given the same life-saving options other people receive.\n\nLudlum and Stephen Mendelsohn, another Second Thoughts Connecticut member who was part of the group that developed the proposal, consider the medical orders programs in other states problematic. Some don\u2019t require a patient\u2019s signature to verify that he or she participated in developing the orders.\n\nIn some states, people with life expectancies of up to five years can create the orders, which Ludlum said increases the possibility that orders created with a particular condition in mind could be used in responding to unforeseen situations like a car accident or a severe allergic reaction.\n\nLudlum, who uses a feeding tube and breathing support, said it\u2019s also important to ensure that people are fully informed about the choices, rather than given biased information that presents being on a ventilator or feeding tube as horrible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to understand that this whole process needs to not become a checklist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt needs to be a productive and useful conversation between the patient and the health care practitioner.\u201d\n\nConnecticut\u2019s proposal requires that a MOLST be signed by the patient or a legally authorized representative. Before requesting the signature, health care providers would be required to discuss with patients their goals for care and treatment, and the benefits and risks of different methods for documenting their wishes for end-of-life treatment.\n\nIt also requires health care providers who want to write the orders to receive training on the importance of talking with patients about personal treatment goals, methods for presenting choices without directing people to a particular option, and awareness of factors that could affect the use of MOLST, including race, ethnicity, age, gender, socioeconomic status, mental illness and disability.\n\nAlthough Second Thoughts Connecticut is supporting the bill, Ludlum said it\u2019s with caution.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re always going to be a little bit cautious because the trainings they\u2019re going to have in how to use this are really key,\u201d she said, adding that the process won\u2019t work if the trainings don\u2019t help health care providers overcome their own biases and embrace their patients\u2019 choices.\n\nMichael C. Culhane, the Catholic Conference\u2019s executive director, said the organization supports the legislation in concept, but he would like it to place more emphasis on including family members and trusted friends in the process -- something he said could be achieved when regulations are written for the pilot program.\n\n\u201cIf we can ever get to a point where patients can actually trust that those kinds of conversations are intended to be a support and form of advocacy for them, and not a way to withhold care from them, society really benefits,\u201d said Dr. Jewel Mullen, the state's public health commissioner.\n\n\u201cBecause then we don\u2019t end up having people wonder, when the conversation comes up at a critical moment, maybe left to a family, people don\u2019t have to start wondering, \u2018Is it that they don\u2019t want to treat me?\u2019 Or people don\u2019t have to feel stuck saying, \u2018I want this therapy stopped for my loved one, but the doctors don\u2019t feel like they can.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/14/emergency-responders-disability-advocates-backing-end-of-life-care-proposal/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Catherine Ludlum, Catholic Conference, Compassion & Choices, Dr. Jewel Mullen, Joanne Kuntz, medical orders for life sustaining treatment, Michael C.
