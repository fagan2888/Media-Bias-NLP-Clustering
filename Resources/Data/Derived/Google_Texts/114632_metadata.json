Use the Agricultural Employer Checklist\n\nMichigan State University Extension has recently revised its Agricultural Employer Checklist. Farms that hire labor should use this document as a general education tool on the employment process.\n\nAgricultural employers of labor in Michigan have a newly updated tool in the form of the Agricultural Employer Checklist, which was revised Oct. 1, 2015 and updated by Stan Moore, Adam Kantrovich, Corey Risch and John Jones of Michigan State University Extension. The checklist was developed in 2011 and revised to incorporate changes that are needed to reflect the hiring process for agricultural workers in Michigan. The document is available on the MSU Extension Farm Information Resource Management ( FIRM ) Labor and Human Resource Management website, or can be downloaded at: Agricultural Employer Checklist.\n\nThe checklist is put together in five sections that outlines the steps used when hiring labor. \u201cSection 1: Employers Prepare to Hire Agricultural Employees\u201d provides what steps should be taken by the employer in this phase of hiring. Section 2 outlines the processes the employer must do \u201cAfter Hiring Agricultural Employees, Employers Must.\u201d In Section 3, the checklist outlines what the \u201cEmployer Must Provide to the Employee,\u201d and Section 4 gives the documents that an agricultural \u201cEmployer Must Complete Annually.\u201d\n\nSection 5 gives employers a list of all the \u201cOther Potential Labor Regulations\u201d that agricultural employers need to be aware of, including unemployment insurance, pesticide and worker protection rules, OSHA and MIOSHA regulations, the Affordable Care Act and the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act. Finally, a list of references is placed in Section 6 along with links to useful publications that all employers should have on file.\n\nAccording to Kantrovich, MSU Extension FIRM states that this is not a complete list, but one that contains many of the more common items to be aware of, and \u201calways consult your legal and tax consultants about your specific situation.\u201d\n\nFor additional information on labor and human resource management, see the MSU Extension Labor and Human Resource Management website or contact your local MSU Extension educator.\n\nRelated Articles", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michigan State University Extension has recently revised its Agricultural Employer Checklist.
