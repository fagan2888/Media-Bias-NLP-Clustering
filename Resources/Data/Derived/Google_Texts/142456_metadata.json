Of those, 200,000 quit shortly after the campaign. More than 100,000 are expected to stop permanently.\n\n\u201cThe TIPS campaign surpassed our expectations,\u201d CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a call Monday, saying the results represented more than a doubling of initial goals. \u201cThat\u2019s a tremendous success story. These are Americans that will live longer lives, healthier lives with lower health-care costs.\u201d\n\nThe $54 million ad series, which ended in June 2012, featured stark images and emotional pleas from ex-smokers suffering from a variety of ailments, including amputated limbs, oral and throat cancer, paralysis, lung damage, strokes, and heart attacks.\n\nOne of the most haunting ads featured a 52-year-old North Carolina woman named Terrie Hall, who had to have her larynx removed after being diagnosed with throat cancer. She now speaks with the help of an artificial voice box.\n\n\u201cThe only voice my grandson\u2019s ever heard is this one,\u201d she says in a robot-like voice in one commercial.\n\nThe CDC study, published in the medical journal the Lancet, surveyed a randomly selected group of about 3,000 smokers and 2,200 nonsmokers before and after the initial ad campaign. Almost 80 percent of smokers and nearly 75 percent of nonsmokers recalled seeing at least one of the ads during the campaign, the CDC found.\n\nThe agency also said that calls to its toll-free quit line (800-QUIT-NOW) more than doubled during the ad campaign, and visits to its Web site were five times greater than during the same three-month period a year earlier.\n\nOfficials said the campaign saved an estimated 300,000 years of life that otherwise would have been lost to smoking-related disease, which remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 1,200 Americans each day.\n\n\u201cThis study shows that we save a year of life for less than $200. That makes it one of the most cost-effective prevention efforts,\u201d Tim McAfee, director of the CDC\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health and lead author of the study, said in a statement Monday.\n\nA second batch of TIPS ads aired in early 2013, and the agency plans to air another round in 2014.\n\n\u201cBottom line: Ads against tobacco work,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cThis campaign saved lives. . . . It also saves money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cdc smoking, tips commercials, quit smoking, terrie's story, the lancet, tom frieden, thomas frieden", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "CDC says 1.6\u00a0million Americans tried to quit after encountering the federally funded \u201cTips from Former Smokers.\u201d", "title": "Study: More than 200,000 stop lighting up after seeing former smokers in hard-hitting ad campaign", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-200000-americans-quit-smoking-after-graphic-ad-campaign/2013/09/09/eed5038a-196e-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@brady_dennis"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/cdc-200000-americans-quit-smoking-after-graphic-ad-campaign/2013/09/09/eed5038a-196e-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "cdc smoking, tips commercials, quit smoking, terrie's story, the lancet, tom frieden, thomas frieden", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "eed5038a-196e-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "CDC says 1.6\u00a0million Americans tried to quit after encountering the federally funded \u201cTips from Former Smokers.\u201d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5f1b\"", "article_summary": "A second batch of TIPS ads aired in early 2013, and the agency plans to air another round in 2014.\nAn estimated 200,000 Americans quit smoking in the wake of a federally funded ad campaign that graphically showed the consequences of tobacco use, according to a study released Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\u201cThe TIPS campaign surpassed our expectations,\u201d CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a call Monday, saying the results represented more than a doubling of initial goals.\nThe CDC study, published in the medical journal the Lancet, surveyed a randomly selected group of about 3,000 smokers and 2,200 nonsmokers before and after the initial ad campaign.\nThe CDC said an estimated 1.6 million U.S. smokers attempted to quit last year after encountering the three-month \u201cTips From Former Smokers\u201d campaign, which was funded by the Affordable Care Act."}
