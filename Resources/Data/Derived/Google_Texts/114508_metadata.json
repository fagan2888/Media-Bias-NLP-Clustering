However, the site launched amid glitches and other technical difficulties that resulted in it responding slowly and at times crashing.\n\nThe 1,000 pages of documents included emails, studies, memoranda and slide presentations from January 1, 2012 to the present.\n\nThe documents also show that on the day before the website launch, Blue Canopy, a contractor that was testing the security, reported that a problem related to receiving messages \u201cwould cause the service to crash.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "executive", "classification": "/FOX
