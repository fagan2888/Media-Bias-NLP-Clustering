She didn\u2019t make the team for the 2012 London Games, even though she won her first world championships gold medal seven weeks later.\n\nShe knows how much is at stake \u2014 for her and for women\u2019s wrestling in the U.S. \u2014 but for all that to happen she must win her weight class Sunday at the Olympic Trials in Iowa City. Only one wrestler at each weight goes to Rio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an Olympic-caliber wrestler, I\u2019ve beaten Olympic champions, I\u2019m the best girl in the world right now in my weight division, but I do not have an O-word by my name,\u201d said Gray, who is on a 35-match winning streak going back to July 2014. \u201cWomen\u2019s wrestling has this influx of sponsors, of support, and USA Wrestling thankfully picked me to help head that. It\u2019s been an awesome opportunity and an awesome journey. Little girls know my name. I am just so excited to have that platform and to be in that position.\n\n\u201cBut I haven\u2019t made an Olympic team, and it\u2019s going to mean something when I do. That title is special. It\u2019s crazy that I can be as successful as I\u2019ve been. It comes down to timing. If this year doesn\u2019t go great, it\u2019s unfortunate, but I peaked too soon. My two great years were 2014 and \u201915, not that \u201916 year that really matters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate the magnitude of the opportunity Gray will have if she wins in Rio.\n\n\u201cShe already is the face of our program, but she can really etch that in stone,\u201d said Terry Steiner, the women\u2019s national team coach since 2002. \u201cI really think she\u2019s like a Billie Jean King. In 30-40 years, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be talking about Adeline Gray. She has that kind of charisma, she has that kind of ability to reach the population.\n\n\u201cAnd she loves that spotlight. Some people, they want to win and do their thing, but they don\u2019t want that spotlight and that kind of attention. Adeline, I think she revels in it. She understands there\u2019s a lot more than an Olympic gold medal at stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember having a blast\u201d\n\nSeven years before women\u2019s wrestling made its Olympic debut at the 2004 Athens Games, Gray took up the sport by joining Bear Creek Junior Wrestling, where her uncle, Paul Delmonico, was the coach. Her father, George, helped him.\n\nAdeline was 6 years old, smitten from the start.\n\n\u201cWe had like 50 kids under the age of 8,\u201d Adeline recalled. \u201cIt was this crazy hodgepodge of people running around and coaches trying to keep kids calm. It was so fun. I remember having a blast. My uncle would run the practice. He would be: \u2018OK, these are the techniques we\u2019re going to learn, pair off and do this.\u2019 Half of us would go and screw around and the other half would be pulled by our parents, their dad would be like \u2018You\u2019re going to pay attention. OK, what are we learning today?\u2019 Dad would break it down for me.\u201d\n\nWrestling was good for Adeline because she was \u201csuper-hyper\u201d as a child. She never wanted to go to sleep at night. She couldn\u2019t sit through a meal. She had too much energy to sit still in class.\n\n\u201cTo this day, if I don\u2019t work out for a couple days, I can feel this buzzing energy,\u201d said Gray, 25. \u201cI radiate this overwhelming energy. People are like \u2018You\u2019ve just got to stop, you\u2019ve got to chill out.\u2019 It\u2019s this craziness that probably is ADHD. My parents were like \u2018This kid is going to need to be medicated, or figure something out.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWrestling gave her an outlet for all that energy. It tired her out so she could fall asleep at normal times. It gave her an activity to help focus her attention.\n\n\u201cIf I didn\u2019t want to go to bed, I would do push-ups and sit-ups until I was so tired or bored that I wanted to go to sleep,\u201d said Gray, the oldest of four girls in a family with no brothers. \u201cThat\u2019s weird in middle school, and it would have been weird to do if I didn\u2019t have something where I was like \u2018This is going to make me stronger.\u2019 I could rationalize how to control my overhyperness and have it work for me. I could get up and do a two-hour bike ride before school and be like \u2018I\u2019m cutting weight for practice,\u2019 but actually it just helped me pay attention in class.\u201d\n\nWhen she started wrestling, Adeline and Delmonico\u2019s daughter, Arenet, were the only girls in the program. A couple years later, one of Adeline\u2019s sisters, Geneva, joined them. Adeline would learn to wrestle by practicing against boys.\n\nA big junior tournament in those days might attract three to five girls. Now those same tournaments can have 100.\n\n\u201cAt that point, there\u2019s really no difference between boys and girls,\u201d Adeline said. \u201cThe fact that I had to deal with my hair was pretty much the biggest obstacle. There isn\u2019t a muscle difference. I actually think I had an advantage as a female because we mature a little bit faster than the boys do. I had an attention span of about five seconds, where the boys had about three.\u201d\n\nIn high school, bodies develop differently. Boys gain more upper body strength. Girls develop lower centers of gravity. Adeline had been training with boys for eight years, so she could handle herself competing with them in high school \u2014 at Bear Creek her freshman year, then at Chatfield her sophomore and junior years. After winning a junior world title at age 17, she moved to an Olympic development program at Northern Michigan University.\n\n\u201cI learned so much in high school, getting beat up, getting the boys to make me better,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt was an opportunity for me to have to figure it out. I have girls on the Olympic stage that are stronger than me, girls that are bigger and faster. It definitely feels escalated when you\u2019re on the mat against a boy sometimes because those differences are larger. You look at a 140-pound girl, she\u2019s going to be softer than the 140-pound boy, especially when he turns 17, 18 years old.\u201d\n\nLiving the dormitory life\n\nFor the past eight years, Adeline has lived a dormitory life at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. She has her own bedroom and bathroom, sharing a living room with another wrestler, Jennifer Page. She eats her meals in the OTC cafeteria.\n\n\u201cPeople keep asking me, \u2018What are you going to do to win the Olympics?\u2019 \u201d Gray said over an oatmeal breakfast there last month. \u201cI\u2019m like \u2018Nothing that I haven\u2019t done.\u2019 I\u2019ve been working hard for years. This has been me getting better for eight years. It\u2019s been a great thing to know it\u2019s coming to that peak right now. This is my year, and the platform\u2019s kind of set up through wrestling and this culture we have that\u2019s budding with women\u2019s sports being more important and pushing to have more role models for young girls.\u201d\n\nSunday represents a crucial step in that process. As the reigning world champion in her weight class \u2014 the heaviest of the three women\u2019s divisions at 75 kilograms (165 pounds) \u2014 Gray gets a bye to the final at the Olympic Trials. About a dozen women will wrestle off for the right to face her.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to the bye. She will be well rested, but the woman she faces in the final might be on a roll.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take the trials lightly,\u201d said Steiner. \u201cEveryone is going to come swinging. They may not be as experienced, they may not have the notoriety, but they\u2019re not going to hand over an Olympic spot.\n\n\u201cBut from what I see, Adeline is on task. She\u2019s on track. She\u2019s a professional athlete. She knows what her job is. I don\u2019t have to worry about Adeline as far as doing what she needs to be doing. She\u2019s very self-driven and self-motivated. She knows what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Adeline Gray aims to be 1st American woman to win Olympic wrestling gold", "title": "Adeline Gray aims to be 1st American woman to win Olympic wrestling gold", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/adeline-gray-aims-to-be-1st-american-woman-to-win-olympic-wrestling-gold/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160409_015016_adeline-gray.jpg", "height": 462}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160409_015016_adeline-gray.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T13:28:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T13:08:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWomen\u2019s wrestling has this influx of sponsors, of support, and USA Wrestling thankfully picked me to help head that.\nFirst, though, Adeline Gray has to get there.\n\u201cAt that point, there\u2019s really no difference between boys and girls,\u201d Adeline said.\nIn 30-40 years, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be talking about Adeline Gray.\nI have girls on the Olympic stage that are stronger than me, girls that are bigger and faster."}
