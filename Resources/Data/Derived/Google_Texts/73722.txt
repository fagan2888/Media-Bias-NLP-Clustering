Moreover, Romney seems to be praising Obamacare's effects of dramatically reducing the nation's uninsured rate.

Romney's much-belated concession came in comments he made to the Boston Globe about the death Friday of his friend Thomas Stemberg, the founder of Staples, the office supply giant that was founded with backing from Bain Capital, Romney's former investment firm.



Romney told the Globe that soon after he was elected governor in late 2002, Stemberg asked him why he had run. When Romney said he did so to help people, "Stemberg replied that if he really wanted to help, he should give everyone access to health care, which Romney said he hadn't really considered before," the Globe article said.

"Without Tom pushing it, I don't think we would have had Romneycare," Romney told the Globe. "Without Romneycare, I don't think we would have Obamacare. So, without Tom a lot of people wouldn't have health insurance."
