In anticipation of bitterly cold temperatures this weekend, two Wichita shelters are keeping their doors open a little longer for people who have nowhere else to go.

The Inter-Faith Ministries Warming Souls Winter Shelters for the homeless will remain open all day on Sunday because of a bitterly cold weather forecast, said Executive Director Anne Corriston.

“Typically the winter shelter operates only at night, closing around 7:00 each morning,” she said. “Most of our guests spend the day working, looking for work, or seeking assistance at area social service agencies.

The shelters are open from November 1 through March 31 each year. Several area churches and volunteer groups provide meals, snacks, and warm clothing such as socks, coats, hats, and gloves.

“Since so many local agencies are closed on Sunday we have decided to keep the shelters open all day because exposure during this extreme cold could be fatal,” Corriston said.

The men’s shelter is located at 841 North Market in the Inter-Faith Spiritual Center. The women’s shelter is at 841 North Broadway, the site of the Ti’ Wiconi Safe Haven.

Corriston said that from November 1 through December 31, 2013 the shelter provided 5,101 bed nights for men and women.
