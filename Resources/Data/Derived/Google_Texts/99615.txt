A 17-year-old Pomperaug High School student who just celebrated her birthday was killed in a crash on Interstate 84 in Southington this weekend, along with a recent graduate of the school.

Aryana Youngquist, 17, was traveling inside a car being driven by 20-year-old Charlie Campoverde, who graduated from Pomperaug High School from 2011, on Saturday morning.

The car slammed into the back of a tractor-trailer parked in the breakdown lane prior to Exit 27 on I-84, police said.

Youngquist and Campoverde were pronounced dead at the scene, police said.



The westbound right and center lanes on I-84 in Southington between exits 29 and 27 were closed for most of the day following the crash so police could investigate.

On Monday, friends told Eyewitness News that Youngquist and Campoverde were a couple.

"She really has impacted a lot of people and it's a shame she had to go," said student Alyssa Meyers.

Pomperaug High School had grief councilors on hand Monday. Pictures were set up in the auditorium Monday so students could pay their respects on Tuesday.

"She would want us to be happy every day and focus on our school work," Kelly Canfield said. "And that she would want us supporting each other and being there."

Youngquist was a stage crew member for the high school's theater department. Her peers made banners with a saying she recently wrote for a college essay.

"She would want us to be happy and to move on but keep her memory with us," Meyers said.

After high school, students told Eyewitness News Youngquist wanted to go to college and study art.

Eyewitness News learned both students were close with their siblings and families.
