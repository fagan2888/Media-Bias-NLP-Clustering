Bradley Byrne has wasted no time trying to make his mark on a major national policy issue, announcing on his first full day in office that he has signed on to the latest Republican effort to repeal Obamacare.\n\nByrne, R-Montrose, announced Thursday that he will co-sponsor the American Health Care Reform Act of 2013, a plan pushed by the chairman of the influential House conservative caucus to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The bill, originally filed in September, has 118 co-sponsors.\n\n\u201cOver the past six months, I promised my constituents that if elected, I would fight to repeal the destructive Obamacare law and replace it with common-sense, conservative reforms,\u201d Byrne said in a prepared statement. \u201cAs my first legislative act as Congressman, I am making good on that pledge.\u201d\n\nThe bill would repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care overhaul with a plan that its sponsors promise would rely on market-based solutions to cure America\u2019s health care problems.\n\nThe bill would provide a tax break of $7,500 for individuals and $20,000 for families to help Americans purchase health insurance. The government also would fund statewide high-risk pools to help people with pre-existing medical problems that make it difficult to buy insurance.\n\nInsurance companies would be able to sell policies across state lines under the proposal, which also would expand Health Savings Accounts and limit medical malpractice lawsuits.\n\nThe Republican-led House has voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but the GOP does not have the votes in the Senate to pass any of the bills. And even if they did, their proposals would face a certain veto.\n\nThe bill that Byrne signed on to received a cool reception from liberal groups when its sponsors unveiled it last year. The left-leaning group Think Progress criticized it as rewarmed ideas dating back to the George W. Bush administration that would do little to help the uninsured and could unravel the employer-sponsored health care system.\n\nBut Byrne said the bill would create competition that would bring down prices.\n\n\u201cThis measure eliminates billions in taxes and thousands of pages of burdensome regulations by repealing Obamacare, which is weighing down our economy and hurting families across south Alabama,\u201d he stated. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s not enough to just be against something \u2013 to govern, we have to provide conservative alternatives and do what is right for the American people.\u201d\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the chairman of the House Republican Study Committee, praised Byrne.\n\n\u201cIt is significant that on Bradley Byrne\u2019s first day as a member of Congress, he has already shown determination to solve problems facing hardworking families in Alabama by co-sponsoring our bill to lower health costs and put patients back in charge of their health care decisions,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, AL-01, Bradley Byrne, news", "title": "Fresh off oath, Congressman Byrne joins latest Republican effort to repeal Obamacare", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Fresh off oath, Congressman Byrne joins latest Republican effort to repeal Obamacare\", \"link\": \"http://blog.al.com/live/2014/01/fresh_off_oath_congressman_byr.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/12873513-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11959420\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-09T16:36:45Z\", \"author\": \"Brendan Kirby\", \"tags\": [\"@river-all\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"AL-01\",\"Bradley Byrne\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/live/photo/12873513-standard.jpg", "description": "Rep.
