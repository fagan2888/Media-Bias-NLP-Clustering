ARVADA — After the game, Pomona coach Jay Madden temporarily stopped an interview so he could make sure his Panthers would play Cherry Creek again next season.

This has been one of the better nonleague rivalries for decades — also covering playoff and championship games — and keeping it intact can only be good for Class 5A football.

While the first half Friday night was forgettable, the second half was more in line as Cherry Creek got past the Panthers 19-15 at the North Area Athletic Complex.

The Bruins, ranked No. 4 in the CHSAAnow.com 5A poll, improved to 2-0.

No. 6 Pomona is 1-1.

Cherry Creek junior Milo Hall had 27 carries for 169 yards and a touchdown. The Bruins gradually improved their blocking. A key reverse for a TD by Joseph Parker covered 53 yards. A coffin-corner punt by Charlie Scott pinned Pomona at its 1-yard line.

Still, the first half ended 6-3 and, well … “I wouldn’t have sat there for this after paying,” Madden said.

Bruins coach Dave Logan didn’t disagree. “We tried to give the game away in the first half,” he said, “but we played hard. We just need to get a lot better. I was proud of the effort. Pomona’s good and this is part of the building process.”

Hall, steady all game, said yes, he would sleep well.

“But blockers helped me and we’re just trying to get better every week,” Hall said.

The Bruins rushed for 309 yards on 39 attempts, but they were only 9-of-29 passing for 112 yards.

Pomona was held to 181 total yards.
