It\u2019s become so inane that it\u2019s easy to forget that real feelings and people are involved. It has become a proxy fight, the Vietnam of the culture wars. The instigators are the Christian right but also politicians who manipulate people\u2019s deepest emotions for votes and the tiniest advantage against political opponents. \u201cStanding up for Christmas\u201d is the same thing as defending apple pie and motherhood. It takes no courage, because none of these things are really \u201cunder attack,\u201d but the continuous \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d nonsense is driving a lot of the joy out of the holiday.\n\nI used to love Christmas. When I was a child my family wasn\u2019t religious, but my parents put extreme time, effort and money into making Christmas special. There were too many presents, too much food and the entire world stopped spinning for a month so we could participate in community and family activities. None of this involved church, ever, and Christmas carries a great many of my best childhood memories.\n\nOne of my most vivid memories of Christmas is of my mother wrapping a gift in plain paper for my aunt, who was a Buddhist. It stands out in my mind, because I knew very few non-Christians as a child. My mother knew enough, even before discussions of diversity were common, to try and give a gift to my aunt on her terms. My mother was careful to avoid shoving her traditions down someone\u2019s throat. To this day it is one of the most beautiful gestures of understanding I remember from the holidays. If people could just hang on to that sense of respect, there would be no fictional \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d narrative.\n\nContrary to the bizarre religious posturing offered by Linus in the classic \u201cPeanuts\u201d special, Christmas is not about Jesus. Not for a sizable minority of us. For most of my life, Jesus has been a bit player. Over the last few years, a cottage industry of Christmas pushers and religious fundamentalists have manufactured a list of penalties and prohibitions to dictate how each and every American must celebrate the holiday. Christmas has become about religious coercion.\n\nIn my early twenties, I belonged to an aggressive, fundamentalist church. If someone wished us \u201chappy holidays\u201d we treated it as a chance to \u201creach out\u201d to the \u201cunsaved.\u201d I don\u2019t think fundamentalists are the ones yelling the loudest about the \u201cWar on Christmas,\u201d but rather I suspect it\u2019s the casual Christians who are the problem. They are the people who feel guilty about not being religious enough and who lie to pollsters about how often they go to church. They yell louder and foam at the mouth, but in the end are some of the least committed and most hypocritical members of the faith community. That is why they need Christmas. If their houses aren\u2019t lit up like, well, a Christmas tree, then someone might notice their lack of any other outward religious observance.\n\nThe fear of a waning Christmas is of course preposterous. Have you stepped outside? Turned on the television? The holiday is a bloated, shrieking testament to excess, ever encroaching on other holidays like Thanksgiving and Halloween. When every street stops looking like the inside of Santa\u2019s colon, people can start to worry.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With every predictable rant by the human outrage machines, the holiday loses a little magic for me.
