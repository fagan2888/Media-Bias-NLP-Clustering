That\u2019s evident at Lady M Cake Boutiques.\n\nRevenue is up 40 percent this year at the New York-based company with more customers paying $60 to $85 \u2014 three or four times what a supermarket cake costs \u2014 for confections made of paper-thin pastry dough and flavored with ingredients like green tea and chestnuts. Business is so good that owner Ken Romaniszyn, who has two locations in Manhattan and one in Los Angeles, plans three or four next year in New York, Boston and Charlotte, N.C. He\u2019ll hire 60 new employees to staff the stores, adding to Lady M\u2019s current staff of 145.\n\nHis cakes, which once appealed mostly to the wealthy are now attracting a wider range of customers, Romaniszyn says.\n\n\u201cThe middle class, they can afford to make a special occasion a little more special,\u201d he says.\n\nThe U.S. economy is growing at a solid pace. This week, government figures showed that consumers and businesses drove growth to a sizzling 5 percent annual rate last quarter. Fewer Americans are applying for jobless benefits. In the first 11 months of this year, employers have added 2.65 million jobs. That already makes 2014 the best year for hiring since 1999.\n\nA good chunk of the good news can be attributed to improvements at small companies. Reports from payroll company ADP and software maker Intuit show small-business hiring has gained momentum since the summer. The trend looks to continue \u2014 surveys by Wells Fargo & Co. and the National Federation of Independent Business show more owners plan to bring in new employees in the coming months.\n\nWith revenue up 11 percent this year at her four Squeeze In restaurants in Reno, Nev., and near Lake Tahoe, owner Misty Young plans to add nine people to her staff of about 90 next year. She\u2019ll also open a fifth restaurant next month in Redwood City, Calif., and hire 25 employees there.\n\nDiners are spending an average 35 cents more per meal. When multiplied by the 270,000 people Young serves a year, it gives her an extra $94,500 in annual revenue, she says. Customers are ordering some of the most expensive items on the menu, like a $22 crab omelet. They\u2019re willing to pay a few dollars more for a premium vodka like Grey Goose in their Bloody Marys.\n\n\u201cPeople are in this \u2018I deserve it\u2019 mentality. They\u2019ve worked hard and they want to play hard,\u201d Young says.\n\nThe healthier economy is luring customers back to Spa Lamar for massages, facials and pedicures. Owner Heidi Lamar, who has 35 employees, is hiring to bring her staff back up to 50, the level before the recession.\n\nCustomers visit the Scottsdale, Ariz., spa more often, and they\u2019re asking for more services. The average bill has soared this quarter to $122 from $98, Lamar says. She needs more staffers to handle the increased workload.\n\n\u201cThe group we have is getting to the point where they\u2019re maxed out,\u201d she says.\n\nThe increase in business has encouraged Lamar to add new services such as massages for couples. She\u2019s also renovating and painting the spa.\n\nSome of the pickup in revenue comes from snowbirds, people who come to Arizona to escape the cold. But area residents are splurging on themselves again, she says.\n\n\u201cThey say, \u2018we\u2019ve really missed you. It\u2019s good to be coming back again,'\u201d she says.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "More \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d signs up at small businesses", "title": "More \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d signs up at small businesses", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/24/more-help-wanted-signs-up-at-small-businesses/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224__20141225_A18_BZ25SMALLBIZp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224__20141225_A18_BZ25SMALLBIZp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-24T19:28:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T11:15:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This week, government figures showed that consumers and businesses drove growth to a sizzling 5 percent annual rate last quarter.\nA good chunk of the good news can be attributed to improvements at small companies.\nOwner Heidi Lamar, who has 35 employees, is hiring to bring her staff back up to 50, the level before the recession.\nIf you\u2019re looking for signs that the U.S. economy is growing and that the job market is improving, just talk to small-business owners.\nHis cakes, which once appealed mostly to the wealthy are now attracting a wider range of customers, Romaniszyn says."}
