Bush are manufactured as candidates, abetted by a media all too game to play along. But the meta-narrative she documents emerged from public performances\u2014no one involved tried to hide what they were doing. (The title of the essay comes from an \u201ceerily contrived moment\u201d in which Dukakis tosses a baseball to his press secretary on an airport tarmac while reporters and camera crews diligently take notes for stories on Dukakis\u2019 authenticity and \u201ctoughness.\u201d)\n\nThis is simply how modern political campaigns\u2014at least high-level ones\u2014are conducted. Didion\u2019s complaints now seem a tad antiquated, though still righteously spot-on.\n\nBut now comes a new twist: the art of the non-campaign. The candidate who doesn\u2019t even bother to put on a show, doesn\u2019t even pretend to reach the broad middle of the citizenry and instead appears behind closed doors to small groups of like-minded voters, if he or she appears in public at all. Why risk saying or doing something stupid when you don\u2019t need to? Why legitimize your opponent by pretending that he or she even exists?\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of campaign that some Texas Republicans are now running, in particular Ken Paxton, who\u2019s favored to become attorney general, and Dan Patrick, who\u2019s the frontrunner for lieutenant governor. Their campaigns are marked by a general refusal to speak with reporters, engage with their opponents, hold press conferences, meet with newspaper editorial boards, publicly announce events in advance, or even run TV ads.\n\nInstead, the two men are running \u201cstealth\u201d campaigns\u2014as the Houston Chronicle recently put it\u2014speaking to tea party gatherings or events closed to the press.\n\nA talk-radio show host not known for his reticence, Patrick ran a boisterous campaign against his three rivals during the GOP lieutenant governor primary and later in a head-to-head runoff against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. Now, he\u2019s like the chupacabra: rumored but rarely seen in the flesh. The Houston Chronicle reported in a Sept. 12 story:\n\nThen, as if a switch flipped, his campaign went into hunker-down mode. It sent two news releases in the six weeks after the runoff. Patrick did not re-emerge until even later, in a July 16 public speech in front of an estimated 11,000 students, parents and teachers at the annual gathering of the Texas Future Farmers Association. When he addressed the state\u2019s broadcaster\u2019s association Aug. 7, Patrick quickly left without taking questions from reporters \u2014but only after shouting, \u201cI\u2019ve been the most media-friendly guy in the Legislature!\u201d before vanishing. Just this week, Patrick\u2019s campaign declined an invitation to appear before the Houston Chronicle editorial board. \u201cAt this time the senator does not plan to meet with editorial boards,\u201d Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said.\n\nWhen Patrick did announce a press conference last week, reporters wondered what big reveal he had in store. As it turned out, Patrick called the media together to announce that he was the most business-friendly candidate. The whole thing lasted 15 minutes.\n\nHis opponent, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte (D-San Antonio), who\u2019s excited many Democrats with a peppy, wide-ranging effort, challenged Patrick to five debates but he agreed to only one. Patrick is campaigning\u2014just not in a way accessible to most Texans.\n\n\u201c3 days \u2013 6 cities \u2013 3 planes & one rental car drive from Midland to Lubbock,\u201d Patrick wrote in a Facebook post on Sept. 18. \u201cI will not be out worked.\u201d\n\nTed Delisi, a GOP consultant quoted in the Chronicle, acknowledged that it\u2019s \u201cnot the typical campaigning\u201d but then implausibly tried to coin the approach as not being \u201ccovert,\u201d but rather \u201cthe new overt.\u201d\n\nIf anything, state Sen. Ken Paxton is even more covertly overt. Paxton is the overwhelming favorite to be the next attorney general\u2014he faces an underfunded Democratic attorney with the somewhat helpful name Sam Houston. The highlight of Paxton\u2019s resume so far is that he\u2019s admitted to violating state securities law by accepting kickbacks from an investment firm without disclosing that relationship to regulators or his clients. And apparently he\u2019s not eager to talk about it: Paxton has been almost completely AWOL.\n\nI can find precisely one news account of a public appearance in the last month. On Sept. 8, he was the special guest of honor at a San Jacinto County Republican Party event, where he told the crowd that Obamacare would be \u201cobliterated\u201d if unspecified lawsuits were successful. Dan Patrick is like the chupacabra: rumored but rarely seen in the flesh. His Facebook page touts a fundraiser with Ted Cruz next Monday in Allen.\n\nPerhaps Paxton learned the value of ducking the press in late July when\u2014after noting to a sheriffs group that \u201ca one-party system takes out accountability, takes out competition\u201d\u2014San Antonio Express-News reporter Nolan Hicks approached him after the event and was \u201cphysically blocked by Paxton spokesman Anthony Holm.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Sam Houston has fruitlessly tried to engage his opponent. He\u2019s repeatedly challenged Paxton to debate, but Paxton\u2019s only response has come through his spokesman. \u201cOur opponent is losing, badly, so it\u2019s not surprising that he continues this desperate ploy for publicity when he\u2019s down by 20+ points,\u201d Anthony Holm told the Texas Tribune in an email.\n\nSo we have the prospect of a state senator who faces indictment and serious ethics charges waltzing into office as the next attorney general without having debated, campaigned or meaningfully engaged his general election opponent or the public on the issues of the day.\n\nThe approach, of course, makes perfect strategic sense. Democrats haven\u2019t won a single statewide race in two decades, and Republicans enjoy sizable structural advantages even against well-funded and charismatic Democrats. Why risk saying or doing something stupid when you don\u2019t need to? Why legitimize your opponent by pretending that he or she even exists? Better to keep your head down and coast to election.\n\nThe non-campaign approach is not entirely new. Rick Perry tried aspects of it in 2010, when he ran for re-election against former Houston Mayor Bill White. Much to the chagrin of the White campaign, Perry refused to participate in a single debate and snubbed newspaper editorial boards. He crushed Bill White 55-42. What lesson does a GOP candidate for statewide office draw from that? That silence is preferable to splashy public events. That talking to the mainstream press isn\u2019t worth it when the voters who show up to the polls either get their information from preferred sources or consider snubbing the lamestream media as a mark of political bravery.\n\nIt also puts the press in a bind: How do you cover a non-campaign? Press conferences, block-walking, baby-kissing, stumping, Chamber of Commerce speeches: This is the stuff of which political journalism is made. The Houston Chronicle, for example, did a thorough story on Patrick\u2019s stealthiness. But it was a one-day piece; it\u2019s hard to keep writing about silence.\n\nAnd if Paxton and Patrick prevail as expected, will more GOP candidates attempt the stealth campaign in the next general election? Probably so, until Democrats can prove more competitive. Are we entering an era when the state\u2019s top officials won\u2019t even have to engage with Texas\u2019 general election voters? For Democrats, this seems the ultimate insult. They\u2019re losing, and their opponents aren\u2019t even trying anymore.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ken Paxton and Dan Patrick's campaigns are marked by a general refusal to speak with reporters, engage with their opponents, or even announce events in advance.", "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Observer", "description": "Ken Paxton and Dan Patrick's campaigns are marked by a general refusal to speak with reporters, engage with their opponents, or even announce events in advance.", "title": "Dan Patrick and Ken Paxton, Perfecting the Non-Campaign", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dan-Patrick-hb2-sharp.jpg", "height": 683}, "updated_time": "2014-09-23T10:15:45-05:00", "url": "https://www.texasobserver.org/dan-patrick-ken-paxton-art-non-campaign/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ken Paxton and Dan Patrick's campaigns are marked by a general refusal to speak with reporters, engage with their opponents, or even announce events in advance.", "creator": "@Forrest4Trees", "image": "https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dan-Patrick-hb2-sharp.jpg", "title": "Dan Patrick and Ken Paxton, Perfecting the Non-Campaign", "site": "@TexasObserver", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=417283609", "fb": {"pages": 21002115613, "app_id": 902538479865047}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texasobserver", "published_time": "2014-09-23T10:14:03-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/texasobserver", "section": "Blogs", "modified_time": "2014-09-23T10:15:45-05:00", "tag": "Sam Houston"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1902\"", "article_summary": "And if Paxton and Patrick prevail as expected, will more GOP candidates attempt the stealth campaign in the next general election?\nThat\u2019s the kind of campaign that some Texas Republicans are now running, in particular Ken Paxton, who\u2019s favored to become attorney general, and Dan Patrick, who\u2019s the frontrunner for lieutenant governor.\nWhen Patrick did announce a press conference last week, reporters wondered what big reveal he had in store.\nHis opponent, state Sen.
