That is a free service that is supposed to remain free.\u201d\n\nThe federal government, along with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, began sending out advisories against possible fraud related to Obamacare many months ago, Abernathy said.\n\n\u201cThere are scammers out there who are calling around and saying \u2018All right we need your Medicare number. We need to update your profile.\u2019 A Medicare beneficiary can hand over that information without thinking about it \u2014 and they\u2019ve just given a criminal their Social Security number,\u201d Abernathy said.\n\nAs previously reported, TDCI implemented registration requirements and criminal background checks on people who serve as Obamacare navigators or certified Obamacare application counselors in Tennessee.\n\nSuch people are responsible for handling the financial or medical information belonging to other individuals.\n\nStrangely, last month, mainstream media outlets such as the Washington Post seemed to condemn Tennessee and other states for implementing these policies, saying they were getting in the way of progress.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a very palpable concern . . . that anti-Obamacare state government people will find ways to gum up the works,\u201d the Post quoted Leonardo Cuello, director of health reform for the National Health Law Program, as saying.\n\nLast week, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the regulations, claiming they might penalize librarians or health care workers who helped someone sign up for Obamacare.\n\nDespite the ruling, Abernathy said anyone who handles another person\u2019s personal financial or medical information is still subject to the regulations.\n\nTennesseans with concerns about their insurance plan or with concerns about possible fraud can call the Consumer Insurance Division (615) 741-2218 or 1-800-342-4029 (inside Tennessee).\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org.\n\nGet regular Tennessee Watchdog updates through our Facebook or Twitter accounts\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
