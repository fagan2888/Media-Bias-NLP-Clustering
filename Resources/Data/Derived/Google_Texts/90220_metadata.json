This year alone, he has directed three Broadway revivals: \u201cThe Elephant Man\u201d with Bradley Cooper, \u201cYou Can\u2019t Take it With You\u201d with James Earl Jones\u2014and now \u201cOn the Twentieth Century,\u201d a Betty Comden and Adolph Green musical comedy from 1978 about a theater impresario (played by Peter Gallagher) on a train who has to convince a movie star, and his former lover (Ms. Chenoweth), to star in his next play before they arrive in New York.\n\nMr. Ellis spoke to the Journal about the tricky business of heading up revivals, the key to good directing and the difference between \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d laughs.\n\nENLARGE Kristin Chenoweth and Peter Gallagher in a scene from the show. Photo: Joan Marcus\n\nWSJ: What\u2019s the secret to directing comedy?\n\nSE: You have to base it in absolute truth and reality. In \u201cYou Can\u2019t Take it With You,\u201d you can\u2019t be thinking that you are goofy, crazy people. You\u2019re not. You are real people in this situation with real wants and real needs.\n\nIn \u201cOn the Twentieth Century,\u201d the stakes can\u2019t be any higher. You have a person whose career is on the line. By the end of the train ride he has to save himself and to get Lily back.\n\nWSJ: Oscar Jaffee (Peter Gallagher) is based on David Belasco, the theater impresario who owned theaters, directed, produced and discovered Mary Pickford. Is there anyone on Broadway with that kind of influence now?\n\nSE: No. The theater owners\u2014Jujamcyn, the Shuberts, The Nederlanders, would be the closest. But Oscar also molds people, like Lily Garland, and says, \u201cI am going to make you.\u201d\n\nWSJ: You and Kristen have a similar relationship, though, don\u2019t you?\n\nSE: I didn\u2019t discover her, but I did cast her in her first Broadway show, \u201cSteel Pier.\u201d I saw this little petite girl come in and I literally said, \u201cWho the hell was that?\u201d\n\nShe was so tiny, and this voice\u2014most people with those voices don\u2019t have that kind of comedy. They\u2019re not asked to do it because most of those roles that you sing in are ingenues, and ingenues are not written funny. They\u2019re written virgins. That\u2019s why she was so unique.\n\nWSJ: When you\u2019re directing a revival, how do you overcome the original production\u2014especially when it is a beloved show?\n\nSE: You have to try really hard to push that out of your head and say, \u2018What is this role and who do I think can bring some special quality to it?\u2019 That\u2019s all you can do you.\n\nWSJ: A few folks in one of the Broadway chat rooms are upset that you had the lyrics to the song \u201cLegacy\u201d changed. How do you decide what to change from the original versions?\n\nSE: The way it was written, it wasn\u2019t propelling action. It was a good song, but Phyllis Newman [Adolph Green\u2019s widow] agreed we needed to make it a song that tells you a little bit more about Oscar. None of this could be changed without the estate agreeing.\n\nWSJ: What\u2019s your philosophy towards revivals? Are you curating a museum piece for a new generation or trying to rework them?\n\nSE: I try to tell the story in a way that\u2019s truthful to the piece but in a fresh way. I try to make them clearer.\n\nWith \u201cElephant Man,\u201d in the second act there\u2019s a whole moment where he steps out of character and has a role reversal with Treves [his doctor.] Every time I saw it, I thought, I\u2019ve invested so much in John Merrick that once he steps out of it and he\u2019s no longer John Merrick, it took me a long time to get back into the story. Bradley and I agreed on that immediately, but we had to get the permission of the writer [ Bernard Pomerance. ]\n\nWSJ: What was that conversation like?\n\nSE: We were at the Williamstown Theater Festival then, and [Mr. Pomerance] said as long as you\u2019re not going to have the critics review it, I\u2019m not going to see it, so you can do it.\n\nWSJ: What happened when you told him you wanted to bring it to Broadway?\n\nSE: It took a while for him to agree. He wanted us to do his production with no cuts whatsoever. I said, \u201cLook, Bernard, if this is not successful, the critics aren\u2019t going to blame you. They\u2019ll go after me. Why not take the chance?\u201d He\u2019s very happy now. He called me after he saw it on opening night and said \u201cI\u2019m so grateful. Thank you.\u201d\n\nWSJ: How specifically do you make a scene funnier?\n\nSE: Detail, detail, detail, detail. You have to work hard to make things look easy. You want to sharpen things. I say to the actors, \u2018You have permission to do anything you want in this room.\u2019 And then I\u2019ll curate it.\n\nWSJ: Who came up with the bit where he lifts her like a dumbbell while she\u2019s smoking?\n\nSE: That was mine. Andy\u2019s big and she\u2019s small and he came in one time carrying her and I said, \u2018Do this\u2019 [curling her like a dumbbell] and then I said \u2018Smoke to the same rhythm,\u2019 and it was funny.\n\nWSJ: How do you keep the actors in a farce like this from going over the top, becoming too hammy?\n\nSE: It\u2019s really a question of how far can you go within the truth? Does the truth allow that moment? If not, that\u2019s when it becomes not real. I always have to come back to shows to take out the improvements actors have put in. Laughs are addictive and sometimes they\u2019re good laughs and sometimes they\u2019re bad laughs.\n\nWSJ: What makes a bad laugh?\n\nSE: A bad laugh is a laugh for the sake of a laugh that\u2019s out of character. We\u2019ve had laughs in this show where we go, \u201cI know it\u2019s a laugh, but is it truthful? Is it what the character would do?\u201d I have to say to the actor, you\u2019re not going to like me right now, but I\u2019m going to take that away from you.\n\nWrite to Stefanie Cohen at
