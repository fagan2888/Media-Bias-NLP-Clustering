Bob Rucho, who twattered this over the weekend. Metaphors are hard, and sometimes when you really dislike something, it\u2019s hard not to just pile on. After all, for heaven\u2019s sake, people have been comparing Obamacare to the Nazis, or to the gulags, for years now. So why not just slop in a little of everything? And so we learned just how bad the Supreme Court\u2019s upholding of the ACA truly is:\n\n\u201cJustice Robert\u2019s pen & Obamacare has done more damage to the USA then [sic]the swords of the Nazis,Soviets & terrorists combined.\u201d\n\nHonestly, nothing that hasn\u2019t been said before; why is anyone disputing this?\n\nAnd yet people did find fault with the comparison, somehow. In fact, they called it things like \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201ca joke,\u201d and \u201can embarrassment.\u201d Others even had the temerity to point out that that the Nazis, the USSR, and terrorists have killed rather a large number of people, while the death toll from the ACA is as yet undetermined.\n\nRucho was not pleased with such nitpicking. He just wanted to call attention to what a witty play on a clich\u00e9 he had accomplished, and on Sunday called his critics on their failure to even notice:\n\n\u201cThose that tweeted, put your thinking caps back on: \u2018The PEN is mightier than the SWORD.\u2019 Edward Bulwar-Lytton,1839. [sic] But surely you knew that.\u201d\n\nGod, you guys, can\u2019t you see he is just making a point, is all? He even cited his source, which should count for something. It\u2019s not every day you get a source for somebody\u2019s clich\u00e9, after all. Why are all you internet dummies so dumb?\n\nMr. Rucho\u2019s quest for hyperbolic supremacy was overshadowed almost immediately, however, when someone else on Twitter said that Obamacare was worse than the Nazis, the Soviets, terrorism, the Khmer Rouge, and the Star Wars Holiday Special.\n\n[RawStory]\n\nIf you don\u2019t follow Doktor Zoom on Twitter, you are worse than Hitler, Stalin, and Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're actually a little sympathetic to North Carolina state Sen.
