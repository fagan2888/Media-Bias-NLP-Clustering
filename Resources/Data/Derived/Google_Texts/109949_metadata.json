It was a major reason he entered the final round trailing the leaders by seven shots.\n\nBut Palmer, one of a few players in that era capable of driving such a distance, didn\u2019t stop going for the green. In the final round, it finally paid off. His drive bounced onto the left half of the putting surface, coming to rest about 22 feet from the cup.\n\nPalmer two-putted for birdie. Then he birdied five of the next six holes on his way to a 6-under 65, one of the greatest rounds in major championship history. It was enough to give Palmer a two-shot victory over an amateur golfer named Jack Nicklaus.\n\n\u201cIt set the tone for that round,\u201d said John Ogden, the head golf professional at Cherry Hills, who recently spoke with Palmer at length about that tournament. \u201cHe knew to get himself off in the right frame of mind, he had to be aggressive.\u201d\n\nWhen the BMW Championship begins Thursday at Cherry Hills, the best golfers in the world will have an opportunity to follow Palmer\u2019s historic path. The tournament will use the \u201cPalmer Tee\u201d for all four rounds, marking the first time since Palmer\u2019s memorable win that a PGA Tour event has used that tee box as a launching point.\n\nThe Palmer Tee also was used during the 2005 U.S. Women\u2019s Open.\n\nThe tee most commonly used at No. 1 today is 389 yards from the green, with a slight dogleg left. But with the FedEx Cup playoffs making a stop at Cherry Hills, tour official Stephen Cox said the opportunity to honor the game\u2019s history, and set the stage for first-hole drama, was too good to pass up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a fairly unique opportunity that we don\u2019t have very often to almost allow our players to emulate what Palmer did,\u201d said Cox, who added that the tour considered alternating tee boxes between rounds before deciding to stay with the Palmer Tee every day. \u201cIt\u2019s not very often you get a drivable par-4 to start. We were very happy to embrace that. It\u2019s going to be a really cool atmosphere around the first tee.\u201d\n\nThe golfers Ogden has spoken with are thrilled to have the opportunity to walk in Palmer\u2019s shoes, he said. More often than not, an opening hole is designed to get golfers settled into their rounds and play it safe. At No. 1 this week, with many players in the field capable of driving the green, the drama will begin early.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all capable of (driving the green), but they\u2019re going to have to think,\u201d Ogden said. \u201cThey can set the tone of the round. By today\u2019s standards, it\u2019s not a difficult hole. It\u2019s a tricky green, but it\u2019s not a difficult hole.\n\n\u201cBut from the first hole in the day, you have to say: \u2018Wait a second. Am I going to lay up? Am I going to hit a 4- or 5-iron down there? Or am I going to take a whack at it?\u2019 \u201c\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "At BMW Championship, a chance to walk in Arnold Palmer\u2019s shoes", "title": "At BMW Championship, a chance to walk in Arnold Palmer\u2019s shoes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/01/at-bmw-championship-a-chance-to-walk-in-arnold-palmers-shoes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140901__20140902_B1_SP02GLFBMWp1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140901__20140902_B1_SP02GLFBMWp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-01T21:07:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:30:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd283d\"", "article_summary": "The Palmer Tee also was used during the 2005 U.S. Women\u2019s Open.\nBut Palmer, one of a few players in that era capable of driving such a distance, didn\u2019t stop going for the green.\nThe tournament will use the \u201cPalmer Tee\u201d for all four rounds, marking the first time since Palmer\u2019s memorable win that a PGA Tour event has used that tee box as a launching point.\n\u201cIt set the tone for that round,\u201d said John Ogden, the head golf professional at Cherry Hills, who recently spoke with Palmer at length about that tournament.\n\u201cHe knew to get himself off in the right frame of mind, he had to be aggressive.\u201dWhen the BMW Championship begins Thursday at Cherry Hills, the best golfers in the world will have an opportunity to follow Palmer\u2019s historic path."}
