When each woman showed up to look at the pictures, researchers took a saliva sample and measured it for testosterone, estradiol and progesterone.The selection of pictures intentionally included some babies with characteristics that make people perceive them as \u201ccute\u201d and some babies that lacked those characteristics.All women responded more positively to the cute babies than they did to the plain babies, but higher testosterone predicted greater differences in each woman\u2019s response. The higher the testosterone, the greater the percentage of each session a woman spent looking at cute babes.Changes each woman\u2019s testosterone levels from one week to the next, moreover, predicted changes in that woman\u2019s preference for cute babies at that particular viewing session.Differences in estradiol and progesterone levels \u2014 either among different women or within each woman over time \u2014 had no significant effects on viewing preferences.\u201cThis within-woman effect of testosterone was independent of the possible effects of estradiol and progesterone and was not simply a consequence of changes in women's cuteness perceptions,\u201d the study authors wrote in Hormones and Behavior.\u201cThese results suggest that testosterone may modulate differential responses to infant facial cuteness, potentially revealing a new route through which testosterone shapes selective allocation of parental resources.\u201dResearchers from Japan, meanwhile, recruited both men and women to study the effect testosterone levels had on their willingness to forego small but immediate rewards for larger benefits down the road.Using saliva samples to measure testosterone levels and surveys to measure how much each subject \u201cdiscounted\u201d the value of future rewards relative to immediate rewards, the study team found that higher levels of testosterone were associated with higher delay discounting in men but lower delay discounting in women.\u201cAlthough causal effects of testosterone cannot be certain in this correlational study, if testosterone directly influenced this behavior, observed sex differences in delay discounting may be evidence of a curvilinear effect of testosterone,\u201d wrote the authors of the new paper, which was also published in Hormones and Behavior.\u201cAlternatively, the findings may reflect inverse pattern of responsiveness to testosterone between male and female neural systems, or basic sex-difference in the neural mechanism underlying delay-discounting independent of testosterone itself.\u201dTestosterone in the saliva may even be able to predict culinary preferences, at least among men.Researchers from the University of Grenoble recruited 114 men and asked them whether they preferred spicy or mild food.
