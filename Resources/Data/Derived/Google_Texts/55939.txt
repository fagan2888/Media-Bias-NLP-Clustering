In her Feb. 5 Washington Forum column, “Why millennials feel the Bern,” Catherine Rampell gave us two good reasons for Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) popularity with millennials. Another obvious reason is the bloom of idealism without the experience of responsibility. As someone who was equally idealistic until reality took over, I still think that Mr. Sanders’s aspirations for society are honorable and attractive. But talk is cheap. And working toward such goals is very hard.

Free college education, free medical care, lower-priced prescription drugs, etc., are goals that every Democrat would support, but most Democrats also understand that bringing these dreams to reality isn’t just a matter of making promises. As a senator, Mr. Sanders bragged about the Affordable Care Act as a compromise that he helped create. I characterize it as a confusing hybrid and caving to the GOP. What makes millennials think that as president he would have more power to fashion a single-payer system? Mr. Sanders would serve millennials better by sticking with the Senate and helping get more Democrats elected, which wouldn’t happen with him heading the Democratic ticket.
