Iowa Democratic Party chair Andy McGuire is also a medical doctor. She said getting more Iowans insured means they can avoid the emergency room and, instead, get regular care.\n\n\u201cAs a doctor, you see nothing more important than preventive care,\u201d McGuire said. \u201c\u2026If we keep someone healthy, if we catch illness early before it becomes worse or more expensive, that\u2019s really what preventive care does.\u201d\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation has been tracking public opinion of \u201cObamaCare\u201d and polling earlier this month found 47 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of the law. Democrats argue the law hasn\u2019t grown more popular because Americans continue to see increases in their health insurance premiums. The Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s chair said since the law passed, premium costs have risen at the slowest rate in 50 years, plus 20 million uninsured Americans have obtained health insurance coverage.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Radio Iowa", "description": "Iowa Democrats staged a statehouse news conference today\u00a0to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act.
