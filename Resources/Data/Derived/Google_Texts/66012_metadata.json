You can check out the group\u2019s official insane statement for yourself, below, and leave any comments you deem such nonsense appropriate of in the comments section at the bottom of the page. Enjoy!\n\nTHIS IS YOUR TESLA MOTORS INTERVENTION: BORN IN BRIBES AND CORRUPTION, FORGED IN FIRES, AND MORE FIRES, AND STILL MORE FIRES AND SOME EXPLOSIONS, THE TOXIC TESLA CRIME-MOBILE THAT YOU ARE DRIVING IS FULL OF LIES AND CANCER CAUSING MATERIAL. WE WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT THE LOOK ON PEOPLE\u2019S FACES, WHEN YOU DRIVE BY, MAY NOT BE ENVY BUT, RATHER: DISGUST! BRIBED: 5 Senators, 8 Senior Agency Staff and 2 White House Staff. Why do \u201cYOU\u201d want to be a part of that? Let\u2019s examine the facts and details \u2026 \u2026 Some of the people involved have worked at Tesla and claim to have witnessed: \u201cOrganized crime on a first hand basis.\u201d Two members have subscriptions to the Axciom Privacy Abuse database. They thought: \u201chmmm, why not use something evil for good purposes by helping to inform, and save, hapless Tesla owners who got screwed during the information Green-wash!\u201d Members found out that major media outlet owners (Engadget, Google, AUTOBLOG GREEN, Gizmodo, Jalopnik, etc.) had stock in the Tesla and battery cartels and, thus, covered up the first investigation results. They want to clean the market more completely than an email \u201caccident\u201d on an IRS Hard Drive. Does that sound like a big project? It isn\u2019t! After nearly a decade and billions of dollars of your tax money, Tesla has only sold .5% of the cars that their competing electric, or gas cars have sold for the same investments in time and dollars. Nobody wants a Tesla except Tesla\u2019s investors and douche-bag surgeons who then crash them and kill people. So, relatively speaking, there are not that many people to hunt down.\n\nSource: Boycott Tesla, via Green Car Reports.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Gas 2", "description": "The a thing is, the more packs of wild-eyed nutters will try to ruin it.
