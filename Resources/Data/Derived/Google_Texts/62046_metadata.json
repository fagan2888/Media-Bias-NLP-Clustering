Will it contribute to the trend toward limited consumer choice of medical providers?\n\nA deal would substantially affect Georgia, if only because of the numbers of insurance consumers affected. The merger would double Aetna\u2019s enrollment in the state to roughly 1.4 million.\n\nState insurance regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice will review the transaction from a competition standpoint.\n\nThe Medical Association of Georgia, meanwhile, said Thursday that it has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about the merger and \u201cis evaluating every option to protect physicians and patients in the state.\u201d\n\nSuch consolidation has swept across the health care landscape, including insurers, hospitals and physicians. Part of this change has stemmed from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOther health insurers are also seeking to increase their size. Centene, the parent company of Peach State Health Plan in Georgia, announced a proposed purchase of Health Net. And Anthem, parent of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, has sought to snap up Cigna.\n\nIf the latter deal occurs, it would reduce the five large for-profit health insurers to three.\n\nAnd to further complicate the situation, UnitedHealthcare, one of the big five, is reportedly weighing a bid to acquire Aetna.\n\nAetna CEO Mark Bertolini has said the insurer is ready for government examination of its Humana acquisition, and said it has already discussed possible divestitures to satisfy regulators\u2019 concerns.\n\nBertolini said when the deal was announced that it \u201cwill allow us to continue to invest in excellent service for our members and strengthen our partnerships with providers to deliver high quality care at an affordable price.\u201d\n\nLOTS OF SCRUTINY AHEAD\n\nGeorgia insurance regulators plan to perform \u201can in-depth analysis of the proposed transaction\u2019s effect on competition in this state,\u2019\u2019 a spokeswoman said this week.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t received the filing yet,\u2019\u2019 said Laura Wright of the insurance department. After the review is done, the agency will hold a public hearing, she added.\n\nWright said Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens \u201cwill make his decision based on the internal review and the hearing.\u201d\n\nInsurers see several advantages to big mergers.\n\nThe ACA caps how much insurers can profit from the individual plans they offer. That forces them to try to cut administrative costs, which is something they can do by serving more people, the Washington Post noted.\n\nAnd as the insurers get bigger and gain more members, they will have more clout when negotiating prices with hospitals and other medical providers, and getting better deals on prescription drugs.\n\nBill Custer, a health insurance expert at Georgia State University, said recently that such insurer consolidation would significantly affect medical providers. As for consumer premiums, Custer added, \u201cit\u2019s too hard to tell\u201d what the effect of insurer consolidation would be.\n\nThose premiums are already rising \u201cbecause the price of health care is going up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe deal will have a major impact nationally on private Medicare plans known as Medicare Advantage, the Kaiser Family Foundation reported this week. Nearly 17 million Medicare beneficiaries, including more than 460,000 in Georgia, are enrolled in Advantage plans.\n\nIf combined, Aetna and Humana will have almost one-third of Medicare Advantage members in Georgia. That total would still trail UnitedHealthcare\u2019s 49 percent share in the state.\n\nHOSPITALS ARE SKEPTICAL\n\nThe almost frantic pace of consolidation in the health care business makes it hard to predict exactly the effects of such moves, experts say.\n\n\u201cThe health industry is undergoing rapid change, and we have seen consolidation on both the health system side and the insurer side in recent years as these two forces jockey for market power,\u201d said Cindy Zeldin of the consumer advocacy group Georgians for a Healthy Future. \u201cConsolidation means fewer choices for consumers, and history shows that it can also result in higher prices.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia Hospital Association sees potential trouble ahead with deals such as the one between Aetna and Humana.\n\n\u201cThese type mergers could result in a significant increase in market power for the insurance companies while placing health care providers and consumers at a distinct disadvantage at the negotiating table,\u2019\u2019 Earl Rogers, GHA president, said in a statement this week. \u201cIncreased premiums may lead to even more individuals without access to affordable health care, while reduced payments to providers ultimately affect their ability to develop new and innovative ways to deliver care and to provide the level of care and services patients have come to expect in America. The Department of Justice and the Georgia Insurance Commissioner should examine this proposed merger very carefully.\u201d\n\nDuke University law professor Barak Richman said the U.S. Justice Department will probably review such deals market-by-market with an eye on the long-term competitive dynamics, Modern Healthcare reported.\n\nDonald J. Palmisano Jr., executive director of the Medical Association of Georgia, told GHN on Thursday that an Aetna/Humana deal could end up increasing health insurance premiums and ratcheting down payments to doctors. The more health insurer competition, the lower the premiums, he added.\n\nHe said insurers already use their increased market power to limit consumers\u2019 choices of providers in so-called \u201cnarrow networks.\u201d\n\nPalmisano cited a study that found that many health insurance exchange plans have what could be defined as \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cextra small\u201d physician networks. The research defined a network as small if no more than 25 percent of physicians in an area are covered, and extra small if it covers less than 10 percent.\n\nThe health insurance industry has called these networks \u201chigh value.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe word we really should be focusing on is not \u2018narrow,\u2019 but \u2018affordable,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Graham Thompson, executive director of the Georgia Association of Health Plans, said recently.\n\n\u201cConsumers demand affordable options with access to doctors and hospitals with the best track record of delivering high-quality, cost-efficient care.\u201d\n\nState attorneys general may also look at the Aetna/Humana deal.\n\nA spokeswoman for Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens told GHN that \u201cthe Law Department monitors antitrust activity, but I can\u2019t comment on specifics.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, National News, Andy Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "ATLANTA | The biggest health insurance deal ever was announced earlier this month. \nAnd though it is yet to be reviewed by regulators, the proposed transaction has already prompted concerns about its potential impact in Georgia and elsewhere.", "title": "Big insurance deal raises questions, fears", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/local-news/2015-07-18/big-insurance-deal-raises-questions-fears", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/N1106P12006H.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0a6\"", "article_summary": "Central questions about the deal include:Will it lead to higher health insurance premiums?\nATLANTA | The biggest health insurance deal ever was announced earlier this month.\nState insurance regulators and the U.S. Department of Justice will review the transaction from a competition standpoint.\nWright said Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens \u201cwill make his decision based on the internal review and the hearing.\u201dInsurers see several advantages to big mergers.\nBill Custer, a health insurance expert at Georgia State University, said recently that such insurer consolidation would significantly affect medical providers."}
