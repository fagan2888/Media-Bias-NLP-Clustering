But not Anton Gunn. He\u2019s thinking about hospital bills, and how those bills get paid. Specifically health insurance bills. As Director of External Affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services his main job over the last two years has been to go around the country and talk about what the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare for most folks) has to offer. In particular Gunn has been taking the message of the new ACA law to the Hip-Hop community, because he knows that a rapper\u2019s or singer\u2019s career is only as good as their health.\n\n\u201cHip-Hop is what I am, healthcare is what I do\u201d says Gunn, who I spoke to from his offices in Washington D.C. \u201cI went to highschool in Hampton Roads, Virginia. I went to high-school with half of the Neptunes. I know Timbaland, and I went to middle school with Magoo.\u201d\n\nHis whole life he\u2019s been kicking it with DJs and beatmakers and he knows what the business is like inside and out. In October Anton Gunn spoke at the Future of Music Coalition Annual Conference and he has a particular message about the Affordable Care Act for Hip-Hop. \u201c\u2026Until you get that record contract health insurance is something that is not generally in your conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even if you DO get that contract you\u2019re a contract employee of the label and contract employees usually don\u2019t get provided benefits like health insurance and other things.\u201d His point is that across the board, whether you\u2019re an rapper, a DJ, a dancer, even an actor or producer, most people aren\u2019t getting healthcare out there but you need it if your mind and your body are going to perform at the top of their game.\n\n\u201cThere are many artists that are uninsured or have pre-existing conditions. We all know J Dilla that passed away had Lupus, Phife from a Tribe Called Quest has type 1 diabetes and has had that all his life,\u201d he says before running through a list of hip-hop stars with pre-existing conditions and chronic ilnnesses that make medical care crucial to their success. But what about those folks out there that are young and healthy. Why do they need to bother with signing up for healthcare?\n\n\u201cWe all know things happen every single day. You might be playing pick-up basketball game and break your arm, or break an ankle or break a leg that can cost you $7,500,\u201d he says. He also points out that you could be on tour, and you pass out, suffer from exhaustion, or even fall off the stage. A three day stay in the hospital can cost you $30,000 out of pocket if you don\u2019t have any coverage, on TOP of what you lose from missing tour dates. Most artists don\u2019t have $30,000 laying around to pay for a hospital stay when you\u2019re on tour only making $500.00 show still trying to get that record deal. In other words, if you\u2019re an up and coming artist on the road bringing in $500-$1,000 a show you can\u2019t afford to NOT have health insurance.\n\n\u201cEvery DJ I know that DJs off their laptop has insurance on their laptop\u2026..people have insurance on their smartphone in case something happens to protect that investment. Why don\u2019t you have insurance on your body? Your body is the most important instrument you have,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to understand why health insurance through the Affordable Care Act is helpful but cash rules everything when you\u2019re out there as a starving artist. How much does all of this new coverage cost most people?\n\n\u201cWe did a study at the department that says six in 10 could have a healthcare bill of less than $100.00 a month. That\u2019s cheaper than a cellphone bill,\u201d points out the director. And if you are that DJ out there, or singer on tour making little or no money there are government subsidies out there to make healthcare even cheaper or sometimes free.\n\nThe deadline to get coverage on January 1st 2014 is December 15th and then the second wave of sign \u2013ups ends on March 31st of 2014. So there\u2019s plenty of time. But let\u2019s say you are signed up to get healthcare starting on January 1st of 2014, what is the minimum you would get with your coverage? \u201cYou get 10 basic benefits from every healthcare plan now,\u201d says Gun excitedly. \u201cIt has to cover hospitalizations, outpatient coverage, maternity, substance abuse and mental health\u2026.and several other services that used to come extra with health coverage.\u201d\n\nThere are three basic ways to sign up under the Affordable Care Act, the first is to just go to www.healthcare.gov and sign up for a plan. If you\u2019re travelling on tour or don\u2019t have time to go online you can call 1-800-318-2596, 24 hours a day 7 days a week and they\u2019ll walk you through the whole process and sign you up. Finally if you want to sit down with someone in your local area and get walked through the process, plenty of organizations, like Churches, La Raza and the Urban League are willing to help and it\u2019s all free, check out www.locahelp.healthcare.gov.\n\nGetting sick, having to take a couple days off tour or the road for a hospital stay without insurance is fine if you\u2019re bringing in Drake money or Lil Wayne money. But honestly why should anyone put themselves through that kind of trouble? \u201cI\u2019m passionate about this,\u201d says Gunn. \u201cBecause this is the community I come from. It\u2019s a new day, no matter who you are, where you live, you can\u2019t be discriminated against, you can get affordable healthcare.\u201d So if you\u2019re out there trying to make things happen, or know someone who is, sign up for the Affordable Care Act. There\u2019s no way you can make your dreams come true if suddenly you\u2019re too sick to get out of the bed.\n\nWritten By Dr. Jason Johnson, Politics Editor, The Source Magazine\n\nReprinted with permission", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every time an R&B diva has to stop her concert tour for exhaustion, every time Lil Wayne suffered seizures from drinking sizzurp, all most fans thought about was missing out on the show or waiting for a tweet to see what happened.
