As I wrote back on the day of its announcement, the discovery was thought to be \u201cevidence to support [Einstein\u2019s] last untested prediction about the Theory of General Relativity.\u201d The existence of gravitational waves was viewed as proof of a period of inflation after the birth of our universe.\n\nWhen it was announced, on March 17, the discovery had yet to be confirmed. Since then, other researchers have been skeptical that gravitational waves were viewed by the team and BICEP2 telescope in the South Pole. It may have all just been dust in the Milky Way.\n\nNow the researchers themselves are hedging the discovery. Nature writes:\n\n\u201cIn a paper published on 19 June in Physical Review Letters1, the BICEP2 collaboration, named after the South Pole telescope they used to look at a patch of the microwave sky, acknowledges that the foreground effect of dust in the Milky Way may account for a larger fraction than previously estimated \u2014 and possibly all \u2014 of what had appeared to be a signal from the dawn of time. \u201cIn addition, presentations given earlier this week at a cosmology conference in Moscow, based on observations from the European Space Agency\u2019s Planck satellite add fresh evidence that what BICEP2 could be entirely due to a confounding effect of dust.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves could amount to dust -- dust grains from the Galaxy, that is", "title": "Bad news for Einstein: Major scientific discovery walked back", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves could amount to dust -- dust grains from the Galaxy, that is", "title": "Bad news for Einstein: Major scientific discovery walked back", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/23/bad_news_for_einstein_major_scientific_discovery_walked_back/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/alberteinstein.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The breakthrough discovery of gravitational waves could amount to dust -- dust grains from the Galaxy, that is", "title": "Bad news for Einstein: Major scientific discovery walked back", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/alberteinstein.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Albert Einstein, big bang, Discovery, gravitational waves, Science, Space", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ed5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Albert Einstein, big bang, Discovery, gravitational waves, Science, Space, Innovation NewsIn March of this year the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced a breakthrough discovery, (the yet unconfirmed) existence of gravitational waves.\nSince then, other researchers have been skeptical that gravitational waves were viewed by the team and BICEP2 telescope in the South Pole.\nWhen it was announced, on March 17, the discovery had yet to be confirmed.\nNow the researchers themselves are hedging the discovery.\nIt may have all just been dust in the Milky Way."}
