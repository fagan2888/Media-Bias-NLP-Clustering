Panama City Beach, FL---All weekend long, Frank Brown Park's been the home of Grand Slam Baseball's Memorial Day Beach Blast, the perfect event to kick off the unofficial summer sports season.

Youth baseball teams traveling as far as Tennessee and as close as right here in Bay County wanting to be apart of Grand Slam, an organization based out of the beach celebrating a successful decade of growing the game.

In fact, many of our local high school players fine tuned their skills playing at the youth travel level, thanks to the opportunity this league gave them early on.

"In the 10 years we've been doing this, we've seen local baseball here in Bay County increase tremendously," said Grand Slam's owner Larry Thompson. "Not only the talent level, but just the fact that your high schools are doing so well. And I think a lot of it is attributed to the fact that kids are playing travel ball at an earlier age, but it's really been neat to watch some of these kids grow when they start playing with us at eight, nine, ten years old, now playing High School ball. It's really gratifying to see that."
