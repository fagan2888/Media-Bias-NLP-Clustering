The community has really, really embraced us,\" he said.\n\nAnd then came Wednesday's court order to stop selling, after a patent infringement case was filed by telecom equipment maker Ericsson. The ban will last until at least Feb. 5, when the Delhi court hears the case again.\n\nBut that is unlikely to be the end of the young company's battle over intellectual property (IP) rights.\n\nSources close to Xiaomi say its leadership has privately acknowledged for years its vulnerability to patent entanglements. The higher risks of IP litigation in Western markets even played a role in shaping Xiaomi's strategy of expanding in India and Southeast Asia, the sources said.\n\nXiaomi said in a statement that \"it isn't easy\" to build up a patent portfolio as a start-up company, but it aims to have filed 8,000 applications by 2016.\n\nOn its home turf, Xiaomi has already been dogged by IP controversies with other Chinese firms, mostly over content rights for its streaming TV service.\n\nAs its smartphone business, already number one in China, continues to grow, however, industry analysts expect greater pressure at home, particularly since two of its fiercest handset rivals, Huawei and ZTE Corp, are among the top telecom patent holders in China.\n\nGROWTH SETBACK\n\nUntil it is lifted, the ban in India will be particularly hard on growth prospects. In a country where just one in 10 people use smartphones, the potential is vast. The market grew 82 percent in the third quarter, while China expanded at a relatively modest 10.8 percent, according to research firm IDC.\n\nBarra posted a message on the company's website on Friday apologizing to fans.\n\n\"Rest assured that we're doing all we can to revert the situation,\" he wrote. \"Stay tuned for more information.\"\n\nIn China, Xiaomi already outsells Apple and Samsung Electronics in smartphones, and it became the world's third-largest vendor as of October, though it is little known outside Asia.\n\nUnlike Apple, which introduces a new iPhone just once a year, Xiaomi rolls out updated models frequently, usually in small batches that sell out in seconds. It sells only online, and with minimal advertising, relying on word of mouth to build anticipation for each new launch.\n\nIn India, Xiaomi initially imported 10,000 devices a week but soon had to ramp that up to 60,000 to 100,000 to meet demand, India business chief Manu Jain told Reuters before the sales ban. It has chartered flights four times to rush in fresh supplies.\n\nJain did not respond to a request for comment on the business impact after the order.\n\nRushabh Doshi, an analyst at technology research firm Canalys in Singapore, said the ban would \"leave a gap in the market, to be quickly filled by local or international vendors looking to increase market share\".\n\nThe court case will also make phone vendors wary about their current patent portfolio and require them to step up their spending on research and development, he added.\n\n(Additional reporting by Jeremy Wagstaff in
