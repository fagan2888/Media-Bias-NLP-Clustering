Surrounded by buildings lit with the French Tricolour, a crowd of about 200 people gathered in downtown Dallas in solidarity with France on Sunday night.

The gathering was organized by the Alliance Française de Dallas and was held outside the Omni Hotel two days after the terror attacks in Paris killed at least 129 people and wounded more than 350.

An organizer stood in the center and addressed the group in French, calling for unity in the face of tragedy and noting the motto of Paris — “Fluctuat nec mergitur,” which translates to “she is tossed by the waves but does not sink.”

After a moment of silence, dozens sang the French national anthem and a few shouted “Vive La France.”

The Omni, Bank of America Tower and Reunion Tower are glowing blue, white and red in support of France.

Jean-Marc Domergue, a 48-year-old Frenchman from the suburbs of Paris, said he was impressed by the international response from many non-French and appreciated what “our friends from Texas and Dallas do for us.”

“I feel honored to be French and that Texas, Dallas, or any other place all over the world [would] honor what happened,” he said.

Domergue’s family in France was not harmed in the attacks, but said his nephew was at a party at the Bataclan theater the week before Friday. Eight-nine people were killed at the Bataclan where the American band Eagles of Death Metal was playing a sold-out show.

Domergue, who has lived in Dallas for five years, said a solution needs to be found for what happened.

“It’s terrible, it’s like all the attempts that are taking place against innocents,” he said. “It’s not resolving an issue to kill innocents.”
