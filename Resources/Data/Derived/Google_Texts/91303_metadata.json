In the wake of Elliot Rodger\u2019s six murders\u2013three with a knife and three with a gun, plus injuries inflicted with an automobile\u2013they are calling, once again, for gun confiscation. I guess they are, anyway. As usual, they denounce conservatives and say things like \u201cend the madness,\u201d but confiscation seems to be the point of it all.\n\nOnce again, though, liberals are denied the holy grail of mass murderers\u2013a conservative perpetrator, preferably a follower of the Tea Party. Rodger, like most of the others, was a devoted liberal. He followed the Young Turks on YouTube, a far-left group led by a goof named Cenk Uygur who once was an MSNBC host. So, foiled once again, liberals can make only their broader propaganda points.\n\nMichael Moore deserves to be singled out for special condemnation. On Facebook, he purported to respond to requests for comment:\n\nWe are a people easily manipulated by fear which causes us to arm ourselves with a quarter BILLION guns in our homes that are often easily accessible to young people, burglars, the mentally ill and anyone who momentarily snaps.\n\nSo was Rodger was manipulated by a fear of conservative ascendancy propagated by the Young Turks? Apparently so.\n\nWhile other countries have more violent pasts (Germany, Japan), more guns per capita in their homes (Canada [mostly hunting guns]), and the kids in most other countries watch the same violent movies and play the same violent video games that our kids play, no one even comes close to killing as many of its own citizens on a daily basis as we do \u2014 and yet we don\u2019t seem to want to ask ourselves this simple question: \u201cWhy us? What is it about US?\u201d\n\nHeh. Moore hasn\u2019t checked the numbers. There are many places with murder rates higher than ours. Pretty much all of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, Russia, and others. Actually, the white murder rate in the U.S. is comparable to other Western countries.\n\nNearly all of our mass shootings are by angry or disturbed white males. None of them are committed by the majority gender, women. Hmmm, why is that?\n\nI think testosterone has something to do with it. But wait! Elliot Rodger\u2019s mother is Indonesian. Doesn\u2019t that count for something? Apparently not, when liberal memes are at stake.\n\nActually, mass shootings are pretty equally distributed among ethnic groups. The worst mass shooter in American history was an Asian-American, Seung-Hui Cho, and an African-American, John Muhammad, murdered at least ten people in the D.C. area. And, of course, the overall homicide rate among African-Americans is something like eight times the white rate.\n\nWhen the NRA says, \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people \u2014 people kill people,\u201d they\u2019ve got it half-right. Except I would amend it to this: \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people \u2014 Americans kill people.\u201d\n\nMurder occurs in every society, but at widely varying rates. Switzerland and Canada have high rates of gun ownership, but low homicide rates. White Americans own lots of guns but commit murders at a similarly low rate. While it is true that \u201cAmericans kill people,\u201d some categories of Americans kill a lot more people than others\u2013a fact which liberals understandably try to obscure.\n\nThis, however, has little to do with mass murders or serial killers. Mass murderers, while very rare, are found everywhere; to cite just one recent example, the train station attack in China in which 29 people were murdered. With knives. And one of the worst school massacres ever took place in Scotland.\n\nAs usual, the Left\u2019s effort to gain political advantage from a murderous rampage by one of its own goes nowhere.\n\nBeyond that, some might argue that Rodger was a prototypical liberal male, only carried to a pathological extreme. Consider the profile: socially awkward, convinced of his own brilliance but not notably successful in life, hungry for revenge against those who have done better despite their obvious inferiority, eager to gain power over others, but through political influence rather than firearms\u2013is this not a typical liberal on Twitter, or elsewhere on the internet? Or, for that matter, in the Obama administration? Isn\u2019t state power the legal path to the long-awaited revenge of the liberal nerds? This strikes me as a plausible suggestion.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "You have to hand it to the liberals: they never miss an opportunity to convert tragedy into political gain.
