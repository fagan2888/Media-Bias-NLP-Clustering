The writer, recording artist, producer, manager and Svengali had a five-decade-plus career in which he went from the novelty songwriter of \u201cAlley Oop\u201d to working with a range of successful artists including Van Halen, Cat Stevens, Kiss, Steppenwolf, Motley Crue, Frank Zappa, John Lennon, Warren Zevon, Gene Vincent, Helen Reddy, Alice Cooper and even Hanson. (Yes, that Hanson.)\n\nHis greatest creation is long thought to be the 1970s all-girl group The Runaways, including Joan Jett, Lita Ford and Cherie Currie.\n\nBut Kim Fowley was not without his detractors. Many viewed him as a hedonistic, abusive sociopath who trolled Hollywood\u2019s underbelly, satisfying his own carnal needs and desires with no regard for others. In the big-screen biopic \u201cThe Runaways,\u201d based on Miss Currie\u2019s book, Mr. Fowley, portrayed in the film by Michael Shannon, comes across as an appalling monster.\n\nBut love him or hate him, there was no denying Mr. Fowley\u2019s talents and abilities to create captivating music.\n\nI didn\u2019t meet Kim Fowley until 2013, when mutual friends suggested I interview him for a national magazine. They told me he had a terminal illness and wanted his story to be told in all its gory glory.\n\n\u201cThis is Kim Fowley. I\u2019m bored and dying,\u201d he told me over the phone. \u201cCome interview me. Don\u2019t wait. Cancer is eating me.\u201d\n\nMy photographer and I traveled to his dingy West Hollywood apartment. Mr. Fowley had advanced bladder cancer and was, by all accounts, on his deathbed. There in all his glory was a bedridden Kim Fowley, clothed only in a T-shirt and adult diaper with a colostomy bag in full view. After about 35 minutes of standard Q&A, I thanked Mr. Fowley for his time and planned to leave, but he was having none of it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving. Use that alleged high IQ of yours and ask me more questions. Do you realize this is your only chance? You can leave after 25 solid questions. Do it!\u201d he barked at me.\n\nI could have left easily, but he was charming and captivating. In the two hours that followed, he gave me the greatest interview I\u2019ve ever had. Raw, unabashed, unfiltered. Brilliant.\n\nI got updates from time to time on his deteriorating condition. Late last year, there was a burst of great news when he married longtime girlfriend Kara Wright. He had found true love at last \u2014 the one thing he never knew he wanted in his entire life.\n\nOn Thursday, I was among the 300 invited guests at Mr. Fowley\u2019s memorial, held at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles. The crowd, which looked like something out of Central Casting, comprised a mishmash of rock \u2018n\u2019 rollers, dozens of underweight, hat-wearing hipsters, former music business associates, aging rock scenesters and a slew of goth girls. All there to pay tribute to him.\n\nAmong the rabble and Sunset Strip refugees were some bona fide stars including Kim\u2019s greatest student, former Runaway Joan Jett, glam rock god Michael Des Barres, Mr. Des Barres\u2019 ex-wife Pamela \u2014 the so-called \u201cqueen of the groupies\u201d \u2014 and LA radio icon Rodney Bingenheimer.\n\nMissing were big-name rockers Kiss, Alice Cooper and the other members of The Runaways.\n\nMiss Jett was the first to speak about her mentor and friend, recounting their early days. \u201cKim and I shared a dream,\u201d she said, \u201ca sweaty rock \u2018n\u2019 roll dream.\u201d She told tales of raw talent and determination harnessed and focused by Mr. Fowley.\n\nMiss Jett ended by crediting Mr. Fowley for her solo career, saying, \u201cMy success was a vindication of not only me but Kim as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cKim made you feel like you were the most important person in the world,\u201d Mr. Des Barres said. \u201cAnd if you were willing to follow the specific discipline outlined by him, you would become a success. He was a starmaker.\u201d\n\nOf Mr. Fowley\u2019s career, Mr. Des Barres added, \u201cHis greatest production was not the music he made with Kiss or Alice Cooper. It wasn\u2019t The Runaways. Kim Fowley\u2019s greatest production was Kim Fowley. Kim Fowley died with love in his heart. I hope you are all able to do the same.\u201d\n\nA video of Mr. Fowley\u2019s impressive music career followed. Many were moved to tears. I even choked up a bit, which was odd based on the fact that I had known Kim for less than a few months total and met him just the one time. I wondered why I was attending the funeral of a man I met once and barely knew, but the answer is simple: Kim Fowley told me to be there.\n\nThe last time I spoke with him was just after our interview was published. He called me and said, in a dry, matter-of-fact tone, \u201cWell done. Just the right amount of venom.\u201d\n\nI thanked him and made some uncomfortable small talk until he cut me off. \u201cListen, when this is over, I want you to come to my funeral.\u201d When I asked why, he said, \u201cto report to all my enemies that the monster is dead. Let those who hated me know that they\u2019re finally rid of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about those who loved you?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe let out a long cough, followed by, \u201cI don\u2019t imagine there will be many people there who loved me. No one will care. No one will remember me.\u201d\n\nJust like that, our connection was gone. And now so is he.\n\nAs I walked from the packed chapel, joining the procession of people following the hearse carrying his casket to its final resting place \u2014 past the graves of Johnny Ramone and Cecil B. DeMille \u2014 I realized that, for the first time in his life, Kim Fowley would have to admit that he was wrong.\n\nSorry, Kim, you were appreciated. You will be remembered. You will be missed. And, Kim, whether you like it or not, you were loved.\n\nR.I.P., you twisted genius.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Kim Fowley succumbed after a long battle with cancer Jan. 15 at age 75, the world lost a true musical legend.
