No one tell Mark Wahlberg about “Star Wars.”

Promoting his role in the upcoming fourth “Transformers” film, the Oscar-nominated actor told an audience at Las Vegas’ CinemaCon that he “had to jump at the opportunity because I really feel like it is probably the most iconic franchise in movie history.”

Wahlberg has tried several times to get franchises going with mixed results; the rumored “Departed” sequel never came into being, and video game adaptation “Max Payne” disappointed. (There will be a “Ted” sequel, but that’s more about the stuffed bear than Wahlberg — and the “Ted” films are far from “iconic.”) He’s now stepping into a movie franchise defined by Shia LaBeouf and Josh Duhamel, though the degree to which they’re replaceable indicates that the franchise may not, exactly, be as “iconic” as, say, the James Bond, “Jurassic Park” or Indiana Jones franchises. But they sure made a lot of money!
