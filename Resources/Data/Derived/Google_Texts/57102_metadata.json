The Census Bureau reported this fall that 8.8 million fewer Americans were uninsured in 2014, the first year of ACA implementation, than in 2013, reducing the ranks of the uninsured to 10.4 percent, or around 33 million. (There are several other estimates on the number of uninsured, but none are as reliable or authoritative as Census data.)\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBut before ACA proponents break out the champagne, they should consider another statistic: The number of Americans on Medicaid programs increased by 10.8 million between October 2013 when open enrollment under the ACA began and December 2014, according to Medicaid.gov. (Over 70 million Americans \u2013 about one in five \u2013 are now enrolled in Medicaid, double the number enrolled in 2000.)\n\nGiven population changes and the churn of Medicaid enrollment, it is difficult to say exactly what proportion of the reduction in the uninsured can be attributed to Medicaid. (The Heritage Foundation estimates that virtually all of it can be.) What is clear is that Medicaid makes up the vast \u2013 if not overwhelming \u2013 proportion of the reduction.\n\nThe increase in Medicaid enrollment shouldn\u2019t be a major surprise. The ACA dramatically expanded Medicaid as one of its three pillars \u2013 the others being the employer mandate and the subsidized exchanges, whose problems I discussed in the first two parts of this series.\n\nNevertheless, enrollment in Medicaid has exceeded expectations. California expected 800,000 new enrollees, but ended up with 2.3 million. New Mexico exceeded estimates by 44 percent, Oregon by 73 percent, and Washington State by over 100 percent. Clearly this is the pillar carrying the lion\u2019s share of the law\u2019s load despite the fact that 22 states have not adopted Medicaid expansion.\n\nAnd while few disagree that the country has a moral responsibility to care for our less fortunate, shunting them into Medicaid, which has a long list of problems, is not exactly charity. Doctor reimbursement rates for Medicaid have been driven so low that fewer than half of U.S. doctors are even accepting new Medicaid patients. In fact, several studies have found that Medicaid recipients have no better health outcomes than those who go without health insurance at all.\n\nEven the staunchest defenders of Medicaid must admit that its outsized role wasn\u2019t the goal of the ACA, which as its name infers was supposed to make health care affordable for all Americans. If the country just wanted to expand the medical safety net \u2013 as these figures suggest is virtually all the ACA has done \u2013 that could have been accomplished in a far less expensive, distortionary, and disruptive fashion.\n\nIt\u2019s time to deregulate the ACA so that real job creators can come in and offer market-based insurance solutions that are desirable to a great swath of Americans who have been overlooked by the ACA, solutions that could even compete with Medicaid to offer more effective help to the less fortunate.\n\nAlfredo Ortiz is CEO and President of Job Creators Network", "article_metadata": {"description": "What is clear is that Medicaid makes up the vast \u2013 if not overwhelming \u2013 proportion of the reduction.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "What is clear is that Medicaid makes up the vast \u2013 if not overwhelming \u2013 proportion of the reduction.", "title": "We\u2019re Just Not That Into You Part 3: Medicaid Expansion - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 594, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Medicaid-Getty.jpg", "height": 396}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/15/were-just-not-that-into-you-part-3-medicaid-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What is clear is that Medicaid makes up the vast \u2013 if not overwhelming \u2013 proportion of the reduction.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Medicaid-Getty.jpg", "title": "We\u2019re Just Not That Into You Part 3: Medicaid Expansion - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Obamacare,Medicaid", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-11-15T11:46:56-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Given population changes and the churn of Medicaid enrollment, it is difficult to say exactly what proportion of the reduction in the uninsured can be attributed to Medicaid.\nDoctor reimbursement rates for Medicaid have been driven so low that fewer than half of U.S. doctors are even accepting new Medicaid patients.\nClearly this is the pillar carrying the lion\u2019s share of the law\u2019s load despite the fact that 22 states have not adopted Medicaid expansion.\n(Over 70 million Americans \u2013 about one in five \u2013 are now enrolled in Medicaid, double the number enrolled in 2000.)\nThe increase in Medicaid enrollment shouldn\u2019t be a major surprise."}
