Here are 10 women\u2019s rights success of 2015 in no particular order.\n\n1. The Supreme Court ruled that employers can\u2019t discriminate against pregnant workers.\n\nThis March, the Court put pregnancy under the same protected class that includes people with disabilities or injuries. Although the lawsuit that sparked the ruling can now be re-litigated, the decision pushes employers to accommodate pregnant workers or risk a lawsuit. Now that\u2019s something people on both sides of the abortion debate can agree on.\n\n2. Women can now serve in all branches of the military.\n\nTwo women became the first women ever to graduate from the prestigious Army Ranger School this year. Earlier this month U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that women are now allowed to participate in the 220,000 roles they were previously banned from, like special operations and infantry. While backlash has been disheartening\u2014a study shows that at least 70 percent of special ops member are against the integration\u2014it\u2019s nice to see the military move forward in letting women get ahead on their own merits.\n\n3. California became the first state to put out guidelines for handling sexual assault on campus.\n\nAs the spotlight continues on campus sexual assault, California issued the first guidelines in the country detailing how colleges can handle the violence better. May\u2019s landmark rules include focusing on victims needs and coordinating with groups off-campus, priorities that have often been overlooked in the past.\n\n4. A woman finally took the helm at Sandia National Laboratories.\n\nThis summer, Jill M. Hruby became the first-ever female president of the New Mexico lab, which is the largest national security lab in the U.S. The numbers of women in science, math, engineering and technology fields are still paltry, but small advances like Hruby\u2019s prove we\u2019re moving forward.\n\n5. The White House reinstated birth control access for working women with health insurance.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled that employers like Hobby Lobby don\u2019t have to cover contraceptives in their insurance programs, the White House guaranteed workers who worked for for-profit companies access to birth control. Experts estimate that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage has saved women more than $1.4 billion in costs.\n\n6. Oregon made getting birth control easier for women by letting pharmacies dispense contraceptives in a full-year supply.\n\nUsually, women can get birth control only in 30 or 90 day packs, Care2 notes. Gov. Kate Brown signed a measure this summer that removes that challenge, saying that it was a \u201csimple premise that I whole-heartedly believe in.\u201d\n\n7. The U.S. Treasury decided to put a woman on the $10 bill.\n\nFor the first time in more than a century, a woman is going to be the face on U.S. paper currency. The honoree is still yet to be determined, as the public swamped the Treasury with suggestions, but as Care2 notes, she\u2019ll probably share the honor with Alexander Hamilton.\n\n8. Nepal joined the countries that elected a woman for president.\n\nRight now, 29 of the world\u2019s 195 countries have a leader who\u2019s a woman. In the U.S., numbers of women are higher than ever before in Congress\u2014we can only move up from the current 20 percent, right? Also two women total are major candidates for president. Don\u2019t be upset by the slow progress; social change moves like molasses.\n\n9. The UK introduced a new rule to call attention to the gender pay gap.\n\nThe country now requires companies to publish what they pay men and women, including bonuses. The pay gap persists across the world, including in the U.S. where women get paid 77 cents to every man\u2019s dollar. This gap increases even further with age and racial disparities, so hat tip to the U.K. for not sweeping it under the rug.\n\n10. The first openly transgender woman of color ever takes her post at a job in the White House.\n\nDuring the year the country marveled at the coming-out of Caitlyn Jenner and saw advances for transgender populations, which are far-too-often marginalized. With transgender women of color suffering the most, President Obama\u2019s appointment of Raffi Freedman-Gurspan in the Presidential Personnel Office a few months ago is monumental.\n\nPhoto Credit: UN Women", "article_metadata": {"description": "With this year's fiascoes facing women's rights, like the push to defund Planned Parenthood, we need a few silver linings to sleep at night.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3163/3162243.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "women\\'s rights 2015,women in military,women\\'s rights milestones,birth control,women on $10 bill,female presidents,gender pay gap", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Here are 10 women\u2019s rights success of 2015 in no particular order.\nThe first openly transgender woman of color ever takes her post at a job in the White House.\nWith this year\u2019s fiascoes facing women\u2019s rights, like the push to defund Planned Parenthood, we need a few silver linings to sleep at night.\nOregon made getting birth control easier for women by letting pharmacies dispense contraceptives in a full-year supply.\nUsually, women can get birth control only in 30 or 90 day packs, Care2 notes."}
