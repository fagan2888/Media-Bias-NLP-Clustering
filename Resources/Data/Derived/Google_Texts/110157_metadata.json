That\u2019s the simple question at the heart of \u201cA Day With HIV,\u201d an annual campaign that encourages people to submit photos of themselves as a method of raising awareness about the virus. Tuesday marks the fifth annual installment of the photo campaign.\n\nDecades after Americans first became aware of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, some people still have misconceptions about how exactly the virus is spread, and may harbor stereotypes about the kinds of people who become infected. And although about 1.1 million people in U.S. are living with HIV, research has shown that the persistent stigma surrounding the disease can dissuade them from seeking medical treatment.\n\nSo, in order to tackle those larger cultural issues, Positively Aware magazine \u2014 an HIV treatment journal \u2014 started encouraging people around the country to submit photos and short descriptions of their life with the disease. HIV-negative allies are also invited to join the campaign in solidarity. \u201cTake your best shot against stigma,\u201d the campaign website\u2019s encourages.\n\nLast September, hundreds of entries poured in. \u201cI don\u2019t carry HIV around like a burden; instead, I use my HIV to empower myself to make healthier choices in all areas of my life,\u201d one participant wrote along with his photo submission last year. \u201cI embrace each day with optimism and hope. I don\u2019t even think about being HIV-positive, it doesn\u2019t define who I am,\u201d another submitted. \u201cA day with HIV can be a day filled with with love,\u201d a third participant wrote to accompany a photo of himself and his romantic partner.\n\n\u201cThese people are possibly facing terrible adversity, depending what they\u2019re up against \u2014 whether it\u2019s their health, or their job, or their family \u2014 but there\u2019s a real sense of hope that you see in all these pictures that really is so powerful,\u201d Jeff Berry, the editor of Positively Aware, told ThinkProgress.\n\nParticipants are also currently tweeting about their daily lives under the hashtag #ADayWithHIV.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 15 percent of HIV-positive Americans don\u2019t know they have the virus. That number rises dramatically among young Americans between 16 and 24 years old, 60 percent of whom are unaware of their status. Berry ultimately hopes \u201cA Day With HIV\u201d will encourage more people to get tested and connected with the medical resources they need.\n\nThis year\u2019s participants have until September 12th to add their photos to the website, and their entries have the potential to be seen by Americans all over the country. Some of them will be selected as cover photos for the Positively Aware magazine. Others will be used as part of a traveling art exhibition showcasing images of people with HIV. And the CDC plans to partner with \u201cA Day With HIV\u201d to work on an anti-stigma campaign on a larger scale.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of my status,\u201d Nancy Duncan, an HIV-positive peer educator for Planned Parenthood who has submitted her photo for the campaign several years in a row, told ThinkProgress in an interview. \u201cAnd I admire other people who are willing to put their face out there. People need to see there are many faces to HIV/AIDS, people from all walks of life.\u201d\n\nThe caption on the photo that Duncan submitted on Tuesday says she\u2019s \u201cthriving well on a journey with much gratitude, love and blessings.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"A Day With HIV\" puts a personal face on a stigmatized disease.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"A Day With HIV\" puts a personal face on a stigmatized disease.", "title": "Photo Campaign Documents A Day In The Life Of HIV-Positive People", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/09/3565168/day-with-hiv-photos/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/shutterstock_127473608.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"A Day With HIV\" puts a personal face on a stigmatized disease.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/shutterstock_127473608-321x214.jpg", "title": "Photo Campaign Documents A Day In The Life Of HIV-Positive People", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/shutterstock_127473608.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/shutterstock_127473608.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-09T15:15:39+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd289c\"", "article_summary": "Health Photo Campaign Documents A Day In The Life Of HIV-Positive People CREDIT: Shutterstock2013 submissions to the \u201cA Day With HIV\u201d campaign CREDIT: A Day With HIVWhat\u2019s a day in the life of an HIV-positive person like?\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 15 percent of HIV-positive Americans don\u2019t know they have the virus.\nAnd the CDC plans to partner with \u201cA Day With HIV\u201d to work on an anti-stigma campaign on a larger scale.\n\u201cA day with HIV can be a day filled with with love,\u201d a third participant wrote to accompany a photo of himself and his romantic partner.\nBerry ultimately hopes \u201cA Day With HIV\u201d will encourage more people to get tested and connected with the medical resources they need."}
