The parent companies of BlueCross BlueShield and Univera also reported operating losses for 2014.\n\nIndependent Health\u2019s revenues of $1.8 billion were largely unchanged between 2013 and 2014, rising just $2.2 million from the previous year. But the company\u2019s total expenses, or underwriting deductions, rose by 4.6 percent, or $84.8 million, to $1.9 billion. Medical and hospital spending accounted for $17.2 million of that increase.\n\nJohnson said the company\u2019s commercial business and Medicaid business did as well, or better, than projected. But the managed Medicare line of business was hurt by increased medical and prescription drug expenses and lower reimbursements from the federal government. Over the past two years, under the terms of the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans by 10 percent, according to the insurer.\n\nIndependent Health set aside $58 million to cover anticipated losses for its Medicaid and Medicare lines for 2015, a move that had a $21 million net impact on the company\u2019s finances for 2014.\n\n\u201cThe underwriting loss was really driven by our Medicare business,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThat $21 million impact is accounted for in the insurer\u2019s general administrative costs, which soared by nearly 30 percent, or $45.3 million, to $199 million last year. Johnson said another large portion of that increased spending, about $19 million, was the insurer\u2019s continued investment in new information technology.\n\nThe company also paid $26 million in new taxes and fees in 2014 as part of another provision of the Affordable Care Act. And fluctuating interest rates from 2013 and 2014 were the primary force behind a $17 million negative impact on Independent Health\u2019s pension fund, one year after the insurer reported a $33 million favorable pension impact.\n\nIn response, Independent Health took $69 million out of its reserve fund, which stood at $560 million at the end of 2013 and $491 million last year.\n\nIndependent Health last May announced it was forming a strategic alliance with Albany-based CDPHP. Little activity has taken place since then, but company spokesman Frank Sava said Wednesday the insurer remains committed to the partnership. CDPHP, for its part, on Wednesday reported a net loss of $37.2 million on $2.2 billion in revenue.\n\nIndependent Health\u2019s filing also detailed payments to its top executives, including five who earned $900,000 or more last year.\n\nThe company paid Dr. Michael Cropp, its president and CEO, $1.6 million in salary and other compensation in 2014. Other top earners included: John Rodgers, executive vice president and chief operating officer, $1.1 million; Johnson, the chief financial officer, $1.1 million; Dr. Thomas Foels, executive vice president and chief medical officer, $991,745; and Jill Syracuse, executive vice president and chief servicing officer, $915,957.\n\nemail: swatson@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Independent Health on Wednesday reported a $75.1 million operating loss for 2014, blaming the result on the cost of investment in information technology, an increase in its pension fund obligation, taxes and fees included in the federal Affordable Care Act and money set aside to cover projected shor...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "Independent Health on Wednesday reported a $75.1 million operating loss for 2014, blaming the result on the cost of investment in information technology, an increase in its pension fund obligation, taxes and fees included in the federal Affordable Care Act and money set aside to cover projected shor... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Independent Health reports $75 million operating loss for 2014  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/business/independent-health-reports-75-million-operating-loss-for-2014-20150401", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/images/BNSocialShareLG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa44\"", "article_summary": "Because of the way the company is incorporated, the two entities that make up Independent Health \u2013 Independent Health Association and Independent Health Benefits Corporation \u2013 file their previous year\u2019s financial statements at the end of March.\nIndependent Health is the region\u2019s second-largest health insurer, with 381,123 members as of Jan. 1, an increase of 23,926, or nearly 7 percent, in its membership from one year earlier.\nIn response, Independent Health took $69 million out of its reserve fund, which stood at $560 million at the end of 2013 and $491 million last year.\nIndependent Health last May announced it was forming a strategic alliance with Albany-based CDPHP.\nIndependent Health set aside $58 million to cover anticipated losses for its Medicaid and Medicare lines for 2015, a move that had a $21 million net impact on the company\u2019s finances for 2014."}
