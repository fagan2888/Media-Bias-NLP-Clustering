She has written a history of myth. She has written a history of God. Born in Britain, Armstrong studied English at Oxford, spent seven years as a Catholic nun, and then, after leaving the convent, took a brief detour toward hard-line atheism. During that period, she produced writing that, as she later described it, \u201ctended to the Dawkinsesque.\u201d\n\nSince then, Armstrong has emerged as one of the most popular \u2014 and prolific \u2014 writers on religion. Her works are densely researched, broadly imagined and imbued with a sympathetic curiosity. They deal with cosmic topics, but they\u2019re accessible enough that you might (just to give a personal example) spend 15 minutes discussing Armstrong books with a dental hygienist in the midst of a routine cleaning.\n\nIn her new book, \u201cFields of Blood,\u201d Armstrong lays out a history of religious violence, beginning in ancient Sumer and stretching into the 21st century. Most writers would \u2014 wisely \u2014 avoid that kind of breadth. Armstrong harnesses it to a larger thesis. She suggests that when people in the West dismiss violence as a backward byproduct of religion, they\u2019re being lazy and self-serving. Blaming religion, Armstrong argues, allows Westerners to ignore the essential role that violence has played in the formation of our own societies \u2014 and the essential role that our societies have played in seeding violence abroad.\n\nReached by phone in New York, Armstrong spoke with Salon about nationalism, Sept. 11 and the links between anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\n\nOver the course of your career, you\u2019ve developed something of a reputation as an apologist for religion. Is that a fair characterization? If so, why do you think faith needs defenders?\n\nI don\u2019t like the term \u201capologist.\u201d The word \u201capologia\u201d in Latin meant giving a rational explanation for something, not saying that you\u2019re sorry for something. I\u2019m not apologizing for religion in that derogatory sense.\n\nAfter I left my convent I thought, \u201cI\u2019ve had it with religion, completely had it,\u201d and I only fell into this by sheer accident after a series of career disasters. My encounters with other faith traditions showed me first how parochial my original understanding of religion had been, and secondly made me see my own faith in a different way. All the faith traditions have their own particular genius, but they also all have their own particular flaws or failings, because we are humans and we have a fabulous ability to foul things up.\n\nThe people who call me an apologist are often those who deride religion as I used to do, and I\u2019ve found that former part of my life to have been rather a limited one.\n\nYour new book is a history of religion and violence. You point out, though, that the concept of \u201creligion\u201d didn\u2019t even exist before the early modern period. What exactly are we talking about, then, when we talk about religion and violence before modern times?\n\nFirst of all, there is the whole business about religion before the modern period never having been considered a separate activity but infusing and cohering with all other activities, including state-building, politics and warfare. Religion was part of state-building, and a lot of the violence of our world is the violence of the state. Without this violence we wouldn\u2019t have civilization. Agrarian civilization depended upon a massive structural violence. In every single culture or pre-modern state, a small aristocracy expropriated the serfs and peasants and kept them at subsistence level.\n\nThis massive, iniquitous system is responsible for our finest achievements, and historians tell us that without this iniquitous system we probably wouldn\u2019t have progressed beyond subsistence level. Therefore, we are all implicated in this violence. No state, however peace-loving it claims to be, can afford to disband its army, so when people say religion has been the cause of all the major wars in history this is a massive oversimplification. Violence is at the heart of our lives, in some form or another.\n\nHow do ritual and religion become entangled with this violence?\n\nWell, because state-building was imbued with religious ideology. Every state ideology before the modern period was essentially religious. Trying to extract religion from political life would have been like trying to take the gin out of a cocktail. Things like road-building were regarded as a sort of sacred activity.\n\nPolitics was imbued with religious feeling. The prophets of Israel, for example, were deeply political people. They castigated their rulers for not looking after the poor; they cried out against the system of agrarian injustice. Jesus did the same, Mohammed and the Quran do the same. Sometimes, religion permeates the violence of the state, but it also offers the consistent critique of that structural and martial violence.\n\nIs it possible to disentangle that critiquing role from the role of supporting state structures?\n\nI think in the West we have peeled them apart. We\u2019ve separated religion and politics, and this was a great innovation. But so deeply embedded in our consciousness is the desire to give our lives some meaning and significance that no sooner did we do this than we infused the new nation-state with a sort of quasi-religious fervor. If you regard the sacred as something for which we are willing to give our lives, in some senses the nation has replaced God, because it\u2019s now not acceptable to die for religion, but it is admirable to die for your country.\n\nCertainly in the United States, your national feeling, whether people believe in God or not, has a great spiritual or transcendent relevance \u2014 \u201cGod bless America,\u201d for example; the hand on the heart, the whole ethos. We do the same in the U.K. with our royal weddings. Even in our royal weddings, the aristocracy are all in military uniform.\n\nAh, that\u2019s a great observation.\n\nIn your great parades, you know, when a president dies, there\u2019s the army there.\n\nThe religiously articulated state would persecute heretics. They were usually protesting against the social order rather than arguing about theology, and they were seen as a danger to the social order that had to be eliminated. That\u2019s been replaced. Now we persecute our ethnic minorities or fail to give them the same rights.\n\nI\u2019d like to go deeper into this comparison between nationalism and religion. Some people would say that the ultimate problem, here, is a strain of irrationality in our society. They would argue that we need to purge this irrationality wherever we see it, whether it appears in the form of religion or nationalism. How would you respond?\n\nI\u2019m glad you brought that up, because nationalism is hardly rational. But you know, we need mythology in our lives, because that\u2019s what we are. I agree, we should be as rational as we possibly can, especially when we\u2019re dealing with the fates of our own populations and the fates of other peoples. But we don\u2019t, ever. There are always the stories, the myths we tell ourselves, that enable us to inject some kind of ultimate significance, however hard we try to be rational.\n\nCommunism was said to be a more rational way to organize a society, and yet it was based on a complete myth that became psychotic. Similarly, the French revolutionaries were imbued with the spirit of the Enlightenment and erected the goddess of reason on the altar of Notre Dame. But in that same year they started the Reign of Terror, where they publicly beheaded 17,000 men, women and children.\n\nWe\u2019re haunted by terrible fears and paranoias. We\u2019re frightened beings. When people are afraid, fear takes over and brings out all kind of irrationality. So, yes, we\u2019re constantly striving to be rational, but we\u2019re not wholly rational beings. Purging isn\u2019t an answer, I think. When you say \u201cpurging,\u201d I have visions of some of the catastrophes of the 20th century in which we tried to purge people, and I don\u2019t like that kind of language.\n\nLet\u2019s try a different analogy: Perhaps our search for narrative and meaning is a bit like a fire. It can go out of control and burn people pretty badly. Seeing this destruction, some people say we should just put out the fire whenever we can. There are others who argue that the fire will always be there, that it has benefits, and that we need to work with it to the best of our abilities. And you\u2019re sort of in the latter camp, yes?\n\nI would say so \u2026 If we lack meaning, if we fail to find meaning in our lives, we could fall very easily into despair. One of the forensic psychiatrists who have interviewed about 500 people involved in the 9/11 atrocity, and those lone-wolves like the Boston Marathon people, has found that one of the principal causes for their turning to these actions was a sense of lack of meaning; a sense of meaningless and purposelessness and hopelessness in their lives. I think lack of meaning is a dangerous thing in society.\n\nThere\u2019s been a very strong void in modern culture, despite our magnificent achievements. We\u2019ve seen the nihilism of the suicide bomber, for example. A sense of going into a void.\n\nIn \u201cFields of Blood,\u201d you explore how the material needs of people can give rise to more abstract ideas. So, speaking about nihilism as something particular to the modern era: Are there political or social conditions that underlie this sense of meaninglessness?\n\nYes. The suicide bomber has been analyzed by Robert Pape of the University of Chicago, who has made a study of every single suicide bombing from 1980 to 2004. He has found that it\u2019s always a response to the invasion of the homeland by a militarily superior power. People feel their space is invaded, and they resort to this kind of action because they can\u2019t compete with the invaders. [Suicide bombing] was a ploy [first] used by the Tamil Tigers, who had no time for religion. Of the many Lebanese bombings [in the 1980s], only seven of them were committed by Muslims, three by Christians. The rest, some 17 or so, were committed by secularists and socialists coming in from Syria.\n\nI think a sense of hopelessness is particularly evident in the suicide bombings of Hamas, where these young people live in refugee camps in Gaza, with really very little hope or very little to look forward to. People who talk to survivors of these actions found that the desire to die a heroic death, to go out in a blaze of glory and at least have some meaning in their lives and be venerated and remembered after their death, was the driving factor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blaming religion for violence, says Karen Armstrong, allows us to dismiss the violence we've exported worldwide", "title": "Karen Armstrong on Sam Harris and Bill Maher: \u201cIt fills me with despair, because this is the sort of talk that led to the concentration camps\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Blaming religion for violence, says Karen Armstrong, allows us to dismiss the violence we've exported worldwide", "title": "Karen Armstrong on Sam Harris and Bill Maher: \u201cIt fills me with despair, because this is the sort of talk that led to the concentration camps\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/23/karen_armstrong_sam_harris_anti_islam_talk_fills_me_with_despair/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/harris_armstrong_maher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blaming religion for violence, says Karen Armstrong, allows us to dismiss the violence we've exported worldwide", "title": "Karen Armstrong on Sam Harris and Bill Maher: \u201cIt fills me with despair, because this is the sort of talk that led to the concentration camps\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/11/harris_armstrong_maher.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Schulson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Maher, Books, Editor's Picks, Fields of Blood, Islam, Islamophobia, Karen Armstrong, Religion, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Terrorism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d0e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Bill Maher, Books, Editor's Picks, Fields of Blood, Islam, Islamophobia, Karen Armstrong, Religion, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Terrorism, Life News, NewsKaren Armstrong has written histories of Buddhism and Islam.\nWhat exactly are we talking about, then, when we talk about religion and violence before modern times?\nReligion was part of state-building, and a lot of the violence of our world is the violence of the state.\nReached by phone in New York, Armstrong spoke with Salon about nationalism, Sept. 11 and the links between anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.\nSometimes, religion permeates the violence of the state, but it also offers the consistent critique of that structural and martial violence."}
