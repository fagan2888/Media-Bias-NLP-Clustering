Macek\n\nHere's a dose of reality for critics who suggest The Gazette is so conservative that it doesn't give a fair voice to liberals. I plugged the name John F. Macek into a search of our computer archives Friday, and it came up dozens of times. Many links were tied to letters critical of Republican Congressman Paul Ryan of Janesville. The most recent two computer items, however, were of Macek's death notice and obituary.\n\nFuneral services for Macek were Friday. Though I think we only met once, we exchanged emails dozens of times and spoke by phone from time to time. As his obituary explained, Macek worked 17 years with a mental health center in Michigan before becoming director of the University Health and Counseling Services at UW-Whitewater. He retired emeritus in 2007. He started six health care organizations, and his obituary says political analysis and writing were among his passions.\n\nI'm not surprised. He was always pushing the envelope with his letter writing and even requested column length space. He often would send the next letter before our 30-day requirement between letters had expired. He wrote nine letters in 2012; six in 2013.\n\nGazette reporter Jim Leute interviewed Macek for a Page 1 story in January 2012 about Macek's \u201cMy Life Preferences\u201d document. This advanced health care directive is designed to help doctors, patients and their families consider end-of-life decisions when the patient no longer can make those decisions for himself or herself.\n\nIn his letters to the editor, Macek could be biting. Still, facts he used to support his opinions seemed spot on. I did question a couple of facts he made in a letter a few months ago. He apologized and blamed the slip-ups on health problems he had been having.\n\nWhether I agreed with his criticisms and points made no difference. My job was to let those opinions run, and I did.\n\n\u201cI am disgusted, but not surprised, by Rep. Paul Ryan's budget,\u201d Macek wrote this May. \u201cGrowing up in privilege, Ryan is totally disconnected with the plight of the poor.\u201d Macek was speaking from experience, explaining that he saw the problem firsthand while volunteering the summer of 1963 in Chicago's Woodlawn area.\n\nIn January, Macek attacked critics of the Affordable Care Act and Ryan's budget reforms, which he argued would shut down Head Start, reduce food stamps and take away Medicare as we know it. \u201cRyan plays deficit hawk but approved Bush's cut in revenues while starting an unfunded war,\u201d Macek wrote.\n\nLast December, Macek wrote: \u201cDon't be deceived by Ryan's photogenic smile. He is a master strategist for the tea party, a Republican opinion leader planning ruthless strategies to protect the wealthy while hurting us. He thinks starving the cow will increase milk production. Any dairy farmer can assure you that's a good way of killing off the herd.\u201d\n\nIn November 2013, Macek urged readers to vote for Ryan opponent Rob Zerban when Macek criticized the congressman for having met with strategists the night of Barack Obama's first inauguration and plotting how to get rid of the new president. \u201cThat is not only un-American but a violation of the sacred trust voters placed in him.\u201d\n\nIn October 2013: \u201cThe Republican claim that the Affordable Care Act will bankrupt our nation is preposterous. Tea party leaders such as Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor demand budget cuts in critical areas needed to sustain a customer base. Without a stable customer base, our standard of living is doomed.\u201d\n\nIn November 2012: \u201cSome of the worst power mongers are Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, Eric Cantor, Paul Ryan and tea party ideologues, all hell bent on their interests and ideology.\u201d\n\nIn September 2012, Macek called Ryan a \u201cself-serving hypocrite.\u201d Macek also believed Ryan followed the atheist Ayn Rand more faithfully than his own Catholic religion. That July, Macek wrote: \u201cRyan's budget is based on Rand, not the Gospels. It favors the wealthy, cutting programs for the disadvantaged, and giving the so-called 'job creators' more tax cuts.\u201d\n\nRyan wasn't Macek's only target.\n\nIn May 2012, he wrote of Gov. Scott Walker: \u201cRecent videos of Walker interacting with wealthy contributors give grave reason to question where his loyalties lie.\u201d\n\nMacek criticized \u201ctough on crime\u201d politicians: \u201cWe have created a prison industrial complex in which for-profit prisons profit handsomely from quasi criminals such as undocumented workers,\u201d he wrote in April 2014.\n\nWe've filled prisons with people whose only job skill is dealing drugs, he wrote a month earlier: \u201cThe bulk of inmates are poor minorities who lack job skills and resort to crimes of desperation. The most efficient answer is training, not incarceration.\u201d\n\nMacek wanted more gun control and criticized the National Rifle Association. \u201cI'm sick of the NRA's ruse,\u201d he wrote in March 2013. \u201cWe need responsible gun use; documented training and proper licensing of both guns and gun users. Why should this killing machine be an exception?\u201d\n\nAnd in January 2013: \u201cI applaud President Obama for taking the initiative on regulating guns used for massacres. I decry the fraud perpetrated by the NRA and others claiming violation of Second Amendment rights. It's deliberate, almost psychotic, misrepresentation.\u201d\n\nYou might disagree with Macek's liberal politics, but it's hard to question the passion in his viewpoints.\n\nMy sympathies go out to his wife and family.
