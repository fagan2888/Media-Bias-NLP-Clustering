Wind Cave National Park, SD

Wind Cave National Park is seeking public comments on a proposal to raise fees for camping and cave tours next spring.



Superintendent Vidal Davila says the proposed camping fees would make the campground financially self-sufficient. He says the proposed new tour fees would be in line with what other Black Hills caves are charging.



Fees for the various cave tours would increase by $2 or $3 for adults. Camping fees would increase from the current $12 to $18 per site and from the current $20 to $40 for groups.



Comments can be made online at www.parkplanning.nps.gov . The park also is holding open houses Sept. 23 at the Outdoor Campus in Rapid City, Sept. 24 at the Hot Springs Library and Sept. 25 at the National Forest Supervisor's office in Custer.
