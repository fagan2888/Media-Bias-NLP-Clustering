Katz\u2019s idea is the result of a six-month effort to build support for expanding the publicly funded health insurance program, which has provoked fierce ideological and philosophical opposition among Republicans over its results and costs.\n\nKatz said the state has proven incapable of managing its Medicaid program, called MaineCare, the way it\u2019s now structured, \u201cregardless of which party is running it.\u201d He said his plan would enable the state to overhaul the program while taking advantage of federal funding for expansion through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKatz\u2019s plan was submitted in the form of an amendment to a managed care bill he submitted in the last legislative session and that lawmakers held over to the current session. The Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee will take up the proposal Wednesday.\n\nMaineCare expansion would extend health insurance to an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 adults who have no children and earn as much as 133 percent of the federal poverty level \u2013 just over $15,558 a year for an individual \u2013 while providing an economic boost to hospitals and health care providers. Katz said the sustainability of the program is on the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a broken system,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, expansion could offer a major economic boost. We are forgoing almost a million dollars a day (in federal funding) by not participating in the Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nUnder the managed care approach, the state would drop its fee-for-service structure, which now pays hospitals and health care providers for every visit and procedure. In its place would be a system that creates a limited network of doctors and hospitals for MaineCare patients. The cost of the treatments provided in the network would be set by a third-party managing company that would be paid a set fee by the state.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion would expire after three years if the Legislature didn\u2019t reauthorize it \u2013 after an independent review of its health impacts and costs. Coverage for those people also would end if the federal government reneged on its promise to fully fund expansion for three years, then gradually reduce its compensation to 90 percent of costs by 2020.\n\nKatz\u2019s proposal includes provisions to boost efforts to:\n\n\u2022 Root out Medicaid fraud among providers and consumers.\n\n\u2022 Make reforms that would help eliminate a waiting list for about 3,000 developmentally disabled people.\n\n\u2022 Study ways to move people off Medicaid through better employment opportunities.\n\nMOVING TOWARD BIPARTISAN PLAN\n\nThe amendment is Katz\u2019s second attempt to build bipartisan consensus for Medicaid expansion, a top priority for Democrats in Maine and in other states. It has been a leading issue for Eves, the House speaker, who took the symbolic step of allowing Katz\u2019s proposal to move ahead of his expansion bill.\n\n\u201cWe view the proposal as a step forward in months of debate over how to ensure more families can have access to a family doctor,\u201d said Eves. \u201cOur priority has always been focused on lifesaving health care for 70,000 Maine people. While we have been skeptical of managed care programs in the past, we look forward to hearing the details of the Republican proposal. We will want to make sure that the emphasis is on quality treatment, not simply denying care.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have the majority in the Legislature, but they don\u2019t have enough votes to override a veto by Gov. Paul LePage, a staunch opponent of expansion. A compromise proposed by Katz last year fell three votes short of overriding LePage\u2019s veto in the House.\n\nSince then, Katz and several other Republicans, including Sen. Thomas Saviello of Wilton, have been working with Republican lawmakers to forge a new proposal. Katz and Saviello said the amendment proposed Tuesday is the product of those discussions.\n\n\u201cThis didn\u2019t have to be so partisan,\u201d Katz said. \u201cThe proposal we have shows that.\u201d\n\nBut the bipartisan approach did little to dissuade critics of expansion. Adrienne Bennett, spokeswoman for LePage, said the bill is another example of how \u201cliberals are playing politics with the state\u2019s financial future.\u201d\n\nBennett questioned the authenticity of Democrats\u2019 support for the amendment, noting that interest groups aligned with the Democratic Party have often opposed managed care.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kenneth Fredette, R-Newport, said, \u201cObamacare\u2019s welfare expansion would be so devastating for Maine\u2019s economic future that we simply cannot support it or anything that\u2019s attached to it.\u201d\n\nMANAGED CARE MORE WIDESPREAD\n\nProponents of managed care say it improves the efficiency of Medicaid and saves money while installing benchmarks for health outcomes. Opponents worry that managed care can lead providers to deny care if they\u2019re close to the payment caps set by the state.\n\nDemocratic Gov. John Baldacci began laying the groundwork for managed care, but LePage abandoned the pursuit after succeeding Baldacci in 2011. Last year, Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew testified against Katz\u2019s managed care proposal. Mayhew said it would undercut Medicaid payment reforms that her department was pursuing.\n\nAt a legislative committee meeting last month, Stefanie Nadeau, director of MaineCare services for the DHHS, questioned whether the state would save the $40 million that Katz projected when he proposed managed care last year. Because of its rural nature and sparse population, Maine may not be as conducive for savings through managed care as other states, Nadeau said.\n\nNational data shows that managed care in Medicaid is becoming more common as states try to control spending on a program that accounted for 23.6 percent of total state expenditures in fiscal year 2011, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation reported that the percentage of Medicaid recipients enrolled in some form of managed care increased from 57 in 2002 to 66 in 2012. Managed care is used in at least 45 states, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Kaiser Foundation also found that savings through managed care produced mixed results, and that significant savings were largely dependent on how states crafted their plans. The key savings drivers, the report said, were reduced emergency room use and improved use of primary care physicians.\n\nMaine would have to apply for a waiver from the federal government to switch to managed care. Dr. David Howes, president of Martin\u2019s Point Health Care, said states\u2019 increased migration to managed care has made such requests more routine. Martin\u2019s Point participates in managed care programs through contracts with Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nKatz said the Medicaid expansion debate has been polarized, with Democrats favoring expansion as proposed through the Affordable Care Act and a core group of Republicans, including LePage, opposing it outright.\n\n\u201cSome of us think there\u2019s a third way,\u201d Katz said. \u201cIt will expand Medicaid but at the same time institute major management reforms.\u201d\n\nSteve Mistler can be contacted at 791-6345 or at:\n\ns[email protected] m\n\nTwitter: @stevemistler", "article_metadata": {"description": "A key Republican says his proposal is bipartisan, covers 60,000 more people, provides an economic boost, takes advantage of federal funding and includes cost controls through managed care.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "A key Republican says his proposal is bipartisan, covers 60,000 more people, provides an economic boost, takes advantage of federal funding and includes cost controls through managed care.", "title": "New MaineCare expansion plan seeks consensus in Augusta - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 710, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/20140226_950781.xml-Medicaid+Expansion.jpg", "height": 1000}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/02/25/maine_republican_leader_releases_medicaid_expansion_proposal_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A key Republican says his proposal is bipartisan, covers 60,000 more people, provides an economic boost, takes advantage of federal funding and includes cost controls through managed care.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/20140226_950781.xml-Medicaid+Expansion.jpg", "title": "New MaineCare expansion plan seeks consensus in Augusta - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "tag": "state", "published_time": "2014-02-25T10:44:11-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Dr. David Howes, president of Martin\u2019s Point Health Care, said states\u2019 increased migration to managed care has made such requests more routine.\nJohn Baldacci began laying the groundwork for managed care, but LePage abandoned the pursuit after succeeding Baldacci in 2011.\nMaine would have to apply for a waiver from the federal government to switch to managed care.\nMOVING TOWARD BIPARTISAN PLANThe amendment is Katz\u2019s second attempt to build bipartisan consensus for Medicaid expansion, a top priority for Democrats in Maine and in other states.\nThe Medicaid expansion would expire after three years if the Legislature didn\u2019t reauthorize it \u2013 after an independent review of its health impacts and costs."}
