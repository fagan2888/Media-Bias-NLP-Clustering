WOO-HOO! Congratulations to Jimmy and his wife on the birth of their baby daughter, last week! On tonight\u2019s show, Fallon\u2019s guests were Chris Rock (Top Five) and country singer Carrie Underwood, who was also the musical guest. Announcer Stave Higgins provided a lot of fun, as usual, and the Tonight Show house band, The Roots, were also great.\n\nJimmy Fallon began the Tonight Show by welcoming his guest. Then he began his nightly comedy monologue, joking about celebs, politicians, and other things in today\u2019s headlines. Some of the jokes follow, in a somewhat paraphrased form.\n\n\u201cI live with three females now. Or, as Obama puts it, \u2018Good luck now, funny man!\u2019 My wife and I couldn\u2019t be happier being parents for a second time while my dog, Gary, said \u2018Wait \u2014 am I adopted?\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama went to the hospital this last weekend because of a sore throat, but it turned out to be acid reflux. It was a little awkward when he was asked \u2018What insurance do you use?\u2019 and he said \u2018Blue Cro\u2013 ObamaCare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Tree Lighting ceremony, Santa gave President Obama a hug and didn\u2019t seem to want to let go,\u201d Fallon said, showing a clip of Santa hugging President Obama.\u201d\n\nTime magazine\u2019s Person of the Year list includes both Vladimir Putin and Taylor Swift. Putin said \u2018Take my name off of the list \u2014 you don\u2019t want to mess with that lady.'\u201d\n\nThe Roots played Jimmy Fallon to his desk, where he showed a photo of Francis Cole, the newest addition to his family, born last week. Winnie is the name of their first daughter. As he showed the photos on his smartphone, the audience ooohed and aaahed. Jimmy Fallon then announced some of the guests that will be on later in the week, and then he said that Chris Rock, who wrote, directed, and starred in Top Five, will be on. Also, about to release her first Greatest Hits album, Carrie Underwood will be Fallon\u2019s second guest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for 12 Days of Christmas Sweaters,\u201d Jimmy Fallon said. He will be giving one lucky studio audience member a sweater each day. Fallon called the number of somebody from the audience, #308, and then he ran up the aisle to meet the woman who won. She tried on the sweater right then and there. It even had built-in mittens! Then, the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon went to the first commercial break of the night.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome Chris Rock!\u201d Jimmy Fallon said, when the Tonight Show returned from the break.\n\nChris Rock said \u201cWhat\u2019s happening, man? You got two babies!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right; I joined the two daughters\u2019 club. You have two daughters too, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Chris said. \u201cFirst of all, two kids are easier than one. If oyu\u2019re one, you have to be the show. If you have two, you\u2019re just the usher. My daughter, Lola \u2014 she\u2019s amazing. If Lola came home and told me a guy hit her, I would shoot the guy. I would put DNA all over the bullet, so everyone would know I did it. Now, if Zora was hit by a guy, I\u2019d say \u2018What happened?\u2019 They\u2019re two different girls. You hear that Ray Rice got reinstated? I\u2019d put him and Solange in my Fantasy Elevator Team.\u201d\n\nChris talked with Fallon about almost having had a 12 inch rap record come out.\u201d keep doin\u2019 my demos,\u201d he said. Questlove is \u201cthe Executive Music Producer for Top Five,\u201d Rock said. Jimmy Fallon then said they would talk more about the movie when they came back, and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon went to another commercial break.\n\n\u201cTop Five is the movie!\u201d Fallon said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your Top Five rappers?\u201d Chris Rock asked him.\n\n\u201cThe Beastie Boys\u2026.Jay Z\u2026Run DMC\u2026Eminem\u2026Rappn\u2019 Duke\u2026maybe LL Cool J\u2026it changes all the time,\u201d Fallon said. The movie, Top five, is one of the funniest movies ever!\u201d\n\nChris Rock told Jimmy Fallon that he had a good time making other movies, but he wanted someone \u201cto give me the ball.\u201d He added \u201cNo one was calling,\u201d so he decided to make his own movie. Tons of great actors and comedians are in the movie.\n\n\u201cYou know why they agreed to be in your movie, right?\u201d Fallon asked.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m paying them?\u201d Rock suggested.\n\n\u201cNo, because they love you,\u201d Jimmy told him. Jerry Seinfeld, Whoopi Goldberg, Tracy Morgan and Cedric the Entertainer are just some of the funny people in the flick. Both Rock and Fallon talked about how funny Cedric the Entertainer was, and how he liked to party.\n\n\u201cBasically, the movie is about you\u2019re a funny comedian, but you\u2019re having a new movie coming out, you\u2019re starting a family, and the pressure is on to continue being funny,\u201d Jimmy Fallon said. Then, he showed a clip with Chris Rock and Tracy Morgan in it. \u201cHe\u2019s allergic to jobs,\u201d Rock said about Morgan\u2019s character. \u201cWhen he feels a job coming on, he takes a job Benadryl.\u201d\n\nAfter another commercial break, the Tonight Show came back and Jimmy Fallon introduced the second guest of the night, country singer Carrie Underwood, a six-time Grammy Award winner.\n\n\u201cCarrie Underwood, welcome back to the show!\u201d Fallon said, and asked her about the baby she has on the way.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of nieces and nephews who are happy, and my mother is happy about the baby,\u201d Carrie said.\u201dI feel I have to sing good all the time, even when I\u2019m driving, because the baby is listening.\u201d\n\nShe told Fallon about her husband \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really know the lyrics of any song, except maybe Whomp There It Is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow \u2014 look at this!\u201d Fallon said. \u201cGreatest Hits: Decade #1! Ten years ago you were on American Idol, little Carrie Underwood.\u201d Her Greatest Hits: Decade #1 album comes out tomorrow, Fallon said.\n\n\u201cI kept a journal while I was on the show, so it\u2019s all documented,\u201d she told Fallon. She will be singing Something in the Water tonight, after another break on the Tonight Show.\n\nAfter the commercial break, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon came back and Carrie Underwood sang Something in the Water. It has been nominated for Best Country Music Solo Grammy. She was terrific, as usual, and she is showing no signs that being pregnant is slowing her down at all. Her voice soared to the rafters of 30 Rock, and she KILLED this song! The audience erupted in applause as she finished singing.\n\nIt is great that The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon is back, after only being on a couple of nights last week. Congratulations, again, to Fallon and his wife and the birth of their second daughter. The show this Monday was very entertaining, with Jimmy Fallon\u2019s guests Chris Rock and Carrie Underwood starting the week off right.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nSources:\n\nNBC Universal Media Village\n\nChris Rock Official Site\n\nCarrie Underwood Official Site\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon is back!
