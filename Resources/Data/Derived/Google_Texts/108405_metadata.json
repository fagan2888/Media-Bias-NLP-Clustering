It\u2019s grooming, after all\u2014advanced grooming, maybe, as her violet, Hollywood extensions likely cost several hundred of dollars and took hours to apply to her hair. But the intimacy of the scene reveals Noni\u2019s familiarity with this particular chore; her experience is lived-in, and her task both absorbs her and leaves her free to ruminate, the same way she might feel in the shower or behind the wheel of a car. It\u2019s a moment for the character\u2019s awakening to her own internal faultlines, a moment where she has the opportunity to shed the most visible shroud of artifice from her in exchange for what her hair actually looks like.\n\nChanging a character\u2019s appearance is a visual motif directors have leaned on since the birth of the medium\u2014like this scene in Wes Anderson\u2019s \u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums,\u201d where Richie cuts his hair and shaves. It\u2019s the attention to appearance that inspired Norma Desmond to theatrically descend the staircase, telling Mr. DeMille that she was ready for her close-up. Yet in \u201cBeyond The Lights\u201d it\u2019s a storytelling device made anew, and that is because of Noni\u2019s hair. Noni is biracial, and her hair is distinctly African. The experience of her hair is new for a lot of audiences\u2014certainly new to me. And because her hair is a fundamental part of her, her hair is a fundamental part of the film, too. Noni\u2019s hair is a reflection of her inner life and an expression of her mission as a musician.\n\nThe first scene of the film depicts a young Noni being driven frantically to a salon by her white mother, so that something can be \u201cdone\u201d with her hair. \u201cBeyond The Lights\u201d is, on some level, an outsize version of the same journey\u2014an attempt to bridge the gap between the mainstream, white perception of beauty and the reality of Noni\u2019s day-to-day existence.\n\n2014 may not have ended up being the year of diversity that some of us hoped it would be, but if there is one particular way in which it introduced texture and variety to the pop cultural landscape, it\u2019s in the realm of hair. This year has seen attention drawn to natural hair on black women across television, from \u201cHow To Get Away With Murder\u201d to \u201cBlack-ish.\u201d It\u2019s brought attention to the economy behind artificial hair via jokes on \u201cSelfie\u201d and storylines on \u201cThe Comeback.\u201d It\u2019s seen the films \u201cBeyond The Lights\u201d and \u201cDear White People,\u201d both of which feature characters coming to terms with their ever-shifting racial identities through the canvas of their hair. After 2014, Noni\u2019s mother wouldn\u2019t have much of an excuse for not knowing what to do with her daughter\u2019s hair\u2014she would have had the chance to see its reality on-screen over and over again.\n\nWithout a doubt, the defining moment for natural hair this year was Viola Davis\u2019 character Annalise Keating taking off her wig in \u201cHow To Get Away With Murder.\u201d \u201cBeyond The Lights\u201d went for similar themes, but the film is going for quiet transformation. Davis is going for high drama\u2014in the style of all of Shonda Rhimes\u2019 shows, she\u2019s going for operatic heights of emotion. And in \u201cLet\u2019s Get To Scooping,\u201d she lands it: slowly stripping off not just her wig but her false eyelashes, her makeup, and the eyeliner that makes her look more \u201cpresentable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If there's one way 2014 introduced texture and variety to the cultural landscape, it's in the realm of hair", "title": "The year in hair: How afros, wigs, and extensions took over pop culture", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If there's one way 2014 introduced texture and variety to the cultural landscape, it's in the realm of hair", "title": "The year in hair: How afros, wigs, and extensions took over pop culture", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/28/the_year_in_hair_how_afros_wigs_and_extensions_took_over_pop_culture/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/2014_year_in_hair.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If there's one way 2014 introduced texture and variety to the cultural landscape, it's in the realm of hair", "title": "The year in hair: How afros, wigs, and extensions took over pop culture", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/2014_year_in_hair.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, annie, beyond the lights, dear white people, how to get away with murder, orange is the new black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2590\"", "article_summary": "Noni\u2019s hair is a reflection of her inner life and an expression of her mission as a musician.\nYet in \u201cBeyond The Lights\u201d it\u2019s a storytelling device made anew, and that is because of Noni\u2019s hair.\nIt\u2019s grooming, after all\u2014advanced grooming, maybe, as her violet, Hollywood extensions likely cost several hundred of dollars and took hours to apply to her hair.\nAnd because her hair is a fundamental part of her, her hair is a fundamental part of the film, too.\nDavis is going for high drama\u2014in the style of all of Shonda Rhimes\u2019 shows, she\u2019s going for operatic heights of emotion."}
