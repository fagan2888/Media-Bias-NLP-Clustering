He is considered one of the game\u2019s classiest players, which makes it hard not to root for him as a sentimental favorite. Joe Sakic and Patrick Roy will help try to get him that first Cup.\n\nThis is the story line for Jarome Iginla, almost identical to the one Ray Bourque had when he came to the Avs in 2000 from the Bruins. A year after his acquisition, Bourque was handed the Cup by Sakic after the final game of his career, the definition of the storybook ending.\n\nIf Iginla ever raises a Stanley Cup with the Avs, he probably would receive the handoff from team captain Gabe Landeskog \u2014 just as Sakic did for Bourque after Game 7 of the 2001 Finals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hope one day,\u201d Iginla said after signing a three-year, $16 million contract with the Avs last week.\n\nBut is it just a fantasy? Iginla wouldn\u2019t have chosen the Avs over several other suitors \u2014 including the Eastern Conference regular-season champion Bruins \u2014 if he thought it was.\n\n\u201cWith this group, I think the sky is the limit,\u201d Iginla said. \u201cWhen I think of some of the teams that have had success in the NHL in the last five or six years, I think of Chicago; they were a very young, very talented team that moved up very quickly, that had a very talented young core when they won.\n\n\u201cPittsburgh was pretty young when they won. Boston had a pretty young core when they won, too. I think Colorado has a lot of young guys, whether in their first year or third or fourth year or whatever, they\u2019ve been confident and been able to play their way and just keep getting better. I\u2019m excited to be able to come for three years and be part of that, and grow with the guys.\u201d\n\nThree years an important part of deal\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The Avs will remain seen by most pundits as outside shots to win the Cup this coming season, especially playing in the brutal Western Conference. They lost a key forward, Paul Stastny, to a division rival, St. Louis, and failed to sign any of the bigger-name defensemen on the open market. The replacements for Stastny and P.A. Parenteau were two players 36 or older \u2014 Iginla and Daniel Briere. The biggest addition to a defense that needed help was 34-year-old Brad Stuart.\n\nLet\u2019s also not be naive and say the Avs\u2019 contract offer, particularly the three-year term, had nothing to do with Iginla\u2019s choice of Colorado. Even Iginla admits that.\n\n\u201cIt was important, from one side, for my family and I to have that stability, to be able to buy a house and set some roots down again,\u201d Iginla said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to come and just have one shot at it, on a one-year deal.\u201d\n\nBut Iginla said he is sincere in his belief that the Avs offered the best hockey option among his suitors, that being able to check off the box of \u201cCup contender\u201d made him sign.\n\n\u201cNext year, the year after, I think they just keep getting better and better,\u201d said Iginla, who has scored 560 goals, including 30 or more in 12 of the past 13 seasons. \u201cI expect to be good for the guys. I won\u2019t be taking it easy. I expect to be contributing.\u201d\n\nCan Iginla, 37, still keep up in the faster-paced Western Conference?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to back to the West. As far as a different style of hockey, east to west, I don\u2019t know if I noticed that much of a difference. I would say the West seems to be a little bit more physical, but the (difference) wasn\u2019t as big as I thought,\u201d he said. \u201cAs far as being able to fit in, I believe I can. I felt better as the year went on in Boston. Not to be arrogant or anything, but I still believe I can be very good, and not be able to contribute offensively and be a good player.\u201d\n\nFrom Edmonton to archrival\n\nIginla, whose full name is Jarome Arthur-Leigh Adekunle Tig Junior Elvis Iginla, is the son of a Nigerian-born lawyer father, Elvis, and former music teacher mother, Susan. He grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, but spent the first 17 years of his career with the nearby rival Calgary Flames.\n\nHe is a part owner of the Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League, the junior team he played on, and is known as a tireless champion of charitable causes everywhere he plays. While in Calgary, he gave more than $700,000 to KidSport Calgary, a foundation that helps underprivileged children play sports.\n\nAmong the people Iginla has most looked up to in his career is Sakic, the Avs\u2019 executive vice president of hockey operations. They were linemates on the 2002 Team Canada Olympic club that won its first gold medal in 50 years, and while Iginla said he didn\u2019t name one of his three children Joe specifically because of Sakic, \u201cit didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\nSakic said he called Iginla when the June 25 period for talking to free agents started, and believes his signing best addresses areas of need up front in the wake of Stastny\u2019s departure.\n\n\u201cJarome was always tops on our list to replace (Stastny),\u201d Sakic said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big power forward on the right side who brings leadership. He\u2019s a proven winner. He might not be in his prime, but he\u2019s still got a lot. Our core guys are all young, and you want to surround them with great veteran leadership.\u201d\n\nAdrian Dater: adater@denverpost.com or twitter.com/adater", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbd4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s a hope one day,\u201d Iginla said after signing a three-year, $16 million contract with the Avs last week.\nAmong the people Iginla has most looked up to in his career is Sakic, the Avs\u2019 executive vice president of hockey operations.\nThis is the story line for Jarome Iginla, almost identical to the one Ray Bourque had when he came to the Avs in 2000 from the Bruins.\nIginla wouldn\u2019t have chosen the Avs over several other suitors \u2014 including the Eastern Conference regular-season champion Bruins \u2014 if he thought it was.\nA year after his acquisition, Bourque was handed the Cup by Sakic after the final game of his career, the definition of the storybook ending."}
