"Just like most of the products Americans buy are made in China, most of the economic problems the Chinese have are made in America," says investment guru and radio host Peter Schiff, CEO of Euro Pacific Capital. "The Chinese have decided to peg their currency to the dollar and so they have imported our monetary policy."

But as Schiff explained to Reason's Matt Welch, that may be changing. China's recent market woes may force China to change its monetary policy and Schiff believes the Chinese government is laying the groundwork to back its currency by gold.

"Quietly they have been increasing thier ownership of gold," says Schiff. "They want to untether their currency from the dollar but they don't want it to be backed by nothing."
