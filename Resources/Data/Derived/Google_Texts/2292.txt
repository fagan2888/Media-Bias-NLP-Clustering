A Denver City Council committee Tuesday approved the use of $8.6 million from a city development fund to buy property and build a community day center for the homeless.

The project includes construction of the Lawrence Street Community Center — with a dining room, showers and bathrooms — adjacent to the Denver Rescue Mission. An attached courtyard waiting area would allow homeless men who want overnight shelter to line up each afternoon in a safe area, outside public view.

The Land Use, Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the proposal 6-0.

Councilwoman Susan Shepherd abstained, saying she didn’t feel comfortable voting until she had a chance to hear from businesses and other opponents in the Ballpark neighborhood who attended the meeting. The committee did not allow public comment.

At one point, Ballpark developer and resident David Tagieff interrupted the discussion. He said the council should have the courage to hold off on the proposal and avert making the area “the permanent center for homeless people forever” in Denver.

He said later that the city instead should use the money to buy the mission’s building and move it out of the neighborhood.

In coming weeks, the full council will consider the proposal.

The Denver Rescue Mission is working to raise $2.3 million to reimburse the city after the center opens early next year. The city would put that money toward a 24-hour “rest and resource” center to be built elsewhere.
