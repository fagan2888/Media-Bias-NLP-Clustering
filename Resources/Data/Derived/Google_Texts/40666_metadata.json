The uneven, halting, tepid Obama \"recovery\" continues, via the Wall Street Journal:\n\n\n\nThe U.S. economy slowed sharply at the start of the year as businesses slashed investment, exports tumbled and consumers showed signs of caution, marking a return to the uneven growth that has been a hallmark of the nearly six-year economic expansion. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, expanded at a 0.2% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. The economy advanced at a 2.2% pace in the fourth quarter and 5% in the third. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected growth of 1% in the first three months of this year.\n\nThe first-quarter figures repeat a common pattern in recent years: one or two strong readings followed by a big slowdown. Before this year, first-quarter GDP growth had averaged 0.6% since 2010 and 2.9% for all other quarters. That has worked out to moderate overall expansion but no sustained breakout for the economy. ast year, economists pinned much of the blame for a bad first quarter\u2014GDP shrank 2.1%\u2014on unusually harsh weather. This year, multiple factors appear to be at work, including another bout of blizzards, disruptions at West Coast ports, the stronger dollar\u2019s effect on exports and the impact of cheaper oil. And while most economists expect another second-quarter rebound, some forecasts are muted. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s GDP release, for example, J.P. Morgan Chase was predicting only a 2.5% pace in the second quarter. Wednesday\u2019s report showed consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic output, decelerated to a 1.9% pace in the first quarter, down from 4.4% growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nNearly two in three Americans who bought subsidized health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges this year had to pay some of the federal dollars back, according to new data from H&R Block. That's because they presumably collected more federal aid than their income qualified them for. In that case, consumers must either pay some of it back or \u2014 in most cases \u2014 the IRS will subtract it from their tax refund. Policymakers have expressed concern that low-income people could struggle with paying back the subsidies \u2014 or suffer if their tax refunds are greatly reduced because of overpayments. The average amount consumers owed back to the government was $729, cutting their potential tax refunds by almost one-third, said the tax preparation company.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Weak..05/26/2016 3:55:50AM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Weak.", "title": "Guy Benson - Flatline: US Economy Misses Badly, Expands at 0.2 Percent Clip in Q1", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/04/29/flatline-us-economy-misses-expectations-expands-at-02-percent-clip-in-q1-n1992043", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/114/667223b1-5061-49d1-af5e-9339c748296d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Weak.", "title": "Guy Benson - Flatline: US Economy Misses Badly, Expands at 0.2 Percent Clip in Q1", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/04/29/flatline-us-economy-misses-expectations-expands-at-02-percent-clip-in-q1-n1992043", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/114/667223b1-5061-49d1-af5e-9339c748296d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Flatline: US Economy Misses Badly, Expands at 0.2 Percent Clip in Q1, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb08e\"", "article_summary": "Before this year, first-quarter GDP growth had averaged 0.6% since 2010 and 2.9% for all other quarters.\nAhead of Wednesday\u2019s GDP release, for example, J.P.
