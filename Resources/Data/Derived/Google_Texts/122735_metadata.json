Another is scheduled to open next week in West Fullerton.\n\nChain retailers \u2014 CVS, Walmart, Target and others \u2014 have operated clinics in their stores for years, but the Kaiser-Target partnership is a notable new chapter: Kaiser\u2019s size and previously insular reputation suggest a new, perhaps far-reaching change in health care delivery, relying heavily on telehealth technology. The partnership is new and small, but Kaiser officials hope the model will grow in the eight states and District of Columbia where Kaiser does business.\n\nThe clinics represent a couple of significant firsts for Kaiser, California\u2019s largest HMO with about 7.3 million members. The move marks Kaiser\u2019s first foray into retail settings and the first time its providers will routinely treat patients covered by other insurers.\n\nHealth care changes in California \u2014 especially involving the state\u2019s largest HMO \u2014 are often carefully watched by the rest of the country.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely new for us, however it fits in the larger context of a strategy we have called Care Anywhere,\u201d said Chris Stenzel, senior vice president of business development and innovation at Kaiser.\n\nRather than \u201cretailization,\u201d Stenzel suggested \u201cyou might think about it as the consumerization of health care. We\u2019re doing many things to make our care convenient and accessible.\u201d\n\nStenzel pointed to mobile health options, an \u201cincreasing array of telehealth visits in the home\u201d and a number of work site clinics. In some ways, Kaiser clinics at employers\u2019 sites is coming full circle for the insurer with roots in the Kaiser shipyards in the 1930s and \u201940s.\n\nKaiser\u2019s Target clinics will treat all comers \u2014 Kaiser and non-Kaiser members, as well as Medi-Cal and Medicare beneficiaries. Stenzel said Kaiser is negotiating reimbursement agreements with three other large insurers and more may follow. He declined to name the insurers.\n\nNurse Practitioners, Telehealth Key in Clinics\n\nThe clinics will be staffed with nurse practitioners and rely heavily on telehealth technology to connect to physicians and Kaiser\u2019s large clinical and technical infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe telehealth capacity at Kaiser is pretty impressive, so that will certainly add something to these Target clinics,\u201d said Dylan Roby, director of UCLA\u2019s Health Economics and Evaluation Research Program.\n\nInterpreter services, specialty consults and other needs could be coordinated fairly easily because of the infrastructure investment Kaiser has made in electronic health records, videoconferencing and secure e-mail systems, Roby said.\n\nNurse practitioners\u2019 role as primary care giver at Kaiser and other retail clinics may increase as more people gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cNurse practitioners have been very involved in primary care and urgent care for many years, and that may increase due to the pressure put on the health care workforce due to the aging of the population, increase in chronic illnesses, expansion of coverage and improved insurance benefits,\u201d Roby said.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard reports yet of specific providers being overburdened by the ACA, but the general trend is toward a workforce shortage due to population growth, aging, etc. Because NPs have a scope of practice that allows them to do substantial primary care duties and prescribe drugs, they are a popular option at many urgent care centers and community clinics,\u201d Roby said.\n\nMore Exposure for Both Businesses\n\nMedical clinics in Target stores are not new. The first opened a decade ago, offering vaccinations and flu shots. But Kaiser\u2019s participation takes them to a new level. The Kaiser clinics will offer pediatric primary care visits, ob-gyn services, management of chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and hypertension, and consultations with specialists.\n\nAlthough Kaiser officials said the new partnership is not primarily a marketing tool \u2014 \u201cThis is really not about selling the health plan,\u201d Stenzel said \u2014 the exposure won\u2019t hurt.\n\n\u201cBoth Kaiser Permanente and Target are well-known brands that could mutually benefit from the arrangement in terms of drawing in customers,\u201d Roby said. Shoppers will be exposed to Kaiser and Kaiser members will be drawn into Target stores.\n\n\u201cI think this is a bit different than other smaller retail clinic chains partnering with drug store chains, where the focus has been on convenience and developing a new brand,\u201d Roby said. \u201cTarget and Kaiser have pre-existing brands that have some customer overlap, but there is a lot to gain for both in my opinion.\u201d\n\nAs health insurers compete in the new ACA landscape, exposure to new customers is critical.\n\n\u201cStrategically, Kaiser has been trying to lower premiums relative to other carriers through Covered California and get more patients and this could also help them do that,\u201d Roby said.\n\n\u201cIf they feel patients from Blue Shield and Medicare will come in, use their services as an in-network provider and like what they see of the Kaiser model \u2014 integration, EHR, follow-up \u2014 they may be likely to sign up for Kaiser at the next open enrollment via Covered California, their employer, or in Medicare Advantage,\u201d Roby said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Three Kaiser clinics opened in Target stores last week in Southern California and a fourth will open next week, marking a significant change for California's largest HMO and a new chapter in the \"retailization\" of health care.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Three Kaiser clinics opened in Target stores last week in Southern California and a fourth will open next week, marking a significant change for California\u2019s largest HMO and a new chapter in \u2026", "title": "Kaiser-Target Partnership Another Step in \u2018Retailization\u2019 of Health Care", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/kaisertarget-partnership-another-step-in-retailization-of-health-care/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-11-24T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-24T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27f8\"", "article_summary": "Health care changes in California \u2014 especially involving the state\u2019s largest HMO \u2014 are often carefully watched by the rest of the country.\nRather than \u201cretailization,\u201d Stenzel suggested \u201cyou might think about it as the consumerization of health care.\nMarking a significant step in what might be called the \u201cretailization\u201d of health care delivery, Kaiser Permanente is partnering with Target to open medical clinics in stores in Southern California.\nThe Kaiser clinics will offer pediatric primary care visits, ob-gyn services, management of chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and hypertension, and consultations with specialists.\nNurse practitioners\u2019 role as primary care giver at Kaiser and other retail clinics may increase as more people gain coverage through the Affordable Care Act."}
