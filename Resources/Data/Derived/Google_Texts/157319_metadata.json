Many states are loosening restrictions on telemedicine, and requiring insurers to pay for it, citing doctor shortages and pressure to increase convenient access to medical care, partly because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTexas, however, is moving in the opposite direction. The Texas board already required doctors to establish a relationship with patients before giving a diagnosis or prescribing drugs.\n\nBut on Friday, it changed its rules to state that \u201cquestions and answers exchanged through email, electronic text, or chat or telephonic evaluation of or consultation with a patient\u201d are inadequate to establish a doctor-patient relationship. The move significantly tightens rules that already preclude video consultations except under a narrow set of circumstances.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Texas Medical Association and other groups representing doctors in the state strongly supported the new restrictions, citing concerns about patient safety. In a letter to the board, the association said it \u201csupports the use of telemedicine that can provide safe, high-quality, timely care,\u201d but that safeguards must be in place \u201cto protect patients and ensure telemedicine complements the efforts of local health care providers.\u201d\n\nBut Jason Gorevic, the chief executive of Teladoc, said in a statement that the new restrictions were \u201ca huge step backward for Texas,\u201d eliminating \u201ca safe, affordable and convenient health care option that many have depended on for more than a decade.\u201d\n\nThe new restrictions do not outright ban telemedicine, however. Doctors will still be able to treat patients by phone or video from another location under certain circumstances. For example, patients will have to be at a hospital or clinic, with a second health care provider there to \u201cassist.\u201d The new restrictions do not apply to mental health visits, most likely because of a continuing shortage of psychiatrists.\n\nTelemedicine companies either directly charge consumers a flat fee, typically around $40 per consultation, or contract with employers or insurers to provide the consultations as a covered benefit. But they emphasize that they cannot treat serious problems or medical emergencies, and that they are meant to complement, not replace, people\u2019s relationships with their doctors.\n\n\u201cThis is going to quickly emerge as one way to relieve the demand pressures that are being put on the system,\u201d said Ceci Connolly, managing director of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers Health Research Institute. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d\n\nTexas is among a handful of states that still require an in-person exam before a telemedicine consult can take place, according to the American Telemedicine Association, a trade group in Washington. Other states have vaguely worded policies that are not clear on whether an in-person visit is needed first.\n\nIn a recent interview, Mr. Gorevic said Teladoc\u2019s national network of 700 board-certified physicians receive special training in how to conduct telemedicine consultations and follow clinical guidelines that are \u201cspecific to telehealth.\u201d The company, which operates in every state except Arkansas and Idaho, has seen rapid growth in demand for its services, he said, with almost 300,000 consultations last year, double the number in 2013. It has more customers in Texas than in any other state.\n\nThe company says its doctors are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. When a customer requests a consultation by calling or going to the company\u2019s website, Mr. Gorevic said, a doctor licensed in the person\u2019s state responds within 10 minutes on average. Its doctors do not prescribe narcotics, other controlled substances, or what it refers to as \u201clifestyle drugs,\u201d such as Viagra.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTeladoc\u2019s conflict with the medical board started in 2011, when the board threatened to discipline the company\u2019s doctors for prescribing drugs to patients they had not seen in person. Teladoc sued, accusing the board of changing its rules without going through the proper process. Late last year, a state appeals court sided with Teladoc, which led the medical board to issue an emergency rule in January. Teladoc won a temporary injunction while the board went through its formal rule-making process over the last few months.\n\nThe new restrictions are to take effect in June. Before voting on them, Frank Denton, an investment executive from the Houston area who was the only board member to oppose them, said telemedicine was the \u201cleast desirable\u201d way to deliver health care but that \u201cthe public should have the right to use that option.\u201d\n\nBut another board member, Dr. George Willeford of Austin, expressed the opinion of the majority when he said he worried that telemedicine, unless properly regulated, could weaken doctor accountability to patients. \u201cI\u2019m terribly, terribly worried about the absence of responsibility and accountability,\u201d he said.\n\nThat view was echoed at a public hearing on Thursday by Dr. Steven Yount, a family practice doctor in Bastrop, near Austin, who said that hands-on diagnosis and treatment was essential.\n\n\u201cA patient encounter that from the very get-go removes many of the abilities of a physician to comprehensively look at any given patient is of a lower quality,\u201d Dr. Yount said.\n\nBut most of about a dozen people who spoke at the hearing, including several Teladoc officials, opposed the change. Bill Hammond, chief executive of the Texas Association of Business, said the restrictions would \u201cdrive a stake through the heart\u201d of telemedicine in Texas at a time when thousands of small businesses are looking for innovative solutions to combat rising insurance costs and to provide health care to employees.\n\n\u201cThis proposal is bad for business, bad for health care, bad for consumers,\u201d Mr. Hammond said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150410202556, "twitter": {"description": "The latest salvo in a four-year battle with Teladoc, a national company that provides telephone or video consultations with doctors.", "title": "Texas Medical Panel Votes to Limit Telemedicine Practices in State", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/texas-medical-panel-votes-to-limit-telemedicine-practices-in-state.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003622959"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "abbygoodnough", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/texas-medical-panel-votes-to-limit-telemedicine-practices-in-state.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003622959", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/texas-medical-panel-votes-to-limit-telemedicine-practices-in-state.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Texas Medical Panel Votes to Limit Telemedicine Practices in State", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 10, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Texas Medical Board", "keywords": "Telemedicine,Texas,Teladoc Inc,Medicine and Health,Doctors,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Texas Medical Board,Regulation and Deregulation of Industry", "news_keywords": "Telemedicine,Texas,Doctor", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Abby Goodnough", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By ABBY GOODNOUGH", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The latest salvo in a four-year battle with Teladoc, a national company that provides telephone or video consultations with doctors.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The latest salvo in a four-year battle with Teladoc, a national company that provides telephone or video consultations with doctors.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "April 10, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/abby_goodnough/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-07-12", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Regulation and Deregulation of Industry", "published": "2015-04-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "geo": "Texas", "slug": "11telemedicine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150712081902, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/us/texas-medical-panel-votes-to-limit-telemedicine-practices-in-state.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The latest salvo in a four-year battle with Teladoc, a national company that provides telephone or video consultations with doctors.", "title": "Texas Medical Panel Votes to Limit Telemedicine Practices in State"}, "pdate": 20150410, "des": "Regulation and Deregulation of Industry", "articleid": 100000003622959, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Texas Medical Panel Votes to Limit Telemedicine Practices in State", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "The Texas board already required doctors to establish a relationship with patients before giving a diagnosis or prescribing drugs.\n\u201cThis proposal is bad for business, bad for health care, bad for consumers,\u201d Mr. Hammond said.\nLate last year, a state appeals court sided with Teladoc, which led the medical board to issue an emergency rule in January.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyThe Texas Medical Association and other groups representing doctors in the state strongly supported the new restrictions, citing concerns about patient safety.\nMany states are loosening restrictions on telemedicine, and requiring insurers to pay for it, citing doctor shortages and pressure to increase convenient access to medical care, partly because of the Affordable Care Act."}
