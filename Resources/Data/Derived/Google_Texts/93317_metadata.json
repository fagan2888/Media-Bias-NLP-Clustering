BurwelI, a challenge to the Affordable Care Act that threatens to cut out the heart of Obamacare and leave millions of newly insured low- and middle-income Americans uninsured. But unlike the last big challenge to the ACA in 2012, in which the court upheld the president\u2019s signature legislation, King v. BurwelI hasn\u2019t captured the public imagination.\n\nAnd that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s so technical. The issue in King boils down to whether the 34 states that declined to create state exchanges, and whose citizens are therefore enrolled in the federal exchange, will be unable to get the tax subsidies that are a central component of the ACA. On today\u2019s episode of Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick asks experts on both sides of the case to break it down into plain English, and explain why it matters so much. First, she speaks with Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University and one of the lawsuit\u2019s chief architects. Then she hears from Abbe Gluck, a professor at Yale Law School and a co-author of an amicus brief submitted in King v. Burwell.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Two perspectives on the Supreme Court case that could bring the Affordable Care Act to its knees.", "sailthru.tags": "Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick, Supreme Court, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Health Insurance", "sailthru.author": "Dahlia Lithwick", "description": "Listen to Episode 12 of Slate\u2019s Amicus: Subscribe in iTunes \u2219 RSS feed \u2219 Download \u2219 Play in another tab On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear King  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Listen to Episode 12 of Slate\u2019s Amicus: Subscribe in iTunes \u2219 RSS feed \u2219 Download \u2219 Play in another tab On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear King  ...", "title": "How to Understand the Most Important Case of the Supreme Court Term", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/amicus/2015/02/the_future_of_obamacare_depends_on_the_supreme_court_s_interpretation_of.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/etc/designs/slate/images/slate_facebook_icon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Listen to Episode 12 of Slate\u2019s Amicus: Subscribe in iTunes \u2219 RSS feed \u2219 Download \u2219 Play in another tab On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear King  ...", "creator": "@dahlialithwick", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/amicus/2015/02/the_future_of_obamacare_depends_on_the_supreme_court_s_interpretation_of.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/etc/designs/slate/images/slate_facebook_icon.png", "title": "How to Understand the Most Important Case of the Supreme Court Term", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-28T15:30:25Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "How to Understand the Most Important Case of the Supreme Court Term", "sailthru.headline": "The Letter of the Law", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"How to Understand the Most Important Case of the Supreme Court Term\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/amicus/2015/02/the_future_of_obamacare_depends_on_the_supreme_court_s_interpretation_of.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100150228005\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2015-02-28T15:30:25Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Podcasts\",\n  \"author\": \"Dahlia Lithwick\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"supreme court\",\n    \"law\",\n    \"podcasts\"\n  ]\n}", "fb-share": "How to Understand the Most Important Case of the Supreme Court Term", "tw-line": "Obamacare's future may depend on five words before the Supreme Court", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=805335340"}, "keywords": "Amicus, Dahlia Lithwick, Supreme Court, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Health Insurance", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "Listen to Episode 12 of Slate\u2019s Amicus: Subscribe in iTunes \u2219 RSS feed \u2219 Download \u2219 Play in another tab On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear King  ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/etc/designs/slate/images/slate_facebook_icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6d3\"", "article_summary": "First, she speaks with Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University and one of the lawsuit\u2019s chief architects.\nOn Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear King v.
