BOULDER — Heading into Thursday night’s Pac-12 showdown against No. 25 UCLA (13-3, 2-1 Pac-12) at the Coors Events Center, Colorado men’s basketball coach Tad Boyle could take comfort in knowing the No. 21 Buffaloes (14-3, 3-1) did not have to make wholesale changes to their system during the past several days.

Colorado learned early in the week that it will be without its top player, 6-foot-6 junior point guard Spencer Dinwiddie, with a season-ending ACL tear to his left knee, and that 6-7 freshman reserve swingman Tre’Shaun Fletcher is expected to be out at least six weeks, also with a knee injury that will require surgery.

“We don’t change anything in terms of our approach — attacking the basket, getting to the free-throw line, playing inside-out,” Boyle said.

“I think now, our margin for error (without Dinwiddie running the offense) is much less. What we have to concentrate on is having great possessions on offense. We can’t have empty possessions. We can’t take bad shots.

“That shouldn’t be any different (than when Dinwiddie was in the lineup),” Boyle added. “But with him being out, the offensive possessions become that much more valuable. We have to make sure we take care of the ball and get a great shot every time.”

Tipoff is 6 p.m. The Pac-12 Network has the telecast.
