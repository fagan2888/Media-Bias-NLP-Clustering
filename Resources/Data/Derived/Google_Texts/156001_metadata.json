A team of fire investigators worked through the night to find the source of the fire, but has yet to confirm the cause.\n\nVirginia Dyer\u2019s brother, Danny Pendleton, 78, was at the scene of the fire Sunday afternoon, along with several other family members and neighbors. He said he believed the fire resulted from an electrical problem, based on an earlier conversation he had with investigators.\n\nPendleton said a woman from Camden passing by the home shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday night spotted the fire from the road and called 911. Pendleton said the woman was able to free the couple\u2019s dogs from the house.\n\nFirefighters arrived soon after and were able to get the couple out of the building and performed CPR in an effort to resuscitate them, but were unsuccessful, according to McCausland.\n\nThe flames also destroyed a truck parked in the driveway.\n\nPendleton said he would like to find the passer-by from Camden to thank her. He also wished to thank first responders for their efforts to save his sister and brother-in-law.\n\nThe state Medical Examiner\u2019s Office will examine the Dyers\u2019 bodies on Monday to determine the cause of death. More information is expected to be released Monday.\n\nFollow Nick McCrea on Twitter at @nmccrea213.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LINCOLNVILLE, Maine \u2014 An elderly couple died late Saturday night after a fire engulfed their Lincolnville home, according to state public safety officials.
