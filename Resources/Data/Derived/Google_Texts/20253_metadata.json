Along with the nearly $1.5 billion sought on behalf of the class, lawyers of the plaintiff had asked for $6,800 for Larsen individually. Both actual and punitive damages were sought.\n\nThis has been the second time a St. Louis jury has heard the case. The jurors deliberated for four days after a month-long trial in October 2011. The trial reached a deadlock of 8-4 on the plaintiff\u2019s side, where nine votes are needed for a civil case verdict in Missouri.\n\nThe lawsuit which was first filed in 2000, claimed that cigarette packages promised lower tar and nicotine though were made from the same tobacco as regular cigarettes, and were in actuality more dangerous for consumers. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney claimed that smokers might compensate for less nicotine by inhaling longer and more deeply.\n\n\u201cThey knew it was wrong \u2026 they knew they were deceiving people,\u201d said Mark Bronson, one of the attorneys, during Thursday\u2019s closing arguments.\n\nWhat representations the class relied, deception through \u201creckless indifference to the rights of others,\u201d or \u201cevil motive,\u201d did not have to be determined by the jurors.\n\nPhillip Morris argued their cigarettes contained less tobacco than Marlboro Reds, with a longer filter and more ventilation. The cigarette maker\u2019s lawyers said inhalation had also been known and publicized by the public health community for years.\n\nAttorney for Phillip Morris, Beth Wilkinson, said the company took the label of \u201clower tar and nicotine\u201d off the packages in 2003, eventually stopping the term \u201clights\u201d as well. The suit did not include any personal injury claims.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, this case is only about money,\u201d Wilkinson said in closing arguments.\n\nDuring the rough time period covered in the suit, about 700 million packs of Marlboro Lights were sold in Missouri.\n\nSource: St. Louis jury sides with Philip Morris in class-action suit seeking $1.5 billion\n\nPhoto credit: www.bloomberg.com\n\nJoin the Discussion", "article_metadata": {"description": "St. Louis jury defends Phillip Morris in class-action suit seeking $1.5 billion from tobacco giant Phillip Morris.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Eric Needs", "og": {"site_name": "Legal Reader", "description": "St. Louis jury defends Phillip Morris in class-action suit seeking $1.5 billion from tobacco giant Phillip Morris.", "title": "St. Louis Jury Defends Phillip Morris in Class-Action Suit - Legal Reader", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.legalreader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/750x-1.jpg", "url": "http://www.legalreader.com/st-louis-jury-defends-phillip-morris-in-class-action-suit/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 1598871133679697}, "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thelegalreader", "section": "News & Politics", "published_time": "2016-04-10T09:33:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "St. Louis jury defends Phillip Morris in class-action suit seeking $1.5 billion from tobacco giant Phillip Morris.\nSource: St. Louis jury sides with Philip Morris in class-action suit seeking $1.5 billionPhoto credit: www.bloomberg.comJoin the Discussion\nMissouri smokers who bought and smoked Marlboro Lights from Feb. 14, 1995, through Dec. 31, 2003, would have been affected by the outcome.\nDuring the rough time period covered in the suit, about 700 million packs of Marlboro Lights were sold in Missouri.\nDeborah Larsen, the class representative, smoked about a pack and a half of Marlboro Lights a day between 1979 and when she quit in 2002."}
