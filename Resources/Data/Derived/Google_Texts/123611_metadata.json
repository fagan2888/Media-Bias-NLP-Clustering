Only a miracle can save the $1.2 billion Florida horse racing industry they represent. Not a single savior emerged Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe House Regulatory Affairs Committee quick-marched forward three bills in its revised gambling legislation, with only a handful of objections. In fact, not even one of the three lawmakers voting against the pari-mutuels bill (PCB RAC 16-02) did so because they want to preserve horse racing \u2014 an economic engine that breathes life into hundreds of thousands of rural Florida families.\n\nPCB RAC 16-02 would decouple greyhound, Harness and Quarter Horse racing, but would keep Thoroughbred racing at Gulfstream Park and Tampa Bay Downs \u2014 for how long, well, there are no guarantees, only incentives.\n\nThe new Seminole Compact? No problem. That was PCB RAC 16-01. It allows the Seminoles to add craps and roulette to their casinos in exchange for a minimum $3 billion paid to the state over seven years. And so it should. The Seminoles kept their end of the bargain throughout the term of their first compact.\n\nBut the other stuff is a mystery, I don\u2019t care how long House Regulatory Affairs Chairman Jose Felix Diaz, R-Miami, has been slaving over these bills.\n\nBesides the pari-mutuels gifthorse in 16-02, the third bill, PCB RAC 16-03, is another real cutie. It calls for a constitutional amendment to expand gambling in the future. Sounds citizen friendly, right? Wrong. It\u2019s cockeyed. Take the time to read this whole Obamacare-sized monster of a bill \u2014 and how many lawmakers actually will do that? You\u2019ll find that any little glitch they didn\u2019t think about in this gaming act can\u2019t be fixed by the Legislature next session or the session after that or the session after that. It can only be fixed by constitutional amendment.\n\nAny little change.\n\nSo there had better be no afterthoughts with this bill (which Diaz calls \u201ca work in progress\u201d) because this is all she wrote, folks. The Legislature decides who gets more gambling, who gets shut down, who gets rich, who loses the farm (literally), who gets a tax reduction, who doesn\u2019t count. And THEN the Legislature says, oh, sorry, we don\u2019t want to make these decisions anymore, Florida voters, you do it.\n\nOn Tuesday, a number of horse ranchers had driven hundreds of miles to Tallahassee to spend three minutes addressing bill sponsor Diaz. But Diaz never paid these people the courtesy of listening to them. He had to \u201cgo present a bill\u201d to another committee at the same time. Now, he could have shifted the meeting to place the speakers first so that wouldn\u2019t happen. But he didn\u2019t. Nor did he leave enough time for the other speakers who had traveled far and filled out cards to speak.\n\nThe only reference to these citizens, frankly, was shameful. It came as a condescending speech from Halsey Beshears, R-Monticelo, who admitted he didn\u2019t know much about the horse farming business, but then he apparently thought he knew enough about it to give them advice: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to find a new business.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll have to find a new business. Beshears\u2019 district also includes Apalachicola. I hope that isn\u2019t what he told the oyster fishermen.\n\nBottom line, that\u2019s all the attention horse ranchers got. The negative kind. It was insensitive, and as Joe Pennacchio, president of the Florida Standardbred Breeders and Owners Association, said after the meeting, \u201cJust plain wrong. What other business are they supposed to find?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that horse racing draws fewer spectators, Pennacchio said. Naturally people have more to do with their time today than they did in the 1950s. Racing itself is still making a lot of money for everybody. Owners want to race their horses in Florida.\n\nHas any legislator ever asked for a state audit of the horse racing industry? Is there a single elected official who understands what\u2019s happening here?\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Regulated Industries Committee, all set to vote on its version of the gambling legislation, postponed it until next week. That\u2019s because Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, filed a slew of amendments that pretty much shredded the Senate\u2019s original proposal.\n\nHorsemen hoping to fare better in the Senate\u2019s hands? They\u2019ve got about as much chance as the NRCC has of talking Donald Trump into dropping out.\n\nNegron\u2019s amendments basically would give slots to pari-mutuels in each of the six counties, Palm Beach included, where voters approved them, and wherever else voters agree to them down the road.\n\nOh, yes, he would decouple all dog and horse racing \u2014 jai alai, too. Pari-mutuels could keep operating cardrooms and slot machines (keep a close eye on who\u2019s donating to Negron these days).\n\nNegron thinks $45 million is just right to beef up thoroughbred purse pools. That\u2019s $20 million from the compact, $25 million from revenues from slots and card games at pari-mutuels that stop racing or jai alai.\n\nLike I said, horsemen, you\u2019re so screwed. Whatever the \u201cplan\u201d the Legislature goes with:\n\nDiaz is already convinced he has enough votes for a victory on the House floor. And Negron is the rising Senate president, who\u2019s going to get in his face?\n\nAnd even if everything blows up and there\u2019s no deal, horsemen, you still lose. Owners \u2014 recruited by states like Kentucky, Ohio and Maryland \u2014 already are pulling their horses out of Florida. In anticipation.\n\nWe all know what your trouble was.\n\nYou guys couldn\u2019t match the other guys\u2019 special interest money. No special interest money = you\u2019re a dead duck.\n\nTuesday was a sad day for a lot of us.\n\nNancy Smith is the editor of Sunshine State News.
