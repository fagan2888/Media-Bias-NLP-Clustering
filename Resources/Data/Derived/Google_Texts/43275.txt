A bipartisan group of senators is relaunching an effort to exempt volunteer firefighters and emergency responders from an ObamaCare rule requiring employers to offer insurance to full-time employees.

The bill, introduced by Sens. Mark Warner Mark WarnerLawmaker bemoans tax 'buzzsaw' for on-demand economy workers Reid throws wrench into Clinton vice presidential picks Reid: 'Hell no' to VP pick from state with a Republican governor MORE (D-Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), now has more than 20 co-sponsors.

The IRS, which enforces the mandate, has already said that it will not count volunteer fire departments or ambulances as employers under the ObamaCare mandate. But the senators warned that the government could “still reverse course” without an official change to the law.

“This sensible, bipartisan fix will ensure that the law permanently and properly distinguishes between full-time, paid emergency responders and volunteers so that emergency response agencies can continue focusing on keeping our communities safe,” Warner wrote in a statement.

Toomey added that the men and women volunteering "have enough on their plate without having to worry about whether excessive Washington red tape will close their station."

The employer mandate goes into effect for the first time this year after multiple — and controversial — delays. All employers with more than 50 employees are required to offer health insurance or pay a penalty that increases over time.
