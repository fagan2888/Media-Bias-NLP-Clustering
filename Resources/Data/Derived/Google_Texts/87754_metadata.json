Talks to sell Roshen's Russia-based Lipetsk factory were continuing, he said.\n\n(Writing by Matthias Williams; Additional reporting by Natalia Zinets; Editing by Alison Williams and Richard Balmforth)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko defended his commitment to trans", "title": "Ukraine's Poroshenko defends record after Panama leaks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Ukraines-Poroshenko-defends-record-after-Panama-leaks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/panama-tax-ukraine-poroshenko_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Ukraines-Poroshenko-defends-record-after-Panama-leaks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/panama-tax-ukraine-poroshenko_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko defended his commitment to trans", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The law firm tasked with managing the sale of Roshen said the offshore firm was set up in accordance with Ukrainian law.\nIn response, Poroshenko said he had handed over the management of his assets to consulting and law firms on taking office.\nA senior official in the General Prosecutor's office said the leaked documents did not show that Poroshenko had committed any crime.\nPoroshenko, who came to power after protests in 2014, has already faced criticism for not selling Roshen despite promising to do so.\nKIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko defended his commitment to transparency on Monday after lawmakers called for an investigation into allegations contained in the so-called Panama Papers that he had used an offshore firm to avoid tax."}
