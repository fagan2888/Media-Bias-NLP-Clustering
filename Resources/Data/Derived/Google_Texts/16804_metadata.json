Despite describing himself as a political liberal, he\u2019s long been harshly critical of Obama\u2019s use of executive power and said he\u2019d jumped at the chance to represent the House GOP in the lawsuit against unilateral changes to the Affordable Care Act in its implementation. (RELATED: Boehner\u2019s Obamacare Lawsuit Boosted By Liberal Law Professor)\n\nNow that Turley\u2019s working for the GOP, Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Robert Brady wants to ban him from speaking out any issue of executive authority \u2014 which Turley\u2019s based much of his career on \u2014 for years.\n\n\u201cGiven that Mr. Turley extensively participates in various media forums, including writing his own blog, would it not be better to prohibit Mr. Turley from making any media appearances in which he comments on the extent of the executive authority of the President in any context whatsoever during the pendency of this case?\u201d Brady wrote Monday to Rep. Candice Miller, chairman of the House Administration Committee.\n\n\u201cMoreover, since the limitation appears to be in force only for the life of the contract, would it not better protect the interests of the House if Mr. Turley was prohibited from making statements, granting interviews or otherwise conferring with any member of the media or media organization for a period of years following the conclusion of this case?\u201d\n\nAs part of his contract with the House of Representatives, Turley agreed not to speak to the media about the case itself. But Brady wants to extend that to pretty much anything critical of Obama\u2019s use of executive power \u2014 especially convenient given the uproar concerning the White House\u2019s announcement of executive amnesty just last week.\n\nTurley has condemned that proposal as well.\n\n\u201cNo president can take on the power of all three branches and that\u2019s what he seems to be doing,\u201d Turley said of the executive action before its announcement. Obama \u201ccertainly seems to be taking on legislative authority\u2026that does become a government of one.\u201d\n\nTurley filed the official complaint against the Obama administration in United States House of Representatives v. Burwell on Friday. The lawsuit is targeting the administration\u2019s unilateral decision to waive the employer mandate and penalties for not complying with it despite effective dates written into the Affordable Care Act and as well as its transfer of funds to insurance companies without an appropriation from Congress.\n\nRep. Brady also questioned whether Turley would \u201cexploit\u201d his law students by asking for their assistance in the case and asked that Turley\u2019s contract be modified to \u201cforbid discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\u201d\n\nGiven that two Washington-based law firms had backed out of representing the House after signing initial contracts, conservative watchdog Judicial Watch is already questioning whether Democrats had pressured the firms into dropping the case. Brady\u2019s request to ban Turley from speaking on any issue \u2014 for years after the lawsuit is concluded, no less \u2014 is unlikely to ease any appearance of political pressure.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Silencing the critics?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Self-avowed liberal law professor Jonathan Turley is representing the House GOP in its lawsuit against President Barack Obama's implementation of Obamacare and at least one House Democrat wants him pu", "title": "Democrat Wants Gag Order On Liberal Lawyer Representing GOP In Obamacare Lawsuit", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/24/dem-wants-gag-order-on-liberal-lawyer-representing-gop-in-obamacare-lawsuit/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Jonathan-Turley-e1416865770538.jpg", "height": 269}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Silencing the critics?", "title": "Democrat Moves To SILENCE Liberal Lawyer Representing GOP In Obamacare Lawsuit Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/24/dem-wants-gag-order-on-liberal-lawyer-representing-gop-in-obamacare-lawsuit/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Jonathan-Turley-e1416865770538.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-24 17:29:24", "sailthru.title": "Democrat Wants Gag Order On Liberal Lawyer Representing GOP In Obamacare Lawsuit", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "john-boehner,obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "john boehner,jonathan turley,obamacare,robert brady", "sailthru.description": "Self-avowed liberal law professor Jonathan Turley is representing the House GOP in its lawsuit against President Barack Obama's implementation of Obamacare and at least one House Democrat wants him pu", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Jonathan-Turley-e1416865770538.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3e9\"", "article_summary": "(RELATED: Boehner\u2019s Obamacare Lawsuit Boosted By Liberal Law Professor)Now that Turley\u2019s working for the GOP, Pennsylvania Democratic Rep.
