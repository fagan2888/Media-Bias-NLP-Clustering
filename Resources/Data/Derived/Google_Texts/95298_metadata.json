Harris remembers Gov. Pat Brown traveling to Washington to help Watts get a hospital.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we got Martin Luther King Hospital,\u201d she said.\n\nIn March 1972, Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital opened its doors to a long-neglected community that had seen too much suffering \u2013 and too little care.\n\n\u201cThe children didn\u2019t have to suffer no longer,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhatever happened, if you get to Martin Luther King Hospital, you\u2019re going to live. We had the best trauma center in the world. And it saved lives.\u201d\n\nThe opening of the hospital was a point of pride for an area that desperately needed it.\n\n\u201cThe Martin Luther King Hospital was a very important step forward,\u201d said Mark Ridley-Thomas, who sits on the county board of supervisors and represents 2 million people in South LA, including Watts.. \u201cIt was a way of saying that the Watts uprising was, frankly, something that could have been \u2013 and should have been \u2013 avoided.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After losing the hospital, it was clear that the Watts community needed back the hospital it had fought to earn", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/america-tonight/articles/2015/8/12/watts-hospital-anniversary.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/shows/AmericaTonight/2015/08/wattshospital6.jpg", "height": 913}, "type": "article", "description": "After losing the hospital, it was clear that the Watts community needed back the hospital it had fought to earn", "title": "In Los Angeles, hospital born of Watts riots resurrected after failures"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 13:39:08 GMT", "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/shows/AmericaTonight/2015/08/wattshospital6.jpg", "description": "After a long-sought hospital failed miserably, Watts residents hope a new facility will finally meet their basic needs", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "In Los Angeles, hospital born of Watts riots resurrected after failures"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "America Tonight, U.S., Health, Los Angeles", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8afd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhatever happened, if you get to Martin Luther King Hospital, you\u2019re going to live.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we got Martin Luther King Hospital,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf you want to kill a community, kill the medical care; that kills the community.\u201dA 101-page investigation on the riots, commissioned by the governor, noted that insufficient and inaccessible medical care were among the causes.\nIn March 1972, Martin Luther King, Jr. Hospital opened its doors to a long-neglected community that had seen too much suffering \u2013 and too little care.\nPat Brown traveling to Washington to help Watts get a hospital."}
