ST. PETE BEACH, Fla. (AP) - A 33,500 gallon aquarium overlooking the dining room of an upcoming restaurant has been revealed on the hit Animal Planet show "Tanked."

The giant "snorkel aquarium" can be seen by the public starting Saturday. It's at the Guy Harvey Outpost, a TradeWinds Beach Resort.

The aquarium is being stocked with indigenous fish such as snook, redfish, trout, tarpon, grouper, snapper, small sharks and eels for the largest tank the show has ever created. Guests will be able to get behind-the-scenes tours and even snorkel in the tank and feed the fish.

The "Tanked" episode with the aquarium aired Friday. The restaurant is expected to open at the end of May.
