Speak softly enough to each other and to the Avs, be sufficiently somber, offer good-luck messages for the rest of the season and beyond \u2026 and say the sun will come up tomorrow.\n\nAnd sure enough, it did.\n\nFor some of the Avalanche, the Stadium Series game and the 5-3 loss to Detroit at Coors Field on Saturday night might have been a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but it was even conceivable that for some, it could have been their final game in any kind of a Colorado jersey.\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\nThe NHL trade deadline is Monday, and the Avs have a pivotal Tuesday night meeting with the Minnesota Wild in St. Paul.\n\nThe Avs (32-28-4) are in the second of the two wild-card playoff slots in the Western Conference, two points ahead of the Wild.\n\nIn a prelude to the trade deadline, the Avs placed goaltender Reto Berra, who is on the 23-man active roster but on a conditioning assignment with San Antonio of the AHL, on waivers Sunday. He has another season, at $1.45 million, remaining on his three-year contract.\n\nIf Berra is claimed, that clears a spot and a contract; if not, that would give the Avalanche a 30-day window to assign him to San Antonio without sending him through waivers again. It\u2019s even possible, although unlikely, that Colorado could continue to carry three goalies \u2014 Semyon Varlamov, Calvin Pickard and Berra \u2014 beyond Monday. But that depends on who still is around after the trade deadline and Berra\u2019s 24-hour waiver period.\n\nBerra has played 14 games for Colorado, and his 2.41 goals-against average and .922 save percentage actually are better than those of Varlamov and Pickard. But he hasn\u2019t played for Colorado since suffering an ankle injury Dec. 21, participating in the pregame hallway kibitzing with a soccer ball.\n\nThe Avalanche, which didn\u2019t practice Sunday, will be back on the ice Monday at the Family Sports Center before traveling to Minnesota.\n\nMeanwhile, the memories of playing in front of 50,095 fans at Coors Field in the NHL-staged Stadium Series game won\u2019t be all negative for the Avalanche \u2026 especially as time passes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you, it was a lot of fun,\u201d said captain Gabe Landeskog. \u201cIt was different. It was so quiet, because we\u2019re in that little bubble out there. During warm-up you don\u2019t really hear the music, you don\u2019t really hear any of the crowd. But it was fun; we enjoyed it.\u201d\n\nThe wind forced a rare hard whistle at 10 minutes of the third period and switching ends, meaning each team went each direction for 30 minutes. The sight of strips and pieces of the ersatz on-field snow flying around, even landing on the ice, was bizarre. It also ruled out pretending to the international television audience that crews in always snow-covered Denver had just scraped 6 feet of snow off the baseball field around the rink.\n\n\u201cThere was a nice breeze there in the second period,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t bothering us. I know they switched ends in the middle of the third, but I don\u2019t think it made much of a difference.\u201d\n\nMost players said the ice held up remarkably well.\n\n\u201cIt was a little slow, but you\u2019re not going to expect the best ice, like Edmonton and arenas like that,\u201d Landeskog said. \u201cI think the NHL did a great job of making this event as good as they could. The ice was fully, absolutely good enough to play out there.\u201d\n\nHe added that the loss \u201cis going to leave a bit of a bitter taste in the mouth, but at the same time, I\u2019m sure down the road we\u2019re going to be able to look back at this and say what an amazing experience it was.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Next for Avs: Deal with trade deadline", "title": "Next for Avs: Deal with trade deadline", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/28/next-for-avs-deal-with-trade-deadline/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160228__hkn-avsp1.jpg", "height": 477}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160228__hkn-avsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-28T22:02:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T03:31:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But that depends on who still is around after the trade deadline and Berra\u2019s 24-hour waiver period.\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike ChambersThe NHL trade deadline is Monday, and the Avs have a pivotal Tuesday night meeting with the Minnesota Wild in St. Paul.\n\u201cIt was a little slow, but you\u2019re not going to expect the best ice, like Edmonton and arenas like that,\u201d Landeskog said.\nIn a prelude to the trade deadline, the Avs placed goaltender Reto Berra, who is on the 23-man active roster but on a conditioning assignment with San Antonio of the AHL, on waivers Sunday.\nThe sight of strips and pieces of the ersatz on-field snow flying around, even landing on the ice, was bizarre."}
