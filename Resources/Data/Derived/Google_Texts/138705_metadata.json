Its authors determined that premiums would have been about 11 percent lower had all active insurers offered plans on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces in 2014.\n\nJohn Large, an assistant professor of health management at the University of South Florida, agrees there is a risk of premiums rising if consumers have fewer options. But he pointed out that a consolidated company could use its size as leverage to negotiate lower rates with providers \u2014 and potentially pass those savings on to consumers.\n\nLarge also noted that the Affordable Care Act has a number of consumer-protection provisions, including limits on the amount of money insurers can spend on administrative costs and profits.\n\n\"The rates shouldn't get really out of hand,\" he said.\n\nAetna and Humana have sizable footprints in Florida. Humana has about 1.5 million members enrolled in its Medicare, Medicaid and commercial plans across the state. Aetna has another 1.5 members in Florida, some of whom are covered under Coventry plans.\n\nHumana spokesman Mitch Lubitz said members should not expect to see \"major premium increases.\"\n\n\"We're in a good place in terms of premiums in Tampa Bay and Florida, across all lines of business,\" he said.\n\nLubitz described Aetna and Humana as \"complementary companies\" with different strengths in different parts of the country.\n\n\"You aren't necessarily taking away choices,\" he said.\n\nAn Aetna spokesman declined to comment, saying it was too early to speculate on future rates.\n\nBut a news release issued after the announcement suggested that consumer costs might drop.\n\nThe analysis by Aetna: \"The combined entity will help drive better value and higher-quality health care by reducing administrative costs, leveraging best-in-breed practices from the two companies \u2014 including Humana's chronic-care capabilities that measurably improve health outcomes for larger populations \u2014 and enabling the company to better compete with more cost effective products.\"\n\nThe $34 billion deal must still survive antitrust scrutiny. It is expected to close in the second half of 2016.\n\nOther acquisitions could follow. Last month, the insurer Cigna rebuffed a $47 billion acquisition offer from Anthem, but insiders say the companies may now be closing in on a deal.\n\nThe shakeup in the industry comes at a time when many consumers are already bracing for higher health insurance premiums. Some companies offering plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges are projecting double-digit hikes in 2016 to correct for artificially low premiums in the first two years of the new health law.\n\nStill, USF's Large is more concerned about what the changing landscape might mean for health care providers.\n\n\"If Aetna is the only player in the market, that's just going to give them more clout to negotiate rates,\" Large said. \"If a provider doesn't accept the rates they are offering and gets locked out of this big pool of covered lives, they will be limited as far as who they see.\"\n\nInformation from the Associated Press was used in this report.
