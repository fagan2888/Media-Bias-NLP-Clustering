IUPUI\u2019s soccer player Krissy Kirkhoff (pictured) also shines as one of the brightest stars in the state.\n\nWe ran the Value Add Sports calculations on all returning Indiana athletes and emailed 117 sports writers and other experts in the state to help rank the 25 state players to watch on a list we will update here.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nStudent-athletes make their biggest improvement between their freshman and sophomore seasons, and Kirkhoff already ranked second in the Summit League in goals as a freshman, while on the men\u2019s side IUPUI\u2019s Uriel Macias played as the soccer new comer of the year. Another IUPUI to make an all-Summit League team was softball player Roni Patterson.\n\nIndiana high school basketball stars joined student-athletes from Bethel College, Butler, Evansville, Indiana Hoosiers, Indiana State, IUPUI, Notre Dame, Purdue, and Valparaiso on the list.\n\nMake no mistake, how Ferrell and two other Hoosiers basketball players do this year will be the top sports news in the state, and Purdue has put together a nice offseason to potentially derail Indiana.\n\nThe sky is the limit for Valpo\u2019s Peters, an incredible shooter who stands 6-foot-9, a description that also describes Larry Bird, the greatest athlete to ever come out of the state according to the December 23, 2012, Bleacher Report.\n\nNate Sudfeld Indiana Football, QB Alec Peters, Valparaiso, Basket, PF Yogi Ferrell, Indiana, Basket, PG Sabrina Flores, Notre Dame, Soccer, Defender Brett Wehmiller, Indiana State, Track/Field, Decathlon Kellen Dunham, Butler, Basket, SF Ariane Nelson, Indiana, Track/Field, Long Jump Egidijus Mockevicius, Evansville, Basket, C Krissy Kirkhoff, IUPUI, Soccer, Isaac Humphries, La Porte, INLa Lumiere School, Basketball, F Chidera Obasih, Indiana State, Track/Field, 200m Dash Demetrius Jackson, Notre Dame, Basket, SG Roni Patterson, IUPUI, Softball, Jessica Harter, Purdue, Track/Field, Pole Vault Troy Williams, Indiana, Basket, PF Kyle Guy, Indianapolis, INLawrence Central, Basketball, G David Timlin, Indiana State, Track/Field, 1,500m Run Zach Auguste, Notre Dame, Basket, C Uriel Macias, IUPUI, Soccer, Kyle Fiala, NotreDame, Baseball, 3B Ryan Smoyer, NotreDame, Baseball, SP Nolan Narain, La Porte, INLa Lumiere School, Basketball, F Kathryn Larson, BethelCollege, Hockey-Men, James Blackmon, Indiana, Basket, SF Brandon Bielak, NotreDame, Baseball, SP\n\nOthers Receiving Votes\n\nA.J.
