If you're a Milwaukee native or have at least spent a full winter here, you'll likely consider Sunday a perfect day.

Just what constitutes "perfect" this time of year?

Two words: Sunny and warm. And even a little more gorgeous than Saturday when the high hit 63 degrees at around 1 p.m.

Highs Sunday are expected to reach into the upper 60s to lower 70s inland and winds will barely be noticeable. The temperatures will be about 10 degrees warmer than usual for both Sunday and Monday, according to Sarah Marquardt, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sullivan.

"The lake will really have a big influence," Marquardt said. "Western portions of the county could get up to 75."

Marquardt warns not to race off to the garden center just yet, however. Overnight lows are still averaging in the mid to upper 30s but a freeze is still possible.

The last day on record for an overnight freeze in Milwaukee was May 27, 1961, she said.

In addition, a weak front is expected to be moving into the area on Tuesday knocking temps back down into the 50s.

Natives know what this means. No need to read on.

Newbies, hear this: Enjoy it while it lasts. Save the housework, cancel the movie (some would even encourage you to call in sick to work, though you didn't read that here). You're going to want to head to the lake, tennis courts or trails. Or even just the front porch or backyard. Get outside and soak it in.
