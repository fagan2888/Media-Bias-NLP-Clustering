The chase eventually ended when the driver pulled into the driveway of a rural Creek County home on 241st West Avenue and Highway 33.

A 39-year-old Waukomis, Oklahoma man was arrested by Sand Spring Police officers after he led three police agencies on a 30-minute chase across two counties early Tuesday.

Sand Springs Police said the chase began when an officer attempted to stop a pickup driven by Brian Mosley heading south on the shoulder of Highway 97 near the Arkansas River bridge just after midnight. The chase continued into Sapulpa and west on Highways 117 and 33.

The chase ended when Mosley pulled into the driveway of a rural Creek County home near 241st West Avenue and Highway 33.

Sand Springs Police say speeds during the chase briefly exceeded the speed limit, but the driver refused to stop until he parked in the driveway.

Sapulpa Police officers and Creek County Sheriff's deputies were also involved in the chase.

Mosley was booked into the Tulsa County jail on complaints of improper use of lane, eluding, DUI, driving under revocation, transporting an open container, failure to yield and resisting arrest. Jail records show Mosley has a court appearance set for July 8, 2014.
