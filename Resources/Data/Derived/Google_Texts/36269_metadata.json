(AP) - Westminster-Canterbury on Chesapeake Bay, 2:30 p.m.\n\nCoal colliers bob in gentle green swells on a gray afternoon, but it\u2019s bright and sunny 11 stories up.\n\nThe walls and carpets of Ty and Penny Brown\u2019s apartment are pristine white, and a shaggy round orange rug fills the living room with sun. Windows provide a glimpse of the scenes below: condominium rooftops, a sandy shoreline and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel disappearing into low-hanging clouds.\n\nPaintings in gilded gold frames present a similar beach view plus two very different geographies: the craggy red cliffs of the Grand Canyon, which the Browns hiked twice in their younger years, and Yellowstone National Park. Mrs. Brown created all three, the first and largest taking nearly four decades.\n\nThe Browns have called this retirement place home since July 2004, when they traded their three-bedroom Chicago estate for the smaller apartment, with one bedroom occupied by twin beds. A second serves as a TV room for Mr. Brown, 88, and an alcove houses a painting studio for Mrs. Brown, 85.\n\nIt\u2019s just enough room, they say, to live out their final years. The bay beckons many for that purpose, locals and transplants like the Browns looking for an easier way of life. No more bothering with yard work or storm shutters or other routine chores. Plenty of time for reflection and dinner dances and croquet tournaments.\n\nThe Browns looked all over for their final home.\n\nSarasota, Fla., was too hot, and Boston \u201ctoo damned cold,\u201d Mr. Brown says. But Virginia Beach was just right.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be snowbirds,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to really settle in and be a part of the community.\u201d\n\nThey excitedly show it off: a bank over here, a beauty parlor there, a gym and a craft room down the hall. The dining room, Mrs. Brown says proudly, always has cloth tablecloths and fresh flowers. And there\u2019s always something good to eat, such as steaming beef pot pie and pistachio-peanut butter biscotti, too good to pass up.\n\nWhile Mr. Brown toiled at his law career, Mrs. Brown spent most of her years rearing their two children and keeping house. There\u2019s a maid for the latter now.\n\nThe duo have become regulars in the home\u2019s social circles, attending weekly musical performances and lectures on topics including stock trading and outer space.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be bored,\u201d Mr. Brown says. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly do everything here.\u201d\n\nMrs. Brown - elegant, thin and warm with wispy white curls - takes line-dancing lessons twice a week. She sails and regularly swims in the bay, and is active with the Shore Drive Community Coalition and Lynnhaven River Now, an environmental nonprofit.\n\nMr. Brown - slightly shorter with glasses, socks pulled up to his calves, an impish smile and a wicked wit - sits on the finance committee of the retirement home\u2019s board and is on a first-name basis with most of the staff. He also volunteers at the Norfolk Botanical Garden, where he tends its roses.\n\nThey\u2019ve made fast friends among the roughly 700 residents, but friendships in a retirement home can be fleeting.\n\nThe Browns aren\u2019t shy about discussing death, a frequent visitor, sometimes expected and welcomed, other times jarring. The home\u2019s chapel hosts regular memorial services. Its convenience store stocks condolence cards next to cookies.\n\n\u201cYou have a certain amount of turnover in a place like this,\u201d Mr. Brown says.\n\n\u201cYou get used to it. When you come here, you\u2019re going to die here.\u201d\n\nBut the couple doesn\u2019t dwell on death, focusing instead on their lives. And what better backdrop for their final act than the Chesapeake Bay, Mrs. Brown asks.\n\nThey have front-row seats for the drama of hurricanes, the action of windsurfing and the comedy of playful dolphins.\n\n\u201cWe love the bay,\u201d Mrs. Brown says. \u201cThere\u2019s always something going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd even when we get older and won\u2019t be able to swim\u201d or stroll as far, she adds wistfully, \u201cwe\u2019ll be able to sit on the beach and watch.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Virginian-Pilot, http://pilotonline.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Westminster-Canterbury on Chesapeake Bay, 2:30 p.m.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Westminster-Canterbury on Chesapeake Bay, 2:30 p.m.", "title": "Chesapeake Bay community offers seaside retirement", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/1/chesapeake-bay-community-offers-seaside-retirement/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/01/8a5289ac88a5ef215d0f6a706700195e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/01/8a5289ac88a5ef215d0f6a706700195e.jpg", "description": "Westminster-Canterbury on Chesapeake Bay, 2:30 p.m.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Chesapeake Bay community offers seaside retirement"}, "Author": "KATHY ADAMS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc123\"", "article_summary": "And what better backdrop for their final act than the Chesapeake Bay, Mrs. Brown asks.\n\u201cWe love the bay,\u201d Mrs. Brown says.\nWhile Mr. Brown toiled at his law career, Mrs. Brown spent most of her years rearing their two children and keeping house.\nA second serves as a TV room for Mr. Brown, 88, and an alcove houses a painting studio for Mrs. Brown, 85.\nThe dining room, Mrs. Brown says proudly, always has cloth tablecloths and fresh flowers."}
