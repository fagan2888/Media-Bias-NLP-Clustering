So what we have done is sit down with all four of the insurance companies that are going to be offering coverage in the 2015 plan year and we\u2019ve talked to them about the fact we feel this is discriminatory.\"\n\nThat\u2019s because other tiers of drugs don\u2019t have that same requirement.\n\nLindeen says while Blue Cross-Blue Shield, the Montana Health Co-op, PacificSource and Assurant didn\u2019t admit discrimination, they did agree it was a large burden on patients. So they agreed to comply with the order by the state Office of the Commissioner of Securities and Insurance to cover all prescription drugs equally beginning next year.\n\nConsumers will be able to see the changes for specialty drugs when they enroll or re-enroll in Obamacare for 2015.\n\nLindeen warns, however, patients shouldn\u2019t expect a price cut as a result of this change.\n\n\"While it makes it more affordable to purchase your expensive drugs upfront, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its going to be less expensive.\"\n\nThis change in the way specialty drugs are handled only applies to the health insurance plans sold through the Marketplace under ObamaCare.\n\nEnrollment or re-enrollment begins November 15th through February 15th for the 2015 plan year.", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Montanans who need specialty prescription drugs to battle cancer, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis, and other diseases will see changes in the way the four", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://mtpr.org/post/new-rules-rx-drug-pricing-montana", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kufm/files/styles/medium/public/201310/Monica_Lindeen.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Montanans who need specialty prescription drugs to battle cancer, multiple sclerosis, hepatitis, and other diseases will see changes in the way the four", "title": "New Rules For Rx Drug Pricing In Montana"}, "wordCount": 369, "twitter": {"site": "@mtpublicradio", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Jackie Yamanaka, Yellowstone Public Radio", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "New Rules For Rx Drug Pricing In Montana"}, "nid": 25797, "datePublished": "2014-10-10", "story_id": 355239872, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf200\"", "article_summary": "Traditionally, health insurance companies classify prescription drugs into tiers, with so called specialty drugs at the most expensive level.\nThis change in the way specialty drugs are handled only applies to the health insurance plans sold through the Marketplace under ObamaCare.\nConsumers will be able to see the changes for specialty drugs when they enroll or re-enroll in Obamacare for 2015.\n\"While it makes it more affordable to purchase your expensive drugs upfront, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean its going to be less expensive.\"\nState Insurance Commissioner Monica Lindeen negotiated the change for the companies that offer insurance in Montana under the federal Affordable Care Act."}
