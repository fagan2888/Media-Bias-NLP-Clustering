Or at least it became clear to him in retrospect. “My dark blue Bentley, my S3 Continental Flying Spur — an automobile of some rarity, one of a limited edition of 87. Having this car was already heading for trouble, breaking the rules of the establishment, driving a car I was definitely not born into. ‘Blue Lena’ had carried us on many an acid-fueled journey,” Richards recalled in his 2010 autobiography.
