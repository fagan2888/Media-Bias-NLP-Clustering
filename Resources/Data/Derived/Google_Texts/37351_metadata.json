All five states have Democratic governors whose terms end this year. Three of them \u2014 Gov. Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii, Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota and Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon \u2014 are seeking re-election.\n\nIn Maryland, the turmoil around the state-run exchange is dogging Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, a Democrat hoping to succeed Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who is leaving office because of term limits. Mr. O\u2019Malley made Mr. Brown his point person on the health care law\u2019s rollout in Maryland, and now Mr. Brown\u2019s opponents \u2014 both Democratic and Republican \u2014 are bludgeoning him with the state exchange\u2019s failures.\n\nPhoto\n\nAddressing a legislative panel on Jan. 14, Maryland\u2019s top health official said the state had made the mistake of using \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d software with serious defects. The official, Joshua M. Sharfstein, said the state would stick with the current system until the enrollment period ended on March 31, but might consider other options, such as joining the federal exchange, after that.\n\nAll five states lean Democratic, and many analysts believe the exchange failures will not be enough to allow Republican upsets this fall. Still, the issue has been potent enough to hurt Mr. Obama\u2019s approval rating and put congressional Democrats on the defensive. If nothing else, it will provide a continuous headache for Democratic candidates like Mr. Dayton in Minnesota, who is hoping to cruise to a second four-year term. The website of the state\u2019s exchange, known as MNsure, is still plagued by software defects, and an outside review last month found that it cannot be completely fixed before the March 31 enrollment deadline.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe reality is that Mark Dayton owns the MNsure debacle \u2014 there\u2019s no other way about it,\u201d said Ben Golnik, a Republican strategist and a former executive director of the Minnesota Republican Party. \u201cHe pushed it through the Legislature, he said Minnesota is all in, so I think it\u2019s going to be very difficult for him to distance himself from this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140201124121, "twitter": {"description": "State-run health insurance exchanges are now the
