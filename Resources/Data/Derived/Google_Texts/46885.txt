The U.S. Open, New York’s premiere tennis event, brings tennis lovers from around the world to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, where the world’s best players compete. It ended earlier this week, with Serena Williams — one part of the sisterly duo that’s dominated women’s tennis — defending her U.S. Open title against Caroline Wozniacki in her first final in 12 months. Despite failing to make the finals in the Australian Open, Roland Garros, and Wimbledon, she was able to beat Wozniacki with a 6-3, 6-3 win, earning her 18th Grand Slam title.

“It was such a wonderful feeling,” she said in a U.S. Open article. “It’s so emotional for me. I couldn’t ask to do it in a better place. In the beginning of the week, I definitely wasn’t sure I would make it this long (to the finals). So I’m just elated, to be honest, to have made it this far.”

Williams attributed her inability to get to the finals of the other competitions to a viral illness, which she says had caused dizziness and a lack of coordination. Her success during the 75-minute-long U.S. Open final game showed that she’s physically and mentally capable of winning, and if you watch the latest Beats advertisement — you can watch it below — then you’ll see why.

Tennis is a lot more difficult than people give it credit for. A single game can last anywhere from 30 minutes to five hours, so it’s important to be in top shape. Along with basic running and strength exercises, tennis players also strengthen key parts of their bodies used when playing tennis, such as practicing tennis moves with medicine balls.
