(AP) - In 2011, when brothers Hank and Steve Frecon wanted to grow profit at their family\u2019s 71-year-old Frecon Farms in Boyertown, they began turning some of their apples into hard cider.\n\nThey were venturing into the fastest-growing alcoholic beverage category in the country \u2014 and a thicket of red tape beyond anything they could have imagined.\n\nFirst, they obtained a limited winery license and began fermenting crab apples, Granny Smith, Winesap, and other varieties, producing ciders that, due to apples\u2019 natural sugar content, came in around 7.5 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) or higher.\n\nThen, to sell through beer distributors - where most consumers look for hard cider, but where, under state law, hard ciders\u2019 ABV may not exceed 5.5 percent - they added a second, lower-alcohol cidery, called the Other Farm, under a brewery license.\n\n\u201cThink about the silliness of this!\u201d Hank Frecon said. \u201cWe had to create a separate business\u201d to sell a different version of the same product.\n\nThat could soon change. Allegheny County Rep. Mark Mustio introduced a bill last month that would raise that alcohol limit to 14 percent.\n\nFrecon, who with seven other cideries is organizing a new trade association, the Pennsylvania Cider Guild, wants to take it a step further: \u201cWe all feel that it\u2019s really important for cider to be recognized as its own commodity. It would be great to have a uniform structure in Pennsylvania to support this industry, which is growing at a really amazing clip.\u201d\n\nCumbersome liquor laws aside, the hard-cider boom is already well underway. Cider sales were up 79 percent last year, according to market-research firm Nielsen, and 24 brands launched in 2014 alone.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, which is fourth in the nation in apple production, growers are taking note, said Carla Snyder, agricultural entrepreneurship and marketing educator at Penn State Extension in Adams County. These days, she gets at least three inquiries a day about hard cider.\n\nIn the Philadelphia region, newcomers this year include Kurant Cider, which shares space with Round Guys Brewing Co. in Lansdale, and Sir Charles Hard Cider, which is fermenting its first 500-gallon batch for distribution. They join producers small and large that have entered the market in the last five years - most notably, Boston Beer, Sam Adams\u2019 parent company, which produces the top-selling cider, Angry Orchard, in Ohio and at a plant outside Allentown.\n\nFor those who didn\u2019t get in early on the craft-beer wave, it feels like a can\u2019t-miss opportunity.\n\nThat\u2019s the case for Kurant co-owner Joe Getz, who turned from brewing to fermenting in hopes of tapping into a less-crowded cider market.\n\nCraft-cider-makers like him are modeling their products on traditional French, Spanish, and English ciders, using fresh juices rather than concentrates, and less sugar than industrial producers do.\n\n\u201cA traditional cider would be dry with a quality like white wine,\u201d he said. Kurant is launching with three flavors made mostly from Pennsylvania apples: the crisp Cider Daily, a hopped cider, and a tropical cider sweetened with pineapple juice.\n\nOne challenge is convincing consumers wary of sugar overload that cider actually can taste good.\n\n\u201cPeople often say, \u2018I don\u2019t like cider.\u2019 And we try to say, \u2018This is extremely different. Give it a shot.\u2019 \u201c\n\nStill, he said, a bigger challenge is meeting state limits on alcohol content, because he has licensed as a brewery, subject to that 5.5 percent ABV limit.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest hurdles in Pennsylvania is legislation that puts hard cider in a large gray area with very different possibilities, depending whether you\u2019re producing under a brewery license or a winery license,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really prohibitive.\u201d\n\nOn the flip side, Big Hill Ciderworks in Adams County opted to go for a winery license when it opened last year.\n\nCo-owner Ben Kishbaugh said business was going well - but, he added with a sigh, \u201cwe\u2019re going through growing pains.\n\n\u201cThere are two of us,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re doing all the manufacturing, the bottling, the kegging, the delivery, and sales.\u201d\n\nHe and his partner, Troy Lehman, have their own orchards, where they grow American and European heirloom cider-apple varieties, which are higher in tannins and acid than apples sold for snacking. To achieve 5.5 percent alcohol ciders, they have to dilute them, adding fresh cider to the fermented stuff.\n\nStill, they\u2019re considering seeking a brewery license. It would let them sell through a distributor and grow their business. It would also be an added expense: about $5,000 for the paperwork, plus administrative costs for running a second company.\n\nGiven the fractured nature of the current marketplace, varied interests including apple growers, wineries, beer distributors, and the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board all have their own ideas about what direction the industry should take in Pennsylvania.\n\nA push from beer distributors was what sparked Mustio\u2019s bill, he said. He has since been hearing from other constituents, and will consider modifying the proposal once hearings are held.\n\nFederal regulatory changes raising limits on alcohol content and carbonation levels, and reducing taxes - the CIDER Act - are also under consideration in the Senate.\n\nBut boosters aren\u2019t waiting around for those bills to be enacted.\n\nAt Penn State Extension over the last year and a half, Carla Snyder has been running workshops, leading cider-marketing tours, and helping growers develop marketing and business plans.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Apple Marketing Program is dedicating its Specialty Crop Block Grant fund this year, $29,000, to cider market research, community education, and technical assistance. But it\u2019s not enough, said Julie Bancroft, executive director.\n\n\u201cContinued research, especially that dedicated to varietals,\u201d she said, \u201cwill be critical to the ongoing success of the industry.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Jason Harris of Stone & Key Cellars in Montgomeryville, said he has found plenty of interest in the ciders he has been making since 2013, fermented from Solebury Orchards\u2019 apple cider and available in farmhouse-style, brandy-barrel-aged or \u201capple cherry pie.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an easy sell to bars, he said: \u201cGoing to them and saying, \u2018We have this product that acts like a beer, but it\u2019s gluten-free\u2019 - that drives it.\u201d\n\nMichael McCaulley, wine director at Tria, said that, six years ago, he wasn\u2019t offering any ciders. Now, he has two taps dedicated to it at Tria Taproom, and bottles at other locations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the best period in cider as far as availability,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of new ciders that have become available in Pennsylvania in the last year.\u201d\n\nBut finding them can be confusing. Because of state laws, McCaulley buys some ciders from wine distributors, while Tria\u2019s beer buyer purchases the lower-alcohol ciders from beer distributors.\n\nAs John Kowchak, of Glenolden, launches his Sir Charles Hard Cider, he\u2019ll be closely watching the news from Harrisburg.\n\nHe designed his flagship product with the 5.5 percent ABV limit in mind. But relaxing the rules would yield a whole new set of possibilities.\n\n\u201cIt would allow us to have not only our original product, but also to play around with some stuff to be sold in bigger bottles at higher ABVs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would open up the cider market in Pennsylvania almost overnight.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1LKNJtC\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2011, when brothers Hank and Steve Frecon wanted to grow profit at their family's 71-year-old Frecon Farms in Boyertown, they began turning some of their apples into hard cider.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/4/proposed-cider-law-could-unleash-a-flood-of-new-va/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "In 2011, when brothers Hank and Steve Frecon wanted to grow profit at their family\u2019s 71-year-old Frecon Farms in Boyertown, they began turning some of their apples into hard cider.", "title": "Proposed cider law could unleash a flood of new varieties"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "In 2011, when brothers Hank and Steve Frecon wanted to grow profit at their family's 71-year-old Frecon Farms in Boyertown, they began turning some of their apples into hard cider.", "card": "summary", "title": "Proposed cider law could unleash a flood of new varieties"}, "Author": "SAMANTHA MELAMED", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Kurant is launching with three flavors made mostly from Pennsylvania apples: the crisp Cider Daily, a hopped cider, and a tropical cider sweetened with pineapple juice.\nAs John Kowchak, of Glenolden, launches his Sir Charles Hard Cider, he\u2019ll be closely watching the news from Harrisburg.\nThese days, she gets at least three inquiries a day about hard cider.\nIn the Philadelphia region, newcomers this year include Kurant Cider, which shares space with Round Guys Brewing Co. in Lansdale, and Sir Charles Hard Cider, which is fermenting its first 500-gallon batch for distribution.\nTo achieve 5.5 percent alcohol ciders, they have to dilute them, adding fresh cider to the fermented stuff."}
