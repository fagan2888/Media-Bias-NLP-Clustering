Pique or principle? 1 / 1 Back to Gallery\n\nThere is a miasma of political peevishness plaguing the land.\n\nIt goes something like this: \u201cIf Bernie Sanders doesn\u2019t get the nomination, I\u2019m not voting for Hillary Clinton\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m not voting at all.\u201d\n\nOn the GOP side, until the withdrawal of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich from the race last week, it was: \u201cIf Donald Trump is brokered out of the nomination, I\u2019m not voting.\u201d\n\nLet us count the ways that this is all pique masquerading as principle \u2014 the political version of taking your marbles or your ball and going home.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the intransigence of those who feel the Bern and are now dismayed because it appears that Clinton has a lock on the Democratic nomination.\n\nOn most of the major issues, Clinton is closer to Sanders\u2019 positions than his are to Trump\u2019s, who, with his win in Indiana on Tuesday, has earned the right to call himself the presumptive GOP nominee.\n\nAnd by Clinton being close to Sanders\u2019 stances, I mean Clinton is more likely to get us to many of the places he wants us to go, though by different routes and incrementally.\n\nNot free college but debt-free college. Not single payer but improving on Obamacare. She\u2019s been more hawkish on war and peace than Sanders \u2014 and arguably more than Trump. In any case, Clinton is no warmonger \u2014 I haven\u2019t heard her once yearn to learn if sand can glow in the dark.\n\nSo, that pretty much leaves her super PAC money, her ties to Wall Street and her stance on banks.\n\nLegitimate issues, but tell me: Which of the candidates left standing after the July conventions \u2014 Clinton or Trump \u2014 is likely to push for campaign finance reform or more stringent bank and Wall Street regulation?\n\nBust up the big banks? Not likely to happen with any Congress. Single payer, universal health care? My favorite, too. And we\u2019ll get closer to it with a President Clinton than a President Trump.\n\nTrump might harbor some Democrat-like sentiments \u2014 including on campaign finance reform \u2014 but none of the know-how on how to get it done.\n\nOK, now on to angry Trump supporters in the virtually impossible event that their worst-case scenario comes true.\n\nLet\u2019s say Cruz and Kasich had stayed in and pulled off a miracle. Um, c\u2019mon. Trump supporters just spent all this energy backing the guy who slams the GOP elites and establishment, and whose views on Mexico, immigration and Muslim refugees seem to animate a whole lot of folks. If Trump supporters sat out the election, this would guarantee a win for the person who is secretly (and not so secretly) the hope of those elites in a Clinton-Trump matchup \u2014 a candidate whose views on those trigger issues are the polar opposite of Trump\u2019s.\n\nI know many people hope Trump\u2019s nomination will cause a whole lot of people to sit out the election. I\u2019m not one of them.\n\nParticularly in the case of Sanders fans, staying home would simply nurture a sense of martyrdom \u2014 make them believe even more fervently that a Clinton presidency is illegitimate, though she will have won fairly and squarely. Yes, Sanders fans, superdelegates are part of the rules and, if they are unfair, why is Sanders spending a bit of time wooing them?\n\nIt\u2019s simply not in me to wish that people don\u2019t vote. Voting is what fuels our democracy. I can\u2019t bemoan all those manufactured ways \u2014 voter ID, et al. \u2014 to deny certain people the vote and wish that people deny themselves.\n\nIn fact, this will likely be one of those elections in which where you stood will tell people who you are. You will be asked. Be honest when you answer.\n\nElections are about choices. I\u2019ve never been through an election in which I was 100 percent on the same page of the person I was voting for. It\u2019s about which candidate is closer \u2014 not identical \u2014 to my views.\n\nThis kind of compromise is necessary in the voting booth \u2014 if only to be counted for what and who you\u2019re against.\n\no.ricardo.pimentel@express-news.net\n\nTwitter: @oricardopimente", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Let\u2019s start with the intransigence of those who feel the Bern and are now dismayed because it appears that Clinton has a lock on the Democratic nomination.
