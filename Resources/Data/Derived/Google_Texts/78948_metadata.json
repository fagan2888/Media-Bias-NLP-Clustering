Construction on the 36-inch-wide, 114-mile pipeline would begin in spring 2017 if the project can gain approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n\nFive other pipelines now carry gas over roughly the same route\u2014indeed, the proposed path for the PennEast project was altered so 50 percent of the pipeline could be co-located with existing rights of way, according to project officials.\n\nBut those other lines are operating at full capacity because of the dramatic growth of energy exploration in the Marcellus Shale region, which has made addition of another line necessary, project officials say.\n\nStudies show the pipeline would produce economic benefits. According to a new study from Concentric Energy Advisors, New Jersey ratepayers would have saved $900 million last winter if the pipeline had been in place.\n\nThe pipeline, if built, also would \u201chelp reduce \u2026 price volatility to the benefit of New Jersey\u2019s nearly 3 million natural gas consumers,\u201d and will transport enough natural gas between Pennsylvania and New Jersey to heat the equivalent of 4.7 million homes, the study says.\n\nIndeed, during the winter of 2013-2014, natural gas prices in New Jersey varied from $100 per dekatherm to $3 per dekatherm in the area PennEast will extend into, according to a release from UGI, one of the companies involved in the project.\n\nMoreover, the PennEast partnership, which consists of UGI, AGL Resources, NJR Pipeline Company \u2014 a subsidiary of New Jersey Resources \u2014 and South Jersey Industries, estimates total economic impact in both states during the design and construction of $1.62 billion, which would support more than 12,160 new jobs with $740 million in wages.\n\n\u2018Stop the Pipeline!\u2019\n\nBut the Delaware Riverkeeper network, a nonprofit group based in Bristol, Pa., is not sold on the pipeline.\n\nThe group has organized meetings, planted signs throughout Mercer County and even gone into schools in New Jersey to explain its opposition to the project. Its leaders claim farmers have told them production on farmland goes down 30 percent when pipelines are installed underneath the land. It says pollution and other threats to public safety far outweigh the benefits.\n\nIn fact, it says, the pipeline not only would not deliver on the jobs, salaries, price decreases and other economic benefits promoted by project developers, it would constitute a net economic drain on the area.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at their claims, their analysis is very limited and myopic,\u201d said Maya K. van Rossum, president of the Delaware Riverkeeper organization. \u201cThey do not talk about the job losses associated with the project and the implication for property values and impact on eco-tourism. They also don\u2019t tell you that there is no need for the natural gas in New Jersey and that the real purpose of the project is to export the gas.\u201d\n\nBut supporters say the Riverkeepers\u2019 issue is not truly with the PennEast project itself but with the idea of energy from the Marcellus Shale making it to market. They point to the signs, ubiquitous in Mercer County, which read, \u201cProtect the Environment! Stop the Pipeline!\u201d; \u201cSTOP the Fracking Pipelines\u201d and \u201cSTOP the Pipeline: Save the Sourlands.\u201d\n\nThey bring up the public comments Riverkeeper delivered to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in which, they say, the organization showed its true colors.\n\n\u201cThe impacts of the project cannot be understood apart from the totality of the past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions associated with Marcellus Shale development and the development of other shales such as the Utica shale,\u201d the Riverkeeper argued in its letter to the regulatory body. \u201cThe PennEast project threatens to disturb pristine open space, landscapes of contiguous forest, threatened and endangered species habitat, and breathtaking vistas in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\u201d\n\n\u2018Enormously Beneficial\u2019\n\nTom Shepstone, who operates the Natural Gas Now blog, claims the Riverkeeper\u2019s real purpose is to provide a way for the William Penn Foundation, whose tax status restricts its ability to participate in such political debates, to fund efforts of others who can.\n\nThe William Penn Foundation is a Philadelphia-based grant-making foundation with a focus to \u201censure a sustainable environment,\u201d among other things.\n\n\u201cThey [the William Penn Foundation] are not really out to protect the Delaware River,\u201d Shepstone said, noting the group\u2019s lawsuit about an environmental dispute in western Pennsylvania, which is two watersheds and 200 miles away from the Delaware River. \u201cThey are out to do the bidding of the William Penn Foundation. The pipeline really has nothing do with fracking. The Delaware Riverkeeper is trying to meld the two issues together to create a constituency opposed to the pipeline. But this is really about transporting natural gas to New Jersey, which would be enormously beneficial.\u201d\n\nJim Willis, the editor and publisher of Marcellus Drilling News, sees \u201can irrational hatred of fossil fuels\u201d behind the opposition to the project.\n\n\u201cThey are not making rational arguments. Any kind of fossil fuel for them is something that must be resisted and beaten back. With this kind of mentality, we\u2019ll never have any economic progress. We don\u2019t live in a world without risks. Why hold the pipeline to an artificial standard that is not applied elsewhere and can never be met?\u201d\n\n\u2018We Can Do Both\u2019\n\nAt least two other pipeline projects are proposed for the region, but although all have encountered some opposition, the PennEast project clearly has received the most.\n\nWhy? Possibly because the farther away from energy production you get, the easier it is to stir fear that a pipeline may cause damage to the water supply, says Nicole Jacobs, a spokesperson for Energy In Depth \u2014 a campaign of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.\n\n\u201cThere is no production in that part of New Jersey or Pennsylvania,\u201dJacobs said. \u201cWhere I live, the biggest concerns about fracking are people saying, \u2018One of your trucks knocked over my mailbox. When will you fix my mailbox?\u2019 But the farther away from production you get, the more concern you see with issues such as the water [supply].\u201d\n\nPatrick Kornick, a spokesman for PennEast, says the real issue is whether the pipeline can be built safely and deliver benefits to people who rely on natural gas in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cWe are very fortunate in the United States in that we have reached the point with technological advancements that we do not have to choose between protecting the environment and constructing a natural gas pipeline, because we can do both,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe pipelines of today are not the pipelines of 10 years ago; they are not even the pipelines of yesterday. We can safely construct a natural gas pipeline that will provide heat in winter and other options for homes, businesses and factories. Environmental protection and economic progress can exist harmoniously. We can do both.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A battle over a pipeline that would take natural gas from eastern Pennsylvania to the Trenton, N.J., is stoking divisions on the East Coast.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A battle over a pipeline that would take natural gas from eastern Pennsylvania to the Trenton, N.J., is stoking divisions on the East Coast.", "title": "Controversial Pipeline Divides East Coast", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Riverkeeper.png", "updated_time": "2015-05-08T14:25:34+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1zRGnzr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A battle over a pipeline that would take natural gas from eastern Pennsylvania to the Trenton, N.J., is stoking divisions on the East Coast.", "title": "Controversial Pipeline Divides East Coast", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Riverkeeper.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Energy", "tag": "oil/gas", "published_time": "2015-05-09T03:01:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T14:25:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "pipeline, Riverkeeper, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, PennEast, William Penn Foundation, Mercer County"}, "article_summary": "We can safely construct a natural gas pipeline that will provide heat in winter and other options for homes, businesses and factories.\n\u2018Stop the Pipeline!\u2019But the Delaware Riverkeeper network, a nonprofit group based in Bristol, Pa., is not sold on the pipeline.\n\u201cWe are very fortunate in the United States in that we have reached the point with technological advancements that we do not have to choose between protecting the environment and constructing a natural gas pipeline, because we can do both,\u201d he said.\nAccording to a new study from Concentric Energy Advisors, New Jersey ratepayers would have saved $900 million last winter if the pipeline had been in place.\n\u201cThe pipelines of today are not the pipelines of 10 years ago; they are not even the pipelines of yesterday."}
