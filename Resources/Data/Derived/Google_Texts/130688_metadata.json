Despite the economic and community benefits of volunteering, the percentage of Americans who volunteer fell from its peak of 28.8% in 2005 to 25.4% in 2013.\n\n\u201cVolunteers are the lifeblood of our nonprofits and schools and shelters and neighborhood organization, hospitals, hotlines,\u201d said Sandy Scott, senior advisor at the Corporation for National and Community Service in an interview with 24/7 Wall St. \u201cThey provide enormous social and economic value for our country.\u201d\n\nBased on data from the CNCS, Utah leads the nation with 45.3% of its residents 16 and older volunteering in 2013. State residents also volunteered by far the most hours, with each volunteer contributing 85 hours in 2013 on average. Louisiana, on the other hand, had the lowest volunteer rate at just 16.7%. And each volunteer in the state contributed just 21.4 hours on average, the lowest figure nationwide.\n\nThe volunteer rate only accounts for formal volunteerism and may overlook other ways people help their communities, said Scott. The CNCS also looked at the proportion of state residents who did favors for a neighbor. More than 20% of residents in six of the states with the highest volunteer rates reported doing a favor for a neighbor a few times a month, higher than the national proportion of 17.7%.\n\nAlthough volunteering requires the commitment of often valuable, unpaid hours, an abundance of free time among state residents does not necessarily lead to higher volunteerism rates. For example, one might expect volunteer rates to be higher among unemployed individuals, especially since volunteering dramatically increases the chances of getting hired. However, this is not the case.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re unemployed and volunteering,\u201d Scott said, \u201cyou\u2019re honing your job skills, you\u2019re making contacts, you\u2019re showing a can-do attitude, and you\u2019re increasing your social capital, your skills and doing all the things you should be doing to help find a job.\u201d\n\nYet, unemployment rates in all of the 10 states with the highest volunteerism were lower than the national rate of 7.3% in 2013. Meanwhile, unemployment rates in the 10 states with the lowest volunteerism tended to be higher than the national rate. This suggests that a stable economy, despite requiring perhaps more of the residents\u2019 labor and time, helps promote volunteerism.\n\nThe time available to an individual still plays a role in whether a resident will volunteer. Residents in states with long average commute times were the least likely to volunteer, while residents in states with relatively low commuting times were far more likely to volunteer.\n\nCounterintuitively, Scott observed, \u201cThe most typical volunteer is actually a working mother, which might surprise you because who\u2019s the busiest person around? It\u2019s a working mother.\u201d\n\nVolunteers work in a wide range of places, including religious organizations, schools, and civic institutions. Just over 4% of volunteers devoted most of their volunteer time at sport or art related organizations, the least popular volunteer outlet nationwide. Religious institutions, on the other hand, were the most popular, attracting more than 34% of American volunteers.\n\nHomeownership is strongly associated with volunteering. Owning a home is usually a commitment to stay and live in the home\u2019s location. Perhaps as a result, homeowners are more invested in their communities and tend to volunteer more. More than 65% of housing units in all but one top state for volunteering were owner-occupied, higher than the national homeownership rate of 63.5% in 2013. The opposite tended to be true in the housing markets of the states with the lowest volunteerism.\n\nTo identify the states with the highest and lowest volunteer rates, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the percent of state residents 16 and older who volunteered with an organization in 2013 from the Corporation for National and Community Service. The survey also included state data on historical volunteer rates, where individuals volunteered primarily, the types of volunteering activities, and the volunteer retention rate. In addition, survey respondents were asked whether they did favors for neighbors, voted in local elections, had confidence in public schools, and whether they trusted their neighbor. We also looked at state educational attainment rates, poverty rates, age cohorts by state, homeownership rates, and household median income from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2013 American Community Survey. The number of nonprofit organizations per 100,000 state residents also came from the U.S. Census. Annual unemployment rates are for 2013 and came from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 24/7 Wall St. also considered Gallup\u2019s 2013 well-being index.\n\nThese are the states with the highest (and lowest) volunteer rates.\n\n10 States That Volunteer The Most 10 States That Volunteer The Most\n\n1 of 10 10. Iowa > Volunteer rate: 33.0% > Pct. with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree: 26.4% (15th lowest) > Pct. voting often or sometimes in local elections: 56.1% (9th lowest) > Unemployment rate: 4.6% (6th lowest) Approximately one in three Iowa residents volunteered in 2013, the 10th highest share compared with all states and up slightly from 32.6% in 2012. As in other states, Iowa\u2019s volunteerism rate was lower than it was a decade ago. In 2003, the Iowa volunteer rate was 39.9%, fourth highest at that time. Residents of the Hawkeye State volunteered an average of 35 hours over the course of 2013, down from a high of 47.8 hours in 2004 but still one of the higher figures nationwide. Like volunteers across the country and in most states, Iowans pitched in the most at religious organizations, with 37% devoting most of their volunteer time at faith-based organizations. By contrast, 7.3% of Iowans volunteered at civic groups. Iowans also put their backs into volunteerism: about 28% of their volunteer activity was classified as general labor, including physical labor, second only to Wyoming in such volunteer work.
