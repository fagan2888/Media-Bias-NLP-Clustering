NEWARK - A New Jersey appeals court has overturned several motor vehicle convictions of a woman who claims a former romantic relationship with a Palisades Interstate Parkway police officer led to her being targeted for harassment.

Gail Lawrence was convicted of more than a dozen driving violations in two separate trials in 2011.

Her appeal claimed she didn’t waive her right to a lawyer but that the judge went ahead with the trial, forcing her to represent herself.

She also claimed police never produced dashboard videos that showed the alleged infractions.

Lawrence argued evidence she sought from the police department would show she was retaliated against after her relationship with the officer ended.

Parkway police didn’t comment on the case Saturday.

Friday’s appeals court ruling sent the case back to municipal court.
