I never really considered that happening until the past year.\u201d\n\nTyler has been behind bars for almost 22 years. For most of that time, he has known his only hope for freedom was a grant of clemency from the President of the United States.\n\nNow, the Obama administration has begun a program aimed at reducing incarceration among nonviolent offenders. The Justice Department last month invited inmates to apply for clemency.\n\nTo be eligible, federal prisoners have to meet six criteria:\n\n\u2666 They likely would have received a substantially lower sentence if convicted of the same offenses today.\n\n\u2666 They are non-violent, low-level offenders without significant ties to large criminal organizations.\n\n\u2666 They have served at least 10 years of their prison sentence.\n\n\u2666 They don\u2019t have a significant criminal history.\n\n\u2666 They have demonstrated good conduct in prison.\n\n\u2666 They have no history of violence.\n\nThe Middle District of Florida expects hundreds, maybe thousands, of potential candidates for clemency to apply, according to Rosemary Cakmis, senior litigator at the federal Public Defenders Office, which has started reviewing old files.\n\n\u201cHundreds and hundreds of people are calling in and preliminary scans looks like they are probably eligible,\u201d she said. \u201cThe whole project isn\u2019t up and running.. We\u2019re probably ahead of the game. We\u2019re preparing forms and preparing manuals and training for attorneys to write clemency petitions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hitting the fan, I think, in the next month or so,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd there will be a lot more details and information available.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, the program is hugely popular among federal prison inmates, who are clamoring to fill out electronic surveys necessary to apply.\n\n\u201cWe understand the bureau of prisons has about 15,000 surveys completed and about that number in process by prisoners,\u201d said Tampa lawyer Jim Felman, who is on the board of Clemency Project 2014, which is organizing private lawyers volunteering their services to help the inmates nationwide. \u201cSo we\u2019re expecting a minimum of 30,000 surveys.\u201d\n\nBut that number appears to be inflated and likely to include many people who don\u2019t meet the criteria, Felman said. Officials estimate, for example, that there are only between 23,000 and 24,000 federal inmates who have served at least 10 years of their sentences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to discourage anybody from going ahead and filing their clemency petition,\u201d Felman said. \u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do is if someone needs a lawyer, we\u2019re going to get them one.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of questions that have yet to be answered, Felman said. For example, it\u2019s not clear if someone who has served nine years of a sentence might be eligible to apply next year, and so on. Also, officials haven\u2019t said whether the clemency decisions will be announced as each petition is approved, or in a large group.\n\nIn any event, officials expect it to take many months before the initiative yields results.\n\nMelissa Saldivar says Tyler meets all the qualifications set down by the Justice Department. She\u2019s a law student at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and is representing Tyler as part of the law school\u2019s first Clemency Project. She hopes to have his clemency petition submitted by next month.\n\nTyler was sentenced to two life terms because when he was arrested, he had two previous drug convictions for which he had received probation. His supporters say he was selling LSD to his friends, one of whom was arrested on marijuana charges and became an informant who asked Tyler to send him larger and larger quantities.\n\n\u201cThe best argument he has - and we\u2019re going to keep reiterating this in the petition - is his crime he committed was not violent at all,\u201d Saldivar said. \u201cHe\u2019s never had a violent criminal history. We\u2019re just going to emphasise the fact that he\u2019s the most nonviolent person. He\u2019s cooped up with murderers and rapists and that\u2019s just not OK.\u201d\n\nSaldivar said Tyler\u2019s case is likely to be helped by the attention he\u2019s received.\n\nThe man who was in his early 20s when he was arrested, following the Grateful Dead around the country, selling fried dough to other fans and sending LSD to his friends back home, has captured the attention of sympathizers from the left and right.\n\nHe was featured, for example, in a report by the American Civil Liberties Union called, \u201cA Living Death: Life without Parole for Nonviolent Offenses.\u201d\n\nTyler, the report says, \u201ctold the ACLU that he \u2018lost [his] mind\u2019 after his first 10 years in prison,\u201d the report says. \u201cHe has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, for which he has been periodically hospitalized in mental health institutions since he was a teenager. After more than a decade in prison, he was transferred to Springfield Mental Hospital for treatment for a year; he returned to prison afterward. Despite his mental illness, he has been repeatedly held in isolation. He was recently held in isolation due to a prison-wide lockdown following the murder of a prison guard. As a result of the stress of isolation and being deprived of essential contact with his family, he told the ACLU he suffered a mental breakdown in March 2013, during which he was banging his head against the walls, singing at the top of his lungs while naked, and spreading feces on himself.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R-KY, mentioned him in an op ed in the Washington Times, \u201cThe Madness of Mandatory Minimums.\u201d \u201cTyler should have been punished for selling drugs, but he shouldn\u2019t have to spend the rest of his life in prison for it,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cToday, Timothy is 45 and will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars, not because a judge thought it was a proper punishment, but because an arbitrary federal law demanded it.\u201d\n\nA petition started by his sister, Carrie Tyler-Stoafer on change.org has received more than 360,000 signatures.\n\nTyler, who had girlfriends before he was arrested, says he \u201cadapted\u201d in prison and is now bisexual. \u201cI experimented with men because I needed affection and I was sentenced to never be with a woman again,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nHe recently was approved to move to a medium-security prison, which he says will likely be safer for him because \u201cbeing gay is no big deal\u201d in most medium-security facilities. \u201cSo it is sort of a blessing not to have to walk around looking over your back so much.\u201d\n\nTyler-Stoafer said the clemency program is \u201cwonderful news.\u201d Before, she said, she thought her brother had \u201clike a one in 2 million shot\u201d at ever being free. Now, she says, \u201cI think he has a good chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Obama doesn\u2019t let him go after 360,000 signatures, I\u2019m trying my best,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said her brother is trying to keep an even keel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that he wants to get his hopes up,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s having sort of daydreams that he could get out, which he never had before. So I think he pictures himself doing things on the outside that are fun like kayaking with me or something. But I don\u2019t think he wants to stay in that place (mentally) because he doesn\u2019t want to be let down if that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAsked what he hopes to do if he is released, Tyler wrote, \u201cI really can not imagine freedom. I would love to do so many things such as cleanse my body of all the toxins and eat organic vegan food.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could be optimistic but one never knows what life will bring,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have forgiven everyone I ever knew that did me and my family wrong... I would hope that America and the Justice department could forgive me for making and admitting I made a mistake.\u2019\u2019\n\nTyler said he\u2019s not alone. \u201cI know that there are plenty of people with life sentences that would not violate another law if given the chance. I know I am one of those. If the president gives clemency to a few hundred people that have all served ten or more years and that have life I believe most of them would never be arrested again.\u201d\n\nesilvestrini@tampatrib.com\n\n813-259-7837\n\nTwitter: @ElaineTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Mon, 26 May 2014 13:10:14 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Tim Tyler, a Grateful Dead fan serving life in federal prison for selling LSD to a friend, never thought he would breathe free air again.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Tim Tyler, a Grateful Dead fan serving life in federal prison for selling LSD to a friend, never thought he would breathe free air again.", "title": "Clemency proposal giving hope to federal prison \u2018lifers\u2019", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/crime/clemency-proposal-giving-hope-to-federal-prison-lifers-20140526/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2014-05-26T13:10:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Clemency proposal giving hope to federal prison \u2018lifers\u2019"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-05-26T13:10:14Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-05-26T13:10:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACLU,clemency,Clemency Project,Elaine Silvestrini,federal prison,Justice Department,life without parole,Tim Tyler,war on drugs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21a8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to discourage anybody from going ahead and filing their clemency petition,\u201d Felman said.\n\u2014 Tim Tyler, a Grateful Dead fan serving life in federal prison for selling LSD to a friend, never thought he would breathe free air again.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s having sort of daydreams that he could get out, which he never had before.\nShe hopes to have his clemency petition submitted by next month.\n\u201cAnd there will be a lot more details and information available.\u201dNot surprisingly, the program is hugely popular among federal prison inmates, who are clamoring to fill out electronic surveys necessary to apply."}
