The report is based on survey responses from executives at 920 U.S. manufacturing and distribution firms, including 62 from Minnesota.\n\nMinnesota expressed more confidence and optimism than the nation as a whole, on a number of measures. For example, 42 percent of Minnesota respondents said they are \u201cthriving,\u201d compared to 36 percent nationally. Nationwide, 5 percent of companies said they were \u201cdeclining\u201d; none of Minnesota\u2019s participants did. Sales grew last year for 74 percent of Minnesota companies, compared to 69 percent nationwide.\n\nThe 2014 survey marked an improvement for Minnesota companies: In 2013, 39 percent of participants from the state said they were thriving, and 5 percent said they were declining. But while Minnesota is faring better than the national average, neighboring Wisconsin is even more confident, with 44 percent \"thriving.\" By contrast, only 33 percent of Illinois participants said they are.\n\nThe McGladrey report echoed some of the findings from Twin Cities Business\u2019 latest quarterly economic indicator survey. Similarly, a recent survey from Enterprise Minnesota found that 84 percent of local manufacturing executives were confident in their firms\u2019 future, the highest mark in that survey\u2019s six-year history.\n\nRespondents to all three surveys, however, cited significant concerns about government regulations and taxation\u2014and McGladrey's report confirmed that Minnesota manufacturers are among the most worried about those issues.\n\nSixty-five percent of Minnesota respondents said regulations are having a negative impact on growth, among the highest level among states. In fact, three-quarters of Minnesota manufacturers said they believe regulations and taxes will limit growth more than even competition from other companies.\n\n\n\nSome more takeaways from the survey about Minnesota manufacturers:\n\n\u2022 67 percent are looking to expand their workforce\n\n\u2022 61 percent of executives said they feel their data is at little or no risk\n\n\u2022 77 percent are planning to increase investments in IT\n\n\u2022 90 percent expect health care costs to rise\n\n\u2022 73 percent cited the Affordable Care Act as their greatest limitation to growth\n\nWhile Minnesota manufacturers face many of the same challenges as their industry peers, they appear to be handling them differently in some instances. For example, Minnesota manufacturers are seeing a higher return on investment from their marketing strategies, and they have a greater focus on profitable existing customers, according to the report.\n\nFor more information about Minnesota's manufacturing industry, access McGladrey's full \u201cMinnesota State Benchmark Report.\u201d Find reports about other states here.\n\nA couple of years ago, McGladrey relocated its headquarters from Minneapolis to Chicago, although it maintains a substantial Twin Cities workforce.", "article_metadata": {"document-title": "More MN Manufacturers Say They're \"Thriving\"", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,tcbmag.com", "document-issearchable": "true", "document-description": "A new report from McGladrey reflects increasing confidence among Minnesota manufacturers, although it identified challenges as well.", "og": {"url": "http://tcbmag.com/News/Recent-News/2014/June/More-MN-Manufacturers-Say-They-re-Thriving/", "image": "http://tcbmag.com/CMSTemplates/TCB/Images/fb-twin-cities-business.png", "type": "article", "description": "Minnesota\u2019s leading provider of business news, insight, and analysis through a monthly magazine, twice-weekly e-newsletter, daily online news stories, events, and an annual business information guide.", "title": "More MN Manufacturers Say They're \"Thriving\""}, "document-image": "23c36e01-83d1-4e03-8a35-35cea259e1e5", "fb": {"app_id": 385902024814671}, "keywords": "mcgladrey, manufacturing industry, manufacturing jobs, 2014 Manufacturing & Distribution Monitor, manufacturing report", "document-date": "6/26/2014 12:50:32 PM"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca02\"", "article_summary": "Sales grew last year for 74 percent of Minnesota companies, compared to 69 percent nationwide.\nThe McGladrey report echoed some of the findings from Twin Cities Business\u2019 latest quarterly economic indicator survey.\nMore Minnesota manufacturers and distributors now say they are \u201cthriving,\u201d and they\u2019re faring better than many of their U.S. peers\u2014although local companies are more concerned about the impact of government regulations and taxation.\nIn fact, three-quarters of Minnesota manufacturers said they believe regulations and taxes will limit growth more than even competition from other companies.\nThe report is based on survey responses from executives at 920 U.S. manufacturing and distribution firms, including 62 from Minnesota."}
