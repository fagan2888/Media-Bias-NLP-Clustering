(CBS News) Maybe I was thinking about that movie "Dumb and Dumber," but as I watched the disastrous roll-out of Obamacare, coming as it did on the heels of the Republican shutdown of the government, the phrase that kept running through my mind was "worse and worser"

Is "worser" a word? Well, actually, it is, we looked it up! The shutdown was the worst, but this thing is worser.

If we thought the partisan blather couldn't get thicker or sillier than it got during the shutdown, well, we now know.

By now we have heard from all the people whose fault it wasn't. We're heard all the talking points. And some of the critics were all but foaming at the mouth.

It was the Washington we have come to know -- all talk all the time, but at the end of the day, just another example of how government seems incapable of making things better . . . and it never seems to learn.

Does anyone believe that successful start-ups like Amazon or Google would have risked launching their programs before they were properly tested?

There may be a lesson there, if those involved could spend less time refining the talking points and more time actually trying to make things work.

The way this thing is going, it is a good thing we have a word like worser.
