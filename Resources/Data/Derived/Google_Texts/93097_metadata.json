But longtime Representative Vern Ehlers (R-MI) retired in 2010, and Representative Bill Foster (D-IL) returned to the House only last year after losing his one-term seat in 2010.\n\nDespite his background, Holt didn\u2019t play a major role in science legislation, even when the Democrats were the majority party. Instead, he preferred to use his scientific training to inform his views on other major issues, notably banking and education. \u201cHe was one of the most thoughtful people in Congress,\u201d Lubell says, \u201csomeone who could approach decision-making from a fact-based perspective rather than simply politics.\u201d Toward that end, Holt has tried for several years to restore the tiny but well-regarded Office of Technology Assessment, which Republicans eliminated shortly after they seized control of the House in 1995.\n\nIn his ill-fated primary attempt to defeat Cory Booker in a race to succeed the late Senator Frank Lautenberg, Holt billed himself as \u201ca teacher, scientist, and progressive.\u201d In describing his stance on various issues, his campaign website noted that \u201c[i]t\u2019s not rocket science \u2026 just good progressive policy.\u201d\n\nIn a brief statement released today, the 65-year-old Holt left the door open for future bids for public office. \u201cAs friends who have worked with me know, I have never thought that the primary purpose of my work was re-election and I have never intended to make service in the House my entire career,\u201d he declared. \u201cFor a variety of reasons, personal and professional, all of them positive and optimistic, the end of this year seems to me to be the right time to step aside and ask the voters to select the next representative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "news_authors": "Jeffrey Mervis", "description": "Democrat announces retirement after eight terms, shrinking House\u2019s physics caucus by half", "og": {"site_name": "Science | AAAS", "description": "Democrat announces retirement after eight terms, shrinking House\u2019s physics caucus by half", "title": "Rush Holt to Leave Congress", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/rush-holt-leave-congress", "image": {"width": 1280, "secure_url": "https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-holt.jpg?itok=buqAgkkW", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-holt.jpg?itok=buqAgkkW", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2016-01-12T18:46:33-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Democrat announces retirement after eight terms, shrinking House\u2019s physics caucus by half", "title": "Rush Holt to Leave Congress", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/02/rush-holt-leave-congress", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-holt.jpg?itok=buqAgkkW", "height": 720}, "creator": {"identifier": "@NewsfromScience", "id": 17089636}, "site": {"identifier": "@newsfromscience", "id": 17089636}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, index, noodp", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"admins": 1400521805, "app_id": 1478542162442556}, "news_section": "ScienceInsider", "keywords": "science", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ScienceNOW", "published_time": "2014-02-18T15:27:50-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T18:46:33-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no", "news_key_words": "People & Events"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c52\"", "article_summary": "Representative Rush Holt (D-NJ), a plasma physicist, didn\u2019t reveal why he has decided to leave Congress after eight terms, or what lies in his future.\nDespite his background, Holt didn\u2019t play a major role in science legislation, even when the Democrats were the majority party.\nWikimedia Commons/United States CongressOne of two physicists in the U.S. House of Representatives announced today that he is retiring at the end of the year.\nInstead, he preferred to use his scientific training to inform his views on other major issues, notably banking and education.\nHowever, one science lobbyist who knows him well speculates that Holt, who was beaten badly in the Democratic primary last year for an open Senate seat, could still harbor statewide ambitions."}
