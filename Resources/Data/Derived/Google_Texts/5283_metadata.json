They were all interested in learning more about their options for buying coverage on Alaska\u2019s Marketplace. But Longacre \u2013 a Marketplace enrollment specialist \u2013 says none of the potential applicants got very far beyond logging into healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cAnd then the first part is to set up an account, just like any other online resource, we could get through step one and step two and kind of ran into glitches,\u201d Longacre said.\n\nAnchorage Neighborhood Health Clinic has a lot to gain from the marketplace. According to development director Jon Zasada, nearly half of the clinic\u2019s patients are uninsured. He\u2019s hoping to sign up 20 percent of those uninsured patients, about 1,000 people, by March 31, when the open enrollment period closes. Zasada says the marketplace is a huge opportunity for community health centers.\n\n\u201cAnyone that we can add to our patient ranks with insurance just makes our job of ensuring care to everyone in the community a whole lot easier,\u201d he said.\n\nZasada and Longacre were attending a news conference celebrating the marketplace launch at the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. It attracted a glass-half-full kind of crowd. ANTHC\u2019s Valerie Davidson said a few hiccups on the first day were to be expected.\n\n\u201cI remember the very first day the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend program started online enrollment, and let me tell you, there were a few glitches that day,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cBut as the system rolled out and people became more comfortable, folks were able to navigate that system and were able to apply for their permanent fund dividends in time to meet the deadline.\u201d\n\nEnroll Alaska, a company that has two dozen insurance agents ready to help people enroll, had a backlog by the afternoon of about 400 Alaskans who wanted help but couldn\u2019t get it because of the website problems. The federal government estimates about 140,000 Alaskans are uninsured, with nearly half qualifying for subsidies to purchase insurance in the Marketplace. Susan Johnson is the Regional Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. She says there will be plenty of time to sign up.\n\n\u201cWe want people to relax into all this newness because change is hard, this is a new language for most don\u2019t hurry up and get it over with like a shot or something, enjoy the shopping,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCome in, take a look, make sure you get the help you need, talk to people, get informed, think about it, weigh your decisions, don\u2019t rush today, plenty of time.\u201d\n\nWhen I logged into to healthcare.gov around 1 in the afternoon and clicked \u201capply now\u201d a banner appeared across the page that read, \u201cWe have a lot of visitors on our site right now and we\u2019re working to make your experience here better. Thanks for your patience!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the same message Joan Fisher found when she signed onto the site this morning. Fisher is the United Way\u2019s lead navigator for the marketplace.\n\n\u201cI think this is history making. I think it\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nFisher is setting up a small office on the first floor of Providence Hospital in Anchorage where she\u2019ll be able to help sign people up for insurance, but with the healthcare.gov website not working properly and several media interviews, things were off to a slow start.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t even gotten on my computer yet because I haven\u2019t been authorized by Providence,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nFisher and her fellow navigators would like to sign up thousands of Alaskans for insurance in the next six months, but she\u2019s content to settle in for the long haul rather than sprint out of the Oct. 1 starting gate.\n\nFisher says anyone who wants the process to go smoothly should make an appointment with her in a few weeks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "Alaska's federally run health insurance marketplace officially launched on Oct. 1 as part of the Affordable Care Act.
