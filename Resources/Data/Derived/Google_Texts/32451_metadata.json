Across the Southeast, commercial fishery and hatchery production are declining. Shellfish such as crabs appear to be declining, too, and shrimp might be. Research hasn\u2019t been done to see if the acidity is a factor.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know enough,\u201d said Kim Yates, a U.S. Geological Survey oceanographer, in maybe the scariest takeaway from the organizing meeting of the new Southeast Ocean and Coastal Acidification Network, held in Charleston last week.\n\nThe global research based its regional conclusion on worldwide data that included virtually no data from the Atlantic off the Southeast states because so little study has been done here.\n\nThe network plans to pull together \u201cthe state of the science\u201d as it applies to the Southeast, bring in commercial anglers and other interests for their in-the-field observations, then develop plans to prevent the sort of ecosystem collapse that occurred on the West Coast with shellfish, said Debra Hernandez, network director.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just an ocean problem. It\u2019s impacting things right along the coast. We need to figure out how to manage that,\u201d she said.\n\nAcidification is occurring because fossil fuel burning is dropping carbon dioxide in the water, which eventually absorbs nearly one-third of the emissions. Chemical reactions from it leave the water more acidic, depleting shellfish such as shrimp and oysters, as well as \u201cbaseline\u201d creatures: mollusks, phytoplankton and zooplankton that are fed on by food fish for larger species.\n\nThe loss of them would be a potentially catastrophic push in a cascading effect that could deplete the entire food chain, including the food humans eat.\n\nThe lack of diversity in commercially caught marine species makes the $21 million industry in South Carolina very vulnerable to more acidic waters, but there\u2019s no data on what the hazards are here, whether and how species might adapt.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of gaps in the research so far. We can infer what\u2019s happening from other regions. (But) there\u2019s such variability in the chemistry in the water off the Southeast,\u201d said Libby Jewett, Ocean Acidification Program director for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \u201cShellfish make up one-third to one-half the region\u2019s commercial fishery, and we don\u2019t know what the ramifications are.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that experiments such as sea grass planting in the Tampa Bay area have been shown to cut down acidity in the waters, and the differences in the types of estuaries found from North Carolina to Florida make the rest of the region a natural laboratory for such experiments, meeting attendees concurred.\n\nThe biggest obstacle the network might have to overcome is a sometimes skeptical public with other priorities when there is no immediate crisis.\n\n\u201cThe key question is how to get people aware that ocean acidification is part of the package (of marine pollution problems),\u201d said Al George, South Carolina Aquarium conservation director.\n\n\u201cPeople are going to make decisions on what we\u2019re going to do about this,\u201d said Rick DeVoe, South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium director. \u201cIf shellfish beds get shut down, everybody knows there\u2019s something going on and they start paying attention. We have the opportunity to get in front of (the problem) rather than the back end.\u201d\n\nThe network is comprised of scientists, resource managers, business, nonprofit and government entities.
