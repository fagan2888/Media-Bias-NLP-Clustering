His office sends out press released by the boatload every time some Florida business hires two more people. The man takes credit for everything.\n\nHe has tried to stifle voting in Florida, knowing that more Democratic voters will hurt him in 2018,\n\nHe even had problems with online voter registration, which will put more people into the voting rolls. He finally signed the bill, but without much of a smile.\n\nAnd, of course, there is his dance with Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe Florida Senate came up with a compromise health care plan this week, but Scott has already nixed it.\n\nHealth care expansion would help 800,000 Floridians, but Scott doesn\u2019t want it, because it sounds and tastes and smells like Obamacare.\n\nThe man has bashed the president every chance he can get.\n\nHe didn\u2019t even show up when the president was in the Everglades talking about sea level rise and climate change. Our governor, instead, took the day to sue the government over something or other that had to do with Obamacare.\n\nWe are stuck with him for a couple of more years, this man who somehow won two terms because he has more money than he could ever count, and he was running against weak opponents.\n\nYou can bet he\u2019ll run for the Senate in 2018.\n\nRick Scott in Washington. A scary thought, but maybe not as scary as having him in Tallahassee.\n\nWhat do you think? Would like to see Rick Scott as a senator?\n\nGary Stein can be reached at gstein@sunsentinel.com.
