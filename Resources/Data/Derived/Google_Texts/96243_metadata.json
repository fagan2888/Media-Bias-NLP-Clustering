Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate.\n\nBoston philanthropist and power broker Jack Connors recalls being a bit puzzled by the call he got from his state\u2019s senior senator in May 2008.\n\nHe did not consider himself part of Edward M. Kennedy\u2019s inner circle, so when Kennedy started enthusing about his plans for a grand tribute to the U.S. Senate to be built next to his brother\u2019s presidential library, Connors thought: \u201cI wonder why he\u2019s telling me all of this?\u201d\n\nIt turned out Kennedy wanted Connors to head up a massive fundraising operation to bring the project into existence.\n\n\u201cSenator, I have absolutely no idea how to raise $90 million to $100 million, but I have less of an idea how to say no to you,\u201d Connors said. He accepted on the spot.\n\nThree days later, Kennedy suffered a seizure \u2014 the first warning of the brain cancer that would kill him 15 months later.\n\nLate Senator Edward Kennedy . (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nHis idea, however, lived on, and will soon become a reality.\n\nIn about nine months, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate will open next to the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum on Columbia Point in Boston.\n\nThe irony, of course, is that it will launch at a time when few Americans find much to celebrate about the Senate.\n\nIn a recent Gallup poll asking the public\u2019s opinion of 16 major institutions of American society, Congress ranked dead last, with only 7 percent saying they had much confidence in it.\n\nAnd that\u2019s no wonder. These days, it is considered a legislative achievement if the House and Senate can agree to simply keep the government open and avoid a debt default.\n\nKennedy, on the other hand, is considered one of the most accomplished senators ever to serve \u2014 a liberal partisan, but also a pragmatic deal\u00admaker.\n\nIn his 46 years in the chamber, he left his mark on scores of major pieces of legislation, from the Civil Rights Act of 1965 to the Affordable Care Act, which marked the culmination of what he had called \u201cthe cause of my life\u201d but which he did not live to see signed into law.\n\nOn Thursday night at the Newseum, Kennedy\u2019s widow, Victoria, held what she called a \u201cpre-celebration\u201d of the institute.\n\nIt felt more like a reunion. Among those in attendance were about 100 alumni of Kennedy\u2019s highly regarded Senate staff, a dozen or so current and former senators, Supreme Court Justice Stephen G. Breyer and a sprinkling of Kennedy kin.\n\nWhen she asked her husband what he wanted his legacy to be, Vicki Kennedy said, he told her: \u201cI just want people to love the Senate as much as I do.\u201d\n\nThe senator used to joke that his own fingers were too chubby to use a keyboard, but he was fascinated by technology. In the dial-up era 20 years ago, his Senate office launched the first congressional Web page, and he was among the earliest members to accept e-mails from the public. Much the technology that the institute expects to use did not even exist when Kennedy first started planning it in 2002; visitors will be issued digital tablets to guide them through the exhibits. The institute\u2019s centerpiece will be a full-scale replica of the Senate chamber.\n\nThe endeavor has not been without controversy \u2014 or Kennedy family drama.\n\nTwo years ago, the Boston Globe reported that Kennedy\u2019s sons, Ted Jr. and Patrick, believed his widow was \u201cjeopardizing the senator\u2019s legacy and mishandling the creation of the $71 million institute that bears his name.\u201d The paper quoted unnamed sources, \u201cauthorized to speak to the Globe,\u201d who raised questions about the financing and complained that Vicki Kennedy had shut his children out of the planning.\n\nPatrick, a former congressman from Rhode Island who now sits on the board of the institute, was at Thursday\u2019s reception and lavishly praised the endeavor as something that can help return the Senate to its role as \u201cthe last bastion for real debate.\u201d\n\nWatchdog groups have been critical of the fact that much of the institute\u2019s initial funding came from the government, in the form of more than $32 million in earmarks to appropriations bills. The institute\u2019s most recent filing with the Internal Revenue Service, for 2012, showed assets of nearly $90.6 million.\n\nWere it not for Ted Kennedy\u2019s name being attached, federal funding for \u201can institute for the study of the Senate would never have gotten through,\u201d said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\nNot surprisingly, some of the institute\u2019s biggest fans are ex-senators of both parties who worked with Kennedy and feel some nostalgia for a different kind of Senate.\n\nFormer majority leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) joined the board about a year ago.\n\nThe Senate \u201cis reviled, and maybe this will change that\u201d by altering the public\u2019s perception of how it can work, Lott said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to change,\u201d he predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s going to change pretty soon \u2014 because how low can you go?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The senator\u2019s legacy includes an effort to make Americans love the Senate as much as he did.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Karen-Tumulty/1410916925870676", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The senator\u2019s legacy includes an effort to make Americans love the Senate as much as he did.", "title": "Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate intended to remind Americans what lawmaking can look like", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ted-kennedys-bricks-and-mortar-legacy-taking-shape/2014/06/20/fda99120-f7f6-11e3-8aa9-dad2ec039789_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/06/20/Others/Images/2014-06-19/STkennedy67161403233745.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ktumulty"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ted-kennedys-bricks-and-mortar-legacy-taking-shape/2014/06/20/fda99120-f7f6-11e3-8aa9-dad2ec039789_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "edward m. kennedy, ted kennedy, teddy kennedy, victoria kennedy, vicki kennedy, edward m. kennedy institute, ted kennedy senator, senate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Karen-Tumulty/1410916925870676"}, "news_keywords": "edward m. kennedy, ted kennedy, teddy kennedy, victoria kennedy, vicki kennedy, edward m. kennedy institute, ted kennedy senator, senate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "fda99120-f7f6-11e3-8aa9-dad2ec039789"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10f4\"", "article_summary": "A recent reception was held at the Newseum to celebrate the coming Edward M.
