In this town where police fired 10 shots at unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown and struck him six times, apparently while his hands were up, a homemade sign said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot! Black men are people, too!\u201d Others carried signs insisting that \u201cBlack life matters.\u201d\n\nOn Staten Island, those protesting the chokehold-killing of Eric Garner by a white cop voiced the same theme. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m marching is because it\u2019s time for people of color to be recognized as human beings,\u201d 63-year-old Shirley Evans told the Daily News. \u201cFor years and years, we\u2019ve been fighting for our rights. It\u2019s time we\u2019re seen as equals.\u201d\n\nA human being has the right to not be gunned down by the police for \u201cblocking traffic,\u201d and then be left rotting in the sun for four hours. A human being has the right to not be choked to death for \u201cresisting arrest\u201d for allegedly selling loose cigarettes \u2013 despite repeated pleas that he can\u2019t breathe.\n\nBut other basic rights are also required to sustain human life \u2013 like access to water. When Detroit\u2019s Dept. of Water and Sewage systematically shut off the water of more than 125,000 of its poorest residents \u2013 some of whom owed as little as $150 on their bills \u2013 the UN found that the shutoffs were a basic violation of human rights.\n\n\u201cThese are my fellow human beings,\u201d Detroiter Renla Session told the Detroit News. \u201cIf they threatened to cut off water to an animal shelter, you would see thousands of people out here. It\u2019s senseless\u2026. They just treat people like their lives mean nothing here in Detroit, and I\u2019m tired of it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Detroit businesses still had access to clean water, despite the fact that 55 percent of those businesses had past-due water bills. The corporate debtors included the Chrysler Group, real estate firms and a golf-course management company that owed nearly half a million dollars, but businesses were not included when the shut-offs began.\n\nThis would seem to be in keeping with Mitt Romney\u2019s famous rejoinder \u2014 in an echo of the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling \u2014 that \u201ccorporations are people.\u201d But apparently not all people are people.\n\n* * *\n\nThe denial of black humanity takes many forms. A police officer in a nearby town declared that the Ferguson protesters \u201cshould be put down like a rabid dog.\u201d Another suburban cop, on duty in Ferguson during the protests, pointed his rifle in protesters\u2019 faces and yelled, \u201cI will fucking kill you.\u201d After both incidents received news coverage, the two men were obliged to leave their jobs \u2014 but these and similar incidents raise questions about the institutional culture they reflect.\n\nCertainly in Ferguson, those protesting Brown\u2019s killing were treated by the police as an inhuman entity, en masse. The use of armored vehicles, tear gas, plastic bullets, threatening tactics and unconstitutional arrests sent a clear message: If you express your anger and your grief, you put your freedom \u2013 and maybe your life \u2013 at risk. The freedom of speech that the Supreme Court has guaranteed to corporations and the wealthy was not extended to the protesters in Ferguson.\n\nFerguson\u2019s black residents live in fear of the police in part because the police force has 50 white officers and three black ones, patrolling a community where 67 percent of the residents are black. Not surprisingly, blacks make up 86 percent of police stops, according to a racial profiling report from Missouri\u2019s attorney general.\n\nThese inequalities highlight the fact that the Mike Brown or Eric Garner killings aren\u2019t just caused by the individual bigotry or hot temper of one \u201cbad apple\u201d cop. They reflect structural inequities that run deep throughout U.S. society and history.\n\nFour miles south of Ferguson is the burial place of Dred Scott, the slave who in 1857 sued for his freedom and lost. He lies in Calvary Cemetery on West Florissant Avenue \u2013 the same street that, up in Ferguson, has been the center of protests since Mike Brown was killed. In rejecting Scott\u2019s claim to freedom, the Supreme Court\u2019s Chief Justice wrote, \u201cA free negro of the African race, whose ancestors were brought to this country and sold as slaves, is not a \u2018citizen\u2019 within the meaning of the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Lest we forget, African-Americans\u2019 slave ancestors were described in the U.S. Constitution as \u201cthree-fifths\u201d of a person.\n\nOne hundred fifty-seven years after Dred Scott lost his case, and 156 years after his death, the bruising effects of the country\u2019s racist history are evident throughout the structures of American society. That history has shaped institutions that deprive black Americans of the political power to shape their future, or the resources they need to do so.\n\nFerguson and Detroit are both places where a largely black community is run by a white power structure. In Detroit, Republican Governor Rick Snyder appointed Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr to replace elected officials; a new white mayor, Mike Duggan, now runs the city with an emphasis on what sociologist Thomas Sugrue calls \u201ctrickle-down urbanism,\u201d a focus on selective gentrification that excludes jobs for working-class residents.\n\nIn Ferguson, the police chief is white, the mayor is white, and five of the six city council members are white. Moreover, the district where Michael Brown attended high school, in which almost all students are black, is controlled by a white, out-of-state Republican.\n\nUnequal political power perpetuates unequal access to resources. The largely poor and black residents of Ferguson and Detroit both contend with shrinking city services that impede daily life, abysmal job prospects, punitive social-welfare policies, and underfunded school systems. An acute example of this phenomenon is seen in the high school from which Michael Brown graduated, which had only two cap-and-gown sets for its graduates, who had to take turns wearing them to pose for graduation pictures.\n\nDetroit has been subject to public disinvestment for decades. The water shutoff this summer was the culmination of years of statewide cuts in public spending, a consequence of anti-tax politics that were significantly fueled by racial animus. From Reagan\u2019s fables about \u201cwelfare queens\u201d and Cadillacs to Lee Atwater\u2019s infamous \u201cWillie Horton\u201d ad, white resentments and fear have been used for decades to consolidate a policy of shrinking the public budget. As was dramatically clear when Katrina hit New Orleans, it\u2019s a policy that hurts African-Americans the most, even as it injures the public as a whole.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Michael Brown, Eric Garner, John Crawford: The past few months have seen tragedy after tragedy.
