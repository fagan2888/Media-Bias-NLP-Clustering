What was unthinkable a few months ago no longer is. Trump\u2019s durability in national polls and his standing in the early states have forced GOP leaders \u2014 and all his rivals \u2014 to confront the possibility that the New York billionaire and reality TV star could end up leading the party into the fall campaign against the Democrats.\n\nAnd the fact-checkers have more than enough lies to debunk. Glenn Kessler and Michelle Ye Hee Lee at The Washington Post:\n\n\u201cWe have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.\u201d \u2013Cruz The labor participation rate fell to 62.4 percent in September, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the lowest since 1977, when it touched 62.3 percent. (The rate inched up to 62.6 percent in December.) When Obama took office in January, 2009, the workforce participation rate was 65.7 percent. So there has certainly been a decline. But the rate had already been on a steady downward track since it hit a high of 67.3 percent in the last year of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. A key reason? The composition of the labor force has been affected by the retirement of the leading edge of the Baby Boom generation.\n\nAnd CNN fact checked as well:\n\nReality Check: Rubio says Obamacare is a certified job killer By Tami Luhby and Kate Grise, CNN Rubio said that Obamacare is \"a certified job killer.\" In fact, Obamacare is not a job killer, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September 2015.\n\nAs did Robert Burns and Calvin Woodward at the AP:\n\nIn their rush to slam the Obama administration, play up their records and play down inconvenient realities, Republican presidential candidates served up some misshapen rhetoric in their latest presidential debate. CRUZ: Any country that makes U.S. service members get on their knees like the 10 sailors whose boats were boarded and seized by the Iranian military this week \"will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America.\" CHRIS CHRISTIE: \"Tin pot dictators ... are taking our Navy ships.\" THE FACTS: Neither candidate addressed the fact that the short-lived crisis was created by the U.S. sailors who steered their boats into sovereign Iranian waters, where they were boarded and seized by Iranian naval forces. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said Thursday that the U.S. sailors had made a navigation error. Under such circumstances it would not be unusual to disarm members of a foreign military force \u2014 even a small one like the two Navy boats \u2014 and hold them temporarily for questioning. What was exceptional about this episode \u2014 and perhaps a provocation \u2014 is that the Iranians videotaped the Americans during the encounter and posted the images on the Internet.\n\nAnd The New York Times joined in on debunking lies:\n\nGov. Chris Christie said he did not support President Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the United States Supreme Court. You can't take it back. [...] Asked about his proposal for a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't even know where the 45 percent came from.\" From his own mouth.\n\nOn a final note, Steven Stromberg writes about how negative the tone was:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "We begin today\u2019s roundup with Frank Bruni\u2019s summary of yesterday\u2019s Republican debate: \r\n\r\n \r\n Remember that phase of the campaign when Ted Cruz spoke no ill of Donald Trump, who returned the favor?", "title": "Abbreviated pundit roundup: GOP debate showcases failed policies, bad ideas and lies", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/1/15/1470211/-Abbreviated-pundit-roundup-GOP-debate-showcases-failed-policies-bad-ideas-and-lies", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/196108/story_image/apr.jpg?1452862367", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "We begin today\u2019s roundup with Frank Bruni\u2019s summary of yesterday\u2019s Republican debate:\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember that phase of the campaign when Ted Cruz spoke no ill of Donald Trump, who returned the favor?\r\n\r...", "title": "Abbreviated pundit roundup: GOP debate showcases failed policies, bad ideas and lies", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/196108/story_image/apr.jpg?1452862367"}, "creator": "@glogothetis", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "article_summary": "The composition of the labor force has been affected by the retirement of the leading edge of the Baby Boom generation.\nAnd CNN fact checked as well:Reality Check: Rubio says Obamacare is a certified job killer By Tami Luhby and Kate Grise, CNN Rubio said that Obamacare is \"a certified job killer.\"\nIn fact, Obamacare is not a job killer, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September 2015.\nChris Christie said he did not support President Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the United States Supreme Court.\nAnd the fact-checkers have more than enough lies to debunk."}
