Throughout those 24 hours, 24 lacrosse teams from the region played hourly games. Stange kicked off each game with a rendition of the anthem.\n\nCpl Oneill, Ryan \u2013 USMC holding our flag.

Posted by National Anthem Girl on Friday, July 31, 2015\n\nThe charity, which was founded by a group of Maryland high school students in 2012, has raised close to one million dollars since its inception. This weekend the group brought in $23,975.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m honored and humbled to do it,\u201d Stange told The Daily Signal.\n\nThe event began Friday evening in Dana Point, California, and continued through the night. Stange\u2019s last notes rang out on Saturday night, August 1st, the same day Francis Scott Key wrote the lyrics to the poem-turned-anthem in 1814.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited that this is an event that is fully dedicated to benefiting our soldiers,\u201d Stange said. \u201cIt\u2019s because [of those soldiers that] we are free to do these things.\u201d\n\nAn American flag was held by a veteran or an active military member each time Stange sang. Stange plans to auction off the flag on eBay, donating all proceeds of the sale to the Gary Sinise Foundation, an organization benefiting wounded military members.\n\n#20 Lance Crafton SGT, USMC Posted by National Anthem Girl on Saturday, August 1, 2015\n\nStange has 49 additional flags she plans to auction over time, donating the funds to various organizations that \u201cembody the meaning of the national anthem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a country, when we sing [the anthem] for 90 seconds, no matter who we voted for or what team we want to win, we are united,\u201d Stange said. \u201cWe are one. That\u2019s what we need now more than ever.\u201d\n\nSince completing her two-year stint singing the anthem in all 50 states last summer, Stange has continued to travel the country, singing and speaking at events.\n\n\u201cI never thought in a million years I\u2019d be doing this, but I see a need for it,\u201d she said.\n\nStange is currently in the process of writing a book for young girls about her experiences traveling the country.\n\n\u201cThis song is not my song, it\u2019s our song,\u201d Stange said. \u201cEspecially with the elections and all the turmoil in the world in general\u2026I will keep doing this to do my part.\u201d\n\nStange, who started out her singing career at lacrosse games, spent the last week preparing for the event.\n\n\u201cThis is not even a big deal compared to what our brave men and women go through and sacrifice,\u201d Stange said. \u201cIf I feel a little tired, I think of them and continue on.\u201d\n\nStange said that each time she sings, she looks to the audience and focuses on someone who is clearly either a veteran or an active-duty military member.\n\n\u201cI love to look at them,\u201d Stange said. \u201cThey are always 100-percent focused on the song. They are singing. They\u2019re looking at the flag. And I am sure they are pulling from memory their own personal experience.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Janine Stange sang the anthem 24 times in 24 hours to raise funds for wounded vets this past weekend.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Janine Stange sang the anthem 24 times in 24 hours to raise funds for wounded vets this past weekend.", "title": "'National Anthem Girl' Sings 24 Times in 24 Hours for Charity", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150803_NationalAnthemGirl.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-03T14:06:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KLXNPu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Janine Stange sang the anthem 24 times in 24 hours to raise funds for wounded vets this past weekend.", "title": "'National Anthem Girl' Sings 24 Times in 24 Hours for Charity", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150803_NationalAnthemGirl.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "veterans", "published_time": "2015-08-03T11:13:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T14:06:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cf5\"", "article_summary": "This past weekend, the Los Angeles resident sang the national anthem 24 times in 24 hours.\nPosted by National Anthem Girl on Friday, July 31, 2015The charity, which was founded by a group of Maryland high school students in 2012, has raised close to one million dollars since its inception.\n\u201cThis song is not my song, it\u2019s our song,\u201d Stange said.\nThroughout those 24 hours, 24 lacrosse teams from the region played hourly games.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited that this is an event that is fully dedicated to benefiting our soldiers,\u201d Stange said."}
