In a massive, far-reaching 571-page report to the federal agency in charge of ObamaCare \u2014 the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \u2014 the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) details how it proposes to \u201ctransform\u201d America\u2019s food system.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe expansive mission sounds as though it fits right in with Barack Obama\u2019s early and prophetic promise to \u201cfundamentally transform America.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reports that among the many sweeping proposals to overhaul the country\u2019s food production and consumption patterns and programs are calls for \u201cthe adoption of \u2018plant-based\u2019 diets, taxes on dessert, trained obesity \u2018interventionists\u2019 at worksites, and electronic monitoring of how long Americans sit in front of the television.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the proposed guidelines \u2014 which are significant because they are used as the basis for government food assistance programs and nutrition education \u2014 call for people to radically change their eating habits to help combat global warming.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nOf course, many skeptics doubt that human activity has much, if any, real impact on the earth\u2019s temperature patterns or long-term climate.\n\nStill, this powerful federal committee responsible for nutrition guidelines and how they interact with government healthcare initiatives, tax policies, and behavioral preferences doesn\u2019t take into consideration any doubts about the threat of global warming.\n\nConsequently, the government committee is recommending that people eat less meat so that fewer cows, pigs, chickens, and turkeys are raised. The recommendations to cut back on meat consumption would, supposedly, serve the greater interest of maximizing \u201cenvironmental sustainability\u201d to reduce problems from climate change.\n\n\u201cThe major findings regarding sustainable diets were that a diet higher in plant-based foods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact than is the current U.S. diet,\u201d DGAC said.
