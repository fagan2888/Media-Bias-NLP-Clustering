Boulder County authorities recovered the body of a 22-year-old hiker near the Gregory Canyon trailhead Sunday.

Two hikers reported finding the body of a climber who had fallen, the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release.

The body was found below a rock formation known as the Fifth Pinnacle. The man was climbing without any protective equipment and fell about 98 feet. Authorities believe he fell Saturday.

The man was reported missing Sunday after he failed to return Saturday night as expected.

The Boulder County Coroner is conducting an autopsy and will release the man’s name after notifying relatives.
