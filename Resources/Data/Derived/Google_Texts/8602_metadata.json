But can\u2019t Google simply roll out a Twitch copycat on YouTube? It won\u2019t be easy, say gaming experts.\n\nYouTube would seem to have plenty of built-in advantages that would make it relatively easy for the site to build a big audience for live video game streaming. For one thing, YouTube boasts one billion monthly users. The site is also highly social in nature.\n\nPlus, according to the analytics firm OpenSlate, 23% of the ad-supported content on YouTube is related to gaming, and there is a plethora of recorded video game play on the site. Just look at the biggest YouTube channel, PewDiePie, which features the Swedish creator Felix Kjellberg playing and commenting on video games for over 30 million subscribers.\n\nStill, even if it wanted to, YouTube couldn\u2019t just flip a switch and start its own Twitch. One big hurdle is that it specializes in on-demand videos, while Twitch is known for live streaming. YouTube has tried its hand at building out a live viewing experience,\n\n\u201cGoogle has tried for a few years,\u201d said Peer Schneider, co-founder of the gaming reviews site IGN. \u201cYouTube is live streaming enabled. But for gamers to use it, it\u2019s not trivial easy or turnkey like Twitch.\u201d\n\nGoogle declined to comment.\n\nAs Mr. Schneider explained, because Twitch is an application that is often weaved seamlessly into the interfaces of gaming platforms, it\u2019s easy for gamers to record what they are playing, share it with others live, and invite viewers to chime in. That\u2019s all technically possible with YouTube, but it\u2019s more complicated and \u201cnot everybody has that knowledge about how to do all that,\u201d he said.\n\nYouTube right now acts as sort of the on-demand version of Twitch for video game enthusiasts. Mr. Schneider pointed to the reams of instructional game videos on the site, often grouped under the label \u201cLet\u2019s Play.\u201d\n\nYouTube had looked to court live video game players a few years ago, said Machinima CEO Chad Gutstein. \u201cWe were very involved,\u201d he said. But since Mr. Gutstein took the reigns of the video game-centric programmer last March, live content on YouTube \u201cis not something I\u2019ve spent much time on.\u201d\n\nWhy might YouTube be less focused on live gaming? Well, because right now Google is focused on bigger fish, namely trying to convince big advertisers to shift TV ad budgets to Web video.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not a focus for them,\u201d said Sundance DiGiovanni, co-founder and CEO of the professional video game organization Major League Gaming. \u201cI think Google and YouTube are focused on businesses of scale. There\u2019s not really an opportunity to form a new gaming platform within this giant platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad they really put time into it they could have competed [with Twitch] but it never seemed like a priority,\u201d Mr. DiGiovanni added.\n\nMr. DiGiovanni says YouTube\u2019s huge size is an issue \u2014 a Twitch-competitor might get lost among its many channels and millions of video streams.\n\n\u201cWhat has worked with Twitch is that it\u2019s dedicated to a single purpose,\u201d said David Gibbons, Vice President of Marketing at Ustream, another live streaming platform. \u201cTwitch offers the commentary, the high resolution streaming, all the things gamers want. YouTube has channels. They\u2019ve shown no willingness to create a dedicated portal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat people love about Twitch is that it\u2019s this grass roots thing for them,\u201d added Mr. Schneider.\n\nSo it may not be so easy for YouTube to reproduce something like Twitch\u2013just like it\u2019s not so easy for another company, like say Yahoo or Amazon, to instantly launch a YouTube competitor, as so many have speculated about. More often, the next giant social platform or app comes from an entrepreneur, not a big company.\n\nSome in the industry think Twitch could be even bigger than just a gamer site. \u201cI think that\u2019s just the beginning of what\u2019s possible,\u201d said Mr. Gutstein. Machinima has already begun experimenting with live series programming on Twitch, and Mr. Gutstein sees potential for other genres to thrive\u2013such as entertainment-oriented fare.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019ve heard about this generation of young consumers is that they\u2019ll only watch on-demand programming and never watch anything live ever again,\u201d he said. \u201cBut look at what Twitch has done. They\u2019ve gotten millions of millennials to watch live content.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "[wsj-ticker ticker=\"GOOGL\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Google\" postfix=\"\"]", "title": "Why It Won\u2019t Be Easy For Google To Launch a Twitch Killer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/08/27/why-it-wont-be-easy-for-google-to-launch-a-twitch-killer/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EG220_twitch_P_20140825135558.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Why It Won\u2019t Be Easy For Google To Launch a Twitch Killer", "description": "[wsj-ticker ticker=\"GOOGL\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Google\" postfix=\"\"]", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Mike Shields", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "[wsj-ticker ticker=\"GOOGL\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Google\" postfix=\"\"]", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-27T17:55:56-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/08/27/why-it-wont-be-easy-for-google-to-launch-a-twitch-killer/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-1459", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "[wsj-ticker ticker=\"GOOGL\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Google\" postfix=\"\"]", "title": "Why It Won\u2019t Be Easy For Google To Launch a Twitch Killer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/08/27/why-it-wont-be-easy-for-google-to-launch-a-twitch-killer/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EG220_twitch_P_20140825135558.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-1459", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-27T17:56:09-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a9d\"", "article_summary": "One big hurdle is that it specializes in on-demand videos, while Twitch is known for live streaming.\nGoogle either opted not to buy Twitch, or got outbid by Amazon, which this week agreed to acquire the live video game-streaming site for close to $1 billion.\nYouTube right now acts as sort of the on-demand version of Twitch for video game enthusiasts.\nYouTube would seem to have plenty of built-in advantages that would make it relatively easy for the site to build a big audience for live video game streaming.\n\u201cWhat has worked with Twitch is that it\u2019s dedicated to a single purpose,\u201d said David Gibbons, Vice President of Marketing at Ustream, another live streaming platform."}
