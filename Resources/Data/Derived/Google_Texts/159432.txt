Health care has lagged retail services by a wide margin when it comes to customer engagement. Part of the reason is historical — the U.S. health care model typically relied on employers as the decision makers.

But with the introduction of health-care exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, consumers now have the transparency and responsibility to make decisions for their well-being.

As this trend –known in the industry as “consumerism”—accelerates, private equity firms have decided to come along for the ride, as we report in this month’s issue of Private Equity Analyst.

Firms like General Atlantic, H.I.G. Capital and Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe have made investments in client-facing urgent care centers, which cater to patients whose conditions aren’t serious enough to warrant a visit to emergency rooms.

But consumerism also opens up a whole host of other investment opportunities for private equity.

Genstar in 2010 acquired Netsmart Technologies Inc., which provides software that helps mental health and substance abuse treatment agencies and psychiatric hospitals with electronic health records and data analytics.

Meanwhile, Baird Capital backed Myelin Health Communications Inc., which helps health-care service providers with branding.

“Providers historically viewed advertising as unnecessary,” said Michael Bernstein, a Baird Capital partner. That’s because up to this point, “insurers, employers and managed-care organizations made the decisions for employees and members about which health-care providers they are going to be able to access.”

“We are in the early, early innings of consumerism,” said Roman Margolin, a principal at Genstar Capital. “This purchasing dynamic is going to continue in the next three to four years.”
