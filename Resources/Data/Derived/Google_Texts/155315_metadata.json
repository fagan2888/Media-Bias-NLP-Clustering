What\u2019s not to like? At 44, he\u2019s the youngest candidate running of any party. He\u2019s Cuban, eschewing familiar party demographic traditions. He\u2019s quite hip, enjoying the Wu-Tang Clan and watching Netflix. He has also cited Minecraft in anti-Common Core speeches and endorsed Uber, displaying his better-than-average flair among many of his co-workers for millennial-oriented technology.\n\nCasino mogul Sheldon Adelson is strongly considering an endorsement, and with that a ballpark donation of $100 million, in keeping with the sums of his past preferred candidates.\n\nBut some people are not as keen on the Florida senator, specifically the population he\u2019s supposed to draw votes from. Rubio\u2019s main folly from the Hispanic electorate: inconsistent, vague stances on immigration.\n\nFollowing the failure of the bipartisan, 1,198-page \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill he helped to co-sponsor, Rubio has since renounced his past views, which included a 10-year path to a green card and citizenship three years later. Instead, he is now advocating a piecemeal approach to dole out certain provisions from the bill over an unspecified period of time. I\u2019m guessing he hasn\u2019t mentioned specifics simply because he doesn\u2019t know.\n\nIf he wins the Republican primary, then he can\u2019t run for the Senate, and if he loses the presidential race, then his political career is in a bit of a jam. It\u2019s hard to predict things when the future is so tenuous.\n\nThe piecemeal strategy certainly makes sense, though. By initially acquiescing to his party and securing the border, he can then address Democratic concerns about a reliable way to citizenship. Retrospectively, the Gang of Eight bill was too massive for Congress to properly digest; if something like the Affordable Care Act evidenced anything, it\u2019s that our legislators don\u2019t like expansive overhauls of current systems, regardless of their current functionality or lack thereof.\n\nThat said, it is Rubio\u2019s lack of specificity with his immigration plan that grates on the Latin American constituency so. Alfonso Aguilar, a former immigration official under George W. Bush and executive director of the American Principle Project\u2019s Latino Partnership, told Politico this: \u201c(An unspecific immigration plan) is the kind of sloppiness that I think opens the door for a lot of people, Democrats in a general election, to question if he\u2019s really committed to immigration reform.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Rubio\u2019s spokesperson, Alex Conant, declined to specify how Rubio would consider a border secure or how long the entire process would take under his hypothetical presidency. I can\u2019t fathom how anybody would expect to know something like this before they\u2019re even in a presidential race, but the Hispanic electorate still wants to be appeased with a more substantial answer, considering what a relevant issue it will always be.\n\nAnother issue worth highlighting is Rubio\u2019s nationality, and how it actually speaks to the Hispanic bloc at large. (This technically applies to Ted Cruz, too, although he hasn\u2019t given the Hispanic voters any reason to consider him.) As the son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio and his parents experienced a drastically different and ultimately easier transition to a steady American life.\n\nIn short, under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966, Cuban defectors who successfully evaded the U.S. Coast Guard, stepped on the shores of Florida and stayed there for at least a year were granted a green card and put on a fast track to citizenship in what is called the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy. Contrast that with Mexico or any other Hispanic country, and it\u2019s just not that simple.\n\nSince the U.S. and Cuba recently resumed diplomatic relations, there is talk of amending the bill to not include this stipulation. Overall, Rubio\u2019s immigration experience does not represent the broader Hispanic constituency and speaks to the Republican Party\u2019s unfair homogenizing of Latin Americans.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s another Republican establishment candidate from Florida with Latin American ties that is beating Rubio in the polls within this bloc. Jeb Bush considers children of illegal immigrants to have earned citizenship. He also has a plan to grant legal status to undocumented workers once meeting criteria such as learning English and paying back taxes. Sometimes being of a similar ethnic background as a group of voters isn\u2019t enough.
