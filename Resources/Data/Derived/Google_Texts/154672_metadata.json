He did not get high grades in high school. He considers himself lucky to have gained entrance into the Durango, Colorado liberal arts college, where he earned a B.A. in Sociology. Campbell said he also struggled in his first year of college, but he did well in his second, third and fourth years.\n\nAfter college, he did not know what he wanted to do for work. Thanks to his persistent mother, who must have seen a lawyer in him, Campbell took the Law School Admissions Test. But he did not study hard enough, and his scores reflected that. Campbell knew the upper-echelon law schools would never take him, so he applied at the lower-tier schools. They did not want him either.\n\nIn 2005, he received a flyer for the Pre-Law Summer Institute for American Indians and Alaska Natives, offered at the American Indian Law Center (AILC) in Albuquerque. He called the AILC yet was told the deadline had passed. \u201cThey asked me to send my application anyway, and I got in,\u201d he said.\n\nCampbell describes the two-month program, which replicates the first year of law school, as \u201cintense,\u201d and it attracts recruiters from law schools all over the country. Not only did he do well, but he was also wooed by recruiters from three different law schools. Campbell ended up enrolling at Sandra Day O\u2019Connor College of Law at Arizona State University in Tempe. In addition to his J.D., obtained in spring 2008, he holds an Indian Legal Certificate, with an environmental emphasis.\n\nAfter law school. Campbell served as a law clerk at the Arizona Court of Appeals in Phoenix. About a year later, he took an attorney position at Cuddy & McCarthy, LLP, a Native American firm in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he worked on cases related to the environment, the Indian Child Welfare Act, voting rights, and other issues.\n\nCampbell sent his resume to NARF in 2012 in pursuit of a boarding school staff attorney vacancy. That was the job he interviewed for at the organization\u2019s headquarters. But when NARF called him after the interview, it was to tell him he did not get that position; rather, it had him in mind for an education attorney position that had recently become vacant. Campbell, who understood how prestigious NARF is and how rarely it hires lawyers due to low turnover, did not need time to think about it. \u201cI pretty much accepted on the spot,\u201d he said.\n\nSince reporting to work in March 2013, Campbell has been busy working on a variety of court cases and projects. For example, on behalf of the National Congress of American Indians, he drafted a brief for the Jim Thorpe \u201crepatriation\u201d appeal; and on behalf of tribes in Arizona and southern Utah, he wrote a brief for a case involving the U.S. Secretary of Interior\u2019s withdrawal of one million acres surrounding the Grand Canyon from uranium mining to protect sacred sites. He also has worked on implementation of NARF\u2019s Sacred Places Project and advocated for a water rights settlement.\n\nAs an education attorney, Campbell represents Tribal Education Departments National Assembly to advocate for federal policy changes and developing and promoting education forums. He has also worked on some eagle feathers at graduation cases.\n\nFor Campbell, who is married to Annette Campbell, an attorney at the National American Indian Court Judges Association, and the father of a two-year-old son, Eli, working at NARF comes with huge rewards, and securing victories for his clients is one of them. Bigger than that, he said, \u201cWhen you are in law school and you are a Native student, you are so interested in Indian law and Native issues. I get to work at NARF, and, well, that is pretty much all that we do. Just being able to work here is very rewarding. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Working for the Native American Rights Fund was never in Matthew Campbell\u2019s wildest dreams following a rocking school path, but dreams do come true.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/06/14/matt-campbell-works-dream-job-narf-160688", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/matt_campbell1.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Matt Campbell Works the Dream Job at NARF"}, "abstract": "Working for the Native American Rights Fund was never in Matthew Campbell\u2019s wildest dreams following a rocking school path, but dreams do come true.", "dc": {"title": "Matt Campbell Works the Dream Job at NARF"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/06/14/matt-campbell-works-dream-job-narf-160688", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Matt Campbell, Native American Rights Fund, NARF, Alaska Native Village of Gambell, Pre-Law Summer Institute for American Indians and Alaska Natives, American Indian Law Center, AILC, Indian Child Welfare Act, National Congress of American Indians, NCAI, Jim Thorpe Repatriation Appeal, NARF\u2019s Sacred Places Project, Tribal Education Departments National Assembly", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-06-14T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Matt Campbell Works the Dream Job at NARF"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4d4b\"", "article_summary": "Thanks to his persistent mother, who must have seen a lawyer in him, Campbell took the Law School Admissions Test.\nAs an education attorney, Campbell represents Tribal Education Departments National Assembly to advocate for federal policy changes and developing and promoting education forums.\nIn 2005, he received a flyer for the Pre-Law Summer Institute for American Indians and Alaska Natives, offered at the American Indian Law Center (AILC) in Albuquerque.\nBigger than that, he said, \u201cWhen you are in law school and you are a Native student, you are so interested in Indian law and Native issues.\nCampbell sent his resume to NARF in 2012 in pursuit of a boarding school staff attorney vacancy."}
