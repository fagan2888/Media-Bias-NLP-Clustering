Terry Branstad in Iowa Saturday night, the Wisconsin congressman bemoaned the 2012 defeat in a dull and, at times, awkward speech that failed to extract the rapturous reaction one would expect for a rising star or potential 2016 presidential candidate.\n\nPerhaps the crowd caught a bit of the 2012 bug Ryan was still carrying.\n\n\u201cWe were in a funk for a good six months because we made mistakes,\u201d he acknowledged, adding that it was \u201cobviously very frustrating.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think one of the problems that Mitt and I had was we were arguing against big government in theory We had to campaign against big government in theory,\u201d he argued, noting that most of the provisions of Obamacare and Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t begin getting implemented until 2013. \u201dHere\u2019s the difference now, we\u2019ve got big government in practice. And what we are realizing is that the results are nothing close to what was used to sell it,\u201d he argued.\n\nObama carried Iowa by 5 points.\n\n\u201cNext time you have a famous politician coming through Iowa, breezing through the towns, talking about big government, let\u2019s be a little more skeptical,\u201d Ryan said, as if the mostly Republican audience he was speaking to had voted to reelect the president.\n\nThe visit marked Ryan\u2019s first stop to the Hawkeye State since 2012. For most of this year, Ryan has made few moves that would telegraph he\u2019s plotting a White House campaign, instead focusing on governing. He\u2019s been tasked by Republicans to try to hammer out a budget agreement by Dec. 13.\n\nRyan took several shots at the widespread problems plaguing the health care law and prodded GOP activists to defeat Rep. Bruce Braley in the 2014 Senate race as punishment for his vote on the legislation. Yet in a rare forward-looking snippet of the speech, he said Republicans must show Americans that they are \u201cnot just the opposition party, but the proposition party.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Branstad, Ryan name-checked and thanked Rep. Tom Latham and Sen. Chuck Grassley but did not mention Rep. Steve King, the most vocally conservative member of the delegation.\n\n\u201cMaybe we should come back and do this more often. People are really friendly here,\u201d Ryan said, in a hint that was clearly meant to signal he\u2019s keeping the presidential door open.\n\nHe could\u2019ve used a few more friendly folks in the room tonight.\n\nFollow Dave\u2019s blog at TheRun2016.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan admitted it took him a good six months to get over his loss to President Obama and VP Biden.
