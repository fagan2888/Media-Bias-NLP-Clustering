ACOs are charged with being accountable for both the cost and quality of care for a defined group of patients. Under risk-based, value-based payment models that reward achieving cost and outcomes of care, provider organizations have incentives to keep people well. While early evidence on ACOs is somewhat mixed, it seems sufficiently encouraging to fuel continued growth.\n\nA major lesson to date is that delivery system provider organizations cannot do it themselves. To effectively work with high-cost, highly complex, chronically ill patients requires outreach to an array of community and social services resources including education, housing, transportation and public health, among others. This exposure to cross-sector organizations that can help manage illness is also generating a larger vision of improving health for the population at large \u2014 the population beyond a delivery system\u2019s current patients, enrollees or service area. To constrain the rate of growth in costs, and improve population health and patient experience, will require the creation of accountable communities for health (ACHs), also called accountable care communities.\n\nAccountable communities for health are cross-sector organizations that come together to form a governance body or \u201cintegrator\u201d entity with the skills and resources to accept responsibility for allocating resources to maintain and improve the health of an entire identified population of community residents. ACHs emphasize the role played by the social determinants of health. They may initially focus, for example, on lowering the incidence of new cases of diabetes in the population or reducing the percentage of children and adults who are obese. Potential funding sources come not only from existing payers and providers \u2014 through community benefit requirements, for example \u2014 but also from local foundations and social investors to create \u201cwellness funds.\u201d\n\nWhat can hospital and health systems do to spread ACHs? (1) Use their resources and influence to highlight the importance of building communities in which all people can lead healthy, productive lives. (2) Eliminate the considerable waste still existing in medical care delivery to free up resources that can be redeployed to upstream activities that address underlying behavioral, environmental and social determinants of health. (3) Use financial capital to increase the community\u2019s social capital through the development of effective partnerships with public health, education, housing, transportation and related organizations that influence the community\u2019s health. (4) Use electronic health record and data analysis capabilities to promote linkages with other sectors\u2019 data and create a dashboard to track progress on population health indicators. (5) Support implementation of all-payer claims databases to raise the transparency of data and information so all parties are aware of opportunities to improve performance. (6) Promote and participate in national initiatives to improve population health, such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2019s \u201cCulture of Health\u201d undertaking.\n\nIn the business world, value (and job security) is provided by satisfying the customer. The customer is changing from the sick patient to the healthy individual within the context of a community that supports health and well-being. No longer will value (or job security) be provided by primarily \u201cfixing up\u201d people. Increasingly, value (and job security) will be provided by working with others to keep people well. In most communities, hospital and health system leadership will be key to achieving this vision for a healthier and more productive country.\n\nStephen M.

The six principles provide a framework for physicians and hospitals that choose to create an integrated leadership structure but are unsure how to best achieve the engagement and alignment necessary to collaboratively prioritize patient care and resource management.\n\nNCHL to present Umbdenstock with Leadership Excellence Award\n\nThe National Center for Healthcare Leadership will present its 2015 Gail L. Warden Leadership Excellence Award to AHA President and CEO Rich Umbdenstock. \u201cFrom his position as the head of the AHA, Rich Umbdenstock has shown unparalleled leadership in breaking through the divisive debate on health reform to help drive change and improvement in the nation\u2019s health care system,\u201d NCHL President and Board Chair Tim Rice said. \u201cHis leadership and innovative thinking span all aspects of the health care system.\u201d The award will be presented Nov. 17 in Chicago. Umbdenstock will retire from AHA at the end of this year.\n\nHRET, University of Kentucky to study care transitions\n\nThe AHA\u2019s Health Research & Educational Trust will partner with the University of Kentucky Center for Health Services Research on a study to determine transitional care services that improve health outcomes and are of high value to patients and their caregivers. The study, called Project ACHIEVE \u2014 Achieving Patient-Centered Care and Optimized Health In Care Transitions by Evaluating the Value of Evidence \u2014 is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. The three-year project will involve the design and development of best-practice recommendations and emphasize the importance of patient transitions from hospital to home as well as the evaluation of nursing facilities and community care transitions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stephen Shortell discusses accountable communities for health and ACOs.", "csrf-token": "aSGl7viVAkL3r1dyjA8cZa4JMw2fNb+KVaGXhZ7Awj8=", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/s/Shortell_190x127.jpg?1448315746", "description": "Stephen Shortell discusses the 'next frontier' of health care: one in which cross-sector organizations come together to better health.", "card": "summary", "title": "Creating Accountable Communities for Health"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.hhnmag.com/ext/resources/inc-hhn/img/articles/author_photos/archives/s/Shortell_190x127.jpg?1448315746", "type": "Article", "description": "Stephen Shortell discusses the 'next frontier' of health care: one in which cross-sector organizations come together to better health.", "title": "Creating Accountable Communities for Health"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-144.png", "keywords": "stephen shortell, ACOs, AHA voices, accountable communities health care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb332\"", "article_summary": "To constrain the rate of growth in costs, and improve population health and patient experience, will require the creation of accountable communities for health (ACHs), also called accountable care communities.\n(6) Promote and participate in national initiatives to improve population health, such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2019s \u201cCulture of Health\u201d undertaking.\n(4) Use electronic health record and data analysis capabilities to promote linkages with other sectors\u2019 data and create a dashboard to track progress on population health indicators.\nHospitals, health systems and physician organizations have taken the lead in catalyzing over 750 accountable care organizations since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\nHe is the 2015 recipient of the TRUST Award from the Health Research & Educational Trust."}
