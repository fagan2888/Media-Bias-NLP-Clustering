Most of these operations have been largely counterproductive and unsuccessful. Examples include Operation Agatha targeting the Jewish Resistance Movement in 1946, French tactics against the FLN in Algeria in the 1950s, the Americans\u2019 extensive bombing against the Viet Cong and NVA in the 1960s and the British Army\u2019s actions in Northern Ireland, ranging from Operation Motorman to Bloody Sunday in 1972. Israel\u2019s Operation Protective Edge in the Gaza Strip is one such example.\n\nWhile the IDF has succeeded in destroying a number of tunnels and in targeting some Hamas militants, the operation has also resulted in the deaths of more than 1,900 Palestinian civilians, including 408 children. It has been reported that more children have died in the IDF\u2019s operation than armed fighters. These facts and this devastating reality has resulted in increased isolation for Israel and international condemnation, as well as the potential prosecution of both Hamas and Israel for war crimes.\n\nThere is no viable military solution to the conflict for either side, there never has been, and there never will be. This lack of military success over Hamas has been met with voices in Israeli society calling for more extreme measures. One of Jerusalem Post\u2019s regular columnists, Martin Sherman, has written two Op-Eds, \u201cInto the Fray: Why Gaza Must Go,\u201d and \u201cInto the Fray: Far Too Little, Much Too Late,\u201d on July 24 and July 26, 2014, respectively, calling for the dismantling of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, the relocation of Gaza\u2019s population, and Israeli annexation of the entire region.\n\nThese articles incite hatred and a complete contravention of international law, as they call for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza\u2019s 1.8 million Palestinian residents. Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal or killing of individuals of a certain ethnicity or race from a territory. Annexation has always been regarded as contrary to international law, from the time of Anschluss, to the Russian annexation of Crimea.\n\nSherman proposes to force 1.8 million Palestinians from their homes in Gaza and put them somewhere else. He doesn\u2019t suggest where they will go, just that they should be forcibly removed. He sees ethnic cleansing as the only solution to Hamas\u2019 control of the Gaza Strip. And he presents all of this as if he is a humanitarian, choosing to use the term \u201chumanitarian relocation.\u201d\n\nA similar article, one calling for the most extreme measure of genocide against the Palestinians in Gaza, was published then removed from the the Times of Israel\u2019s website, eliciting much Israeli and international condemnation, including a statement from the Times of Israel, describing it as contrary to their editorial guidelines. The opinion, titled \u201cWhen Genocide Is Permissible,\u201d written by Yochanan Gorden, stated: \u201cAnyone who lives with rocket launchers installed or terror tunnels burrowed in or around the vicinity of their home cannot be considered an innocent civilian.\u201d Thus, Mr. Gorden questions whether genocide, or the mass killing of individuals based on their ethnicity or race, is permissible in Gaza.\n\nThis sort of rhetoric, although not new within certain extreme elements in Israeli society, has picked up steam during the past few weeks. Moshe Feiglin, the deputy speaker of the Knesset, has published a plan for the \u201cannihilation of all fighters and their supporters,\u201d a clear violation of the Genocide Convention. Feiglin further proposes that those who agree to leave Gaza will be offered an \u201cinternational emigration package.\u201d But first they will be placed in \u201cTent Camps\u201d near the Sinai until a location can be determined for them. Again, he is attempting to coat ethnic cleansing as a generous and humanitarian offer to the Palestinians.\n\nRetired Maj. Gen. Eiland went even further, stating in an article published on Aug. 5 on Ynet News that there were no \u201cinnocent civilians\u201d in Gaza. He added that Gaza\u2019s residents \u201care to blame for this situation just like Germany\u2019s residents were to blame for electing Hitler as their leader and paid a heavy price for that.\u201d\n\nNot only is the major general wrong in his analysis, he has also failed to read his history properly. The Nazi regime did not gain more than 40 percent of the vote in the 1932 election. Although many Germans were complicit in their unspeakable crimes, the 525 recognized by Israel as part of the \u201cRighteous Amongst Nations\u201d (including members of the Nazi Party such as Oskar Schindler), as well as the countless other German Trade Unionists, Communists and others sent to the Concentration Camps were certainly not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A 10-year-old Palestinian boy playing in his yard is the first death as fighting resumes in Gaza.
