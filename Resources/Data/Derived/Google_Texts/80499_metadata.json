Of the state\u2019s more than 60 association and trust plans, 11 are approved, nine are under review and the rest have been rejected.\n\nMounting frustration with the process has caused association-plan backers to run full-page newspaper ads and lobby state lawmakers to protest Kreidler\u2019s actions. Many are challenging the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC) in court or through administrative hearings.\n\nKreidler asserts that the Affordable Care Act brought into play new rules that affect association health plans, changing which businesses can buy insurance through different trusts and reshaping the way the insurance is priced. Associations counter that Kreidler is misinterpreting the law.\n\nAssociations and trusts for years have been the most popular insurance option for Washington\u2019s small employers because their products generally were cheaper than the health insurance available on the open market. That resulted in part from the plans\u2019 ability to charge businesses with sick workers more money, a practice no longer allowed under the ACA.\n\n\u201cAssociations offer a lot of benefits to their members, and to their communities. We\u2019ve worked very hard to reach out to as many associations and insurers as possible for the last several years to help them understand the new federal law,\u201d Kreidler said in a statement.\n\nFor the WEA\u2019s health association, the review went smoothly.\n\n\u201cOur pool [of covered employees] has remained stable, so we haven\u2019t had to make any changes,\u201d said Linda Mullen, director of communications at the WEA. \u201cIt\u2019s the same people we\u2019ve been covering for 40 years.\u201d\n\nFor others, it hasn\u2019t been so easy. The OIC says associations need to clear two bars for approval. First, they must cover businesses in the same sector as the associations, such as car dealers or farmworkers. Then they must price their insurance in a way that meets the new rules, which generally means prices can vary \u2014 within limits \u2014 by age, geography and management and nonmanagement employees.\n\nAn OIC analysis of recently proposed rates found that in some cases, older workers and women of reproductive age were being overcharged in association plans.\n\nThe Health Alliance for Technology (ALLtech) trust, which provides insurance for 110 smaller technology companies, missed both marks when it was reviewed, and it\u2019s appealing the decision.\n\nBefore the ACA kicked in, \u201cwe went with our arms wide open to the OIC\u201d to try to set up a product that would meet the new rules, said Ken Myer, the trustee providing fiduciary oversight at ALLtech.\n\nThe companies using ALLtech plans are \u201ccompeting for talent with some of the bigger players in the industry,\u201d Myer said. They need to be able to offer plans with rich benefits that at least approach what\u2019s offered by large employers, and ALLtech helped them do that, he said.\n\nThe OIC review process has gone slower than expected, and the office is still issuing decisions for plans started in 2014, some of which still could be in effect. All the 2015 plans are pending review.\n\nNone of the workers covered by disapproved plans have lost their coverage, said Stephanie Marquis, OIC spokeswoman. The trusts have 90 days to appeal the decisions and many have. If they do not, the OIC has offered to help the trusts transition employees to approved plans.\n\nThe Washington Counties Insurance Fund trust, which covers 7,500 county workers plus employees working at fire, hospital and library districts, was rejected because of its prices. Jon Kaino, executive director, said the rates had nothing to do with workers\u2019 health, and he can\u2019t understand the ruling.\n\nIn fact, Kaino argues that the trust\u2019s prices are fairer than what\u2019s on the open market. Under the ACA, insurance prices can increase each year as a person gets older. The county trust instead takes the average age of all an employer\u2019s workers and sets the rate there. That way insurance for a 60-year-old employee costs the same as someone who is 30.\n\nThe solution is simpler for bookkeeping and could discourage an employer, who pays much of the insurance costs, from discriminating against older workers, Kaino said. On charging individuals according to age, he said, \u201cit\u2019s incentivizing age discrimination, and we don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nMarquis didn\u2019t know exactly why the county trust failed the pricing test. The OIC asks trusts to explain why one group is being charged more than another, and sometimes the trusts haven\u2019t provided enough information to explain it.\n\n\u201cWe just believe we\u2019re enforcing the federal law as written,\u201d Marquis said.\n\nKaino\u2019s trust is to argue its case before an administrative hearings officer later this month, and he\u2019s optimistic: \u201cI believe we can win.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the Washington Education Association health trust has won an OK from the state, other groups providing health insurance for thousands of small-business employees are finding their plans in limbo or rejected.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "While the Washington Education Association health trust has won an OK from the state, other groups providing health insurance for thousands of small-business employees are finding their plans in limbo or rejected.", "title": "Small-business employees' group slams state for rejecting health plans", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/associations-complain-state-has-left-their-health-plans-in-limbo/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "While the Washington Education Association health trust has won an OK from the state, other groups providing health insurance for thousands of small-business employees are finding their plans in limbo or rejected.", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "Small-business employees' group slams state for rejecting health plans"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Health", "published_time": "2015-05-07 17:59:21", "modified_time": "2015-05-08 06:50:33"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local News, Health"}, "article_summary": "While the Washington Education Association health trust has won an OK from the state, other groups providing health insurance for thousands of small-business employees are finding their plans in limbo or rejected.\nJon Kaino, executive director, said the rates had nothing to do with workers\u2019 health, and he can\u2019t understand the ruling.\nOf the state\u2019s more than 60 association and trust plans, 11 are approved, nine are under review and the rest have been rejected.\nFor the WEA\u2019s health association, the review went smoothly.\nIf they do not, the OIC has offered to help the trusts transition employees to approved plans."}
