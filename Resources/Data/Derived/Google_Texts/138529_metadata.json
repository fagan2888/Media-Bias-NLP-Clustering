Earlier this month, President Barack Obama declared the surge in immigrant children an \u201curgent humanitarian situation,\u201d and directed federal agencies to coordinate a response.\n\n\u201cU.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s El Centro and San Diego sectors are about to begin assisting with the processing of migrants apprehended in South Texas, many of whom are adults with children,\u201d the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, or ICE, said statement released Monday.\n\n\u201cCBP will transfer certain individuals to U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement\u2019s Removal Operations, where appropriate custody determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis, prioritizing national security and public safety.\u201d\n\nThe ICE statement specified that Murrieta would be the end point for \u201cprocessing\u201d the individuals, noting that they \u201cmay be released with instructions to report to a local office near their destination address within 15 days.\u201d\n\nFollowing Tuesday\u2019s standoff in Murrieta, ICE officials said that once the migrants are processed, they will be taken to a \u201ctransition center\u201d in Riverside County set up by a faith-based organization that would help the migrants arrange transportation to their final destinations and help them contact family members.\n\nMurrieta Mayor Alan Long told concerned residents during a town hall meeting Monday that the city had coordinated with the Border Patrol to ensure the anticipated influx didn\u2019t create an untenable situation locally.\n\nHe expressed frustration that the federal government was moving its \u201cheadache\u201d to Riverside County but assured residents that the individuals set to arrive don\u2019t have criminal backgrounds.\n\n\u201cThis is a failure to enforce federal law at the federal level,\u201d Long said. \u201cMurrieta continues to object to the transfer of illegal immigrants to the local Border Patrol office.\u201d\n\nOfficials said more migrants could be brought to Southern California in as soon as 72 hours.\n\n\u2014 City News Service\n\n>> Subscribe to Times of San Diego\u2019s free daily email newsletter!
