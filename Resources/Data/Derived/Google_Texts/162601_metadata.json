I previously reported that his alleged infraction was reading a colorful passage from Mark Twain, but according to new details in this Washington Post story, it\u2019s actually a harmless, wholly inoffensive joke that got him in trouble.\n\nEsquith teaches at Hobart Boulevard elementary in LA. Most of his students are low-income Korean and Hispanic kids. His numerous extracurricular activities\u2014including field trips and Shakespeare productions\u2014are largely funded through private donations from benefactors attracted to his excellent work. While reading a passage from Huckleberry Finn in which \u201cthe king came prancing out on all fours, naked,\u201d Esquith remarked that if he couldn\u2019t raise additional funds for his annual production, he supposed \u201cthe class would have to similarly perform naked.\u201d\n\nWaPost\u2019s Jay Mathews puts his comment in context:\n\nEsquith was joking. He does that a lot, as anyone who knows him has long been aware of. The school district has provided no significant funds for the annual play and Esquith\u2019s many field trips and other projects, but his work has attracted many wealthy and influential supporters, so he was not expressing a real worry. The Shakespearean plays are very low-budget, since they are done in his small classroom with the audience on risers and the many musical instruments mostly donated. But a teacher who was in the room took him seriously, reported this to the principal and the principal reported it to the district. From there on, [Esquith\u2019s attorney Ben] Meiselas said, the district has been conducting an open-ended investigation with no apparent charges and no due process for Esquith. No child has complained. No parent has complained. The teacher who made the first report emailed him in April to say \u201cI just want you to know that I am here for you . . . and I wish you the best resolution possible!\u201d Esquith\u2019s lawyers have told the district to publicly apologize and let him return to work or be sued. Meiselas said district officials pulled some of Esquith\u2019s students out of class and questioned them intensely about what Esquith had said and anything he might have done to them, without first seeking the permission of their parents. Meiselas said the students were extremely upset, as were the parents.\n\nAnd that\u2019s it. One of the most celebrated public school teachers in the country has been driven out of his classroom, his charitable work halted, because no one can appreciate a joke\u2014a completely appropriate joke.\n\nMathews continues:\n\nThere are no suggestions that he has harmed any children. But as many of the great teachers I have written about over the years have told me, if you work hard and show administrators how much better our schools could be if they took their responsibilities seriously, you are going to become a target for abuse. I have witnessed many outrages by school districts, but this may be the worst yet.\n\nThis is the public school system: a confluence of bad incentives that permits lazy, ineffective teachers to keep drawing checks year after year while thwarting successful and innovative teachers at every turn. Esquith will likely be allowed to continue teaching when classes resume next fall, but this disruption is a terrible shame for his students.\n\nIn a sane world, LA schools would stifle the urge to splurge on unnecessary extravagances, and instead concentrate on providing basic instruction while rewarding the good apples.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Public schools punish good educators", "title": "LA School District Wants to Destroy the World\u2019s Greatest Teacher Over Harmless Joke", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/06/23/la-school-district-wants-to-destroy-the", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14350699401538.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Public schools punish good educators", "title": "LA School District Wants to Destroy the World\u2019s Greatest Teacher Over Harmless Joke", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14350699401538.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-06-23T14:43:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "But a teacher who was in the room took him seriously, reported this to the principal and the principal reported it to the district.\nOne of the most celebrated public school teachers in the country has been driven out of his classroom, his charitable work halted, because no one can appreciate a joke\u2014a completely appropriate joke.\nWhy was Rafe Esquith\u2014a celebrated Los Angeles teacher with numerous achievements\u2014suspended from class and forced to cancel his annual Shakespeare production?\nHis numerous extracurricular activities\u2014including field trips and Shakespeare productions\u2014are largely funded through private donations from benefactors attracted to his excellent work.\nFrom there on, [Esquith\u2019s attorney Ben] Meiselas said, the district has been conducting an open-ended investigation with no apparent charges and no due process for Esquith."}
