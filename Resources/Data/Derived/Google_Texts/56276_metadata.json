He was meant to spread love in this world, that's what he was good at,\u201d she said.\n\nMendoza said she learned this while dating Gage Bodenheimer.\n\n\u201cHe was good. He was a good person,\u201d said Mendoza. \"He was so loving.\"\n\nShock, disbelief, pain all emotions Mendoza has been feeling like many of Bodenheimer's other friend after learning he was shot and killed Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really saddening,\" said Ryan Sefton, who said he went to school with Bodenheimer.\n\n\u201cI didn't even believe it at first. It's hard to imagine something that close happening,\" said Sefton.\n\n\u201cIt was a stupid joke that could have been avoided that took his life,\u201d said Mendoza.\n\nDetectives said Nathaniel Thomas shot Bodenheimer in the head while he was sleeping in Thomas\u2019s apartment.\n\nPolice said Thomas, who regularly carries a gun, pulled the trigger believing the gun was unloaded, and when the gun went off, detectives said Thomas called 911 to say he had shot an intruder, but police said after talking to witnesses and looking at evidence, they found out the intruder story wasn't true.\n\n\u201cIt angers me very much because it could have been avoided. Something so simple could have been avoided,\u201d said Mendoza.\n\nThomas has been charged with second degree murder.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
