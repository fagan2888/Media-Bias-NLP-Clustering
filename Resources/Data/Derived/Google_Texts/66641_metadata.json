And while Cruz\u2019s campaign says Trump has a large lead in the early vote in winner-take-all Arizona, which also votes Tuesday, Cruz\u2019s aides are projecting confidence that they can gain on Trump by then.\n\nEstablishment Republicans, once expected to be the demon of Cruz\u2019s White House ambitions, are increasingly coming around. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate and a Mormon, said he will vote for Cruz on Tuesday. And former presidential foe Lindsey Graham will host a fundraiser for him.\n\nIf Cruz is able to notch a powerful showing in those two states, it could reset the narrative of Trump\u2019s inevitability as the pace of primaries and caucuses slows considerably in the spring.\n\n\u201cEvery week is important, but\u200e this one is especially important given the time-sensitive nature of conservatives rallying around Ted,\u201d said Cruz communications director Alice Stewart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be key that he wins some of these winner-take-all primaries to slow Trump down, but I think this week can be the week that happens,\u201d said David McIntosh, the head of the Club for Growth, one of the main anti-Trump advocacy groups. \u201cIt\u2019ll show that it\u2019s still possible to have someone other than Trump.\u201d\n\nCruz officials are trying to emphasize the damage they feel Trump would do the GOP, even seeking to use protests at Trump protests to their advantage.\n\n\u201cPeople are recognizing what a disaster Trump would be if he were the nominee,\u201d Stewart argues, adding unsolicited, \u201cThese protests are an indication of what we would see in the general election if \u2014 heaven forbid \u2014 he were the nominee.\u201d\n\nBut even a sweep Tuesday would not put Cruz on a glide path to the nomination \u2014 he would have to win a huge majority of the remaining delegates to earn 1,237 by the time Republicans gather for their national convention in Cleveland.\n\n\u200eWhat about Kasich?\n\nWhile it is closer to a two-man race than it has ever been, John Kasich has signaled no willingness to leave the race, a roadblock that angers many of Cruz\u2019s backers and donors. Kasich has made an aggressive play in Utah on the ground and on television, a move that likely will give Trump more delegates and pave his path to the magic number.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of the camp that Kasich is running for vice president \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s Trump or Cruz or Sanders or Hillary,\u201d said Nate Bachman, a Cruz contributor from Kasich\u2019s Ohio who is part of the donor network organized by Charles and David Koch.\n\nYet Bachman said he feels \u201cnot real well\u201d about Cruz\u2019s overall chances: \u201cI just don\u2019t see a path for him \u2014 especially with Kasich blocking him.\u201d\n\nOther donors share in the considerable angst about Kasich, with Cruz himself this weekend dubbing the Ohio governor \u2014 who has no mathematical shot at winning the nomination before the convention \u2014 a \u201cspoiler.\u201d His campaign, however has been slow to otherwise attack Kasich. Cruz on Saturday declined to answer when asked by reporters whether the governor was a \u201cconservative.\u201d\n\nBenefits of Rubio\u2019s departure\n\n\u201cWe would be shocked if he didn\u2019t do much better than 50%,\u201d said Utah GOP Vice Chairman Phill Wright, who is helming Cruz\u2019s campaign in the state. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident \u2014 especially with Marco Rubio out of the race.\u201d\n\nIt is Rubio\u2019s exit that has Cruz\u2019s Houston headquarters excited.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the ones answering the phones. People are reaching out to us,\u201d Stewart says, \u201cThe trend and the momentum is moving to Ted. People are responding.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s departure has caused some establishment figures, such as Romney, to give Cruz a fresh look.\n\nGraham joked about Cruz\u2019s murder only three weeks ago, but on Monday in Washington, he will hold a fundraiser for Cruz\u2019s campaign, a jaw-dropping reversal explained not by a newfound appreciation for a man who once shut down the government, but a recognition, Graham said, that only Cruz could topple Trump.\n\nOther Rubio surrogates are following suit, such as conservative Arizona congressman Matt Salmon, who on Sunday said he would choose Cruz. Salmon\u2019s home state is likely to break for Trump, who has the backing of the border state\u2019s most prominent anti-immigration hardliners, such as Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a very good night in Utah. Arizona is much tighter,\u201d Cruz said in Phoenix on Friday. \u201cDonald did well in early voting in Arizona. We\u2019re surging now. Our numbers are going up and up and up.\u201d\n\nAfter Tuesday, the Republican calendar slows to a crawl, with only two contests over the next month: Wisconsin and New York.\n\nThe Badger State on April 5 in particular is expected to be ground zero for the forces hoping to stop Trump, with McIntosh saying his group is planning a large ad buy in the state. And the Club is even considering not just anti-Trump advertising for the remainder, but pro-Cruz spots as well.\n\nMcIntosh said that Cruz could even begin to make inroads with the Republicans who flocked to Trump\u2019s campaign and refused to let go.\n\n\u201cPeople who really do not want to have a Trump nominee are OK with Cruz,\u201d McIntosh said, \u201cand you\u2019re seeing the Trump voters saying they\u2019re OK with him, too.\u201d\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2016 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.
