John Kasich, President Obama told Vox.com in an interview released Monday.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that in dribs and drabs, much as was true with the original Medicaid program, you\u2019re starting to see Republican governors and Republican state legislatures realizing that, ya know, \u2018We\u2019re cuttin\u2019 off our nose to spite our face \u2014 we got an ideological objection to us helping our own constituencies and our own healthcare systems,'\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cTo their credit, you got folks like John Kasich in Ohio and (Gov. Rick) Snyder in Michigan and now, most recently, the governor up in Alaska and others who are saying, \u2018Ya know what, this is the right thing to do, let\u2019s go ahead and expand it.'\u201d\n\nIn Ohio alone, Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion resulted in more than $2 billion in new federal spending last year. The federal government is currently more than $18 trillion in debt.\n\nKasich, a Republican, routinely accuses Republicans of being ideologues who don\u2019t care about the poor. The governor unilaterally expanded Medicaid under Obamacare in 2013 after failing for six months to pressure the Republican-controlled Ohio General Assembly to back the policy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay much attention to narrow ideologues,\u201d Kasich said of Obamacare Medicaid expansion critics during a Jan. 23 NPR interview.\n\nDuring a Jan. 21 visit to Montana, Kasich told state lawmakers, \u201cturning down your money back to Montana on an ideological basis when people can lose their lives because they get no help doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, all these entitlements need to be reformed, but in the middle of reforming them you just don\u2019t cut off your nose to spite your face and make some declarative statement and then people can\u2019t get any help,\u201d Kasich said when asked about Medicaid expansion at a Dec. 18 Ohio Chamber of Commerce event.\n\nThe biggest problem with Obamacare, according to the president, is that not enough Republicans have followed Kasich\u2019s lead by embracing the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cI mean, the big problem we have right now with Obamacare is that it was designed to make sure that some subset of people were gonna qualify for Medicaid,\u201d Obama told Ezra Klein, Vox editor-in-chief, bemoaning the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 Obamacare ruling.\n\n\u201cBecause of the decision of the (Chief Justice John) Roberts court that we couldn\u2019t incentivize states to expand Medicaid the way we had originally intended, you\u2019ve got a lot of really big states, you\u2019ve got tens of millions of people who aren\u2019t able to get their Medicaid coverage and so there\u2019s this gap,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObamacare was written to withhold all federal Medicaid funding from states refusing to expand Medicaid to able-bodied, working-age adults with no dependent children. The Supreme Court ruled Congress could not make traditional Medicaid funding contingent on expansion.\n\nObama has used Kasich as a rhetorical lifeline for his unpopular 2010 health insurance law for more than a year. During the disastrous rollout of the Obamacare exchange website HealthCare.gov, the president repeatedly pointed to Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion as proof Obamacare was working.\n\nThe governor, meanwhile, insists Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion has nothing to do with Obamacare. When seeking office in 2010, Kasich complained Obamacare would \u201crequire more Medicaid spending and stick states with large and unsustainable costs.\u201d\n\nKasich now claims each state\u2019s Obamacare expansion money comes entirely from that state\u2019s taxpayers, and has warned support for the Obamacare expansion will be used as an admission test in the afterlife.\n\nState legislators in Tennessee and Wyoming blocked their Republican governors\u2019 attempts to follow Kasich\u2019s lead on the Obamacare expansion last week. Medicaid expansion is still under consideration in Utah, Idaho and elsewhere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare would be working well if more Republicans were like Ohio Gov.
