They utilize resources that facilitate their choices as informed consumers without feeling compelled to support the health or decision making of other families with fewer resources. They also refuse to acknowledge the role their children play in protecting or undermining systems of public health...\n\nIn other words, parents who opt out of vaccines come to their decisions by prioritizing the very virtues American culture readily recommends: freedom of choice, consumer primacy, individualism, self-determination, and a dim, almost cynical view of common goods like public health. If enclaves of anti-vaccination advocates are limited to the rarefied exurbs of California and Oregon, then the prevalence of this \"neoliberal\" frame makes all the more sense, as a certain laissez-faire attitude toward matters of mass coordination is associated with wealth and an attendant sense of personal control: Since money affords the wealthy a certain amount of control over their personal affairs, they both experience feelings of control (which may or may not correspond to reality) and feel less concerned with the welfare of others. After all, if one is convinced they can manage their own affairs, why shouldn't everyone else be able to?\n\nCompare Reich\u2019s data with a similar study published in The Scandinavian Journal of Public Health circa 2013. Conducted by Swedish political science scholar Bj\u00f6rn R\u00f6nnerstrand, the study sought to understand differences between Swedes who chose to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus in 2009 and those who did not. R\u00f6nnerstrand controlled for a number of factors, including age, sex, gender, education, and even level of concern about an H1N1 pandemic, meaning that the decision to be vaccinated or not couldn\u2019t be confounded by, say, a person\u2019s individual panic level or knowledge of infectious disease.\n\nSo what separated Swedes who sought vaccination and those who didn\u2019t? R\u00f6nnerstrand found that those who sought vaccinations had high levels of institutional trust\u2014that is, trust in the Swedish healthcare system\u2014and high levels of generalized trust, or trust in the rest of society. R\u00f6nnerstrand notes that in \u201ca promotion campaign during the 2009 (H1N1) pandemic, the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control emphasised that individual immunisation\u2014besides strengthening individual protection\u2014was a way of protecting fellow citizens,\u201d and suspects that this had a major impact on general willingness to be vaccinated. \u201cIt is well known,\u201d he goes on, \u201cthat Sweden belongs to a group of northern European countries where citizens have high trust in institutions as well as in fellow citizens.\u201d In other words, along with a healthcare system they can rely upon, Swedes are inclined to care about and protect one another, and feel secure that others feel the same about them.\n\nThis ethic is, of course, quite contrary to the American fantasy of rugged individualism, which functions in a feedback loop with American politics: culture influences politics, and laws and political rhetoric in turn influence culture. While conservatives daydream about an American idyll of self-sufficiency and liberty, the new House GOP is set to hold its first repeal vote on the Affordable Care Act, the closest thing to a unified healthcare system the United States has ever known. The idea that everyone should ultimately be individually responsible for her own health directly animates the idea that there need be no unified, reliable healthcare system\u2014and those two ideas preclude anything approaching Sweden's trust in healthcare or society at large. Individualism begets individualist politics, both of which encourage the type of thinking anti-vaccination advocates appear prone to.\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good to roast anti-vaccination sorts in the media, and it isn\u2019t as though they don\u2019t deserve the righteous condemnation of the masses they put at risk when they allow once-defeated diseases to return. But to extinguish large swathes of anti-vaccination sentiment and practice, it appears a more momentous cultural shift is in order, and a pursuant political change. Trust requires mass coordination of efforts, which in turn requires consistent trust\u2014something neoliberal politics in America vastly undervalues.
