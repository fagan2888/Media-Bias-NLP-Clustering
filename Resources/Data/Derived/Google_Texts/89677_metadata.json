The steps will help hospitals better identify patients at high risk for readmissions, engage patients through education and communication and establish a mutually accountable environment that doesn't just penalize hospitals for unnecessary readmissions.\n\nA multi-stakeholder cooperative care model must encompass three requirements, according to the report:\n\nCollaboration in clinical outreach and care: Use assets to identify high-risk patients and support them through the transition of care process.\n\nBusiness sustainability: Make sure the chosen financial model is sustainable. Ask questions that address payment, resources, incentive and return on investment.\n\nEmployee engagement and communication: Fully communicate with staff and caregivers and encourage them to embrace new activation models.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the report (.pdf)\n\n- here's the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nLawmakers push for Medicare overhaul, focus on coordinated care\n\nReality check: coordinated care is a daunting task", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coordinated care\u00a0can cut\u00a0unnecessary hospital readmissions, but it's up to hospitals and healthcare providers to take a bigger role in the initiative, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0by the nonprofit coalition Northeast Business Group on Health.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Coordinated care\u00a0can cut\u00a0unnecessary hospital readmissions, but it's up to hospitals and healthcare providers to take a bigger role in the initiative, according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0by the nonprofit coalition Northeast Business Group on Health.", "title": "Stakeholder collaboration can reduce readmission rates", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/stakeholder-collaboration-can-reduce-readmission-rates/2014-02-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Coordinated Care,hospital readmissions,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement,quality measures,readmission rates", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07a4\"", "article_summary": "\"Reducing Hospital Readmissions through Stakeholder Collaboration,\" which includes input from 67 executives from employer organizations, health plans, hospital systems, suppliers and other stakeholders, recommends a series of strategies providers can use to align their readmissions initiatives.\nTo learn more:- read the report (.pdf)- here's the statementRelated Articles:Lawmakers push for Medicare overhaul, focus on coordinated careReality check: coordinated care is a daunting task\nThe steps will help hospitals better identify patients at high risk for readmissions, engage patients through education and communication and establish a mutually accountable environment that doesn't just penalize hospitals for unnecessary readmissions.\nWhile many readmission reduction efforts are underway in the marketplace, few, if any, have the shared data analytics, integrated care models, robust employee outreach and communication, and the economic sustainability features necessary to reduce readmissions, the report said.\nEmployee engagement and communication: Fully communicate with staff and caregivers and encourage them to embrace new activation models."}
