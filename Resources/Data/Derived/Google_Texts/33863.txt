Dec. 19, 2013 -- If you want new health insurance through the Affordable Care Act starting Jan. 1, you’re running out of time. There's good news, though.

Consumers now have until Jan. 10, 2014, to make their first payment on insurance that takes effect New Year's Day. They still have to enroll for a health plan in their state's Marketplace by Dec. 23, 2013, to receive that Jan. 1 coverage.

The latest deadline change came Wednesday from America’s Health Insurance Plans, the national trade association representing the health insurance industry.

The payment deadline had been Dec. 31, 2013. Although each health plan has the option to make its own decision, it’s expected that most major carriers will go along with the new payment deadline.

Keep in mind, that’s for the 36 states where the federal government runs the Marketplace. If you live in a state that runs its own Marketplace, your deadlines might be different.

You can still get insurance for 2014 if you sign up after the Dec. 23 enrollment deadline -- you just won’t have coverage starting Jan. 1.

The new law has already had multiple “key dates” for consumers to keep in mind, and many of those dates have changed in the past few weeks.
