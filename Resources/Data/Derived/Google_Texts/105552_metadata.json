If Healthcare.gov is Obama\u2019s Katrina, then we could not ask for a more experienced leader to deal with the problem. Because according to the news and punditry of the last five years, President Obama has had at least a dozen \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201ds so far.\n\nProbably the most widespread usage of the phrase \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d before now came during the BP oil spill in 2010. There at least you had history maybe not repeating but rhyming: a natural an environmental disaster (if not a massive loss of human life), the location in the Gulf near New Orleans, a seemingly paralyzed government response. And, of course, it had partisan utility: Karl Rove, who had some experience with the actual Katrina, christened the spill thus in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d would not limit itself to one geographic region, or to environmental disasters, or to disasters at all. At conservative site Breitbart.com, days before the 2012 election, Hurricane Sandy was \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina.\u201d After tornadoes devastated the Midwest, commentators (including Katrina\u2019s Michael \u201cHeckuva Job\u201d Brown) likened the disaster to \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina,\u201d criticizing the President for an overseas trip. Sequestration has been Obama\u2019s Katrina. The New Republic dubbed the 2011 debt ceiling crisis Obama\u2019s Katrina. (But, fair\u2019s fair, also \u201cBoehner\u2019s Katrina.\u201d Everyone gets a Katrina!) Earlier this year, conservative Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin wrote that, \u201cIn a way, the NSA intelligence gathering is Obama\u2019s Katrina.\u201d Sure! In a way, what isn\u2019t?\n\nI could go on and on, but writing in ThinkProgress, Judd Legum recently identified several more \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201ds in the media: the bank bailout, Benghazi, unemployment, the underwear bomber, the IRS scandal, and the earthquake in Haiti.\n\nObviously there are partisan motives behind plenty of these, but not exclusively: one of Legum\u2019s examples, for instance, comes from liberal New York magazine columnist Frank Rich. Beyond the desire of one party to score a two-fer\u2013christening a scandal for the opposition while ameliorating one of their own past scandals in the process\u2013there\u2019s the good-old-fashioned reflex of the media to cast This Thing in terms of That Other Thing. God knows it didn\u2019t originate with the Obama Administration; we\u2019ve lived through four decades of \u201c-gates\u201d by now. It\u2019s just easier to have a precooked bit of hyperbole that declares, \u201cThis is big news\u201d than to go through the trouble of distinguishing how this news is different from other news.\n\nThere was one Katrina. There was one Watergate. Maybe Healthcare.gov will be a failure whose ramifications will reverberate for years; maybe it won\u2019t. But one news clich\u00e9 or another won\u2019t make it so. The only way we\u2019ll know that for sure is if, four or eight years from now, partisans and pundits are calling the next President\u2019s problems his or her Healthcare.gov.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You don't have to have read very deeply in the minutiae of the Healthcare.gov fiasco to have picked up on a certain musical meme in the coverage: the Affordable Care Act is \"Obama's Katrina.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "There is no force of man or nature more powerful than a news clich\u00e9.", "title": "Healthcare.gov Is, Like, the Twelfth \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d So Far | TIME.com", "url": "http://entertainment.time.com/2013/11/21/healthcare-gov-is-like-the-twelfth-obamas-katrina-so-far/", "image": "https://timeentertainment.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/131121-barack-obama.jpg?w=592", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "What\u2019s good, bad and happening, from pop culture to high culture", "keywords": "news media, tuned in,", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Entertainment", "google-site-verification": "U7OX9IjuXnaDf-CoTeQzJwWanr44JrFSBJt044vng_0", "msvalidate.01": "D5D31ED89855B2C2D8411F1F8B2367B6", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/TIME"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://entertainment.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0df4e433005015e27e2188e452d16236?s=16", "news_keywords": "news media, tuned in,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1a3\"", "article_summary": "If Healthcare.gov is Obama\u2019s Katrina, then we could not ask for a more experienced leader to deal with the problem.\nProbably the most widespread usage of the phrase \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d before now came during the BP oil spill in 2010.\nBut \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201d would not limit itself to one geographic region, or to environmental disasters, or to disasters at all.\nAt conservative site Breitbart.com, days before the 2012 election, Hurricane Sandy was \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina.\u201d After tornadoes devastated the Midwest, commentators (including Katrina\u2019s Michael \u201cHeckuva Job\u201d Brown) likened the disaster to \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina,\u201d criticizing the President for an overseas trip.\nBecause according to the news and punditry of the last five years, President Obama has had at least a dozen \u201cObama\u2019s Katrina\u201ds so far."}
