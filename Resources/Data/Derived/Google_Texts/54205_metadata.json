The company said it is the largest period of growth in its 36-year history and will bring its total workforce to 610.\n\nThe employment growth is being driven by POMCO's contract with Health Republic Insurance of New York,\n\na not-for-profit program created by the the New York City-based Freelancers Union.\n\nHealth Republic operates New York's Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan, a private, member-governed health insurance company. It is one of 23 formed across the country to offer health benefit plans on the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplace. It offers health insurance for individuals and small businesses.\n\nHealth Republic hired POMCO to be its claims administrator, customer service call center and medical management provider. Many of POMCO's new employees are highly trained customer service and claims specialists, the company said.\n\n\"Our partnership with Health Republic Insurance of New York has not only allowed us to assist underserved members across the state of New York with their health coverage needs, it has also given us an opportunity to bring more employment opportunities to Syracuse,\" POMCO President and CEO Robert Pomfrey said in a statement.\n\nFounded in 1978 by Pomfrey, POMCO recently expanded its headquarters on James Street to accommodate its growth. However, the company said it is exploring new options for both training and future worksite locations.\n\nContact Rick Moriarty anytime: Email | Twitter | Facebook | 315-470-3148", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Rick Moriarty | rmoriarty@syracuse.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Bob Pomfrey, Obamacare, POMCO, Pomco, POMCO Group, Robert Pomfrey, news", "title": "Obamacare creates 65 more jobs at Syracuse health insurance administrator", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare creates 65 more jobs at Syracuse health insurance administrator\", \"link\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/obamacare_creates_65_more_jobs_at_syracuse_health_insurance_administrator_1.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/news/photo/2014/07/02/15334469-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13323262\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-02T16:03:21Z\", \"author\": \"Rick Moriarty | rmoriarty@syracuse.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstory\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Bob Pomfrey\",\"Obamacare\",\"POMCO\",\"Pomco\",\"POMCO Group\",\"Robert Pomfrey\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@syracusedotcom", "description": "POMCO Group has hired 157 new employees since the beginning of 2013, mainly due to business growth generated by Obamacare.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@RickMoriartyCNY"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, July 02, 2014, 12:03 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.syracuse.com/news/photo/2014/07/02/2013-09-20-mjg-pomco1jpg-0bd39d326ab6614a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rmoriart\", \"author_nickname\": \"Rick Moriarty | rmoriarty@syracuse.com\", \"author_id\": \"744\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Central NY News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "syracuse.com", "description": "POMCO Group has hired 157 new employees since the beginning of 2013, mainly due to business growth generated by Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare creates 65 more jobs at Syracuse health insurance administrator", "url": "http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/obamacare_creates_65_more_jobs_at_syracuse_health_insurance_administrator_1.html", "image": "http://imgick.syracuse.com/home/syr-media/width620/img/news/photo/2014/07/02/15334469-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "syracuse.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/rick.moriarty.92"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, July 02, 2014, 12:03 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "POMCO Group has hired 157 new employees since the beginning of 2013, mainly due to business growth generated by Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbb6\"", "article_summary": "Syracuse, N.Y. \u2014 Obamacare is bringing 65 more jobs to POMCO Group, the health insurance administrator based in Syracuse's Eastwood section.\nHealth Republic operates New York's Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan, a private, member-governed health insurance company.\nIt is one of 23 formed across the country to offer health benefit plans on the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Marketplace.\nHealth Republic hired POMCO to be its claims administrator, customer service call center and medical management provider.\nIt offers health insurance for individuals and small businesses."}
