In a surprise move, CMS created a new observation \u201ccomprehensive ambulatory payment classification\u201d (C-APC) and deposited into the payment pretty much all associated services, including the emergency room visit, labs and radiology.\n\nHow it affects hospitals\u2019 finances depends on their ability to manage utilization and control costs, says William Malm, director of revenue integrity at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. But they have no choice except to get on board with packaging specifically and fee-for-value generally if they want to survive, he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them,\u201d Malm says, quoting Albert Einstein.\n\nThe proposed C-APC for observation fits into the packaging that\u2019s been underway for two years. Packaging refers to all-inclusive Medicare payments for some of the most common tests and procedures instead of paying for the components separately (RMC 11/10/14, p. 3). There are two major prongs in the march toward a true prospective payment system on the outpatient side: (1) packaged payments for 25 C-APCs within 12 \u201cclinical families,\u201d and (2) packaged payments for certain ancillary services that are integral, supportive, dependent or adjunctive to a primary service. In the proposed 2016 OPPS regulation, which, when finalized, takes effect Jan. 1, CMS added nine C-APCs. Some are surgical, but there\u2019s also the new observation C-APC, with a proposed payment of $2,111.\n\nMost C-APCs are for device-driven or device-dependent procedures, in which the device dominates the cost of the procedure. They are identified with a J1 status indicator. Because observation services are not usually related to device-driven or device-dependent procedures \u2014 recovery time is built in \u2014 CMS has created a new status indicator, J2. The new C-APC 8011 (comprehensive observation services) would replace the existing observation APC, 8009. C-APC 8011 would be billed on a claim when \u201cthere\u2019s a specific combination of services performed in combination with each other, as opposed to the presence of a single primary service identified by status indicator J1,\u201d the OPPS rule states. In terms of the services CMS refers to, patients must spend eight hours in observation, and it also includes everything from the emergency department visit to lab and radiology to high-level evaluation and management services.\n\n\u201cHospitals used to be able to expect additional reimbursement for infusions and injections, but in observation, that will package now,\u201d Malm says. \u201cEvery single service not designated as \u2018excluded from this C-APC\u2019 will be combined on the claim with one singular payment.\u201d\n\nHospitals will have to double down on their efficiency initiatives and reduce overutilization because some of their observation cases are very expensive, he says. \u201cMost of your high-dollar testing will be at risk, so now we have a cost-management issue,\u201d Malm says. But that\u2019s part of the larger picture of fee-for-value reimbursement codified in the Affordable Care Act. Already many large systems, such as the Cleveland Clinic and Intermountain Healthcare, have begun testing utilization committees. Assuming the observation C-APC is finalized, Malm thinks it will reinforce this movement.\n\nRead the rule at http://tinyurl.com/npbzwf5.\n\n\u00a9 2015 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
