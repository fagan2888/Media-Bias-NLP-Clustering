A virus known as distemper has been spreading rapidly throughout the state of Mississippi and surrounding areas. Distemper isn’t as bad as rabies, but is something to be aware of when coming in contact with wild animals, especially foxes and raccoons.

“It’s a virus similar to what humans get as the measles. It attacks the spinal cord and the brain of the fox,” Brian McCary with Meridian Animal Control says.

Workers with Animal Control say they haven’t seen distemper until recently. It’s in raccoons and foxes. Police have come in contact with a few and had to euthanize them.

“Last week we came in contact with a fox at Merrehope off of 8th street,” McCary explains. “We were able to walk right up to the fox so the fox was obviously disoriented, was just sitting there, very heavy saliva coming out of the foxes mouth and coughing, that’s another side effect.”

A fox displaying symptoms of distemper was seen in the Papa John’s parking lot on North Hills Street Saturday night. People trying to care for the fox said they thought it was hit by a car. Regardless of the situation McCary warns people to use caution if they see a fox or any other animal like this.

“We ask that you do not walk right up to them because there has been instances where people have been bit. This disease can also be spread to your domesticated animals, your dogs can get it,” McCary says.

Although animal control has seen cases locally, McCary says it’s widespread.

“To my understanding we’re not the only county that’s had problems with this. There’s other counties around the state of Mississippi and into Louisiana and Alabama that are having problems with this issue right now,” McCary says.
