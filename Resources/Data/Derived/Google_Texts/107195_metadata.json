Accordingly, a plan or issuer may not impose cost-sharing on the ring or the patch.\"\n\nFDA: Smokeless Tobacco Warning Stays\n\nThe FDA on Monday denied a petition by two tobacco companies to ease up on the warnings around smokeless tobacco.\n\nR.J. Reynolds and the American Snuff Company had requested that the FDA change one of the four warning statements required for product packages and advertising from \"This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes\" to \"No tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes.\"\n\nA supplement to the petition suggested \"No tobacco product is safe; however, exclusive use of smokeless tobacco products presents substantially less risk to health than cigarettes\" as an alternative.\n\nThe FDA's response indicated neither change would be made.\n\nRegardless of whether people might read the current label as saying smokeless tobacco isn't a safer alternative, it is factual as written because no tobacco product is safe, the agency argued.\n\n137 Million Can Access Free Preventive Services, HHS Says\n\nAbout 137 million people with private health insurance now have access to free preventive services as a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced Monday.\n\nThe ACA requires that insurers offer certain preventive services without costs, including contraception (see story above), obesity screening and counseling, breastfeeding support and supplies, HIV screening, and vaccinations to prevent flu and other diseases. The 137 million who have access to the free services include 15 million blacks, 17 million Latinos, and 8 million Asian-Americans, HHS noted.\n\n\"These services can substantially improve the health of families, and in some cases even save lives,\" HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. \"This can make a tremendous difference in the health of Americans.\"\n\nNext Week\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Special Committee on Aging will hold a hearing on \"Challenging the Status Quo: Solutions to the Hospital Observation Stay Crisis.\"\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Alliance for Health Reform will hold a briefing on \"Biosimilars in the U.S.: Current and Emerging Issues.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will hold a hearing entitled \"What are the State Governments Doing to Combat the Opioid Abuse Epidemic?\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joyce  Frieden", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Washington-Watch/Washington-Watch/51558", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/assets/images/defaultLede.png", "description": "FDA lifts ban for men who have sex with men, with caveat.", "card": "Summary", "title": "D.C.
