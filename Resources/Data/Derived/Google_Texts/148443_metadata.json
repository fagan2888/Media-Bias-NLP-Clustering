In many cases, payments three times as large as their monthly premiums were drawn from their bank accounts.\n\nSome consumers say this latest glitch \u2014 one that reached into their bank accounts and inappropriately removed funds \u2014 has shaken their confidence in the health exchange.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust the system, period,\u201d said a Kirkland resident who did not want to be identified. \u201cI feel that I have to hawk-eye every step of this. It\u2019s about faith in a system that is shaken on the most fundamental level.\u201d\n\nA Bellingham business consultant said the problems \u201cabsolutely\u201d affect his trust in the exchange. \u201cI personally wish the exchange would go away completely and let me buy health care directly from an insurance carrier under the rules of the Affordable Care Act or something similar,\u201d he said.\n\nAffected customers may have been assessed bank fees if their accounts were overdrawn as a result of the mistake, but exchange officials have indicated those consumers will be reimbursed. The exchange said consumers should check to see if their bank imposed any overdraft fees.\n\nConsumers will receive an email from the exchange confirming the repayment and providing information for consumers to request reimbursement for overdraft fees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A glitch at the Washington Healthplanfinder website affected 13,000 consumers who saw an improper amount of money drawn from their bank accounts.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "A glitch at the Washington Healthplanfinder website affected 13,000 consumers who saw an improper amount of money drawn from their bank accounts.", "title": "Overcharged health-exchange customers getting money back", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/overcharged-health-exchange-customers-getting-money-back/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "A glitch at the Washington Healthplanfinder website affected 13,000 consumers who saw an improper amount of money drawn from their bank accounts.", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "title": "Overcharged health-exchange customers getting money back"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Local News", "published_time": "2015-02-26 20:21:24", "modified_time": "2015-02-26 20:21:24"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local News"}, "article_summary": "Customers who were mistakenly triple-charged for insurance they purchased from the Washington Healthplanfinder exchange should be getting the overcharged amount back Friday.\nExchange officials said the process to repay consumers whose bank accounts were overcharged for the premium payments has been completed.\nIn many cases, payments three times as large as their monthly premiums were drawn from their bank accounts.\nA glitch at the Washington Healthplanfinder website affected 13,000 consumers who saw an improper amount of money drawn from their bank accounts.\nSome consumers say this latest glitch \u2014 one that reached into their bank accounts and inappropriately removed funds \u2014 has shaken their confidence in the health exchange."}
