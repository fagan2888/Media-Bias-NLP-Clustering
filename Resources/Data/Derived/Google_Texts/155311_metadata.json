The human remains were noticeable because the water levels in the area have dropped due to a drought. And on Wednesday, the Yolo County Coroner\u2019s Office announced that the bones were, indeed, prehistoric \u2013 which means they predate written record.\n\nChief Deputy Coroner Gina Moya said the bones were collected and later submitted to the Chico State Human Identification Laboratory. It was there that the bones were discovered to be prehistoric Native American. Once the bones were identified as Native American, Moya said, officials contacted the California Native American Heritage Commission, so the bones could receive a ceremonial burial.\n\nOn August 16 \u2013 one day after the human remains were found in California \u2013 more bones were discovered at a popular lake in Steuben County, Indiana.\n\nA resident in the area found the bones by the shoreline of a lake, News Channel 15 reported. Additional human remains were located in the water by Indiana Department of Natural Resources scuba divers following an underwater search.\n\nArcheologists with the University of Indianapolis reported Monday the remains are of a \u201cprehistoric\u201d Native American.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll pull together both state folks and some researchers, and we\u2019re also going to be working with the tribes to get as much information as we can,\u201d Indiana State Museum Director of Archeology Michele Greenan told Wane.com. \u201cBut, right now, it\u2019s still really early. My first call will be to the tribes and different researchers to try and figure out what steps to take.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prehistoric Native Remains Found in California, Indiana", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/21/prehistoric-native-remains-found-california-indiana-156511", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/sacramento_river.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Prehistoric Native Remains Found in California and Indiana"}, "abstract": "Prehistoric Native Remains Found in California, Indiana", "dc": {"title": "Prehistoric Native Remains Found in California and Indiana"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/21/prehistoric-native-remains-found-california-indiana-156511", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "bones,  prehistoric Native American, Simon Moya-Smith, University of Indianapolis ,", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-21T08:30-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Prehistoric Native Remains Found in California and Indiana"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4884\"", "article_summary": "Once the bones were identified as Native American, Moya said, officials contacted the California Native American Heritage Commission, so the bones could receive a ceremonial burial.\nTeeth and bone fragments were found last week near Sacramento, and officials say they belonged to a prehistoric Native American.\nArcheologists with the University of Indianapolis reported Monday the remains are of a \u201cprehistoric\u201d Native American.\nOn August 16 \u2013 one day after the human remains were found in California \u2013 more bones were discovered at a popular lake in Steuben County, Indiana.\nAdditional human remains were located in the water by Indiana Department of Natural Resources scuba divers following an underwater search."}
