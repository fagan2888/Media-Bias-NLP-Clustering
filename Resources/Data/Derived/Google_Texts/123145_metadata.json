Here\u2019s my guide to the madness. Every day this week, including Friday/Saturday and Sunday, I\u2019m offering up my recommendations for that evening of programming and the best way to watch it. Maybe you still watch live; maybe you catch up the next day on Hulu. Maybe you remember to set your DVR, which makes you far more conscientious than I am. Maybe you\u2019re looking for something to watch during housework or something to watch with family. The upside to #TooMuchTV is that your options are endless; there appears to be a program for everyone. Let\u2019s find it.\n\nSunday nights, in our Golden Age of television, are the haven for prestige and prestige-wannabe programming. I had to leave aside a lot of debuting shows trying to make a mark, both on venerable broadcast institutions and on second-tier cable networks, because there\u2019s simply too much happening on this one night. The big cable networks are offering up whole nights of programming; HBO has the trump card of John Oliver to cap off its evening, too. Elsewhere, various award-winning shows fight for a piece of an increasingly attention-deficit audience as a few newcomers attempt to make a mark.\n\n\u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d 9 p.m. on HBO. Returns Oct. 4.\n\n\u201cProject Greenlight,\u201d 10 p.m. on HBO. Returns Sept. 13.\n\n\u201cDoll & Em,\u201d 10:30 p.m. on HBO. Returns Sept. 13.\n\n\u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver,\u201d 11 p.m. Returns Sept. 13.\n\n\n\nHBO goes into the fall with a weird and potentially quite weak lineup. Of the first three, \u201cDoll & Em\u201d is definitely my pick\u2014an intimate comedy written by and starring two real-life best friends, it\u2019s addictive and satisfying. It\u2019s also the least-discussed show of the three fall shows. Damon Lindelof\u2019s \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d is HBO\u2019s drama offering for the night, which, no matter how much you like the show, is an unequivocally depressing note on which to start the season. The second season takes some of the characters to a new setting\u2014Miracle, Texas, where no one, apparently, was disappeared, but obviously, it\u2019s a TV show, so something bad is going to happen. Regina King is joining the already excellent cast. I have been impressed by the performances in \u201cThe Leftovers,\u201d but its grim misery never quite got through to me. King, like Justin Theroux, Carrie Coon and Amy Brenneman, will almost definitely never laugh.\n\n\u201cProject Greenlight,\u201d between the two, is a continuation of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck\u2019s reality series about filmmaking that last aired a whole decade ago. It\u2019s more of a wildcard, in terms of quality, than the other two; 10 years can lead to quite a crew turnover, even if Damon and Affleck are still onboard. There will likely be something reliably engaging about the show to keep viewers interested, even if that is entirely scrutinizing Affleck\u2019s persona for hints of his currently much-discussed personal life. A topic that 11 p.m. host John Oliver\u2014who has transitioned from newcomer to instant classic\u2014will have no trouble mocking, as the opportunity arises.\n\n\u201cBlood And Oil,\u201d 9 p.m. on ABC. Debuts Sept. 27.\n\n\u201cQuantico,\u201d 10 p.m. on ABC. Debuts Sept. 27.\n\n\n\nABC\u2019s Sunday-night offerings are, true to form, a little bit more melodramatic and splashy than the prestige cable networks; but this year, it\u2019s only a little bit. \u201cQuantico,\u201d starring Bollywood A-lister Priyanka Chopra, is more like \u201cHomeland\u201d than it is like \u201cRevenge,\u201d which occupied its time slot last fall. In terms of story, it\u2019s hitting some standard military-espionage beats, with a lot of double agents and questions of identity and the now-requisite domestic terror plot. In terms of casting and audience, it feels decidedly different\u2014both a play for an international audience, with Chopra, and a stab at prestige drama that has been historically dominated by cable. (The network\u2019s limited-run \u201cAmerican Crime\u201d was also an effort in that vein.) \u201cBlood and Oil,\u201d directly preceding it, is a lot less interesting\u2014a prime-time soap opera set in the oilfields of Texas\u2014but if your taste runs toward \u201cNashville,\u201d it could appeal.\n\n\u201cBob\u2019s Burgers,\u201d 7:30 p.m. on Fox. Returns Sept. 27.\n\n\u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\u201d 8:30 p.m. on Fox. Returns Sept. 27.\n\n\u201cLast Man on Earth,\u201d 9:30 p.m. on Fox. Returns Sept. 27.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sunday is brimming with options, from the return of John Oliver and \"Homeland\" to ABC's new \"Quantico\"", "title": "Fall TV Preview: On Sundays, a Bollywood star comes to ABC, martial arts to AMC, and every award-winning show vies for your attention", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sunday is brimming with options, from the return of John Oliver and \"Homeland\" to ABC's new \"Quantico\"", "title": "Fall TV Preview: On Sundays, a Bollywood star comes to ABC, martial arts to AMC, and every award-winning show vies for your attention", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/13/fall_tv_preview_on_sundays_a_bollywood_star_comes_to_abc_martial_arts_to_amc_and_every_award_winning_show_vies_for_your_attention/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/homeland501.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sunday is brimming with options, from the return of John Oliver and \"Homeland\" to ABC's new \"Quantico\"", "title": "Fall TV Preview: On Sundays, a Bollywood star comes to ABC, martial arts to AMC, and every award-winning show vies for your attention", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/homeland501.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, ABC, amc, blood and oil, bob's burgers, brooklyn nine-nine, CBS, Doll & Em, fall tv preview, Fox, HBO, Homeland, into the badlands, last man on earth, last week tonight with john oliver, priyanka chopra, project greenlight, Quantico, Showtime, the affair, The Good Wife, the leftovers, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd096\"", "article_summary": "Returns Sept. 27.\nReturns Sept. 13.\n\u201cLast Week Tonight With John Oliver,\u201d 11 p.m. Returns Sept. 13.\nMaybe you still watch live; maybe you catch up the next day on Hulu.\nMaybe you\u2019re looking for something to watch during housework or something to watch with family."}
