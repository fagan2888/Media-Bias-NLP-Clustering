On Monday, they were recognized for their efforts through the \"Kindness Campaign.\"\n\nIt's an online contest asking high school girls to share how they're making an impact on their community. The idea came from Nina Pleshe who launched the campaign through her boutique's Facebook page. Pleshe says the initiative is to promote and recognize kindness, and the nine girls went beyond her expectations.\n\n\"Some of them had me in tears,\" Pleshe said. \"One girl said, 'If only the world could see through my eyes, I think it would be a better place.' That's how I feel a lot because you need to have a big heart. It's rare sometimes these days to find those people who really want to make a difference.\"\n\nOne of the winners was Kailey Gibson, a freshman at Eveleth High School. She says she loves volunteering and working with kids as well as singing at nursing homes.\n\n\"I love making people happy, seeing a smile on their face and inspiring people,\" Gibson said.\n\nMaKayla Goerdt feels that way, too. She's a senior at Cherry High School who's talked some of her classmates out of suicide.\n\n\"I see people posting things [on social media] and then I message them,\" Goerdt said. \"I don't like seeing people upset. I don't think anyone deserves it even if they're a bad person. Maybe it just takes the right person to change them.\"\n\nThis weekend the girls' stories and photos will be posted on the Nina Brooke Facebook page. Folks can pick their favorite, and the winner will receive a free prom dress.\n\nEmily Law with Flom Designs & Photography took the photos on Monday while Cassie Kinkel was the trusty \"hairapist.\"\n\nIf you'd like to vote for a girl, click here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WDIO.com", "description": "Making the world a better place can be a tough feat for anyone to tackle, especially high schoolers; however, nine Iron Range girls are making an attempt anyway.
