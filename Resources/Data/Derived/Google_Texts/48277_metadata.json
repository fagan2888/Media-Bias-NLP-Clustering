But so far, Obama has shared the concerns of environmental groups that the pipeline won\u2019t produce many permanent jobs and could pose an environmental threat.\n\nMajor labor groups say the Affordable Care Act is undercutting union-sponsored health insurance programs and will encourage employers in the long term to cut workers\u2019 hours to avoid having to provide them with health insurance.\n\nThey complain that Obamacare may end up \u201cdestroying\u201d the union\u2019s multi-employer health plans. Under the administration\u2019s current interpretation of Obamacare, union members with so-called \u201cTaft-Hartley\u201c non-profit plans would not be entitled to tax subsidies available to others; they might also get hit with federal taxes to help offset the cost of those subsidies.\n\nThey complain that Obamacare may end up \u201cdestroying\u201d the union\u2019s multi-employer health plans.

Organized labor is also strongly opposed to two proposed free-trade agreements that the administration is trying to push through Congress on a fast-track basis. Displeased with the impact of NAFTA and other major trade agreements, labor leaders fear that the new ones could hurt local jobs and industries.\n\nRelated: UAW\u2019s Big Loss in Tennessee Is a Win for Workers\n\nIf labor and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill prevail, that would undercut a major element of Obama\u2019s economic agenda. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid recently broke publicly with the White House by declaring, \u201cI\u2019m against fast track.\u201d\n\nTrumka said that the AFL-CIO \u201copposes [the trade] legislation in the strongest terms and will actively work to block its passage.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is past time for the United States to get off the corporate hamster wheel on trade.\u201d\n\nTrumka has also repeatedly skewered the White House for refusing to address labor\u2019s concerns about the adverse effects of Obamacare on rank- and-file union members. And James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters Union, told MSNBC earlier this month, \u201cWe\u2019re entirely behind the Keystone project.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically part of our infrastructure,\u201d Hoffa said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to put thousands of people to work \u2013 not only Teamsters but all of working people. This is something America needs right now.\u201d\n\nStrong Turnout Needed\n\nThis is hardly the first time a Democratic president has feuded with organized labor, although it comes at an inopportune time. With Republicans threatening to win back control of the Senate and enhance their majority in the House next November, Democrats will need another strong turnout by labor.\n\nRelated: As Unions Lose More Members, Dems See Setbacks\n\n\u201cOn those issues, the divisions are real and they\u2019re not trivial,\u201d said William Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton. While it\u2019s unlikely many union members would vote for Republican candidates in the fall, he said, Democrats could be badly hurt if union leaders choose to sit out the race.\n\n\u201cThe issue is one of enthusiasm and foot power in the run-up to the election,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tensions between the White House and organized labor also come as the president heads to Mexico Wednesday for talks with fellow heads of state at the North American Leadership Summit. Trade and the Keystone pipeline are certain to be on the agenda and labor leaders will be listening carefully to what Obama has to say.\n\nThere is an element of irony to the feuding between Obama and labor leaders over essentially bread-and-butter issues when both sides have made economic equity and fairness for the middle class the centerpiece of their agendas. \u201cAt the core there is a huge overlap between organized labor and the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d noted David Madland, director of the American Worker Project at the liberal Center for American Progress.\n\nRelated: Why Organized Labor Is Organizing Against Obama\n\nMoreover, as White House Press Secretary Jay Carney noted on Tuesday, internal Democratic Party battles over trade issues have gone on for years and no doubt will continue.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t pretend that the wheel has been recreated here when we talk about the differing views that people have on matters of trade expansion,\u201d Carney told reporters.\n\nUniversity of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato says the rift between Obama and labor \u201cisn't particularly wide or intense, at least not yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cLabor may feel like it's getting half a loaf, but in their view Republicans would let them starve \u2013 and they're probably right, since nearly all of labor's money and muscle goes to backing Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cSo labor still has plenty of incentive to support Democrats in the fall.\u201d\n\nA more intriguing question, says Sabato, is whether a serious rift develops between Obama and the environmental movement if the president, in the end, sides with labor, business and the Republicans in allowing construction of the Keystone pipeline to go forward.\n\n\u201cApproval of Keystone would send environmentalists into the ozone-depleted stratosphere,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cIncreasingly, Democrats at the state and local level depend on the environmental community for money and volunteers.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Labor leaders eagerly claimed credit for President Obama\u2019s reelection in November 2012.
