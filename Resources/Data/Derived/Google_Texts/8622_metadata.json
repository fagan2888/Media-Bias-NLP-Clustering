More than half of that deficit growth came from $45 million in lower-than-anticipated Medicaid payments.\n\nThe dispute behind the $45 million in question centers on how to determine how much the federal government should pay for medical care received by people eligible for Medicaid because of the federal health law.\n\nThe federal government pays Connecticut 50 cents for every dollar it spends on care for most Medicaid clients. But beginning in 2014, the reimbursement rate rose to 100 percent for poor adults without minor children who were newly eligible because of Obamacare.\n\nConnecticut was the first state in the country to expand Medicaid as part of the health law, beginning the coverage expansion in 2010. The federal reimbursement rate for their care rose from 50 percent to 100 percent as of Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nBut what if one of those clients went to the hospital in 2013, but the state didn\u2019t pay the bill until 2014?\n\nConnecticut officials have asked the federal government to base the reimbursement percentage on the date care was paid for, rather than when the service occurred. That is, as long as the state paid the bill after the start of 2014, the federal government would pay the full cost, even if the care were delivered in the previous year.\n\nBut federal officials have maintained that to qualify for the full reimbursement, the care must have taken place on or after Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nBarnes wrote that the state is considering options for appealing the federal government\u2019s decision.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Budget/Economy, Health Care, 2014-15 state budget, Affordable Care Act, Medicaid", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/03/25/medicaid-rules-prompt-a-45-million-state-federal-disagreement/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "A $45 million hole in this year\u2019s budget is the result of a disagreement between state and federal officials over how much the federal government should reimburse Connecticut for Medicaid spending for clients who became eligible under Obamacare.", "title": "Medicaid rules prompt a $45 million state-federal disagreement", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/03/25/medicaid-rules-prompt-a-45-million-state-federal-disagreement/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/01/logo-thumb.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/03/25/medicaid-rules-prompt-a-45-million-state-federal-disagreement/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a9f\"", "article_summary": "The federal government pays Connecticut 50 cents for every dollar it spends on care for most Medicaid clients.\nBenjamin Barnes, the governor\u2019s budget director, reported last week that the state\u2019s budget deficit had grown by nearly $72 million to $133 million.\nMore than half of that deficit growth came from $45 million in lower-than-anticipated Medicaid payments.\nThe federal reimbursement rate for their care rose from 50 percent to 100 percent as of Jan. 1, 2014.\nA $45 million hole in this year\u2019s budget is the result of a disagreement between state and federal officials over how much the federal government should reimburse Connecticut for Medicaid spending for clients who became eligible under Obamacare."}
