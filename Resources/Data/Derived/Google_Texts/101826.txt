When the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released health care sign-ups for all ZIP codes using HealthCare.Gov, a strange trend emerged â€“ some conservative states whose governments have fought the law at every turn are signing up the most Americans.

Florida was the standout for enrollment, signing up more than 1.2 million people for 2015 coverage. Although historically Florida has been a swing state in presidential elections, its local government is home of potential Republican candidates for the presidency: Jeb Bush, the state's former governor, and Sen. Marco Rubio.

Florida's decision to avoid Medicaid expansion is one reason for the lead. Without other options, those with incomes above the federal poverty line must sign up for a private plan if they want insurance. Florida also has an older population.

Kaiser Health News also points to successful outreach efforts as one cause of the surging sign-ups. Workers promoting the Affordable Care Act used a heat map similar to the one below to monitor local levels of sign-ups and decide which areas to target.



While this map doesn't take population into account, when selections are mapped as a rate, the same trend emerges. Both rural and urban areas had high plan selection rates, according to Benefitter.

Following the ZIP code data release, HHS also published new enrollment numbers nationwide. At the close of week 10 for health care sign-ups, Americans had selected 7.29 million plans and submitted 9.75 million applications.
