Hail was reported in North Richland Hills, Northlake, Arlington, Mansfield, and north Dallas near White Rock Lake, said meteorologist Lamont Bain with the National Weather Service.\n\nDallas street closures\n\nFourteen streets have been closed as a result of weather as of 5 p.m. Street Services is monitoring the areas.\n\nStreet closures due to weather.

Like the previous Fujita Scale, it classifies tornadoes based on estimated wind speed.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, the old F-Scale\u2019s wind speeds were never scientifically tested or proven and often didn\u2019t take into account different building strengths, wind direction or other factors.\n\n\u201cThese limitations have led to inconsistent rating of tornadoes and, in some cases, an overestimate of tornado wind speeds,\u201d Texas Tech researchers wrote in a 2004 report on the guidelines for the new scale.\n\nThe new methodology, or EF Scale, uses damage classifications for 28 different types of buildings or objects. That includes everything from softwood trees to strip malls and single-family houses.\n\nThe EF Scale then uses the strength of structures and the amount of damage done to them to estimate the speed it would take a three-second wind gust to produce that amount of harm. A tornado event\u2019s eventual rating is an estimate of its highest wind speed, even though its intensity could vary over a geographic area.\n\nWeather watches and warnings\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a wind advisory for North Texas that expires at 8 p.m. \u2014 one more thing atop the list of watches and warnings piled up this devastating holiday weekend.\n\nMatt Bishop, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service\u2019s Fort Worth office, says winds are blowing out of the north 20-30 mph, with occasional gusts of 35-40.\n\nThe advisory now pairs with the flash flood watch that extends until Monday morning as rain continues to fall over most of North Texas.\n\nForecast\n\nJamie Gudmestad, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the Dallas Fort Worth area was seeing a break from the rain about 5 p.m. but showers should return to North Texas on Sunday night, bringing another half-inch before tapering off early Monday morning.\n\nSome of the precipitation could turn to snow, but it won\u2019t be anything more than a few flurries in Dallas-Fort Worth and is not expected to accumulate.\n\nDallas-Fort Worth may experience a \u201clight dusting\u201d of snow between 1 and 8 a.m. Monday, said KXAS-TV (NBC5) meteorologist Remeisha Shade.\n\nBy 10 a.m., the rain will taper off giving way to a sunny and dry week. For the first time ever, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport has collected more than 60 inches of rain in a single year \u2014 61.72 inches, as of 8:50 p.m.\n\nSince midnight Sunday, 1.44 inches of rain fell at D/FW. Less than a half inch is expected overnight, said meteorologist Jesse Moore with the National Weather Service.\n\nFlooding is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a concern today following last night\u2019s catastrophic storms that killed 11 in Garland, Copeville and Blue Ridge.\n\nDan Shoemaker of the National Weather Service says most of the heaviest rains should be just east of Dallas, but \u201csome spots in the area could exceed two inches.\u201d\n\nThe reason: The upper-level low that caused last night\u2019s devastation in conjunction with a cold front remains to the west of Dallas-Fort Worth. And, says Shoemaker, there\u2019s still considerable moisture streaming in from the Gulf Coast just above the surface.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll see showers and storms and still have potential for flooding concerns throughout the day,\u201d says Shoemaker.\n\nAnd it will be cold: Highs will not top the mid-40s Sunday, winds will be strong out of the north, and lows will drop to near freezing, complicating rescue and recovery efforts.\n\nThere\u2019s the chance for some light snow north and west of Dallas overnight and into early Monday; anything we see in Dallas will be light and fleeting around daybreak Monday. It will stay cold throughout the rest of the week, below normal \u2014 highs in the 40s, lows in the 20s and 30s \u2014 thanks to reinforcing shots of cold air.\n\nBut that\u2019s then, and this is now: \u201cToday, it\u2019s essentially 100 percent chance of rain,\u201d Shoemaker said.\n\nStaff writers Claire Cardona and Brandon Formby contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzEyL2FmdGVyLXNhdHVyZGF5cy1jYXRhc3Ryb3BoaWMtc3Rvcm1zLWZsb29kaW5nLWFuZC1jb2xkLW5vdy1hLWNvbmNlcm4tZm9yLXN1bmRheS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Flight cancellations Storms\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0delayed flights at D/FW International Airport and Dallas Love Field.
