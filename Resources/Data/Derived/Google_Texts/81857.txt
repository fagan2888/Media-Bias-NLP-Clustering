Democrats love Obamacare so much they want it written on their cars, for some reason

Not only do the Democrats plan to run on Obamacare in 2014 — their cars might, too.

Because there’s no better way to express affection for terrible public policy than wearing it on your Volvo, the Democratic National Committee has submitted “Thanks, Obamacare” as a choice for its 2014 bumper sticker contest. There are five other designs from which people can choose, including a sticker that simply reads “Democrats!” — doubtlessly the choice of Republican grandfathers across the nation, since they shout the same thing at the television all the time.

Here’s a screengrab of the choices. Do yourself a favor: Don’t get too excited.

If this were a presidential election year, “Like a Boss” would almost certainly be the frontrunner. As it were, folks will be putting their money on taking back the House, which could be characterized in Washington-speak as “a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars.” (The ones they didn’t pay to the government, anyway.)
