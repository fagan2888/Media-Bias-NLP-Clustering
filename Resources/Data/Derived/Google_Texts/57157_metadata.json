When the County did not comply to HUD\u2019s satisfaction, HUD with held the County\u2019s funding,\" the judges wrote in the decision, which agreed with a lower-court finding that the federal agency had the right to withhold the funds.\n\nThe dispute between Westchester County and HUD stems from a 2009 affordable-housing settlement. The settlement requires Westchester to build 750 affordable-housing units in mostly white communities, and to produce an analysis of local zoning codes to pinpoint exclusionary practices. HUD has rejected the county's analysis, though, and held back federal grants meant for projects in the county as result.\n\nThe three judges, Jos\u00e9 A. Cabranes, Reena Raggi and Richard C. Wesley, said that, while their decision means that HUD can withhold funding, they were not taking sides on the larger issue of housing discrimination in Westchester.\n\n\"It bears emphasizing that this decision does not mean that any of Westchester County\u2019s municipalities violated the Fair Housing Act or engaged in discrimination on the basis of race,\" they wrote in the 52 page decision. \"In short, there has been no finding, at any point, that Westchester actually engaged in housing discrimination.\"\n\nWestchester County Executive Rob Astorino said in a statement that the ruling \"vindicates our fight to protect home rule and local zoning.\"\n\nAstorino has proposed a local program to replace money withheld by HUD. The county is no longer seeking additional federal funds under the Community Development Block Grant program to avoid further pressure from HUD to dismantle local zoning.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1KCbKQh", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Appeals court sides largely with federal government in fight over funds linked to Westchester affordable housing settlement", "og": {"site_name": "lohud.com", "description": "Appeals court sides largely with federal government in fight over funds linked to Westchester affordable housing settlement", "title": "Appellate court sides with HUD in Westchester block-grant fight", "url": "http://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/2015/09/26/westchester-housing-appeal/72881194/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/lohud.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Appeals court sides largely with federal government in fight over funds linked to Westchester affordable housing settlement", "title": "Appellate court sides with HUD in Westchester block-grant fight", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8059637e18bc9261d8505790b36f2d96534e12db/c=813-0-3261-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Westchester/B9318628868Z.1_20150828201547_000_G9GBONSQR.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@lohud", "site": "@lohud", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600070416", "fb": {"app_id": 169889109713077}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/jane.lerner.58"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "HUD, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, housing discrimination, Westchester housing discrimination,  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdfea\"", "article_summary": "The court also ruled that HUD can continue to withhold $750,000 in grants from Westchester for 2011.\nWestchester County Executive Rob Astorino said in a statement that the ruling \"vindicates our fight to protect home rule and local zoning.\"\nThe dispute between Westchester County and HUD stems from a 2009 affordable-housing settlement.\nHUD has rejected the county's analysis, though, and held back federal grants meant for projects in the county as result.\n\"In short, there has been no finding, at any point, that Westchester actually engaged in housing discrimination.\""}
