Fresh from a victory at the Supreme Court over his signature health-care law, President Obama said it’s time for opponents to stop attacking the settled policy.

“It is time to stop refighting battles that have been settled again and again,” the president said in his weekly address. “It’s time to move on. With this case behind us, we’re going to keep working to make health care in America even better and more affordable, and to get more people covered.”

The court ruled 6-3 on Thursday to uphold subsidies provided through state health exchanges to people who qualify. Several Republican presidential candidates, and GOP lawmakers, still say they will try to repeal and replace the law.

Mr. Obama said the law’s benefits are clear.

“The law has helped hold the price of health care to its slowest growth in 50 years,” he said. “This law is working exactly as it’s supposed to — and in some ways, better than we expected it to. So far more than 16 million uninsured Americans have gained coverage.”

He added, “This is not some abstract political debate. For all the misinformation campaigns, and doomsday predictions; for all the talk of death panels and job destruction; for all the repeal attempts — this law is helping tens of millions of Americans. This isn’t just about Obamacare. This is health care in America.”
