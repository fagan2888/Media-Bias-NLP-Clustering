Speaking at a campaign event in Iowa this week, Democrat Hillary Clinton said that the Affordable Care Act — keystone legislation for the Obama administration she was a part of — tends to discourage employers from providing full-time positions.

Clinton was responding to a question about why employers seem to favor part-time employment in light of the Family and Medical Leave Act. "Well, that’s why they're going to part-time," Clinton said. "That and also the Affordable Care Act. You know, we've got to change that, because we have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment."

Clinton noted that employers can sometimes avoid the insurance mandates by favoring part-time positions, concluding that as a result "there is a disincentive within our system that we need to deal with." Bonnie Kristian
