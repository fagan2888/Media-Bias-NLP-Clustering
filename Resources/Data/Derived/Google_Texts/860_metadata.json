Not because it\u2019s any good, mind you; it\u2019s completely horrid. No, this is a positive development because it shows they have lost all semblance of self-restraint or awareness of how they sound to anyone not on their mailing list, which can only help quicken their descent to the fringes.\n\nIn response to House Speaker Paul Ryan inviting two of the Little Sisters of the Poor to attend the State of the Union Address, Planned Parenthood tweeted the following:\n\nNever missing an opportunity, @SteveKingIA & @SpeakerRyan used tonight\u2019s #SOTU address to send an anti-abortion message. The disrespect. \u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 13, 2016\n\nFolks, we are officially so far through the looking glass that it\u2019s not in the rearview mirror anymore.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is now officially willing to publicly declare that it considers inviting nuns to a speech offensive. Nuns whose work is purely charitable, who were dragged into the political realm against their wills by the President they were listening to going out of his way to force them to violate their faith, and who are fighting for nothing more than the right to continue serving the elderly poor in peace.\n\nThere sure is disrespect going on here, but it\u2019s not on the Little Sisters\u2019 part.\n\nIf we wanted to indulge them and consider the charge that it\u2019s inappropriate to invite those involved in controversies with the President to his biggest speech of the year, we would remind Planned Parenthood that that ship already sailed thanks to Barack Obama himself. His own guest list was full of people chosen because publicizing their presence sent a variety of political messages\u2014a Syrian refugee, a Muslim immigrant American soldier, the plaintiff in the Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex marriage ruling, and of course the empty seat for gun control.\n\nAnd the signals sent by guests are nothing compared to the actual content of his remarks, which felt far more like a campaign speech than a sober assessment of the condition of the country, full of sniping and posturing on everything from Obamacare and immigration to global warming and food stamps. You can\u2019t watch the main act take potshots at two of the other party\u2019s candidates and then pretend there was any nonpartisan sanctity left for Ryan or the Little Sisters to violate.\n\nMoreover, suppose President Obama had conducted himself in a more dignified, bipartisan manner. So what? A major fact about the state of our union today is that our constitutional right to peacefully exercise our religious convictions as we see fit is under attack. It\u2019s not a campaign talking point; it\u2019s an injustice. And he\u2019s the one responsible. It is entirely appropriate to civilly protest it with this invitation, their presence a dignified, silent reminder to Obama that he\u2019s supposed to be their President, too\u2014and he\u2019s failing them.\n\nSo by all means, Planned Parenthood, attack nuns for attending a presidential speech. Attack them for every imagined slight you can think of. Keep it up. It will work wonders in alienating ordinary Americans at a faster rate than pro-lifers could ever achieve on our own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood tweeted that the invitation of Little Sisters of the Poor and an empty chair for the preborn at the SOTU were gestures of \"disrespect.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "Planned Parenthood tweeted that the invitation of Little Sisters of the Poor and an empty chair for the preborn at the SOTU were gestures of \"disrespect.\"", "title": "Planned Parenthood loses it, calls pro-life gestures at SOTU \"disrespect\"", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 672, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Little-Sisters-of-the-Poor-672.jpg", "height": 372}, "updated_time": "2016-01-14T16:32:33-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/planned-parenthood-loses-it-calls-pro-life-gestures-at-sotu-disrespect/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Planned Parenthood tweeted that the invitation of Little Sisters of the Poor and an empty chair for the preborn at the SOTU were gestures of \"disrespect.\"", "title": "Planned Parenthood loses it, calls pro-life gestures at SOTU \"disrespect\"", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Little-Sisters-of-the-Poor-672.jpg", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "State of the Union", "published_time": "2016-01-15T07:44:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-14T16:32:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Planned Parenthood (@PPact) January 13, 2016Folks, we are officially so far through the looking glass that it\u2019s not in the rearview mirror anymore.\nSo by all means, Planned Parenthood, attack nuns for attending a presidential speech.\nPro-lifers should celebrate one of the latest public statements from Planned Parenthood.\nThere sure is disrespect going on here, but it\u2019s not on the Little Sisters\u2019 part.\nPlanned Parenthood is now officially willing to publicly declare that it considers inviting nuns to a speech offensive."}
