The Department of Defense announced Sunday the death of a soldier who was supporting Operation Freedom's Sentinel.

Master Sgt. Peter A. McKenna Jr., 35, of Bristol, Rhode Island, died Friday in Kabul, Afghanistan, of wounds when he was attacked by enemy small arms fire.

The series of attacks in Kabul Friday included a massive truck bombing targeting a residential area in the capital, which killed at least 44 people and wounded more than 300. Two other attacks included a suicide bomber attacking recruits outside a police academy, as well as the attack on the NATO base.

McKenna was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.
