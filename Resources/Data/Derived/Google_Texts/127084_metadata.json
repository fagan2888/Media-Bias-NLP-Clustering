Mark Udall\u2019s support for Obamacare came back to haunt him again Thursday with the release of figures showing that thousands more Coloradans have had their health insurance policies cancelled.\n\nThe state Division of Insurance said in a letter to the Colorado Senate Republicans that another 2,105 policies were discontinued in August in the aftermath of the Affordable Care Act, bringing the total to 341,666.\n\nThe growing tally has dogged the Democrat Udall in his bid for reelection. Republicans have blasted him for voting in favor of Obamacare and then repeating President Obama\u2019s claim that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\u201d which PolitiFact voted the 2013 \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d\n\nRepublican Rep. Cory Gardner, who\u2019s seeking to unseat Mr. Udall, responded by releasing a video Thursday highlighting the Democrat\u2019s continued support for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMark Udall promised if you liked your plan, you could keep your plan,\u201d says Mr. Gardner in the video. \u201cMark Udall promised if you liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor. Mark Udall lied to the people of Colorado.\u201d\n\nMr. Gardner knows a thing or two about cancelled policies. His family\u2019s insurance plan was among those discontinued in the post-Obamacare upheaval.\n\nWhile the Udall campaign has tried to keep the focus on the \u201cwar on women,\u201d the Gardner camp has hit hard on Obamacare. An ad released last week shows Mr. Gardner standing by a mailbox warning that \u201cmore cancellations are on the way.\u201d\n\nUdall spokesman Mike Saccone countered that the term \u201ccancellation\u201d wasn\u2019t accurate because policyholders were offered an opportunity to renew their coverage.\n\n\u201c[T]he so-called \u2018cancellations\u2019 were not in fact true cancellations because individuals who received these letters were offered the opportunity to re-enroll in their exact same plans,\u201d said Mr. Saccone in an email. \u201cThey were offered that option in said letters, not replacement policies.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama issued a directive in March allowing insurers to delay the ACA\u2019s minimum-coverage requirement until October 2017 if their states allow it. Colorado\u2019s insurance commissioner announced in May that she would allow such an extension through 2015.\n\nA series of emails obtained in January by the website Complete Colorado revealed that Udall staffers pressured state insurance regulators to alter the cancellation figures to reflect the new policy offers.\n\n\u201cWhen we found out the real number, Mark Udall tried to cook the books. He tried to get them to change the number because he was afraid that if the people really found out what happened with Obamacare, that he could lose his election,\u201d says Mr. Gardner in Thursday\u2019s video.\n\n\u201cLook, this isn\u2019t about election year politics,\u201d Mr. Gardner says. \u201cThis is about the people of Colorado.\u201d\n\nPolls show the Senate race locked in a statistical dead heat, but voters are far less divided on Obamacare. A Rasmussen Reports survey released last month found 58 percent of Colorado voters surveyed disapprove of Obamacare, while only 39 percent approve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
