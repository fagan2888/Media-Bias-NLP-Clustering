Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), center, and Roy Blunt (R-MO), right, introduce bipartisan mental health legislation in February CREDIT: National Council For Behavioral Health\n\nCongress took a major step toward passing legislation that funds community resources for mental health care on Thursday, when the Senate Finance Committee adopted the Excellence In Mental Health Act during its markup of the so-called \u201cdoc fix\u201d bill.\n\nSince 1997, lawmakers have been forced to delay implementation of the \u201cSustainable Growth Rate\u201d formula every single year \u2014 a tactic that has come to be called the Medicare \u201cdoc fix\u201d \u2014 to prevent massive cuts in reimbursements to doctors who treat Medicare patients. Elected officials expressed optimism that the doc fix legislation marked up on Thursday may eventually lead to a permanent solution, rather than another temporary stalling measure. Without the doc fix, Medicare doctors could see their pay get cut by 20 percent.\n\nBut media reports have overlooked another unlikely area of progress from Thursday\u2019s markup: the adoption of Sens. Debbie Stabenow\u2019s (D-MI) and Roy Blunt\u2019s (R-MO) stalled Excellence In Mental Health Act as an amendment to the doc fix legislation.\n\nStabenow and Blunt introduced their bill in February, when the horrific mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School \u2014 perpetrated by a man suffering from mental illness \u2014 was still dominating the national conversation. The bipartisan bill has been in congressional limbo ever since, with a series of budget crises and spars over the Affordable Care Act sucking up congressional resources.\n\nThursday\u2019s development represents the biggest step that Congress has taken to expand mental health care in nearly a full year since Sandy Hook. If passed, the bill will \u201cestablish criteria for certified community behavioral health clinics to ensure the providers cover a broad range of mental health services \u2014 including 24-hour crisis care, increased integration of physical, mental, and substance abuse treatment so they are treated simultaneously rather than separately, and expanded support for families of people living with mental health issues,\u201d according to a press release from Stabenow\u2019s office. The version passed in committee today would set up federally-funded pilot programs in 10 states to expand access to mental health care along those lines.\n\n\u201cOur bipartisan bill expands access to care and improves quality of care so people living with mental illness can get the treatment they need,\u201d said Stabenow in a statement. \u201cInstead of merely talking about this issue in the wake of tragedies, it is time for Congress to finally take action.\u201d\n\nOther bipartisan federal legislation such as the Mental Health First Aid Act and Mental Health In Schools Act are still stuck in Congress. On Thursday, Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) \u2014 a former psychologist \u2014 introduced his own legislation aiming to boost outpatient mental health care, make it easier for Americans in rural regions to get treatment, and create behavioral health awareness programs for teens to reduce the stigma of mental illness among young people.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The Senate Finance Committee adopted the Excellence In Mental Health Act as an amendment to the so-called \"doc fix\" bill on Thursday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The Senate Finance Committee adopted the Excellence In Mental Health Act as an amendment to the so-called \"doc fix\" bill on Thursday.", "title": "The Senate Just Took A Big Step Toward Expanding Mental Health Care While No One Was Looking", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/12/3057971/senate-mental-health-care/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mentalhealth-e1360168972828.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Senate Finance Committee adopted the Excellence In Mental Health Act as an amendment to the so-called \"doc fix\" bill on Thursday.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mentalhealth-e1360168972828-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Senate Just Took A Big Step Toward Expanding Mental Health Care While No One Was Looking", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mentalhealth-e1360168972828.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/mentalhealth-e1360168972828.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-12T17:12:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc12f\"", "article_summary": "Health The Senate Just Took A Big Step Toward Expanding Mental Health Care While No One Was Looking CREDIT: ShutterstockSens.\nThursday\u2019s development represents the biggest step that Congress has taken to expand mental health care in nearly a full year since Sandy Hook.\nThe version passed in committee today would set up federally-funded pilot programs in 10 states to expand access to mental health care along those lines.\nDebbie Stabenow\u2019s (D-MI) and Roy Blunt\u2019s (R-MO) stalled Excellence In Mental Health Act as an amendment to the doc fix legislation.\nDebbie Stabenow (D-MI), center, and Roy Blunt (R-MO), right, introduce bipartisan mental health legislation in February CREDIT: National Council For Behavioral HealthCongress took a major step toward passing legislation that funds community resources for mental health care on Thursday, when the Senate Finance Committee adopted the Excellence In Mental Health Act during its markup of the so-called \u201cdoc fix\u201d bill."}
