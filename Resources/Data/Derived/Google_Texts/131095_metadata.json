President Barack Obama's divisive politics and destructive policies are tearing our nation apart. Worst of all, America's workers are getting punched in the gut.\n\nNevadans have seen first-hand what happens when Washington recklessness, personal greed and irresponsibility collide \u2014 bubbles burst, businesses go bust and families suffer.\n\nToday, people are still hurting. Across Clark County, things remain rough. Last week's jobs report showed that Nevada has the highest unemployment rate of any state in the country. Even if Washington bureaucrats fail to report it, many have been forced into early retirement.\n\nUnlike most Washington and Wall Street elites, I actually know a thing or two about working-class Americans living in the real world. My blood is not blue, but my collar is.\n\nI'm a Republican, but not because I grew up rich. I'm a Republican because I didn't want to spend the rest of my life poor, waiting for the government to rescue me.\n\nI've been outspoken and some have labeled me a populist. The truth is, I'm a proud American who just thinks we should put our workers first. I'm frustrated with the Washington establishment that undermines and undercuts Nevada's working families.\n\nWe discourage hard work with liberal policies that weaken America. Why are we punishing those who work and rewarding those who don't?\n\nWe refuse to secure the border, endangering our national security and flooding our country with illegal immigrants who undercut the wages of American workers.\n\nWe spend $2.2 trillion on Obamacare to reform our health care system. But today, simple check-ups, hospital stays and basic medicines are more expensive than ever.\n\nWe bail out \"too big to fail\" Wall Street banks while \"too small to save\" Nevada families, miners and small businesses are punished with big government taxes and one-size-fits-all Washington mandates.\n\nAs governor of Arkansas, I turned my state around. I cut taxes, slashed welfare and balanced the budget for 10 straight years \u2014 despite facing the most Democratic legislature in the country.\n\nAs the dust settles from Nevada's economic whiplash, Washington needs to wake up and turn things around. Politicians need to quit fighting over the minimum wage and focus on solutions that help each American earn their maximum wage.\n\nNevada deserves a thriving economy in which employees and employers can achieve more, do more, earn more and prosper. We need to restore our country's promise so that the American dream is just as accessible to those on Main Street as it is to those on Wall Street.\n\nAfter all, America wasn't built on settling for the minimum. It was built on striving for the maximum. We should:\n\n\u25a0 Abolish the IRS and pass the Fair Tax. Let's encourage hard work and productivity \u2014 not tax American wages.\n\n\u25a0 Secure the border, repeal Obama's executive orders, oppose amnesty and protect jobs for American workers.\n\n\u25a0 Protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare for seniors. That starts by repealing Obamacare, which raided $700 billion from the Medicare Trust Fund.\n\n\u25a0 Break the cycle of government dependency. The only proven poverty reduction program is personal responsibility.\n\nIt's going to take more than simple solutions to fix a broken Washington.\n\nWe need a strategy. From tax, trade and telecommunications to education, immigration and health care, we should boil down every issue to the bone: helping Americans achieve their maximum wage.\n\nLet's put our country back on track by fighting for prosperity and purpose for all.\n\nThis column was originally published in The Las Vegas Review-Journal.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Washington is out of control.
