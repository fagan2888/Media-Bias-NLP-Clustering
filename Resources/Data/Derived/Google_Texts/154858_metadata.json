Now, RNC chair Reince Priebus is using the Williams story to highlight that Clinton episode in a deliberately-provocative letter to DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the letter, obtained \u201cexclusively\u201d by Breitbart, Priebus asks Wasserman Schultz if the Democratic Party has \u201csuspended\u201d Clinton in the same way NBC News has put Williams on an extended hiatus as Nightly News anchor.\n\nRead the full text of the letter below:\n\nDear Debbie: As you have undoubtedly noticed, Hillary Clinton, your presumptive 2016 nominee and President Obama\u2019s heir apparent, has been hiding from the public. We at the RNC, like many Americans, have been wondering why. After hearing about Brian Williams\u2019s recent suspension at NBC for telling false stories about coming under fire in war zones, we thought perhaps the DNC had also \u201csuspended\u201d Mrs. Clinton for her similar fabrications. As you remember, she once told a harrowing tale of \u201clanding under sniper fire\u201d in Bosnia, only to have her story completely debunked when a video showed her walking casually on the tarmac. So, have you given Mrs. Clinton the Brian Williams treatment? Is that why she\u2019s gone missing? If that\u2019s not the case, do you rebuke her fabrications in the same way that NBC has rebuked their star news anchor? Will the DNC conduct research into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s other past statement to ensure that she is being honest with the American people? If not, I\u2019m sure we can help with that. Sincerely, Reince Priebus\n\nPriebus and the GOP have been promoting a #HillarysHiding hashtag on Twitter recently, criticizing the former secretary of state for not actively campaigning for president before she made an official announcement:\n\nAnyone seen Hillary? http://t.co/dW6pOTsW8p #HillarysHiding pic.twitter.com/ALlHM34YSU \u2014 Reince Priebus (@Reince) February 12, 2015\n\n[Photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the days since Brian Williams first recanted his story about getting shot at by RPG fire while flying in a helicopter over Iraq, maybe commentators have", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-12-at-4.56.37-PM.png", "title": "Reince Priebus: Has DNC \u2018Suspended\u2019 Hillary Clinton Like Brian Williams?"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the days since Brian Williams first recanted his story about getting shot at by RPG fire while flying in a helicopter over Iraq, maybe commentators have drawn parallels to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign story about coming under sniper fire during a visit Bosnia in 1996, which was later proven to be untrue.", "title": "Reince Priebus: Has DNC 'Suspended' Hillary Clinton Like Brian Williams?", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-12-at-4.56.37-PM.png", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-02-12T20:06:47+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "http://t.co/dW6pOTsW8p #HillarysHiding pic.twitter.com/ALlHM34YSU \u2014 Reince Priebus (@Reince) February 12, 2015[Photo via screengrab]\u2014 \u2014>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter\nNow, RNC chair Reince Priebus is using the Williams story to highlight that Clinton episode in a deliberately-provocative letter to DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\nSo, have you given Mrs. Clinton the Brian Williams treatment?\nRead the full text of the letter below:Dear Debbie: As you have undoubtedly noticed, Hillary Clinton, your presumptive 2016 nominee and President Obama\u2019s heir apparent, has been hiding from the public.\nAfter hearing about Brian Williams\u2019s recent suspension at NBC for telling false stories about coming under fire in war zones, we thought perhaps the DNC had also \u201csuspended\u201d Mrs. Clinton for her similar fabrications."}
