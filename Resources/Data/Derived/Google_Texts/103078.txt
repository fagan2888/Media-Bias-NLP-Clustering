WASHINGTON -– Former Vice President Dick Cheney on Sunday accused Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) of lying by claiming he and Cheney are fishing buddies.

Enzi mentioned his relationship with Cheney in a profile published Wednesday in the Daily Beast, noting that the former vice president had been a long-time supporter. “I thought we were friends,” Enzi said.

But Cheney, whose daughter Liz is challenging Enzi in the state's Republican primary, denied that he and Enzi ever went fishing together.

"Well, Mike also said he and I are fishing buddies, which is simply not true. Never happened," Dick Cheney said Sunday on ABC's "This Week."

"The fact of the matter is, Washington is not going to elect the next senator from Wyoming," he said. "The people of Wyoming will elect that senator."

Liz Cheney's challenge to Enzi, a popular three-term senator, has sparked significant intra-party tension in Wyoming. Enzi has said that he was surprised by Cheney's July announcement that she would be taking him on in the primary.
