The suit claims Anthem breached customer\u2019s trust.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to cancel a credit card \u2013 that\u2019s not a problem. But you can\u2019t cancel your social security number,\u201d said Lynn Toops, an attorney with Cohen and Malad. \u201cSo this is a whole new set of issues that these people are having to deal with.\u201d\n\nToops said the firm has been flooded with calls since the breach was announced earlier this week, including a woman Friday morning who just learned a fraudulent tax return had been filed in her name. The woman also believes a home loan may have been taken out in her name as well.\n\nThe lawsuit asks for full damages for customers for the hassles, stress and potential for identity theft they now face.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking 80 million people whose names, addresses and social security numbers are now in the hands of thieves and they are going to be subject to and already are subject to identity theft,\u201d Toops said \u201cAnd, Anthem needs to make it right for them.\u201d\n\nFinance expert Peter Dunn said the breach is 1,000 times worse than the recent Target and Home Depot breaches combined. Dunn said the information stolen in the Anthem breach is the \u201cskeleton key\u201d to someone\u2019s credit \u2013 everything thieves need to open a credit line. He urges everyone to place a security freeze on their credit \u2013 which prevents anyone from opening new credit lines in your name \u2013 calling it a good practice.\n\n\u201cIt does not affect your current credit lines, it will not prevent you from getting a job or a house or a car or renting anything \u2013 you just have to make sure you unfreeze it before someone runs your credit to borrow money,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cIt\u2019s good practices and it\u2019s not alarmist. I mean it truly is rooting out the problem at the base level.\u201d\n\nPlacing a security freeze is free for Indiana residents and can be done with each of the three credit reporting agencies, or through the Indiana Attorney General\u2019s website. A freeze can be temporarily or permanently lifted at any time.\n\nClick here to find out more about a security freeze.
