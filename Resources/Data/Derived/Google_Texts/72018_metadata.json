They hate them.\n\nThey think conservatives are either evil, dumb, or both.\n\nIn Bush-Cheney, liberals had one of the greatest joys of their lifetimes, a moment during which they believed they had both dumb and evil in the same White House. It left them never wanting for jokes, snide remarks, and the sneering condescension they love to inflict \u2013 ooh, it makes them feel so good inside, so morally and intellectually robust. Oh such glorious Cro Magnon outrage against the Neanderthals!\n\nReagan of course was The Golden Age, evil and dumb embodied in the same individual. Then George H.W. Bush was elected, and he didn\u2019t seem particularly dumb or evil to them. Liberals weren\u2019t enjoying themselves at all, so they quickly elected Bill Clinton.\n\nRomney was undeniably smart and didn\u2019t seem very evil. The Obama campaign threw all sorts of dirt at him, though I don\u2019t think average voters failed to support him because they thought he was really a bad guy.\n\nBut for true liberals, if dumbness can\u2019t be located in a conservative, there must be evil in there somewhere. I recently spoke with a lefty \u2013 actually, speaking isn\u2019t exactly what we were doing \u2013 who exclaimed to me, \u201cRomney was a whore!\u201d\n\nReally? Romney? A whore?\n\nObama was sold to us as a new kind of politician who was above politics and could build bridges and blah blah blah blah blah.\n\nExcuse me, I\u2019m not done.\n\nBlah blah blah blah blah.\n\nBut he\u2019s just another liberal POLITICIAN who harbors the standard, stereotypical, unintellectual view of conservatives as dumb morons motivated by ill will toward their fellow man, and certainly, fellow woman.\n\nAnd so, even as the wounded and dead were being accounted for following a mass shooting Monday morning a couple of miles away, Obama couldn\u2019t live the with prospect of having to delay sinking his teeth into his conservative opponents. He\u2019d spent weeks being nice as he courted their support for his Syria bombing campaign. I mean, enough was enough.\n\nAnd so we got this:\n\nAre some of these folks really so beholden to one extreme wing of their party that they\u2019re willing to tank the entire economy just because they can\u2019t get their way on this issue? Are they really willing to hurt people just to score political points? I hope not.\n\nAs you and I have discussed during our secret Tea Party meetings that liberals don\u2019t know about, we need to do a much better job hurting people. It\u2019s great that we\u2019re oppressing the poor and locking the doors to the middle class, but we\u2019ve got much more work to do.\n\nI try to hurt someone before breakfast, and I think you should too. It\u2019s a good routine and gets the day off to a nice start. At least torture an animal. Hurt a child if you can (don\u2019t get physical, just give them a cigarette or a Ring Ding), put a black person in \u201cback in chains\u201d (How did Biden find out about this? Have one of you been leaking information from out meetings?) or, if you\u2019re a dude, write the Republican Party to see what role you can play as a soldier in the war on women.\n\nWait a second, though. Obama also said this:\n\nAnd as far as the budget goes, it\u2019s time for responsible Republicans who share these goals \u2014 and there are a number of folks out there who I think are decent folks, I\u2019ve got some disagreements with them on some issues, but I think genuinely want to see the economy grow and want what\u2019s best for the American people \u2014 it\u2019s time for those Republicans to step up and they\u2019ve got to decide what they want to prioritize.\n\nDid you see that? He said, there are a number of folks out there who I think are decent folks. That is, while most of us on the right are awful, there actually are \u201ca number\u201d of us who are \u201cdecent.\u201d\n\nIt could be me! I might be a decent fellow after all! It could be you!\n\nThank God. He\u2019s not completely onto us. Let\u2019s make sure we keep a better lid on those meetings lest he discover the truth.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddba8\"", "article_summary": "Blah blah blah blah blah.\nObama was sold to us as a new kind of politician who was above politics and could build bridges and blah blah blah blah blah.\nAs any of you who are conservative and who has had an argument with a liberal know \u2013 and I realize that includes most of you \u2013 liberals don\u2019t just disagree with conservatives.\nThey think conservatives are either evil, dumb, or both.\nAs you and I have discussed during our secret Tea Party meetings that liberals don\u2019t know about, we need to do a much better job hurting people."}
