After a frigid winter and a wet spring, New Jersey has earned it — a perfect Memorial Day.

"Tomorrow we'll get our first taste of summer," said Jim Bunker, observing program leader with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly.

The forecast calls for a healthy dose of sunshine, with temperatures hitting the low 80s at the beach and the mid 80s in the rest of the state.

After a possibility of some light showers in North Jersey tonight, the clouds will part, Bunker said. There is no chance of rain on Memorial Day.

A gentle southwest wind will help make it "the perfect day for the beach," Bunker said.

If you find yourself back in the office after the holiday is over, the forecast should help to hold off the summertime blues — a storm front will blow in from the Midwest Tuesday night, bringing thunderstorms for the later half of the week.
