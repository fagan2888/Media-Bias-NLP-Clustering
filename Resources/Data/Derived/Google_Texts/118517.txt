What have you done for me lately?

That’s the question that airlines are asking Airbus Group and Boeing, forcing the plane makers to think about what aircraft airlines will want to fly in the decades ahead even before they’ve got their newest planes in the sky.

The reality is the market can change fast in an industry which has notoriously long lead times for developing and building new product. In the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, a move by one player can have a knock-on effect on the other.

The decision by Airbus to revamp its A330 wide-body jet at the same time as it rolls out its new-generation A350 plane is a case in point.

The European plane maker is trying to catch up with unexpectedly strong demand for twin-engine long-distance jets, ones bigger than short-haul aircraft but not as big as the gas-guzzling jumbo jets Airbus and Boeing have built in the past.

When Airbus launched the A350 program, it decided to first build the A350-900, then move to a smaller A350-800 model and the stretched A350-1000 also due in 2017. Demand for the smaller A350-800 proved slack.

So Airbus has effectively ditched it. The similarly-sized A330neo is headed for delivery from 2017 and promises to be 14% more fuel efficient than the existing A330.

Boeing, meanwhile, has booked more than 250 orders for the 777X, the new version of its existing twin-engine wide-body plane, since its launch in November at the Dubai air show. The Chicago-based company is confident it has plenty more customers lining up.

Airbus has no competitor plane for the 777X which is bigger than the A350 but not as big as Airbus’s four-engined A380 super jumbo.

That has led to suggestions Airbus may try a further stretch of the A350, notionally called the A350-1100. The TrentXWB, the Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC engine that powers the jet, has extra thrust capability beyond what is needed for the A350-1000, so that is not a limiting factor.

“It would be an interesting thing to do but I don’t feel like it is a priority we should be worrying about now,” said Tom Williams, Airbus executive vice president for programs. “The guys should be really focused on what they are doing on the A350-900 and the 1000.”

At Boeing, however, the impending arrival of the A330neo also has led to head scratching.

One idea is to revive the out-of-production 757. Others could be more shrink or stretch versions of the Dreamliner.
