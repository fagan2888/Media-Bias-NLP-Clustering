Clary/Agency France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nAMC President Charlie Collier had one major job when it came to marketing the final season of \u201cMad Men\u201d: \u201cTo put it in the hall of fame.\u201d\n\nThe second leg of the hit drama\u2019s seventh and final season begins April 5, and while the show has already been a critical darling with an upscale audience, AMC is giving it an extra marketing push through the finish line.\n\nOne task has been to excite Madison Avenue types. After all, the show is about the advertising industry.\n\nMr. Collier said that a top ad executive told him his firm was participating in \u201cMad Men Dining Week,\u201d a promotion offering lunchtime prix-fixe menus and cocktails at some Manhattan staples like Barbetta. To be sure, ad men and women these days aren\u2019t allowed to get as sauced at lunch as Don and Roger did in the 60s.\n\nAnd outside of the Time-Life Building in New York, where Don Draper held court at the show\u2019s fictional ad agency, AMC has set up a \u201cDraper Bench\u201d reminiscent of the silhouetted \u201cMad Men\u201d title sequence. At the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens, diehards can tour a new exhibit with sets, props and scripts from the show.\n\nMr. Collier said AMC was also making a digital push though things like celebrity tribute videos. In one spot, for example, comedian Sarah Silverman discusses how she missed out on being cast in the series.\n\nIt has been a busy few days for Mr. Collier. CMO Today spoke with him as he waited to fly out of Los Angeles, where AMC on Wednedsday hosted a black-tie f\u00eate debuting the show\u2019s last premiere episode.\n\nMr. Collier was headed to Washington, where The Smithsonian Museum of American History will add \u201cMad Men\u201d materials to its collection.\n\n\u201cNext to Archie Bunker\u2019s chair will be elements of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce,\u201d Mr. Collier said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "AMC President Charlie Collier had one major job when it came to marketing the final season of \"Mad Men\": \"To put it in the hall of fame.\"The second leg of the hit drama's seventh and final season begins April 5, and while the show has already been a ratings bonanza and critical darling, AMC is giving it an extra marketing push through the finish line.One task has been to excite Madison Avenue types.
