Her job took her to China, the Middle East, Europe and other parts of the world. Before that she was with Sunoco in Tulsa, doing similar work.\n\nEarlier, Cox was a career counselor for Resonance Inc., helping women re-enter the workforce, and then was executive director of Leadership Tulsa.\n\nWhile in that position, she met a lot of people in the nonprofit world, including Day, and she eventually was invited to be on the OCCJ board.\n\n\"This is a great organization. I just loved it\" from the start, Cox said. \"It has always been its mission that really gets my attention.\"\n\nHer son and daughter, now adults, attended OCCJ's Camp Anytown, a human relations summer camp for high school students.\n\n\"At first they said, 'Oh, Mom, do we really need to do that?' But they went, and they both loved it,\" Cox said.\n\nDuring her time in Houston, she kept up with what was going on in Tulsa and at OCCJ. When Day told her she was retiring, she was immediately interested in the position.\n\n\"I've always thought that some day I would come back to Tulsa, but the idea that I could come back in this way, and be at OCCJ, was just mind-boggling and incredible to me.\"\n\nNow that her traveling days are over, she said, she can't wait to get a dog.\n\nLooking back on her career, she said, \"It's like everything I ever did has pointed toward doing this.\"\n\nCox said progress has been made in human relations in the U.S.\n\n\"Look where we've come from,\" she said. \"But there's still a lot of work to do.\"\n\nShe said OCCJ's emphasis on education will continue.\n\n\"Nelson Mandela said education is the most powerful thing you can use to change the world. And that's what OCCJ does. We use education to make people's lives better and help people understand.\n\n\"Prejudice is usually born out of a lack of education.\"\n\nCox said that in the future, OCCJ will have to deal with the changing demographics of the community.\n\n\"In the next few years, the minorities are going to become the majority. So what does that mean for an organization like ours? We need to look at those kinds of things and be prepared to address community concerns,\" she said.\n\nCox described Tulsa as a \"very welcoming\" community, and part of OCCJ's mission is to make it even more so.\n\n\"That's also good for economic development and for business,\" she said. \"If we raise kids who treat people with respect, and they grow up in a community where they're respected, they're going to be confident to go out and do things in the world.\n\n\"If everybody feels valued, and they're succeeding in the community, then businesses are going to thrive.\n\n\"I think it's essential that we do this work.\"\n\nCox described herself as a deeply patriotic person who takes seriously the ideals of liberty and justice for all, and who sometimes cries during the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n\"We're all lucky to be born in this country, at this time,\" she said. \"It's just a miracle, an accident of God.\"", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "The next head of the Oklahoma Center for Community and Justice is a Tulsa native who is thrilled to be moving back to her hometown.", "title": "Oklahoma Center for Community and Justice hires Jayme Cox as CEO", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/religion/oklahoma-center-for-community-and-justice-hires-jayme-cox-as/article_cece480b-ad00-55a4-9c24-242c47442a51.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/9b/d9b76a8f-fdbe-59c9-b5a0-30b1168871e4/52ac10f171dd5.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C334", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The next head of the Oklahoma Center for Community and Justice is a Tulsa native who is thrilled to be moving back to her hometown.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "cox,oklahoma,tulsa,community,occj,justice,center,education,executive,jayme,religion,local,news", "news_keywords": "cox,oklahoma,tulsa,community,occj,justice,center,education,executive,jayme,religion,local,news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe048f\"", "article_summary": "The next head of the Oklahoma Center for Community and Justice is a Tulsa native who is thrilled to be moving back to her hometown.\nCox described Tulsa as a \"very welcoming\" community, and part of OCCJ's mission is to make it even more so.\nCox said that in the future, OCCJ will have to deal with the changing demographics of the community.\n\"If everybody feels valued, and they're succeeding in the community, then businesses are going to thrive.\n\"I couldn't be more excited and energized by this opportunity,\" Cox said in an interview before an OCCJ board meeting Thursday in Tulsa."}
