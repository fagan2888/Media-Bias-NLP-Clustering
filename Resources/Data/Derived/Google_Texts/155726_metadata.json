So what connects those dependencies?\n\n\"Addiction is a memory, it's a reflex. It's training your brain in something which is harmful to yourself,\" says Dr. Charles P. O'Brien, co-founder of the Center for Studies of Addiction at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nBrain imaging shows that associations with the addiction \u2014 pictures, odors or people \u2014 make the brain light up, even a month after a person has quit. \"It's a reflex. They don't have to think about it,\" O'Brien tells Weekend Edition host Rachel Martin.\n\nThere have been many advances in treatment, he says, including medication that can minimize the euphoria an alcoholic feels when drinking. But O'Brien says combining various treatments is the best approach.\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn whether Alcoholics Anonymous is effective\n\nI tell all my students that they should learn about the AA groups in their area ... and they should be proud of it, because it's an American invention that doesn't make any money for anyone \u2014 it's free. It's not violent, and it only helps people.\n\nAnd unfortunately, A.A. groups contain well-intentioned people, but they don't have the kind of information and training that they need to be good therapists. And I always refer all of my patients to an A.A. group as an adjunct \u2014 but it is not treatment.\n\nOn treating underlying problems\n\nWe also have evidence from randomized trials showing that patient-treatment matching is in general the best way to go. So that means essentially, you evaluate the patient, you find out about their problems \u2014 whether they're marriage problems, depression problems or whatever \u2014 and then you focus on that in addition to the drinking. So patients are different, even though at its core, addiction is similar.\n\nThe unanswered questions about addiction\n\nOne of the most vexing problems for me is to see all the progress that's been made and to see how little this has permeated the medical profession and the specialists that run the treatment programs.\n\nYou know, there's a lot of rigidity in these therapists, and I think that something good is happening today since the people who framed the Affordable Care Act decided that all people with substance abuse disorders should be treated ... and I hope that doctors will begin to learn about the benefits of these new medications.\n\nDoes someone with a history of alcoholism have to give up drinking?\n\nI think that, in general, the safest thing is to be totally abstinent. Now, what we've learned, based on scientific articles, is that going from being a very heavy drinker to just a moderate drinker is better for your health and for your behavior and so forth, but it's also risky.\n\nSo that those very heavy drinkers who don't become abstinent but rather just reduce the level of drinking, they're at a higher risk for slipping all the way back to the worst kind of drinking. So I tell my patients that the best thing is to totally stop.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "Addiction can come in a lot of forms, but the defining characteristics are the same.
