John Kasich is campaigning with a \u201csense of calm\u201d in a very small state where he\u2019ll \u201clive or die.\u201d\n\nGov. Kasich\u2019s \u201csense of calm\u201d may sound Zen-like, but once results of the latest CNN/WMUR are considered, it\u2019s more like he\u2019s whistling past his own graveyard. In the poll, John Kasich falls to sixth place with just two percent of poll participants. Not good for the crusty CEO who\u2019s pinned his hopes for a second run for the White House exclusively on the Granite State.\n\nKasich Takes Big Hit In Pew Research\n\nMore bad news comes to Gov. Kasich in a look at the candidates by the Pew Research group. \u201cA year before the next president takes office, voters are skeptical that any of the leading 2016 candidates would make a good president,\u201d the report said. \u201cMoreover, of nine candidates included in the survey, far more voters say each would make a \u2018terrible\u2019 than \u2018great\u2019 president.\u201d\n\nLooking at four GOP candidates, John Kasich, along with Ben Carson, Chris Christie and Jeb Bush, are more negative than positive, on balance, Pew notes. \u201cWhile 17% say Kasich would make a good or great president, 25% say he would be poor or terrible, and 31% think he would be average; 27% of Republican voters express no opinion about Kasich possibly becoming president, the highest percentage among GOP candidates.\u201d\n\nKasich Misleads NH Legislature On Medicaid Expansion\n\nOne of a couple GOP candidates who accepted an offer to briefly address New Hampshire\u2019s legislature, the largest in the nation at 400, Gov. Kasich made his off-beat claim that by accepting Medicaid expansion as part of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act he\u2019s bringing Ohio money back home.\n\n\u201cI took $14 billion dollars over the next two years back to Ohio from Washington to meet our challenges, and you did it here,\u201d he told Granite State legislators who earn the paltry sum of $100 per year. \u201cI want to compliment you for it. Lives have been saved; people have some hope.\u201d\n\nHis one-time good buddy, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has gone a little sour on the Wizard of Westerville. \u201cI\u2019ve heard John called a lot of things \u2014 the Prince of Light and Hope has never been one of them,\u201d he told Fox News, reports said. Gov. Christie added that John Kasich \u201csounds a heck of a lot more like Satan than the Prince of Light and Hope when he is attacking other candidates.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s campaign touts it\u2019s many endorsements from former or current state-level politicos and its bulked-up ground game, including five offices with 15 full-time staff members working front doors and phones, as \u201cCaptains For Kasich\u201d do their Granite State best to keep the petulant plutocrat from bowing out early if he doesn\u2019t finish at least second or third once real primary voting starts on Feb. 9.\n\nPalin Out Rogues Kasich\n\nWhile Gov. Kasich crisscrosses the \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d state in his big, shiny bus with a ticking debt clock on it, Donald John Trump got another passenger on his big shiny jet Tuesday when Sarah Palin rose from GOP shadows to endorse him. Palin, who gained fame from being John McCain\u2019s 2008 pick for vice president and won fortune with reality TV shows and being a Fox News commentator, was at her rhetorically confounding best when she touted The Donald in Iowa.\n\nSinging his praises with rhetorical flourishes that even the New York Times had problems translating into real English people could understand, the \u201cyou betcha\u201d former governor of Alaska showed she hasn\u2019t lost a step when it comes to speechifying that defies gravity with fabulous floating phrases that make playing bullshit bingo as easy as child\u2019s play.\n\n\u201cSarah Palin\u2019s meandering, fiery, sarcastic, patriotic and blustery speech endorsing Donald J. Trump for president on Tuesday in Ames, Iowa, does not easily submit to categorization,\u201d the NYT said, describing Mrs. Palin\u2019s talk as \u201cperformance art, a filibuster, even slam poetry.\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone by Sarah Palin, whose political and personal persona may be as divisive as his own, John Kasich is legend for his unique style of performance art. A record of Kasich favorites would have to include the always cloudy refrain that the Republican Party is \u201cmy vehicle, not my master,\u201d or how about \u201ctripping over ant hills on the way to the pyramids\u201d or solid standards like \u201clink arms to climb a mountain\u201d and the every popular \u201cI\u2019m an unorthodox politician because I\u2019m normal.\u201d Over his four decades as a performance politico, Ohio\u2019s term-limited governor has uttered oracle gems that leave his listeners, especially the Greek Chorus of Ohio and New Hampshire reporters who just report what he says, never asking him to explain what he say, scratching their heads in bewilderment.\n\nJohn Kasich likes to say, \u201cI\u2019m not a scripted person.\u201d This enables him to say babble that makes headlines but remains mostly murky. He expressed wonderment that such a trait could be considered a drawback. \u201cThat\u2019s bizarre to me, because what do we want, robots?\u201d\n\n\u201cI try to drive (voters) to the light, not the dark,\u201d said the Catholic raised Mr. Kasich, the AP reported. The term-limited governor\u2019s new analogy, one that reporters who follow him know is ripe for ridicule, is about, what else, driving a bus.\n\n\u201cYou know, if I were the bus driver, I wouldn\u2019t be doing what some of our people in our race are doing, and that\u2019s looking in the rear view mirror,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIf you really want to be a great bus driver, you\u2019re looking way at the car up front. If you want to be a great leader, you look way out there, not in the rear view mirror.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, when he became Ohio\u2019s 69th governor by just two percentage points, then Governor-elect John Kasich warned his enemies and detractors that he would run the bus over them if they didn\u2019t heave-to for him. He bloated state spending to the highest levels in state history while short-changing local governments and schools by billions. He then redistributed those confiscated revenues in the form of income tax cuts that disproportionately benefited Ohio\u2019s wealthiest over common tax filers who actually ended up paying more.\n\nGov. Kasich had held steady in making his resume his central selling point as being the best qualified among the crowded field of GOP candidates vying for the presidency. That\u2019s an exercise in rear-view mirrorism if ever there was one, but that doesn\u2019t trouble him or reporters who will be trailing him.\n\nInscrutability is a valued commodity to Kasich\u2019s performance art and political salesmanship, as he\u2019s shown from his early days in Congress through his last five years as Ohio\u2019s governor.\n\nBut with Sarah Palin back in the ballgame, speaking for and campaigning with Donald Trump, she will continue to befuddle. John Kasich, a black-belt befuddler himself, has likely met his match when it comes to speaking English that makes little sense .", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Plunderbund", "description": "With three weeks until the primary in New Hampshire, the Associated Press reported last week that Ohio Gov.
