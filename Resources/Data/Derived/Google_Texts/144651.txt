Whether you call them sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), one thing is true: Women are at risk of infection. Not only does a woman’s anatomy make her vulnerable to STIs, women are less likely to have symptoms than men. Untreated STIs can lead to serious health issues, including infertility, cancer, and even death. It’s not fun to think about, but protecting yourself from STIs like genital herpes, genital warts, chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV is an important part of staying healthy.

Here are six ways to protect yourself from STIs:

Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, taking steps to protect yourself is easier than ever. Most insurers must cover STI screening, counseling, and HPV vaccination services at no cost to you, even if you haven’t met your yearly deductible.

If you think you may have been exposed to infection, get tested right away. The sooner you get a diagnosis, the sooner you can start treatment and reduce the risk of spreading it to others. Find a testing site near you.

Remember, it’s your body. By taking steps to protect yourself, you can lower your risk for STIs. Please share this important reminder with the teen girls and women in your life.
