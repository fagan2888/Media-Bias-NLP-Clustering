Sept. 13, 2013 -- The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, already has brought big changes to the U.S. health care system.

You may have gotten a refund check from your health insurance company, for example. Or maybe the last time you visited your doctor you weren’t charged for some preventive services like vaccines, certain cancer screening tests, and tests for heart disease and diabetes.

And more change is coming.

This fall, many people will start shopping for beefed-up health coverage through new online Marketplaces, also called Exchanges. The new policies will take effect in January, and people who don't have adequate insurance coverage in 2014 may face a penalty on the taxes they file in 2015.

Feeling lost about what all this means for you? A recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that slightly more than half of all Americans (51%) say they're still not sure what the health care reform law means for them. About 4 in 10 people aren’t sure if the law is still in effect. (It is.)

If you count yourself among the confused, don't fret. This article covers seven surprising things you need to know about this brave new world of required health insurance coverage.
