Instead of fighting in Syria, he said Hezbollah should have focused on archenemy Israel.\n\n\u201cI say that the guns should be directed toward the Israeli enemy,\u201d Jumblatt added.\n\nJumblatt \u2014 whose Druse are like Assad\u2019s Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam \u2014 has been known for his shifting loyalties. His history with Hezbollah has been both complex and full of U-turns.\n\nAfter the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Jumblatt sharply criticized Hezbollah and the Syrian government, which many in Lebanon blamed for the killing. Damascus denies it was behind Hariri\u2019s slaying.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP Interview: Druse head scorns Hezbollah on Syria", "title": "AP Interview: Druse head scorns Hezbollah on Syria", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP Interview: Druse head scorns Hezbollah on Syria", "title": "AP Interview: Druse head scorns Hezbollah on Syria", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/ap_interview_druse_head_scorns_hezbollah_on_syria/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-lebanon-druse-leader.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP Interview: Druse head scorns Hezbollah on Syria", "title": "AP Interview: Druse head scorns Hezbollah on Syria", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/mideast-lebanon-druse-leader.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bassem Mroue", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHezbollah intervened in Syria and did not care about the Lebanese (public) opinion,\u201d Jumblatt told The Associated Press during a recent interview at his home in Beirut.\nInstead of fighting in Syria, he said Hezbollah should have focused on archenemy Israel.\nJumblatt \u2014 whose Druse are like Assad\u2019s Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam \u2014 has been known for his shifting loyalties.\nAfter the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, Jumblatt sharply criticized Hezbollah and the Syrian government, which many in Lebanon blamed for the killing.\nThe harsh criticism by Walid Jumblatt, who leads Lebanon\u2019s minority Druse sect, reflects his increasing pessimism about the bloody conflict next door, now in its fourth year."}
