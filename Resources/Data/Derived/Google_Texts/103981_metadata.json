Ready or not, they\u2019re about to in Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest city.\n\nThe Philadelphia School Reform Commission is restructuring teacher health benefits, redirecting $44 million from the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers contract to the schools. Next year, the savings from health care costs are estimated to be $49 million. If teachers contributed to their health plan for three years, the district could save $100 million.\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia is one of only two districts across the commonwealth that pays zero toward healthcare. It is now time that members of the PFT join the thousands of public school employees across the state who already contribute to their health care costs,\u201d stated Gov. Tom Corbett in a press release.\n\n\u201cWe now have increased our stable, predictable revenue by approximately $212 million when you combine the cigarette tax, the sales tax, and the action taken today,\u201d said SRC chairman Bill Green.\n\nThe changes are to take effect starting Dec. 15, requiring employee contributions ranging from $27 to $71 per paycheck. These funds are expected to restore much-needed counseling services, reading specialists, teacher aides, advanced classes in foreign languages, materials and supplies.\n\n\u201cUnder the new plan, teachers will be required to pay 10-13 percent of their health care costs,\u201d said Cindy Hamill-Dahlgren, director of strategic communications at the Commonwealth Foundation. \u201cThe average private health care plan requires participants to contribute 23 percent.\u201d\n\nSome teachers are for the move.\n\nMarion R., a North Philadelphia middle school teacher for 35 years who declined to give her last name due to her ongoing affiliation with the PFT, said they \u201cabsolutely\u201d should.\n\n\u201cThe union has overstepped the boundaries,\u201d she said. \u201cMy daughter works for a health care company and pays for her health care coverage. There\u2019s nothing wrong with teachers doing the same.\u201d\n\nThe PFT views SRC\u2019s actions as union-busting.\n\nPFT spokesperson George Jackson said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight this.\u201d\n\nDistrict spokesman Fernando A. Gallard issued a statement that said \u201cthe contract changes do not affect other economic provisions of the FT bargaining agreement and allow the District to avoid both salary cuts and layoffs at this time.\u201d\n\nPublic sentiment about the SRC is precarious. The Philadelphia City Council recently passed legislation to place a referendum on the ballot calling for disbanding the SRC, and mayoral candidate Ken Trujillo pledged to get rid of the SRC, if elected. With popular support for the SRC waning, shifting funds to the schools might be a bid to win back parents\u2019 (and voters) confidence.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Philly Schools vote to redirect $44 mil from teachers' health care package to support needy schools.", "title": "District earmarks $44 mil for schools, not teacher benefits", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/Education-Money.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-08T11:21:57+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/175427/teachers-health-care/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Education", "published_time": "2014-10-07T08:55:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-08T11:21:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Philly Schools vote to redirect $44 mil from teachers' health care package to support needy schools.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/Education-Money.jpg"}, "title": "District earmarks $44 mil for schools, not teacher benefits", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Philly Schools vote to redirect $44 mil from teachers' health care package to support needy schools."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0770\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMy daughter works for a health care company and pays for her health care coverage.\nThe Philadelphia School Reform Commission is restructuring teacher health benefits, redirecting $44 million from the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers contract to the schools.\n\u201cThe average private health care plan requires participants to contribute 23 percent.\u201dSome teachers are for the move.\nIf teachers contributed to their health plan for three years, the district could save $100 million.\nNext year, the savings from health care costs are estimated to be $49 million."}
