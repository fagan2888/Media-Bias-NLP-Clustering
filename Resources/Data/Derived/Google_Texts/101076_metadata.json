Adlen will be closing the Sun Valley business January 1, 2016. (Photo by Hans Gutknecht/Los Angeles Daily News)\n\nSUN VALLEY >> For more than a half-century, any poor San Fernando Valley grease head who needed a part for his aging clunker would make a pilgrimage to U Pick Parts.\n\nAnd any TV scout or Hollywood filmmaker who needed a shot of a megajunkyard \u2014 often of a wild-eyed captive bound in a car trunk about to be flattened by a screeching crusher \u2014 would send a camera crew out to Sun Valley.\n\nNow the 261/2-acre yard also known as Aadlen Brothers Auto Wrecking that has drained, tossed, ripped, shredded and pulled apart L.A.\u2019s favorite conveyance for the past 53 years will itself be turned into auto scrap. Its up to 4,000 cars, trucks and other collectibles are all being sold before it closes Jan. 1.\n\n\u201cDealing with the business and personal stuff, it\u2019s just too much,\u201d said Nathan B. Adlen, who employs almost 80 workers, some as old as 77, among a warren of a half-century of collectibles. \u201cThe one thing that really hurts me is that we have some employees who have worked here for a very long time.\n\n\u201cFor my employees, that\u2019s the saddest. I know when it\u2019s gone it\u2019ll hit me. ... I know that someday I may start crying.\u201d\n\nJunk or gold?\n\nFlashback to 1962, when freeways were being laid across Los Angeles. Cars were king. Their owners were handy. And families poured into the growing San Fernando Valley, where they often perused showrooms for the latest car models.\n\nThat\u2019s when a street fighter from East Los Angeles known as \u201cBig Sam\u201d Adlen and his brother Donnie opened their wrecking yard atop an old Tuxford Pitt landfill. As big as a city block, it soon became a cemetery for \u201cend of life\u201d cars.\n\nAnd a field of gold for any teen on wheels who needed parts.\n\n\u2022 VIDEO: U Pick Parts junkyard in Sun Valley closing\n\nTommy Gelinas once spent hours wading through the derelict hulks of U-Pick Parts, plucking radio knobs, badges and interior bits for his proud first ride, a 1968 Dodge Dart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a landmark,\u201d said Gelinas, the owner of a T-shirt print shop and founder of Valley Relics Museum in Chatsworth. \u201cI would think that most everyone who\u2019s ever owned a car in the Valley has pulled a door handle, radiator, starter or hard-to-get part out of that junk.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are sad. A lot of people loved the way it does business \u2014 friendly people always willing to help.\u201d\n\nAt its peak, as many as 25,000 junkers a year were crushed and dismantled at the northeast Valley yard, Adlen said, with as many as 100 cars a day streaming in during the Great Recession\u2019s government cash-for-clunkers buybacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScreen favorite\n\nIts acres of car heaps soon became a favorite of Paramount, Universal, Columbia and other studios, its ruins featured in hundreds of movies, TV shows, music videos and commercials.\n\nL.A.\u2019s possibly largest and most popular junkyard was not only a star in such big-screen features as \u201cEscape From L.A.,\u201d \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d and \u201cHangover.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been featured on countless TV shows, from the 1960s-era L.A. cop drama \u201cAdam-12\u201d to the 1970s-era \u201cCHiPS,\u201d Adlen said. In the past six weeks alone, Aadlen Bros. has served as sets \u2014 sometimes for the second time \u2014 for \u201cSupergirl,\u201d \u201cCriminal Minds,\u201d \u201cRizzoli & Isles\u201d and \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles.\u201d\n\nAfter releasing his 1998 single hit \u201cMy Way,\u201d Usher gussied up a 53-foot junkyard trailer to look like a giant boom box before boogying on it for his music video.\n\nThe reality TV show \u201cFear Factor\u201d once had contestants struggling for keys in running junkyard cars \u2014 in the wake of a 10,000-pound monster truck.\n\n\u201cAnytime you saw a wrecking yard on TV or in film, it was probably here,\u201d said Andrew Adlen, who works for his cousin Nathan at the business located at both 11590 Tuxford Ave. and 11409 Penrose St. By a back gate reads a sign: \u201cWe (heart) junk cars.\u201d\n\nRegulations\u2019 toll\n\nNow the intake of junk cars has fallen to roughly 15,000 a year, the Adlens say. And they have decided to shut down their wrecking business because of costly pending government and environmental regulations, including Affordable Care Act insurance for their employees, rising minimum wages, a stormwater runoff permit and family estate taxes.\n\nThe empty lot will be for sale or rent, they said. But a buyer might be tough because of groundwater pollution tied to it and northeast Valley defense industries.\n\nWhen it\u2019s gone, just one pick-apart junkyard will be left in the Valley, Pick Your Part, in Sun Valley.\n\nSo everything must go \u2014 including a car excavator and shear ($20,000), a car crusher ($25,000), a historic Santa Fe Railroad caboose, a Russian-made jeep captured in Egyptian sands during the 1967 war, a bison head trophy ($2,000), a nonrunning British double-decker bus ($1,000) and a Fender guitar and coffin case ($200), one of many goodies that were taken from junked cars.\n\nBruce, the 25-foot-long Universal Studios castoff that is the only surviving shark from the mold that was used in \u201cJaws,\u201d may be given to a new Los Angeles film museum.\n\n\u2022 PHOTOS: A tour around Aadlen Brothers Auto Wrecking\n\nAnd Gelinas, who once picked for parts, was allowed some picks from history for his Valley Relics Museum.\n\nThey include a vintage Helms Bakery Truck given to Nathan Adlen by his father, who once dreamed of being a Helms driver; an \u201cOld Shoe\u201d car likely used to draw patrons into Valley shoe stores, and the Googie-style steel arches that once soared 86 feet over Studio City Car Wash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge score for the museum and historic preservation,\u201d said Gelinas, who now drives a \u201964 Chevelle and a \u201966 Ford Fairlane. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to go to scrap.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SUN VALLEY >> For more than a half-century, any poor San Fernando Valley grease head who needed a part for his aging clunker would make a pilgrimage to U Pick Parts.And any TV scout or Hollywood filmmaker who needed a shot of a megajunkya", "title": "Sun Valley\u2019s venerable U Pick Parts junkyard to close", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20151028/sun-valleys-venerable-u-pick-parts-junkyard-to-close", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151028/NEWS/151029453/AR/0/AR-151029453.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "998px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Sun Valley\u2019s venerable U Pick Parts junkyard to close"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "SUN VALLEY >> For more than a half-century, any poor San Fernando Valley grease head who needed a part for his aging clunker would make a pilgrimage to U Pick Parts.And any TV scout or Hollywood filmmaker who needed a shot of a megajunkya", "title": "Sun Valley\u2019s venerable U Pick Parts junkyard to close", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/business/20151028/sun-valleys-venerable-u-pick-parts-junkyard-to-close", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151028/NEWS/151029453/AR/0/AR-151029453.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "junkyard, Automobile part retailers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "junkyard, Automobile part retailers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe45\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 VIDEO: U Pick Parts junkyard in Sun Valley closingTommy Gelinas once spent hours wading through the derelict hulks of U-Pick Parts, plucking radio knobs, badges and interior bits for his proud first ride, a 1968 Dodge Dart.\nThe reality TV show \u201cFear Factor\u201d once had contestants struggling for keys in running junkyard cars \u2014 in the wake of a 10,000-pound monster truck.\nWhen it\u2019s gone, just one pick-apart junkyard will be left in the Valley, Pick Your Part, in Sun Valley.\nAadlen Brothers Auto Wrecking owner Nathan B.
