But he faced a firestorm of criticism last summer when some of his past comments about the law surfaced.\n\nOn at least one occasion, Gruber suggested the law wouldn't have passed if not for the \"stupidity\" of voters. Another time, his comments appeared to uphold arguments by the law's opponents that its insurance subsidies \u2014 which the law's language says are only available to users of state-run exchanges \u2014 can't go to participants who use the federal exchange website healthcare.gov.\n\nThat question is currently being considered by the Supreme Court, which is expected to hand down a decision in June. The case, called King v. Burwell, has given Cannon a big platform to air his opposition to the law.\n\nCannon has been King v. Burwell's loudest champion since it first arose in lower courts and worked its way all the way up to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments earlier this month. If the court strikes the subsidies, millions of low and mid-income Americans who have bought health plans on healthcare.gov won't be able to afford them anymore.\n\n\"Either I will be sharing a stage with Jonathan Gruber April 1, or I am about to become the victim of the most awesome April Fools prank ever,\" Cannon told the Washington Examiner.\n\nGruber declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Call it an Obamacare showdown.\nTwo leading voices in the controversy over President Obama's signature healthcare law will face off next week at an event likely to grab widespread attention.
