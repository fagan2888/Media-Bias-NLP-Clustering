Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) told Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on the Breitbart News Saturday radio program.\n\nBlackburn indicated that the court interpreted something out of the law that didn\u2019t actually exist, after some states refused to participate in state exchanges.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nMarlow referenced Justice Roberts\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d argument, which essentially said the court holds that \u201cwhen the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act says exchange established by the state, it means exchange established by the state or the federal government.\u201d That essentially redefines the term \u201cstate\u201d to mean the entire federal government.\n\nBlackburn said, in talking with state elected officials, the concern is, \u201cIf now we are going to interpret any federal laws to be an exercise of federal preemption over state laws, then what does that do to our states\u2019s rights?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an overbearing of the federal government and a federal court, on behalf of a federal government, to say we are exercising our preemption and we are redefining without the benefit of the law. And that\u2019s one of the things with the gay marriage decision, yes the federal court ruled, but there was no law, there was no legislative action that was changed that would have preempted the states in addressing the gay rights issue.\u201d\n\nMarlow agreed, \u201cThey\u2019re inventing rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re preempting states rights,\u201d Blackburn concurred. \u201cAnd by doing that, they\u2019re inventing federal rights.\u201d She predicted that we will begin to hear from state legislators and governors on the issue of how to respond and preserve state sovereignty.\n\n\u201cWhat are the next steps?\u201d Marlow asked.\n\nPeople need to say, \u201cOur resolve is strengthened,\u201d she responded. \u201cBarack Obama said \u2018I am going to fundamentally change this country,\u2019 and he is making good on that promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people have always said we believe in the American dream. That is part of the uniqueness of our nation, but now what we are seeing is people that are saying no, we want a new American dream where it is depending on the federal government for your education, for your home mortgage, for your student loan, for your healthcare, for your retirement, for all that you want to do, and we are going to redefine what freedom and liberty means\u201d around the legislative branch using the court and executive action.\n\nOne check on the court is Congress, Marlow mentioned. He noted nationally syndicated radio talk show host Mark Levin\u2019s spoke of the Congressional power check during the week.\n\nBlackburn said, \u201cIt\u2019s already in the works.\u201d She specifically noted 162 pieces of legislation already in process that reform and replace Obamacare, breaking that law apart.\n\nWhen asked about the purpose behind the over 54 votes to repeal Obamacare, Blackburn noted, \u201cWe as conservatives do not have the media with us.\u201d However, she said, every floor vote increases public awareness. The Congresswoman also noted a need for Republicans to coalesce around a focused solution to Obamacare.\n\nMarlow stated, \u201ctaxes should be a moral issue. I think every time you extract a dollar from someone who has earned it, that you should explain exactly where it is going.\u201d He called these \u201ctroubling times\u201d when government no longer has, \u201cto make that case that taxes are a moral issue.\u201d Blackburn responded saying that\u2019s the trouble with the Supreme Court adjudicating, not on the Constitution and law, but \u201con the assumption of their interpretation.\u201d\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
