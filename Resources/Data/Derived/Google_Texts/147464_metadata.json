Patrick Leahy, who said, \u201cMany on this committee have rightfully expressed their outrage about the call earlier this week to shut our borders to Muslims. Now we need to formally go on the record to reject this reprehensible position.\u201d\n\nHis amendment received unanimous support from the other Democrats on the panel.\n\nA large majority of Republicans on the panel, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, of Iowa, also voted in favor. Four Republicans voted against the amendment: Sen Jeff Sessions of Alabama; Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina; Sen. David Vitter of Louisiana; and Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas.\n\nCruz, currently running second in the race for the GOP presidential nomination in some national polls, has said that he \u201cdisagrees\u201d with Trump\u2019s plan. However, he has been a vocal advocate of blocking refugees from the conflict in Syria and Iraq from being allowed to take shelter in the U.S.\n\nRelated: Why Ted Cruz Is Surging in the Polls\n\nAlso on Wednesday, an attempt by Cruz to force a speedy vote on refugee-related legislation he had introduced earlier in the day was blocked by Democrats, including Leahy, who characterized it as un-American.\n\n\u201cI don't want to stand by quietly and see the victims of terrorism and torture be demonized just so people will have a talking point for the local evening news,\u201d Leahy said on the Senate floor. \u201cWe are better than this. The bill that my colleague, the junior senator from Texas, introduced an hour ago would prevent virtually all nationals of Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen from refugee protection regardless of how they suffered at the hands of terrorists and despots. Women fleeing gang rapes, children fleeing horrors we cannot even imagine, they would be closed off.\u201d\n\nCruz introduced his legislation shortly after giving a speech in which he said that the U.S. ought not to intervene in the war in Syria, which has killed hundreds of thousands and has displaced more than a million.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A Senate panel found bipartisan agreement on an amendment denouncing proposals \u2013 such as one put forward by Donald Trump \u2013 that would bar immigrants from the U.S. based on their religion.
