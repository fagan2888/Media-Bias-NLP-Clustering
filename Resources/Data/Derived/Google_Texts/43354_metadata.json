The company also believes it can achieve at least $10 in operating EPS in 2018. Analysts see $10.12.\n\nConsolidation has been sweeping across the health industry as insurers, hospitals, pharmacy benefit managers and other providers seek scale and pricing power as the government becomes a bigger player.\n\nIn March, UnitedHealth (UNH) announced a $12 billion acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Catamaran (CTRX). In February, Rite Aid (RAD) announced it would buy independent PBM EnvisionRx for $2 billion.\n\nLast August, Walgreens (WBA) agreed to pay $15.3 billion for the part of European pharmacy giant Alliance Boots that it didn\u2019t already own.\n\nHospitals are also looking to expand their services to help cut costs and bring in higher-paying patients. In March, Tenet Healthcare (THC) agreed to form a joint venture with United Surgical Partners International.\n\nTheir combined short-stay surgery and imaging-center assets will create the largest U.S. provider of ambulatory surgery.\n\nFollow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar .", "article_metadata": {"description": "Humana and Cigna shares rose Tuesday on expectations that Aetna may make an offer, amid a broad trend toward consolidation in the health sector.
