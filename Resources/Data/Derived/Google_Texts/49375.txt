Dear Santa,

This year, I would like you to please bring large doses of common sense and a deeper appreciation of math and data to people who think guns are the problem. Come to think of it, if you could please give them all a certificate that allows them to go back to high school and repeat both algebra and logical reasoning classes, I would deeply appreciate it and it would probably help us all.

For my fellow gun-rights supporters, please bring reminders that we need to be better than our opponents. Be polite when they are rude. Be kind always in debate and action. Be of good humor when they are nothing but angry and irrational. Be consistently responsible with your firearm even though they think that’s an impossibility.

Finally, Santa, my kid wants to compete in 3-Gun when he’s older. Please bring me a good guide on choosing the right rifle for him. We’ve got the shotgun and handgun covered, but the rifle is new ground for us.

Merry Christmas to all.

Your big fan in St. Louis,
