DeMarcus Ware may never forget The Peyton Manning Naked Bootleg, even if he tried.

You know the play. Against the Cowboys in Dallas in 2013. The 37-year-old Manning faked a handoff to Knowshon Moreno then curled around to the left as the scrum collapsed on Moreno. Without a defender in sight, Manning trotted into the end zone leaving millions watching in disbelief.

Ware included. He was still with the Cowboys at the time and remembers it vividly. While reflecting on his two years with Manning in Denver and congratulating the quarterback on his Hall of Fame career, Ware looked back to that 2013 play.

“You always hear about Peyton Manning and how he controls the game, uplifts other players to his standards, and I was fortunate to see it as a teammate and opponent,” Ware said. “He was one of those guys who was a great competitor who took chances. When I played against him in Dallas (2013 game), I had the bootleg responsibility and I never thought he would do it. The weird thing is, he looked at me before with this image of, ‘I got you.’

“Being his teammate, I saw how he carried himself, how meticulous he was, how much of a competitor and how great he was off the field. He was one of those guys that if you had an event, a dinner, he was always engaged in every guy’s life. He knew what the trash man’s name was, the trainers, the cafeteria workers—all by name. He always thought about everyone else. When you think of the word ‘champion,’ he’s the image that you see.”
