Voters appear to want candidates who will deliver nothing short of their wildest partisan dreams (and delusions), alongside the unconditional silence and submission of their ideological adversaries.\n\nIf presidential candidates once promised the sun, moon and stars, this time around they\u2019re promising multiple galaxies, plus the turtles all the way down.\n\nCandidates on both the left and right have pledged complete overhauls on nearly every issue voters care about (and some they don\u2019t). That includes health care, reproductive rights, the social safety net, immigration, the Constitution, even basic arithmetic.\n\nMany pundits once said Donald Trump never had a chance. But despite the Republican frontrunner's politically incorrect comments on Mexicans, Muslims and his closest rivals, his popularity is soaring. (Reuters)\n\nDonald Trump, whose most attractive quality is supposedly his unfiltered frankness, has built his campaign around the preposterous promise that Mexico will pay for a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d on the southern U.S. border, despite all evidence to the contrary \u2014 including both common sense and loud, unequivocal refusals from Mexican leaders themselves.\n\nHe also promises that he can get government to swiftly, cheaply and \u201chumanely\u201d round up and deport 11 million people living in the shadows. And his base \u2014 which has, until now, long believed in government incompetence and inefficacy above almost any other political principle \u2014 willingly suspends disbelief.\n\nBernie Sanders likewise promises his base a single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health-care plan, despite the fact that Congress has voted more than 60 times to repeal the (comparatively modest) Affordable Care Act.\n\nHow would either actually get their ambitious plans through? Why, political revolution and magical underpants gnomes, of course.\n\nOn some issues, the candidates\u2019 plans are quantifiably more grandiose than those of their predecessors. Take for example their tax proposals.\n\nSure, huge tax cuts have been a staple of Republican presidential candidates for at least the past two decades. One (George W. Bush) even enacted those cuts. But the scale of the cuts that Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio propose would be unprecedented, according to calculations from Len Burman, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.\n\nMeasured as a share of the economy, the three biggest tax cuts of the past six decades were enacted by Bush, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Of those, the largest was Reagan\u2019s suite of tax changes, which cumulatively led to a revenue loss equaling 2.1 percent of gross domestic product. By contrast, over the next decade, Rubio would cut taxes by an estimated 2.6 percent of GDP, Cruz by 3.6 percent and Donald Trump by 4.0 percent.\n\nBernie Sanders regularly calls for a \"political revolution\" in America, but what does that mean? (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nIn other words, candidates are promising to out-Reagan Reagan.\n\nPerhaps, you might muse, politicians just propose especially fantastical cuts while they\u2019re on the campaign trail. But by my own calculations, today\u2019s candidates are promising cuts that are also far larger than what was proposed by Mitt Romney in 2012, John McCain in 2008, Bush in 2000 and Bob Dole in 1996.\n\nThe story on the left is not so different.\n\nSanders would raise taxes by about 5.9 percent of GDP, based on revenue estimates from the business-backed Tax Foundation. This, too, is multiples higher than any tax increase enacted in the postwar era.\n\nThe largest single tax overhaul of all time \u2014 just like the largest deportation of all time, or the largest health-care reform initiative, or the most ambitious constitutional revisions \u2014 seems especially improbable over the next four years, regardless of who secures the White House.\n\nWe are already seeing unprecedented levels of obstructionism, gridlock and allergy to compromise. In 2015, the Senate confirmed the fewest civilian nominations \u2014 including federal judges, ambassadors, regulatory officials and executive branch appointees \u2014 for the first session of a Congress in three decades, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report. The Senate Banking Committee has not voted a single nominee out of its committee this session, the first time that\u2019s happened in at least 50 years.\n\nAnd yet some presidential candidates now promise they\u2019ll be even less cooperative, and concede even less territory to the other side, in the service of delivering the grand delusions they\u2019ve pledged their voters. Quoth Cruz on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d: \u201cThis is how we\u2019ve gotten in the mess we\u2019re in now, is Republicans who cut deals with Democrats.\u201d\n\nIn today\u2019s political climate, pragmatism and cooperation appear toxic; big, beautiful, uncompromising promises score votes.\n\nOf course, big, beautiful uncompromising promises are also impossible to keep. So what happens come 2017 when voters get disillusioned by another round of broken vows? What fantasies will an ever-angrier electorate have to be promised then?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are getting ready to break their supporters\u2019 hearts.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/crampell", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are getting ready to break their supporters\u2019 hearts.", "title": "Telling it like it is?
