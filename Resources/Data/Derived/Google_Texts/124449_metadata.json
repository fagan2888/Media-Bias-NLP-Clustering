During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, federal auditors said the agency doled out $5.8 million in excess money due to lax oversight and management issues. It\u2019s still trying to recoup that money.\n\nRelated: FEMA Still Doesn\u2019t Know Where Its Money is Going\n\nNow a new report from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Inspector General reveals that FEMA overpaid $8 million to the Port of Tillamook Bay, Ore., in storm recovery funds after floods and thunderstorms badly damaged the port.\n\nThe IG said that the agency misapplied the cost estimating format to determine how much to award the port, resulting in overpaying millions.\n\nThe storm badly damaged one of the railroads around the port, and FEMA was going to cover repairs. However, port authorities decided they wanted to use federal funding for an alternative project, since there were too many challenges plaguing the railroad.\n\nThe federal government can fund only certain alternative projects, and apparently this did not fit the guidelines, the auditors explained. Still, FEMA went along with it and used a flawed system to calculate how much to give to the port to fix other damaged facilities \u2013resulting in $8 million extra dollars.\n\nRelated: FEMA\u2019s $240 Million Disaster Relief System Doesn\u2019t Work\n\n\u201cWe maintain our disagreement with FEMA\u2019s methodology and reasoning. FEMA needs to balance providing financial assistance to communities affected by disasters with its fiduciary responsibility to spend taxpayers\u2019 money prudently,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe IG requested that FEMA get the money back from the port. However, for now, FEMA and Tillamook Bay are standing by the agency\u2019s cost estimates. They have 90 days to respond to the audit.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time auditors have flagged FEMA for botching its administration of disaster relief.\n\nIn January, the IG reported that FEMA doled out about $177 million in improper payments to victims of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma who could have otherwise been covered by personal insurance.\n\nFEMA is still trying to recoup those funds given out more than a decade ago.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency is under fire once again for botching its admi", "title": "FEMA Overpays $8 Million to One Storm-Struck Port", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/19/FEMA-Overpays-8-Million-One-Storm-Struck-Port", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/19/FEMA-Overpays-8-Million-One-Storm-Struck-Port", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08232013_FEMA_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency is under fire once again for botching its admi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a87\"", "article_summary": "Related: FEMA\u2019s $240 Million Disaster Relief System Doesn\u2019t Work\u201cWe maintain our disagreement with FEMA\u2019s methodology and reasoning.\nFEMA has a history of giving out too much money to people or organizations that might not actually qualify for disaster relief.\nThe storm badly damaged one of the railroads around the port, and FEMA was going to cover repairs.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time auditors have flagged FEMA for botching its administration of disaster relief.\nThe IG requested that FEMA get the money back from the port."}
