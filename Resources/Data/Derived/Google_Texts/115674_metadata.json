As one of five Senate Republicans running for re-election in states that supported President Obama in both 2008 and 2012, Ms. Ayotte is seen as particularly vulnerable this November, and is a major reason national Democrats, now on the short end of a 54-46 Republican majority, are optimistic about taking back the Senate.\n\nSix years ago, Ms. Ayotte was part of a Republican wave that swept Democrats out of power in blue states like Illinois and Wisconsin, as well as swing states like New Hampshire. For Ms. Ayotte and other Republicans from that class, 2016 was always going to be a difficult year to run for re-election because more Democrats vote in presidential years. But with the possibility that Donald J. Trump, the most divisive Republican presidential candidate in a generation, will be at the top of the ticket, the party\u2019s task may be all the more arduous.\n\n\u201cThey have to find a way to keep Trump voters excited, and appeal to those who are offended by him,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of The Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report. \u201cThat is the tension they have to navigate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNowhere is that tension more apparent than in New Hampshire, a moderate state that also gave Mr. Trump one of his most critical victories in its presidential primary last month. \u201cNew Hampshire is one of the most competitive races in the Senate,\u201d Mr. Gonzales said. \u201cIf the cycle turns into a catastrophe for Republicans, New Hampshire will be one of the first states to fall.\u201d\n\nMs. Ayotte, like most of her Republican colleagues, stands with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, in opposing a confirmation vote on a Supreme Court nominee, in refusing to reject Mr. Trump should he become the party\u2019s nominee, and in opposing Mr. Obama. But on issues that appeal to moderate voters \u2014 drug programs for addicts, clean power plants and the so-called Gang of Eight immigration bill \u2014 Ms. Ayotte has often sided with Democrats. And that is likely to be a familiar strategy for some of her fellow Senate Republicans this year.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWith the potential for a polarizing nominee like Trump or Cruz at the top of the ticket, it will be more important than ever for Republican Senate candidates to cement their own identity and distance themselves when necessary,\u201d said Brian Walsh, a longtime Senate campaign aide and Republican consultant, referring also to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. \u201cSenators in both parties have been successful in doing that in recent years, but you need to run hard and run your own race because the top of the ticket inevitably dominates the broader national political environment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160328121206, "twitter": {"description": "On some issues, lawmakers like Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who is fighting for re-election, have distanced themselves from the far right.", "title": "Tough Re-election for G.O.P.
