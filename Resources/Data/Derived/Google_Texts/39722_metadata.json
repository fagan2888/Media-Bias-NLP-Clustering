A study of the Tea Party\u2019s influence within the GOP found that anywhere from 45 to 55% of the GOP were Tea Party supporters, and that 95% of Tea Party Republicans took the most conservative view on repealing Obamacare, a.k.a. the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAnd while \u201crepealing Obamacare\u201d was the second-most important priority for Tea Party Republicans, only 2% of non-Tea Party Republicans said it was a top priority for them.\n\nOne of the most critical findings of this study, however, is that \u201cTea Party supporters are not just a faction within the Republican Party: They are the majority faction within the party, particularly among active Republicans.\u201d\n\nThis finding was also in a Pew Research Center poll that found a majority of GOP primary voters who always vote in primaries agree with the Tea Party faction.\n\nAnother Pew Research Center poll found that \u201c50% of Republicans and Republican leaners who agree with the Tea Party say they are angry at the government, compared with just 27% of non-Tea Party Republicans.\u201d\n\nThis anger has influenced the approach taken with the government shutdown: a majority of Republicans in the CNN/ORC poll supported shutting down the government; in a Pew poll, 71% of Republicans who identify with the Tea Party agree with the idea of standing by principles, \u201ceven if the government shuts down.\u201d\n\nBut it appears that the Tea Party faction may be losing its steam of approval: in a CNN/ORC poll, only 31% of respondents view the faction favorably, while in a Gallup poll, only 22% identify themselves as a supporter of the Tea Party.\n\nMadison, in Federalist 10, argued that the \u201ccomplaints are everywhere heard \u2026 that our governments are too unstable, that the public good is disregarded in the conflicts of rival parties, and that measures are too often decided, not according to the rules of justice and the rights of the minor party, but by the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority.\u201d\n\nIf Madison revisited his own work today, he might have to concede that controlling a minority may be just as difficult to control as the majority.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "In the classic writing of American political thought, Federalist 10, James Madison argued that the new constitutional republic would break and control the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wfae.org/post/we-are-witnessing-tyranny-minority", "image": "http://wfae.org/sites/wfae/files/styles/medium/public/201208/Bitzer300-273x300.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In the classic writing of American political thought, Federalist 10, James Madison argued that the new constitutional republic would break and control the", "title": "We Are Witnessing Tyranny Of The Minority"}, "story_id": 228513050, "twitter": {"site": "@WFAE", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WFAE"}, "author": "Michael Bitzer", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "We Are Witnessing Tyranny Of The Minority"}, "nid": 36503, "datePublished": "2013-10-02", "keywords": "James Madison, Tea Party, Obamacare, Congress", "wordCount": 764, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc610\"", "article_summary": "And while \u201crepealing Obamacare\u201d was the second-most important priority for Tea Party Republicans, only 2% of non-Tea Party Republicans said it was a top priority for them.\nNormally in our discourse on factionalism in our political system, we talk about the \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d overriding and trampling on the rights of the minority.\nBut what appears to be happening now seems more like the tyranny of the minority.\nA study of the Tea Party\u2019s influence within the GOP found that anywhere from 45 to 55% of the GOP were Tea Party supporters, and that 95% of Tea Party Republicans took the most conservative view on repealing Obamacare, a.k.a.\nRising from their outrage over the 2009 passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party has asserted its power over the GOP, both within Congress and the national party."}
