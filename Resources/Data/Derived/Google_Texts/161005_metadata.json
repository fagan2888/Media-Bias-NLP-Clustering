Their March 9 letter moved from the relatively arcane\u2013 how to distinguish treaties from \u201cexecutive-congressional agreements\u201d and both from \u201cmere executive agreements\u201d\u2013 to the comparatively straightforward: presidents come and go, the Republicans observed, but senators can last forever. (Or at least for \u201cdecades.\u201d) Their lessons imparted, the 47 (can it be long before a movie tells their story in the fashion of \u201c300\u201d?) wished \u201cclarity\u201d upon the mullahs and signed off, doubtless to prepare their next text \u2014 a postcard on the Federalist Papers, perhaps, or an email on the blessings (or the curse) of judicial review. The latter, it goes without saying, will not be issued until the Supreme Court rules on the latest Obamacare case.\n\nDenunciations were immediate and thunderous, most of them from Democrats, of course, but some from that increasingly endangered species variously identified as \u201cestablishment\u201d or \u201cmainstream\u201d Republicans. (A species on a double-edged sword of extinction, because not only is it subject to constant predation, it has given up any effort to reproduce!) All of them decried the letter as utterly unprecedented, which forgets only the other utterly unprecedented moves by congressional Republicans, such as John Boehner\u2019s decision a week earlier to turn the floor of the House into a mosh pit for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Whether or not the Senate\u2019s pedagogical moment was inspired by the example of their House colleagues\u2014 a pincer movement! a tag-team event! a double whammy!\u2014 it certainly employed the same tactic: the use of a foreign power to shape the outcome of an American policy debate.\n\nMuch froth has been expended on the question of whether this constitutes \u201ctreason.\u201d Even more has been devoted to theories about why Republicans do these things. Why the dalliance with Netanyahu? Why the love note to the Iranian right? Predictably, many commentators link these events to Republican hatred of President Obama. On MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball,\u201d for example, Chris Matthews depicted both as simply the right\u2019s latest primal scream, a two-headed monster from the Republican id:\n\n\u201cSome day years from now people will look back on this presidency\u2026 They will read how it started with the Republican Senate leader calling for the president\u2019s defeat, declaring that the business of the opposition from the first day was to ensure the new president (a) accomplishes nothing and (b) gets booted from office as quickly as possible. They will\u2026 wonder what was it that made this Republican opposition so all out contemptuous of an American president\u2026. They will\u2026 perhaps get the idea that the age of Jim Crow managed to find a new habitat in the early 21st century Republican Party.\u201d\n\nThey may very well get that idea, and far be it from me to say they would be mistaken. But this can\u2019t be a complete explanation of what happened here. After all, 21st century Republicans are also following in the footsteps of their late 20th century brethren, who, for example, didn\u2019t just oppose and defame Bill Clinton \u2014 they impeached him. So while it\u2019s undoubtedly true that some Republicans despise Obama, their behavior as a party seems driven by something other than purely personal motives. Difficult as it may be for many Americans to realize, politics is really about something more than personalities. It\u2019s about, er, politics, and the recent behavior of Republicans must be seen in that light to be fully understood. Their latest escapades merely extend the logic of the party\u2019s evolution since the early 1960s. They may hate Barack Obama, but what they really hate is the modern American state.\n\nConstitutions matter, but every political system depends as well on informal norms, a more or less tacit consensus on how things will be done and what kind of behavior is and isn\u2019t acceptable. This is especially true in America, where our constitutional separation of executive and legislature, and extra-constitutional devices like the filibuster, require compromise and cooperation if the government is to function effectively. Political actors must accept the constraints laid down by the rules (formal and informal) that define legitimate behavior, and must trust that others will do so in turn. When this trust lapses, confrontation replaces compromise and the political system lurches into crisis.\n\nThere have been three moments in our history when something like this happened. The first arose very early, when anxieties about revolutionary France led the Federalist administration of John Adams to propose a number of measures, including the infamous \u201cAlien and Sedition Acts,\u201d intended to enhance executive authority and to repress domestic dissent. This led the Anti-federalists Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to draft a series of resolutions defending the right of states to nullify federal statutes they deemed unconstitutional. Adopted by the Kentucky and Virginia legislatures, these ignited a confrontation between proponents of Federal power and advocates of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d that roiled our politics until the Civil War, and beyond.\n\nThe second moment, of course, was the Civil War itself. The third is much more recent, extending over at least the Obama presidency but with roots as far back, perhaps, as the Clinton impeachment. It involves the readiness of Republicans to violate long-standing norms of institutional conduct in order to advance a highly divisive, intensely partisan agenda. Impeachment and the threat of impeachment; the use of primaries to defeat Republican incumbents judged to be insufficiently \u201cconservative\u201d; a willingness to default on the debt or shutdown the government; the indiscriminate use of the filibuster to require super-majorities in the Senate on virtually every issue\u2014 this pattern of increasingly radical behavior may certainly be associated, in any given case, with the anger or pique of particular politicians. But its deepest source is in the political attitudes of an increasingly radical party.\n\nThere are several different levels of explanation here. To some degree, the Republican obsession with impeachment and the filibuster\u2014 and the Iran letter too \u2014 simply reflects the GOP\u2019s growing sense of itself as primarily a congressional party. As it gradually loses the ability to compete for the presidency \u2014 it has lost the popular vote in five out of the last six presidential elections \u2014 its power base in Congress and legislative prerogatives generally are more important to it. The party that fought pitched battles during the Nixon, Ford, and Reagan years \u2014 and even as recently as the Bush II presidency \u2014 to safeguard executive authority from congressional \u201coverreach\u201d now defends the right of freshman senators to conduct foreign policy. One would love to hear what Dick Cheney thinks about that, if only he could be trusted to say what he thinks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That letter to Iran said more about the GOP than Tom Cotton and company ever intended.
