Riley, MD, assistant professor of neurology and director of the Columbia University Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Center, Department of Neurology, Columbia University, New York\n\nThe MD Magazine Peer Exchange \u201cStrategies in the Management of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis\u201d features a panel of physician experts discussing the importance of early therapy in multiple sclerosis treatment, factors that affect choice of management strategy, the need for ongoing monitoring, and other aspects of treating patients with multiple sclerosis.This Peer Exchange is moderated by, Saunders Family Professor of Neurology and director of the Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York.The panelists are:Dr. Coyle says she thinks that clinicians do not do enough spinal fluid analysis when diagnosing patients for potential multiple sclerosis (MS). \u201cI really think, to make an early diagnosis, spinal fluid adds an invaluable addition to the neuro imaging,\u201d she says.Dr. Markowitz notes that there are many cases when a patient\u2019s MRI clearly indicates MS, in which case he doesn\u2019t think a spinal tap is necessary.According to Coyle, \u201cThere is no absolute diagnostic MRI scan. No one is good enough to look at an MRI scan in isolation\u2026 We have no diagnostic biomarker at this point. So, I think a multimodality approach makes you most confident.\u201dDr. Lublin points out that one reason why CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) is only in the guidelines for primary progressive MS is that is the form of MS that\u2019s most likely to be misdiagnosed, so having the additional data from the spinal fluid is helpful.\u201cCSF wasn\u2019t included for the relapsing forms of MS because there were no data. When the MRI investigator groups looked at the different metrics\u2014more than one lesion in 2 elephant areas, MS specific areas, and enhancing and non-enhancing lesions\u2014they didn\u2019t have CSF data to further characterize,\u201d he notes.When diagnosing a patient, Dr. Riley asks whether clinicians look for positive evidence from the CSF of another disease state, or do they look for the presence of oligoclonal bands?Coyle says she is much more comfortable making a diagnosis of MS when there are positive oligoclonal bands in spinal fluid.Lublin agrees that, in cases where diagnostic uncertainty exists, \u201chaving the spinal fluid is very useful, and radiologically isolated syndrome, by definition, is diagnostic uncertainty\u2026and the spinal fluid is actually very helpful because it increases the odds of going on to actually developing MS several fold\u2014by quite a bit in radiologically isolated syndrome. It\u2019s a matter of how much uncertainty you have when you\u2019re diagnosing.\u201dCoyle proposes that clinicians should start using \u201cactive\u201d and \u201cnon-active\u201d over a defined timeframe and \u201cprogressing\u201d or \u201cnot progressing,\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s going to help us enter better patients into trials, but also begin to think about the patients better.\u201dLublin agrees, noting that \u201cin a defined timeframe\u201d is the key. \u201cActivity, as we define it is either a relapse, or a gadolinium enhancing lesion, or a new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesion. But it has to be framed in time,\u201d he says.\u201cFor relapsing patients, we recommend a minimum of one year, which means they ought to have at least an evaluation once a year both clinically and an MRI. Frankly, if they\u2019re on therapy, I think much more frequently. But that gives you a frame. When we see someone in clinic we\u2019ll just say, \u2018relapsing-remitting\u2019 or \u2018active.\u2019 I usually write down, \u2018by MRI\u2019 or \u2018by clinical past year,\u2019 or even the \u2018past six months.\u2019 And the same thing with progressing or non-progressing,\u201d Lublin says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In this segment, Drs.
