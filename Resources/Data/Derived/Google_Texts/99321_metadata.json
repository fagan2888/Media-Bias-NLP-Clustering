Despite the potential dangers, which she was well aware of, she had wept with joy about the possible cure in store. Still, that morning, she was feeling a bit jittery.\n\nSix hours later, the 23-year-old would be in the ER at Kaiser Permanente in San Diego, going through endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) surgery, in which surgeons would collapse both of her lungs to destroy a portion of nerves located in her chest. ETS surgery is usually considered a last resort, as it comes with significant risks. Side effects and complications range from extreme hypotension, heat intolerance, arrhythmia and, in extreme cases, death.\n\nYet for Alissa, the promise far outweighed the risk. Since she could remember, Alissa has struggled with a condition that she believes has driven her in and out of psychiatric care with anxiety and depression: excessive sweating.\n\n\u201cIn laymen\u2019s terms, our internal thermostat is incorrectly set, telling the body that it\u2019s overheated. So when most people in a given room are comfortable, somebody with hyperhidrosis [may feel] that they\u2019re overheated, and that\u2019s a mechanism for the body to cool, to sweat,\u201d said Dr Brian Perri, an orthopedic spine surgeon at Cedars-Sinai. \u201cIt is uncontrollable by the patient, so at any given moment, when you least want to have those symptoms, it comes on because patients are concerned or wary of that, and that little bit of anxiety can stimulate the body to sweat.\u201d\n\nA few months ago, Alissa and her boyfriend Diego left her house and headed for the hospital.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Less than 20% of hyperhidrosis sufferers seek medical treatment.\n\n\u201cMy hands started sweating for the first time all day in the car,\u201d reflected Alissa. \u201cWe were listening to this really beautiful music at the same time, and I closed my eyes and started crying, realizing I was on my way to something that I had been dreaming of for so very long. I just kind of looked down at my hands and squeezed them and saw the sweat glisten, and hoped that\u2019d be the very last time I\u2019d see something so familiar to me.\u201d\n\nAbout 7.8 million Americans suffer from the condition. Despite the vast numbers, according to Dr Michael Kaminer of SkinCare Physicians, less than 20% of hyperhidrosis sufferers seek medical treatment.\n\n\u201cA lot of people just don\u2019t do the surgery \u2026 because it\u2019s so risky,\u201d laughed Alissa. \u201cBut it\u2019s funny because it didn\u2019t matter in my head. I knew about all the risks, the side-effects, [and] the horror stories \u2026 It was just coming to this point in my life where I felt it was all or nothing.\u201d\n\nWhen Alissa emerged out of the operating room, she was completely disoriented. She couldn\u2019t even remember why she was there. That night, Alissa had to prop herself up with pillows because of how sore, stiff and uncomfortable she was. She had four incisions on her body, two on each size, measuring at about three-quarters of an inch each.\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend kept telling me to try lotion because typically as soon as I use lotion on my hands they start getting slimy and drippy. I just tried a little bit and waited for my hands to sweat and nothing! Not a single gland was sweating. I truly think I\u2019m cured,\u201d laughed Alissa.\n\nThough Alissa\u2019s hands no longer sweat excessively, she now suffers from compensatory sweating, an unavoidable side-effect, which can run from mild to severe sweating on the abdomen, back, butt, face, feet and/or thighs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. It doesn\u2019t happen all the time. It\u2019s kind of random,\u201d said Alissa. \u201c[But] it\u2019s really weird. I [can] actually feel sweat dripping down my back \u2026 It\u2019s obviously still gross and doesn\u2019t feel good, but it\u2019s way better than my hands sweating.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after her surgery, I met Alissa at a restaurant in San Diego. She wore a navy dress, and her red hair and red lipstick complemented her radiant smile. Her eyes met mine with confidence as she introduced herself, sticking out her hand to give me a firm handshake; I would have never expected this person to be the same person she described her old self to be.\n\nThe first time Alissa heard about hyperhidrosis, she told me after ordering, was on the radio when she was eight years old.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of weird hearing about that because my whole childhood, dealing with doctors, I never brought it up,\u201d she said. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t know it was a thing. My siblings didn\u2019t have it. It was just me dealing with this on my own.\u201d\n\nEmbarrassment and lack of understanding keeps many sufferers from seeking advice. So, like many others, Alissa struggled with it in silence. In fact, it was Alissa who diagnosed herself with hyperhidrosis before bringing it up with a doctor.\n\nAt 15, during her first job as a math tutor, a fifth-grader humiliated Alissa in front of her friends.\n\n\u201c[He] had autism and that was the worst combination for me with hyperhidrosis,\u201d sighed Alissa. \u201cI was helping him with his homework and he was getting frustrated \u2026 He saw my hands were wet or sweating and he was like, \u2018Ew! What\u2019s wrong with your hands? They\u2019re so wet!\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the incident, Alissa excused herself from the classroom and went straight to her friend\u2019s house, where she broke down and cried. When Alissa was about 12 years old, she brought up the idea of surgery to her father. \u201cI was just so excited,\u201d smiled Alissa. \u201cI thought I could actually get this and it could change my life \u2026 but I didn\u2019t really push too hard for it with my dad. I tried to, but he didn\u2019t really encourage the idea. I think he was more wary about [it and the risks] \u2026 He couldn\u2019t understand just how much, the impact it had on me. I always had this anchor weighing me down, making me feel like I was a gross, disgusting person unable to touch anyone.\u201d\n\nOne thing Alissa absolutely doesn\u2019t miss are the hand towels she used to carry around with her. \u201c[They] felt like a security blanket. Having one of those just to hold,\u201d said Alissa. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched one since my surgery. Like seeing these things lying around, and knowing I don\u2019t need them any more. It\u2019s pretty surreal.\u201d\n\nEveryone around her has seen a positive change in her. \u201cBefore the surgery she seemed generally happy with her life, but seeing her get frustrated over the sweat was sad sometimes,\u201d said Alissa\u2019s boyfriend Diego. \u201cHaving trouble typing and driving and constantly having to keep towels around would drive me insane, but she was pretty good at handling it.\u201d\n\nDrawing was something Alissa felt a huge connection to when she was younger. However, growing up, she didn\u2019t devote much time to drawing because of the hassle that came with it.\n\n\u201cEven when I would draw, my drawings would always be compromised by my sweat destroying the paper, or smearing the pencil or ink marks,\u201d said Alissa. I have made a few drawings that I\u2019ve been really proud of, but in order to accomplish those I had to use towels under my hands to keep the sweat away from my paper.\u201d\n\nEver since Alissa has recovered from her surgery, she has started to doodle more.\n\n\u201cI hope to find the time and motivation to sit down with a large canvas and draw something beautiful for my mom,\u201d said Alissa. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who I have gained all my creativity from, and she inspires me to try to utilize that as much as possible in life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "Alissa Brown underwent surgery that carried extreme risks including arrhythmia and even death.
