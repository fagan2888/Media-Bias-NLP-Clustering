One can already imagine a \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d version of Clinton looking out the window of her private jet: \u201cWow, those everyday Americans look like ants down there.\u201d\n\nAccording to most pundits, what made the video clever was that it put people first. The bulk of it is a montage of \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d talking about exciting developments in their own lives: a woman reentering the job market after being a stay-at-home mom; Latino brothers poised to start a business; a gay couple planning their wedding; an interracial couple excited about their move, etc. It ends with Clinton saying, \u201cI'm getting ready to do something too. I'm running for president.\u201d\n\nSee, she's just like you, everyday Americans.\n\nThe people profiled are a visual checklist of Barack Obama's \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d (Ron Brownstein's phrase): young people, minorities, gays, college-educated whites, single working women, etc. As with pretty much everything Clinton does, that was carefully planned.\n\nMost political pros agree that Clinton will need a huge turnout from the Obama coalition to win. The bad news is that, so far, the Obama coalition is like a non-transferable, single-purpose coupon that can only be used to get Obama elected president. Clinton advocates insist we don't know that yet, which is true. But all the evidence looks bad for Clinton.\n\nAfter he was reelected, Obama turned his campaign operation, Organizing for America, into a de facto personal political party with the sole aim of mobilizing his coalition to support his agenda. In the wake of the Sandy Hook school shooting, the newly renamed Organizing for Action made gun control a priority. Obama arguably set the bar for political success low, demanding a congressional vote on his proposals \u2014 not actual passage. He made this appeal the emotional centerpiece in his 2013 State of the Union address. Organizing for Action manned the phones, took to the Twitterverse, made a lot of noise on cable TV and \u2026 nothing happened.\n\nClinton will need huge turnout from the Obama coalition to win. The bad news is that, so far, the Obama coalition is like a non-transferable, single-purpose coupon.\n\nThe group's other big priority: making Obamacare popular. That still hasn't happened.\n\nIn every off-year and midterm election of his presidency, Obama tried very hard to rally his faithful for other candidates, including in the special election for the late Ted Kennedy's Senate seat. Obama failed, often spectacularly. After losing the Senate in 2014, Obama petulantly said he heard the voters but added: \u201cTo the two-thirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday, I hear you too.\u201d\n\nWhatever he meant by that, it was also an implicit concession that the Obama coalition isn't a proletarian reserve army that can be mobilized at will, even by Obama.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has hired Obama's image consultants in the hopes that they can do for her what they allegedly did for him. They've even tried to replicate Obama's signature \u201cO\u201d logo into an exciting \u201cH,\u201d which mostly looks like a road sign pointing to the next exit for a hospital.\n\nThe inelegance seems amusingly symbolic. The letter \u201cO\u201d lends itself to graphic artistry, the letter \u201cH,\u201d not so much. It's no surprise that consultants think consultants are very important. But turning Clinton into Obama (or Bill Clinton) is beyond their powers.\n\nIn 2008, the enthusiasm for Obama's novel candidacy was self-evident and organic. His personal appeal was such that his handlers felt he could never be over-exposed.\n\nEnthusiasm for Clinton's long-expected candidacy, while obviously sincere for many partisans, is more asserted than obvious. That's why the smartest thing about Clinton's announcement video wasn't the testimonials from so many \u201ceveryday Americans.\u201d It was that there was so little Hillary Clinton in it.\n\n\n\njgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com\n\nFollow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obama coalition isn't a coupon that Hillary Clinton can redeem for votes", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "In news only slightly more surprising than this morning's sunrise, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced she is running for president again.", "title": "Obama coalition isn't a coupon that Hillary Clinton can redeem for votes", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-oe-0414-goldberg-hillary-clinton-obama-coalition-20150414-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-552c87b5/turbine/la-oe-0414-goldberg-hillary-clinton-obama-coalition-20150414", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Rodham, Obama, campaign, 2016, Democrats, Republicans, president, election, Hillary Clinton, video, everyday americans, latino, gay, coalition, young, minority, organizing for america, consultants, gun control, obamacare", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83288596", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-04-13", "Description": "In news only slightly more surprising than this morning's sunrise, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced she is running for president again.The announcement came in the form of a clever video, in which Clinton says she wants to be a \u201cchampion\u201d for \u201ceveryday Americans\u201d \u2014 an obviously focus-grouped term...", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Rodham, Obama, campaign, 2016, Democrats, Republicans, president, election, Hillary Clinton, video, everyday americans, latino, gay, coalition, young, minority, organizing for america, consultants, gun control, obamacare"}, "article_summary": "The bad news is that, so far, the Obama coalition is like a non-transferable, single-purpose coupon that can only be used to get Obama elected president.\nThe bad news is that, so far, the Obama coalition is like a non-transferable, single-purpose coupon.\nMost political pros agree that Clinton will need a huge turnout from the Obama coalition to win.\nThe people profiled are a visual checklist of Barack Obama's \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d (Ron Brownstein's phrase): young people, minorities, gays, college-educated whites, single working women, etc.\nClinton will need huge turnout from the Obama coalition to win."}
