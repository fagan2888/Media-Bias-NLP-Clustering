Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center.\n\nGhostly black-and-white images of stars and planets, culled by the artist Rosa Barba, appeared while recorded voices emerged from loudspeakers, some of them musing on astronomy, some discussing philosophy. The conversational patchwork moved from parsecs to Italo Calvino.\n\nEncompassing units of astronomical measurement and Italian literature is just the kind of thing that this enormous building was created for. The Priem Center, known as Empac, opened in 2008 with a mission to explore the blurring boundary between the arts and sciences \u2014 both, after all, engaged in the work of experimentation and the examination of perception.\n\nTo that end Empac\u2019s four performance spaces were equipped with an impressive range of multimedia and technical capacities. Led by its director, Johannes Goebel, the center\u2019s curators have attracted artists eager for the time and resources to do work that might raise eyebrows elsewhere.\n\nSome of the programming has been idiosyncratic but low-tech \u2014 Michael Gordon rehearsed and recorded his bassoon septet \u201cRushes\u201d; Laurie Anderson led an onstage tai chi class \u2014 and some has been more overtly cutting edge. Dancers have traced their movements with a 3-D laser scanner. Mr. Goebel has been part of a collaborative project focused on data visualization and virtual reality. The composer Pauline Oliveros, a professor at the school, has worked with others on developing an artificial-intelligence musician able to perform (and improvise!) alongside a human ensemble.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cInterzone\u201d (2003-4), a multimedia acoustic-electric work by the German composer Enno Poppe, which the Talea Ensemble was originally supposed to perform on Friday, would have fit in well here, with the players on a custom-built stage in the center of the 1,200-seat concert hall, surrounded by the audience and projection screens. But visa issues forced the group to substitute it with Mr. Poppe\u2019s \u201cSpeicher\u201d (2008-13), conducted by James Baker, in its American premiere.\n\nEntirely acoustic \u2014 the sound booth, often a site of intense activity at an Empac concert, sat empty and forlorn \u2014 the 70-minute \u201cSpeicher\u201d is really an assemblage of six pieces, played without pause. Mr. Goebel is obsessive about acoustics and eliminating ambient noise in Empac\u2019s halls, and one of Mr. Poppe\u2019s recurring motifs, a soft, sighing droop, registered with preternatural clarity and presence, even if just a single musician was playing it.\n\nSlithering, unsteady passages roused themselves into raucous celebrations, handled with Talea\u2019s characteristic polish and vitality. Mr. Poppe has a gift for imaginative orchestration: Rarely has an accordion\u2019s wheeze taken on such organlike nobility, or a celesta sounded so pearly against piercing winds.\n\nThe audience numbered about 70, roughly 6 percent of capacity and low enough to give most artistic directors panic attacks. (Other similarly challenging concerts here have done significantly better.) But Mr. Goebel, cushioned by sources of revenue other than customers, radiates blissful indifference to such matters.\n\nAs universities become, more and more, the American institutions best equipped to fund artmaking, Empac\u2019s thoroughly academic approach may become more common, valuing exploration and incremental advancement of the field as ends in themselves. The Talea Ensemble was given an uninterrupted week in the space, a rare opportunity to study and percolate. If just a few dozen people showed up for the final product, should it matter?\n\nWell, maybe. While Mr. Goebel cares little about ticket sales per se, he wants to entice more students. The few who showed up to \u201cSpeicher\u201d might well have been turned off by the hall\u2019s lighting, which was kept throughout the concert at a presumably intentional full blast, creating an almost extravagantly uncomfortable listening environment. Without a preconcert talk, on-stage discussion or extensive notes, the evening, for better or worse, emphasized immersion over education.\n\n\u201cIt was a stretch for many people here,\u201d the physicist Shirley Ann Jackson, the school\u2019s president since 1999 and the visionary behind Empac, said of the center\u2019s inception in an interview in her office overlooking downtown Troy. But she said the board, faculty and students had embraced it, and initiatives aimed at fostering more interdisciplinary research projects are included in the strategy that will culminate in 2024, the school\u2019s bicentennial.\n\nFinancial difficulties remain: Empac\u2019s budget has suffered from schoolwide cuts and a hiring freeze has stalled the process of appointing a new curator of theater and dance. But its resources remain formidable and its goal \u2014 creating a space for people to expand their range of experience \u2014 is inspiring. There\u2019s even something refreshing about Mr. Goebel\u2019s distaste for easy, Facebook-style approval. Asked if he wanted people to like the work he presented, he replied, with a smile: \u201cLiking is such a feeble thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20150315173720, "twitter": {"description": "The Talea Ensemble performed at this experimental arts center to an audience at roughly 6 percent of capacity, low enough to give most artistic directors panic attacks.", "title": "Empac Shrugs Popularity to Promote Creative Liberty in Troy, N.Y.", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/arts/music/empac-shrugs-popularity-to-promote-creative-liberty-in-troy-ny.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003573673"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/arts/16TROY/16TROY-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/arts/music/empac-shrugs-popularity-to-promote-creative-liberty-in-troy-ny.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003573673", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/arts/music/empac-shrugs-popularity-to-promote-creative-liberty-in-troy-ny.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "arts/music", "hdl_p": "Shrugging Popularity to Promote Creative Liberty", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 15, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Talea Ensemble", "keywords": "Music,Priem  Curtis R  Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center,Poppe  Enno,Goebel  Johannes,Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Culture (Arts),Talea Ensemble,Poppe  Enno (1965- )", "news_keywords": "Music", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Zachary Woolfe", "SCG": "music", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Poppe, Enno (1965- )", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ZACHARY WOOLFE", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The Talea Ensemble performed at this experimental arts center to an audience at roughly 6 percent of capacity, low enough to give most artistic directors panic attacks.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/arts/16TROY/16TROY-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/arts/16TROY/16TROY-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "The Talea Ensemble performed at this experimental arts center to an audience at roughly 6 percent of capacity, low enough to give most artistic directors panic attacks.", "CG": "arts", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "March 15, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"section": "Music", "modified": "2015-03-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/arts/music/index.jsonp", "tag": "Poppe, Enno (1965- )", "published": "2015-03-15", "section-taxonomy-id": "C5BFA7D5-359C-427B-90E6-6B7245A6CDD8"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "16troy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150316183736, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/16/arts/music/empac-shrugs-popularity-to-promote-creative-liberty-in-troy-ny.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/16/arts/16TROY/16TROY-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Talea Ensemble performed at this experimental arts center to an audience at roughly 6 percent of capacity, low enough to give most artistic directors panic attacks.", "title": "Empac Shrugs Popularity to Promote Creative Liberty in Troy, N.Y."}, "pdate": 20150315, "des": "Culture (Arts)", "articleid": 100000003573673, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Empac Shrugs Popularity to Promote Creative Liberty in Troy, N.Y.", "col": "Critic\u2019s Notebook", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Goebel has been part of a collaborative project focused on data visualization and virtual reality.\nBut Mr. Goebel, cushioned by sources of revenue other than customers, radiates blissful indifference to such matters.\nWhile Mr. Goebel cares little about ticket sales per se, he wants to entice more students.\nBut visa issues forced the group to substitute it with Mr. Poppe\u2019s \u201cSpeicher\u201d (2008-13), conducted by James Baker, in its American premiere.\nEntirely acoustic \u2014 the sound booth, often a site of intense activity at an Empac concert, sat empty and forlorn \u2014 the 70-minute \u201cSpeicher\u201d is really an assemblage of six pieces, played without pause."}
