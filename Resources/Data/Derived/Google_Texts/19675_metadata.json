The Tea Party\u2019s job is to keep making things clearer, and this is only the beginning. It is not a job that will be finished overnight or even in an election cycle. Thomas Jefferson believed that the price of liberty was eternal vigilance \u2014 and now the Tea Party must prove it.\n\n\u201cWe currently have no evidence to confirm that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote\u201d this phrase, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation has said of \u201cthe price of liberty was eternal vigilance,\u201d which Paul uses twice in his book.\n\nEarlier, Paul used another fake Jefferson quote:\n\nIn their wisdom, the Founding Fathers\u2014 whose Constitution was supposed to restrain our rulers\u2014 would have likely made the same prediction. Jefferson wrote, \u201cMy reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government.\u201d This has certainly been true of too much government intervention, as well as attempts to administer too many government benefits.\n\n\u201cThis exact quotation has not been found in any of the writings of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d writes the Thomas Jefferson Foundation.\n\nWriting on the Patriot Act, Paul again cites a fake Jefferson quote.\n\n\u201cThis sort of invasiveness is also precisely the reason we have a Second Amendment protecting our right to keep and bear arms, or as Jefferson wrote \u2018The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs noted by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, \u201cthis quotation has not been found in any of the writings of Thomas Jefferson.\u201d\n\nLater, writing on Obamacare, Paul cites a different fake Jefferson quote.\n\nWhen Thomas Jefferson wrote that a \u201cgovernment big enough to give you everything you want is big enough to take away everything you have,\u201d he could have easily been referencing Obamacare.\n\n\u201cNeither this quotation nor any of its variant forms has been found in the writings of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d writes the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. The foundation notes that it has been attributed to Gerald Ford, though an assistant to Ford said he heard it from someone else.\n\nAnother quote cited by Paul from Jefferson appears to be a misquote.\n\n\u201cTo compel a man to subsidize with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical,\u201d reads the Jefferson quote at the beginning on one chapter.\n\nAs noted by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, this quote comes from Jefferson\u2019s Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom and the original actually reads, \u201cto compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.\u201d\n\nPaul also uses a fake George Washington quote.\n\nSuch is the nature of government, which is precisely why the Founders viewed military use, even when warranted, as something that should be definite and limited. George Washington told us: \u201cGovernment is not reason; it is not eloquence; it is force\u2026. Never for a moment should it be left to irresponsible action.\u201d Science tells us that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Yet today it seems we are much less hesitant to use government action, whether abroad or domestically, than the Founders could have ever imagined. The Founding Fathers also would not be surprised to see that trying to solve problems with continuous government action creates its own set of problems. Not surprisingly, the majority of what our federal government does today, abroad or domestically, also continues to take place well outside the parameters of the Constitution.\n\nThe quote, as noted by professor Eugene Volokh and Fred Shapiro, editor of the Yale Book of Quotations, is also fake.\n\n\u201cThis is undoubtedly apocryphal, like many other quotations attributed to Lincoln or Washington,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cNo one has ever found any evidence that Washington said it.\u201d\n\nLater in the book, a quote from Benjamin Franklin is used out of context. In the context of the quote as used in the 1750s, Franklin was actually speaking in support of not only taxation but also defense spending.\n\nWrites Paul:\n\nWho\u2019s to say the Tea Party won\u2019t become the government\u2019s next target under the PATRIOT Act? Benjamin Franklin once wrote, \u201cThey who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety,\u201d and Americans who continue to support unconstitutional intrusions into the private lives of their fellow citizens will inevitably learn the same lesson.\n\nAs noted by Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the editor of Lawfare blog, the letter from Franklin concerned a dispute between the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the Penn family.\n\n\u201cHe was writing about a tax dispute between the Pennsylvania General Assembly and the family of the Penns, the proprietary family of the Pennsylvania colony who ruled it from afar,\u201d Wittes said recently on NPR.\n\n\u201cAnd the legislature was trying to tax the Penn family lands to pay for frontier defense during the French and Indian War. And the Penn family kept instructing the governor to veto. Franklin felt that this was a great affront to the ability of the legislature to govern. And so he actually meant purchase a little temporary safety very literally. The Penn family was trying to give a lump sum of money in exchange for the General Assembly\u2019s acknowledging that it did not have the authority to tax it.\u201d\n\nPaul also mischaracterized this quote in his second book, Government Bullies, on two separate occasions with slightly different variations.\n\nWrites Paul in his book, \u201cas Benjamin Franklin famously said and our Founders knew well, those who trade liberty for security get neither.\u201d\n\nThen, Paul cites a fake Thomas Jefferson quote again to lead off the chapter \u201cLiving Everyday in Fear of Your Government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen governments fear the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny,\u201d Paul cites Jefferson as saying.\n\nBut again, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation notes they \u201chave not found any evidence that Thomas Jefferson said or wrote\u201d these remarks.\n\nPaul\u2019s chapter \u201cPaved With Good Intentions\u201d also starts off with a mischaracterized Jefferson quote.\n\n\u201cIf people let the government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as the souls who live under tyranny,\u201d Paul attributes to Jefferson.\n\nAs noted again by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, \u201cThis quotation has never been found in Jefferson\u2019s papers in its above form, but it is most likely a paraphrase of Jefferson\u2019s statement in Notes on the State of Virginia, \u201cWas the government to prescribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as our souls are now.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s chapter \u201cHow Can We Solve the Problem\u201d starts off with a quote from former President James Madison that is likewise disputed.\n\n\u201cIf tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy,\u201d Paul quotes Madison saying.\n\nAs noted by etymologist Barry Popik there\u2019s no evidence Madison said it, and no citations link it to Madison before the 21st century.\n\nIn the past three weeks, Paul has misattributed a quote to former President Abraham Lincoln (a quote he again repeated in a speech today) and used a fake quote from Founding Father Patrick Henry. Previously, Paul used a fake Thomas Jefferson quote in his Senate victory speech.\n\nAt CPAC in 2011, Paul cited a Jefferson quote that the Thomas Jefferson Foundation says they have \u201cno evidence\u201d he ever said.\n\nPaul\u2019s campaign declined to comment, and the book publisher did not respond to request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3810366, "userid": 227410}, "description": "\"We currently have no evidence to confirm that Thomas Jefferson ever said or wrote\" this...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
