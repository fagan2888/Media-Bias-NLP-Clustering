He had a 5-yard run that put Ohio State up 14-3 in the second quarter and a 10-yard run put the Buckeyes ahead 35-13 early in the fourth.\n\nEven with the win, the Buckeyes need Penn State to beat No. 6 Michigan State later in the day to reach the Big Ten championship game against Iowa. Their fans at the Big House knew it as they chanted: \u201cGo Penn State! Go Pen State!\u201d\n\nThe Wolverines (9-3, 6-2, No. 10 CFP) simply could not stop their rivals from running at will. They fell behind early, and quarterback Jake Rudock was knocked out of the game when he was sacked and slammed onto his left shoulder.\n\nJ.T. Barrett, who had 19 carries for a season-high 139 yards, started the scoring barrage with a 7-yard run late in the first quarter. His 13-yard run late in the third quarter gave the Buckeyes an 18-point cushion and his 17-yard run midway through the fourth made mercifully ended the scoring for Michigan.\n\nAs a team, Ohio State ran for 369 yards.\n\nBarrett was nine of 15 \u2014 throwing fewer times than he ran \u2014 for 113 yards and a 24-yard TD pass to Jalin Marshall 25 yard TD pass early that capped the first drive of the second half to give Ohio State a 21-10 lead.\n\nRudock was injured by former high school teammate Joey Bosa early in the fourth quarter and was replaced by Wilton Speight. Rudock and Bosa played together at St. Thomas Aquinas in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nRudock was 19 of 32 for 263 yards and a TD. Unlike Ohio State, the Wolverines struggled to move the ball on the ground. Three-way player Jabrill Peppers had 29 yards rushing on seven carries and No. 1 running back De\u2019Veon Smith had 10 carries for just 23 yards.\n\nMichigan kept the game competitive \u2014 in the first half.\n\nKenny Allen kicked a 25-yard field goal to pull the Wolverines within four points early in the second quarter. Rudock made a 5-yard TD pass to Jehu Chesson to cut Ohio State\u2019s lead to 14-10 just before halftime.\n\nThe Wolverines never caught up. While Jim Harbaugh has generated a lot of hype this year for coming back to lead Michigan, were he was the starting quarterback two decades ago, he has to improve a program that is 0-4 against Buckeyes coach Urban Meyer.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the year for Michigan to gain an edge in The Game. In the fourth quarter, red-clad fans were easy to see in the emptying stadium and could be heard shouting, \u201cOH-IO! OH-IO!\u201d toward the end of another blowout.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No. 8 Ohio State tops No. 12 Michigan with ground game", "title": "No. 8 Ohio State tops No. 12 Michigan with ground game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/28/no-8-ohio-state-tops-no-12-michigan-with-ground-game/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128_030027_ezekiel-elliott.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151128_030027_ezekiel-elliott.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-28T13:58:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T05:21:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "6 Michigan State later in the day to reach the Big Ten championship game against Iowa.\nUnlike Ohio State, the Wolverines struggled to move the ball on the ground.\n8 Ohio State rout No.\nAs a team, Ohio State ran for 369 yards.\nElliott\u2019s performance came a week after he was held to 12 carries for 33 yards against Michigan State, then criticized the team\u2019s play calling and said he will skip his senior season to enter the NFL draft."}
