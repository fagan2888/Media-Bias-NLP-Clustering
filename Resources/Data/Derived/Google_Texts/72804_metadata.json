Credit: Mark Hoffman\n\nBy of the\n\nCharlotte, N.C. \u2014 Paul George is back in Indiana and playing the way he did before breaking his leg more than a year ago.\n\nKristaps Porzingis has burst onto the New York scene with his electrifying putback dunks and bigger-than-life 7-foot-3 frame.\n\nTobias Harris and Victor Oladipo are blossoming in Orlando, and Andre Drummond is pounding the boards in Detroit.\n\nNicolas Batum has brought a needed perimeter threat to Charlotte to complement dynamic point guard Kemba Walker. Boston has bench power to keep it in games. Cleveland is still Cleveland, and Atlanta, Chicago and Toronto look strong again.\n\nSo you think the East is better than it was a year ago?\n\nAll the evidence points to a wild scramble for playoff spots in the Eastern Conference this season, and suddenly the Milwaukee Bucks are finding raised expectations a difficult mission.\n\nMilwaukee brings a 6-10 record into its Sunday matinee game against the Charlotte Hornets, one of those now above-.500 teams at 9-7.\n\nThe Bucks improved by a league-best 26 games last season to finish at 41-41 and sixth in the East in their first season under coach Jason Kidd.\n\nBut it's unlikely any sub-.500 teams will make the playoffs this season, as Brooklyn and Boston did in 2015.\n\n\"I said even before our training camp that I didn't think below .500 was going to cut it this year in the East,\" said Magic coach Scott Skiles, who led the Bucks from the start of the 2008-'09 season until January 2013.\n\n\"It seems to be shaping up that way, which is good. You should have to have a winning record if you're going to be a postseason team. It's one of the reasons they've talked about redoing the whole playoff format, because the East hasn't been good enough.\n\n\"Maybe at the end of this season all that talk will be gone. But yeah, it makes it more difficult. You better have a winning record, that's what it looks like right now. So many teams are fluttering a game or two either way of .500 right now. We're coming up pretty quickly on the quarter pole. Things usually at that point start shaping up the way they're going to shape up.\"\n\nThat should put some serious fear into the Bucks, who have lost five of their last six games after going 5-5 against a relatively easy schedule to open the season.\n\nThe Bucks players are well aware of what could happen if they don't fix their defensive woes and start stringing some victories together.\n\n\"We can't use young (as an excuse),\" guard O.J. Mayo said. \"We were young last year. We've just got to stay positive.\"\n\nThe Bucks are incorporating new players in their system, including center Greg Monroe and point guard Greivis Vasquez, signed to provide perimeter power off the bench. But Vasquez has struggled with his shot and much of the three-point burden has fallen on Jerryd Bayless, who has kept the Bucks afloat in many games.\n\nBut the veteran Bayless knows the team has to change its approach and buy in to Kidd's defensive principles. Milwaukee ranked second in defensive efficiency rating last season (points per 100 possessions) but currently ranks last in the 30-team NBA.\n\n\"We've got to do it quick,\" Bayless said after the latest defeat, a 114-90 pasting applied by the Magic on Friday night.\n\nThe Bucks thought their offense would be much improved but it also has struggled. Jabari Parker is reintegrating himself into the lineup after missing most of last season with an anterior cruciate ligament tear, and point guard Michael Carter-Williams is trying to find his fit and limit turnovers. Khris Middleton has struggled to hit his shot at times.\n\nOn Friday the Magic frustrated Monroe, who was limited to 3-of-12 shooting and scored just nine points.\n\nMayo said the team has to find its way out as a collective unit, not with each person trying to do it himself.\n\nIn the meantime the Bucks can see the other teams playing better. They were stunned on opening night by the Knicks, although Milwaukee did beat New York the following week at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe Bucks already have lost to Washington twice, once with Bradley Beal in the lineup and once without. They lost to Boston at home, Cleveland on the road, Indiana on the road in a rout and Toronto on the road.\n\nThey did beat Cleveland at home in a thrilling double-overtime game and knocked off Detroit at home on Monday.\n\n\"You can go up and down the whole list of teams; everybody is improved,\" said Bucks assistant Joe Prunty, who filled in for the suspended Kidd on Friday night.\n\n\"You have to be ready to play every night, regardless of the circumstances, no matter who you are playing against.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "Bucks trying to keep up in improved Eastern Conference", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/bucks/bucks-trying-to-keep-up-in-improved-eastern-conference-b99623530z1-357445551.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99623530z.1_20151128210827_000_gv7dho9a.1-1.jpg", "height": 1282}, "type": "article", "description": "All the evidence points to a wild scramble for playoff spots in the Eastern Conference this season, and suddenly the Milwaukee Bucks are finding raised expectations a difficult mission.", "title": "Bucks trying to keep up in improved Eastern Conference"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99623530z.1_20151128210827_000_gv7dho9a.1-1.jpg", "description": "All the evidence points to a wild scramble for playoff spots in the Eastern Conference this season, and suddenly the Milwaukee Bucks are finding raised expectations a difficult mission.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bucks trying to keep up in improved Eastern Conference"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nicolas Batum has brought a needed perimeter threat to Charlotte to complement dynamic point guard Kemba Walker.\n7-foot-3 Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis (right) has made a splash in the New York scene and contributes to a tougher Eastern Conference.\nAll the evidence points to a wild scramble for playoff spots in the Eastern Conference this season, and suddenly the Milwaukee Bucks are finding raised expectations a difficult mission.\nThe Bucks are incorporating new players in their system, including center Greg Monroe and point guard Greivis Vasquez, signed to provide perimeter power off the bench.\nThe Bucks improved by a league-best 26 games last season to finish at 41-41 and sixth in the East in their first season under coach Jason Kidd."}
