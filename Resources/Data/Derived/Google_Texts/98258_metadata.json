(Photo: Steve Hix/Somos Images/Corbis)\n\nWhat is a question worth? Try $1.7 billion. That\u2019s the impact on the one-day market capitalization of HCA after the King vs. Burwell oral arguments before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nKing is the most recent challenge to the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In King , Mr. King and the other petitioners argue that the ACA federal tax credits to purchase health insurance are not available to states, such as Tennessee, that use the ACA federal exchange.\n\nAfter oral argument, most Nashville health care stocks immediately rose several points. For example, HCA stock rose $4.14 per share; with over 420 million shares outstanding, that\u2019s a $1.7 billion swing in market capitalization in one day (5.8 percent). That same day, Community Health Systems stock rose $3.13 (6.3 percent) and LifePoint Hospitals rose $2.60 (3.6 percent), resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in market value for each.\n\nWhat did Wall Street like about the oral argument? What lies ahead on this significant and valuable issue?\n\nFirst, the question. During oral arguments, Justice Anthony Kennedy began a question with the following:\n\n\u201cFrom the standpoint of federalism, it does seem that there is something very powerful \u2026 the states are being told either create your Exchange, or we\u2019ll send your insurance market into a death spiral.\u201d\n\nIn Justice Kennedy\u2019s words, \u201cthere\u2019s a serious constitutional problem.\u201d\n\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s questioning in King suggested that he might be viewing the \u201cExchange Mandate\u201d in a manner similar to the \u201cMedicaid Mandate\u201d from the ACA sentinel holding in NFIB vs. Sebelius . The NFIB decision upheld the ACA Individual Mandate (4-1-4) under the Constitutional Taxing Power of the Congress. Additionally, the NFIB decision also held (7-2) that the \u201cMedicaid Mandate\u201d of the ACA (that states are required to expand Medicaid or lose all federal Medicaid funding), to be unconstitutionally coercive under the tenets of federalism (the balance of power between the federal and state governments).\n\nIn addition to Justice Kennedy, the questioning from Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan suggest that four votes are firmly in the camp of sustaining the Obama administration\u2019s interpretation of the ACA, i.e. that the tax subsidies are available to both the federal and state exchanges. This means that the federal government needs only one of the remaining five Justices to prevail. The markets\u2019 spontaneous interpretation is that the one vote may be Justice Kennedy.\n\nIf the Supreme Court were to hold for King and the other petitioners, the stock market reaction would likely be swift and adverse. For Nashville\u2019s health care titans, this case is very high stakes poker.\n\nIf the Supreme Court decision is adverse to the Obama administration, there is little likelihood that a Republican Congress will come to the rescue of the ACA. Likewise, after the quick dismissal of Insure Tennessee, there is little likelihood that the Tennessee governor and Tennessee General Assembly will volunteer to solve the problem by creating a Tennessee Insurance Exchange.\n\nAs the governor recently quipped, \u201cthis problem was created in Washington and it can be solved in Washington.\u201d Accordingly, Nashville health care companies have a great deal riding on this case. Let\u2019s hope Justice Kennedy\u2019s questions are a true indicator of his likely position. For Nashville, billions of dollars in market capitalization may hang in the balance.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1bdI3In", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Nashville health care stocks swing with ACA challenge", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Nashville health care stocks swing with ACA challenge", "title": "Nashville health care stocks swing with ACA challenge", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2015/03/17/nashville-health-care-stocks-swing-aca-challenge/24903789/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nashville health care stocks swing with ACA challenge", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/09b09cbdc4a6dc8f60dae539b97674a3a15c5fef/c=382-0-1908-1526&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/03/17/B9316634559Z.1_20150317125803_000_GHDA8DPRK.1-0.jpg", "title": "Nashville health care stocks swing with ACA challenge", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Community Health Systems", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Companies/Community Health Systems", "title": "Nashville health care stocks swing with ACA challenge", "author": "Dick Cowart", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/867ac8745c82afc71c7c10b0300336ea6ed56969/c=572-0-1716-1526/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/03/17/B9316634559Z.1_20150317125803_000_GHDA8DPRK.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/554be756871cfce6103e30e8056f02c9e9051066/c=382-0-1908-1526/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/03/17/B9316634559Z.1_20150317125803_000_GHDA8DPRK.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ff09901cdd0d98ab40b700310154af2696c0d4c/c=127-0-2162-1526/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/03/17/B9316634559Z.1_20150317125803_000_GHDA8DPRK.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3fc914ec8be98c6571a66240e86e1e893bbb40f2/c=0-119-2289-1407&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/03/17/B9316634559Z.1_20150317125803_000_GHDA8DPRK.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-03-17T11:58:03-05:00", "shorthed": "ACA challenge ripples to Wall Street", "articleid": 24903789, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ab9ab41ad4ac6c51d0a96b7192f1a77912f60518/c=0-119-2289-1407/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/03/17/B9316634559Z.1_20150317125803_000_GHDA8DPRK.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6752b61db9e49e952e2660127ba4600eaea817e5/c=716-0-1574-1526/local/-/media/Nashville/2015/03/17/B9316634559Z.1_20150317125803_000_GHDA8DPRK.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, ACA, Wall Street, HCA, Community Health Systems, LifePoint Hospitals"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe0b\"", "article_summary": "After oral argument, most Nashville health care stocks immediately rose several points.\nFor Nashville\u2019s health care titans, King vs. Burwell is very high stakes poker.\nFor Nashville\u2019s health care titans, this case is very high stakes poker.\nAs the governor recently quipped, \u201cthis problem was created in Washington and it can be solved in Washington.\u201d Accordingly, Nashville health care companies have a great deal riding on this case.\nIn King , Mr. King and the other petitioners argue that the ACA federal tax credits to purchase health insurance are not available to states, such as Tennessee, that use the ACA federal exchange."}
