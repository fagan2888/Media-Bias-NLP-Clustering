On average, uncompensated care costs amounted to 11 percent of the nonprofit VHHA members\u2019 total expenses in 2012-13, the most recent year for which complete figures are available.\n\nHospitals\u2019 uncompensated care costs include charity care provided to the poor free of charge, unreimbursed Medicaid costs incurred because the program underpays for the services Medicaid enrollees receive, and bad debt from billed patients who fail to pay.\n\nFor nonprofit Virginia hospitals, charity care averaged 4.2 percent of total expenses, unreimbursed Medicaid averaged 2.7 percent of total expenses, and bad debt averaged 4.1 percent.\n\nNorfolk-based Sentara Hospitals reported $146 million in revenue less expenses in 2013, and Inova Health Care in Falls Church netted $145 million.\n\nVHHA lobbies for additional government assistance with uncompensated care by encouraging state lawmakers to implement policies such as the 2010 federal health insurance law\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion.\n\nJulian Walker, VHHA vice president of communications, directed Watchdog.org to a November press release stating that 25 percent of acute care facilities and nearly 42 percent of rural hospitals in Virginia finished 2014 in the red.\n\n\u201cBeyond government health care mandates, cuts due to the Affordable Care Act and sequestration that are not being offset by available resources stand as additional threats,\u201d the statement warned.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion adds working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities to the Medicaid rolls, with the promise of new federal deficit spending to pay for no less than 90 percent of enrollees\u2019 benefit costs.\n\nIn a December letter to Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe \u2014 an Obamacare expansion supporter \u2014 and the Virginia General Assembly, VHHA offered conditional support for a new hospital fee to help cover Virginia\u2019s share of Medicaid expansion costs in order to bring billions in federal matching funds to the state.\n\nBut the same VHHA letter emphasized the negative impact of low reimbursement rates from the existing Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cFor hospitals, things have gotten worse over time. In 2002, for instance, Medicaid reimbursed hospitals and health systems at 79 percent of a patient\u2019s cost of care,\u201d VHHA president Sean Connaughton wrote. \u201cThis rate has fallen further since then and is now down to 66 percent.\u201d\n\nThompson of the Thomas Jefferson Institute isn\u2019t convinced the state\u2019s hospitals need the infusion of new federal welfare spending an Obamacare expansion would bring.\n\nNonprofit VHHA members, Thompson noted, are expected to provide charity care in exchange for state sales and property tax exemptions. But the hospitals want the state to opt in to Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion to shift more charity care and bad debt costs to federal taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThe hospitals foisted on all of us what we have today with Obamacare in order to protect themselves,\u201d Thomspon added. \u201cThey made a deal with the devil, and now they\u2019re complaining.\u201d\n\nThompson thinks expanding Medicaid would be a short-sighted mistake. With the federal government $19 trillion in debt, \u201cwe know there\u2019s a financial brick wall out here in the fog somewhere, and we\u2019re going toward it pretty quickly but we don\u2019t quite know where it is,\u201d he said.\n\nMcAuliffe has been lobbying for Obamacare expansion for several years, but Republicans in the Virginia General Assembly again refused to include the expansion in their latest budget.\n\nUncompensated care details for the Virginia hospitals whose tax year 2013 (or tax year 2012, for hospitals with a tax year starting before Jan. 1) IRS Form 990 filings are available from GuideStar are listed below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uncompensated care costs haven't prevented Virginia's nonprofit hospitals, which back Medicaid expansion, from taking in revenue far in excess of expenses.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Uncompensated care costs haven't prevented Virginia's nonprofit hospitals, which back Medicaid expansion, from taking in revenue far in excess of expenses.", "title": "Virginia nonprofit hospitals doing well without Medicaid expansion - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/mcauliffe.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-03T12:51:08+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/258462/virginia-nonprofit-hospitals-well-without-medicaid-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Uncompensated care costs haven't prevented Virginia's nonprofit hospitals, which back Medicaid expansion, from taking in revenue far in excess of expenses.", "title": "Virginia nonprofit hospitals doing well without Medicaid expansion - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/mcauliffe.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Gov.
