Now in their 70s, they\u2019ve been back every year since.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting better,\u201d Dwyer said of Saturday\u2019s parade, billed as the largest St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebration west of the Mississippi. \u201cThere\u2019s so much participation now \u2014 I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nThe crowd was 10 people deep in places as spectators vied for a view of the floats. As groups of bagpipe players and traditional Irish dancers passed by, people clapped their hands to the music.\n\nJamie Cotter, 33, brought her family from Broomfield to enjoy the spectacle for the first time. She said her 4-year-old son, Broden, had seen the announcement on the news and wanted to catch the marching bands.\n\nFood trucks and street vendors lined the parade route, taking advantage of the crowds and the nice weather. Charles Gardner stood at the corner of Blake and 17th streets, selling costumes and toys from a shopping cart.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everything green and Irish,\u201d Gardner said of his goods. He added that business is \u201cbooming\u201d this year, with sparkly hats and green stuffed animals as his best sellers.\n\nAfter the parade, a variety of celebrations continued around the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s coming-out day for spring,\u201d Dwyer said, laughing. \u201cWe have to decide which party to go to.\u201d\n\nAnna Gauldin: 303-954-1666, agauldin@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Young and old delight in Denver\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade", "title": "Young and old delight in Denver\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/14/young-and-old-delight-in-denvers-st-patricks-day-parade/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314__st-pats-parade-cfwp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314__st-pats-parade-cfwp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-14T12:44:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:07:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was 1963, the year of Denver\u2019s first official St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade.\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting better,\u201d Dwyer said of Saturday\u2019s parade, billed as the largest St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebration west of the Mississippi.\nFifty-two St. Patrick\u2019s Days ago, John Dwyer met his future wife at Duffy\u2019s Shamrock Restaurant & Bar in downtown Denver.\n\u201cIt\u2019s everything green and Irish,\u201d Gardner said of his goods.\nFood trucks and street vendors lined the parade route, taking advantage of the crowds and the nice weather."}
