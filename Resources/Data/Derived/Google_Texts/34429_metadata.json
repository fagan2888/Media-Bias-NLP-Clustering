The most famous of course is:\n\n\u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan. Period\u201d\n\nWhich on a daily basis is shown to be more and more untrue.\n\nExpert: At Least 129 Million Will \u2018Not Be Able to Keep\u2019 Health Care Plan If ObamaCare Fully Implemented\n\nThe reason for this coverage hemorrhage is \u2013 more government. More government mandates and regulations are constricting the private health insurance sector into blue-faced oblivion \u2013 and squeezing more and more people out of their coverage.\n\nThese government regs are canceling insurance \u2013 and making it much more expensive. Which was another President Obama and Democrat lie.\n\nObama Promises To Lower Health Insurance Premiums for Family of Four by $2,500 Per Year\n\nAgain, not so much.\n\nObamaCare Will Increase Health Spending By $7,450 For A Typical Family of Four\n\nObamacare Increases Premiums for Men 99%, 62% for Women\n\nJust released were the slightly-less-pathetic-than-Obama-Normal October jobs numbers. Which undid another Leftist lie \u2013 that the half-month government ever-so-partial-shutdown would be detrimental to the economy.\n\nMore Jobs Than Expected Added\n\nThe government being slightly-closed for the first half resulted in one of the best jobs months in five Obama years. But let\u2019s not get too excited.\n\nBusinesses Hire Up to Deal With More Regs\n\nHiring paper pushers in the nation\u2019s Government Compliance Departments is just about the biggest waste of time, money and effort there is. Wonder why things get more and more expensive, and less and less effective? Because our nation\u2019s innovators are forced with ever greater regularity and intensity to deal with government.\n\nRed Tape Rises Again: Cost of Regulation Reaches $1.75 Trillion\n\nThat was way back in 2010 \u2013 before ObamaCare (and the rest of the Obama Fiat agenda) really began kicking in.\n\nAverage 68 New Regulations Per Day From Obama Administration\n\nTime, money and effort are finite resources \u2013 the more government consumes, the less there is for everyone and everything else.\n\nSo why is the Left so completely befuddled by the effects of the government\u2019s illegal, all-encompassing Internet power grab Network Neutrality?\n\nEight Ways the Internet Will Suffer if Net Neutrality Is Killed\n\nReally? Let\u2019s look at some of the ways this is supposedly so.\n\n1. It\u2019ll be more expensive\n\nYes, because as ObamaCare has yet again demonstrated, Big Government regulations dramatically lower costs.\n\n3. Service will be worse, unless you\u2019re willing to pay\n\nYes, because as ObamaCare \u2013 and its website \u2013 have yet again demonstrated, greater government involvement is a tremendous boost to service. Like the Post Office. Or the DMV. More government means worse service \u2013 and higher prices anyway.\n\n4. There will be less innovation\n\nNet Neutrality is basically the government regulating the Internet the way it has for seventy-plus years the landline telephone. You know \u2013 that bastion of innovation. (At least we\u2019re no longer rotary dialing or having to ring Sarah Andy Griffith-style.)\n\n6. \u2026BitTorrent sites will suffer\n\nYou mean sites that steal music and movies and then sell them? Shouldn\u2019t the government \u2013 law enforcement specifically \u2013 be causing them to suffer?\n\n8. It\u2019ll be censored\n\nOk, this is just whiplash-inducing. Government is the only named censor in the Constitution:\n\nCongress shall make no law\u2026abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u2026\n\nSo how will undoing the sole censor\u2019s Internet power grab \u2013 lead to the Internet being censored? Isn\u2019t it in fact preempting censorship?\n\nWe\u2019re About to Lose Net Neutrality \u2013 And the Internet as We Know It\n\nIf We Lose Net Neutrality, We Lose the Internet\n\nThe hysteria of the pro-government-control Left is palpable. Because the Internet pre-Obama Administration was a virtual government-free zone \u2013 and Leftists have been looking for decades for a regulatory hook to being reeling it in.\n\nThey are caterwauling so loudly about Net Neutrality \u2013 because it is said hook.\n\nKeep in mind that the Internet as we know it has existed since the early-to-mid 1990s \u2013 and the government didn\u2019t execute its Net Neutrality power grab until December 2010.\n\nNone of the things the Left fears post-Net Neutrality ever happened in the two-plus decades pre-Net Neutrality \u2013 it instead became the free speech-free market Xanadu we all know and love.\n\nOf course we have always had \u201cnet neutrality\u201d \u2013 because it makes zero business sense for an Internet service provider to block its customers\u2019 access to what they want on the Web. And we will always have it \u2013 because it will never make sense for a company to not give its customers what they want.\n\nWhat we didn\u2019t have was an over-arching, over-reaching government regulatory superstructure Network Neutrality \u2013 which we do not need, but the Big Government Leftists have long wanted.\n\nWe passed ObamaCare \u2013 another longtime Leftist wish list item - to find out what is in it. How\u2019s that working? Of course it needs to go.\n\nNet Neutrality should also be undone \u2013 before it does to the Internet and the entire economy what ObamaCare is doing to health care and beyond.\n\n[Originally published on Human Events]", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd81ff\"", "article_summary": "The most famous of course is:\u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\nExpert: At Least 129 Million Will \u2018Not Be Able to Keep\u2019 Health Care Plan If ObamaCare Fully ImplementedThe reason for this coverage hemorrhage is \u2013 more government.\nNet Neutrality should also be undone \u2013 before it does to the Internet and the entire economy what ObamaCare is doing to health care and beyond.\nThey are caterwauling so loudly about Net Neutrality \u2013 because it is said hook.\nWe\u2019re About to Lose Net Neutrality \u2013 And the Internet as We Know ItIf We Lose Net Neutrality, We Lose the InternetThe hysteria of the pro-government-control Left is palpable."}
