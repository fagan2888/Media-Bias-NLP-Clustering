(QSSI), said his company told the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services of concerns about testing the Healthcare.gov website.\n\n``We expressed all of those concerns and risks,'' Slavitt said in testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, without immediately elaborating on what those concerns were.\n\nQSSI, a unit of United Health Group, was hired to build a \"data hub'' that will allow people to buy insurance on the state exchanges that are the heart of President Barack Obama's signature health care policy.\n\nAnother contractor, website developer CGI Federal, said the website will be fixed in time to allow people to enroll in private health insurance by a Dec. 15 deadline to obtain benefits beginning on Jan. 1.\n\n\"The system is working. People are enrolling. But people will be able to enroll at a faster pace,'' said Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president at CGI Federal.\n\nCGI Federal built the federal website serving 36 states, and QSSI designed the part that verifies applicants' income and other personal details.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The main contractors responsible for the Healthcare.gov site say the administration shares responsibility for snags that crippled the system.", "author": "Reuters with AP", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The main contractors responsible for the Healthcare.gov site say the administration shares responsibility for snags that crippled the system.", "title": "Obamacare contractor promises: We'll fix it soon", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/23/cgi-blames-another-contractor-for-obamacare-site-glitches.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/10/24/101140589-185707222.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The main contractors responsible for the Healthcare.gov site say the administration shares responsibility for snags that crippled the system.", "title": "Obamacare contractor: Site will be fixed in time for deadline", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/23/cgi-blames-another-contractor-for-obamacare-site-glitches.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/10/24/101140589-185707222.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Politics, US: News, Health Insurance, Kathleen Sebelius, Barack Obama, UnitedHealth Group Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2013-10-24T11:42:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2013-10-24T13:08:06-0400", "tag": "UnitedHealth Group Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 101138390, "news_keywords": "Obamacare glitches, finger pointing, Obamacare contractors"}, "article_summary": "CGI Federal built the federal website serving 36 states, and QSSI designed the part that verifies applicants' income and other personal details.\nBut people will be able to enroll at a faster pace,'' said Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president at CGI Federal.\n``We expressed all of those concerns and risks,'' Slavitt said in testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, without immediately elaborating on what those concerns were.\nCNBC's Bertha Coombs reports from a hearing at the House pertaining to glitches with the Obamacare websites.\nAndrew Slavitt, executive vice president with the parent of Quality Software Services Inc.
