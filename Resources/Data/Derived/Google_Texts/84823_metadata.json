Among his allegations were that he was told to pull from the mortuary fridge the body of an elderly woman, put her naked into the coffin and throw in her clothes afterwards.\n\nMr Veenkamp said when he complained, his boss allegedly told him: \"It doesn't matter, they're dead, and we cater to the families, not the people who have died.\"\n\nMr Veenkamp also alleged one dead woman was placed in her coffin in a \"frozen state\".\n\n\"The lady was in a frozen state and had received no mortuary care,\" he said.\n\n\"I was told to screw the lid down and that it didn't matter because it was being \u00addelivered straight to the crematorium.\"\n\nOn another occasion, Mr Veenkamp claims he went with his boss to collect a deceased cancer \u00adpatient from a hospice without any body bags and they left with the corpse wrapped in a sheet.\n\nHe said hearses were often late and forced to break the speed limit to deliver the coffins to the funeral on time.\n\n\"The mortuary fridge was on the blink and bodies were regularly placed without head blocks overnight, which left them with a frozen grin like The Joker in Batman,\" he said.\n\n\"The job of the mortician is to put the people to rest and help the family feel the same way by dressing the deceased appropriately. They want to see somebody who looks peaceful and has been treated with respect.\n\n\"I joined the industry thinking it would be performing some kind of public service, putting people to rest and helping their families. Instead, I was being asked to do some very uncomfortable things.\"\n\nThe family undertaking firm is based in southern NSW and is part of the Allison Monkhouse Funeral Directors group, which owns T J \u00adAndrews Funeral Services.\n\nManaging director Clive Allison confirmed having last May \u00adreceived emails from Mr Veenkamp detailing his allegations. He said when the company investigated the claims, the management team and all employees had denied Mr Veenkamp's allegations.\n\n\"The branch has a new management team since Ben's departure,\" Mr Allison said.\n\nHe said the operations manager visited the branch monthly to assess performance. \"There are new employees there now, so the chances of this sort of thing happening is very limited,'' he said.\n\n\"We are now renewing what we are doing and are very keen to ensure that the good name that we have held for a long time is improved.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "A LEADING funeral parlour will be subjected to monthly inspections following allegations dead bodies were being dumped naked in coffins or wrapped in sheets, while &#173;others were allegedly left with frozen grins like The Joker in Batman.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "A LEADING funeral parlour will be subjected to monthly inspections following allegations dead bodies were being dumped naked in coffins or wrapped in sheets, while &#173;others were allegedly left with frozen grins like The Joker in Batman.", "title": "Leading funeral parlour set for monthly inspections after allegations they dumped corpses naked in coffins", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/leading-funeral-parlour-set-for-monthly-inspections-after-allegations-they-dumped-corpses-naked-in-coffins/story-fni0cx12-1226794906760", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/01/05/1226795/144292-f87d28b4-7584-11e3-abd3-ac86fade2183.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/01/05/1226795/144292-f87d28b4-7584-11e3-abd3-ac86fade2183.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226794906760, "keywords": "management team, frozen state, mortuary fridge, funeral parlour, monthly inspections, Leading funeral parlour, resignation emails, frozen grins, detailed emails, Clive Allison, operations manager, allegations dead bodies, deceased cancer, dead woman, uncomfortable things, mortuary care", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun Jan 05 08:18:15 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun Jan 05 08:18:15 EST 2014", "author": "MATTHEW BENNS"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01e4\"", "article_summary": "A LEADING funeral parlour will be subjected to monthly inspections following allegations dead bodies were being dumped naked in coffins or wrapped in sheets, while \u00adothers were allegedly left with frozen grins like The Joker in Batman.\n\"The branch has a new management team since Ben's departure,\" Mr Allison said.\nManaging director Clive Allison confirmed having last May \u00adreceived emails from Mr Veenkamp detailing his allegations.\nMr Veenkamp also alleged one dead woman was placed in her coffin in a \"frozen state\".\nThe family undertaking firm is based in southern NSW and is part of the Allison Monkhouse Funeral Directors group, which owns T J \u00adAndrews Funeral Services."}
