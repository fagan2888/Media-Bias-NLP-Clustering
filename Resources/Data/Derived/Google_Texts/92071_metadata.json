Rand Paul (R-Ky.), but on this he has got Hillary Clinton pegged: \u201cI think she is going to try to say oh, I\u2019m different than President Obama. He\u2019s very unpopular. But I have different policies. She was part of his administration and I really don\u2019t know of many, if any, policies they disagree on.\u201d\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton signs copies of her book \u201cHard Choices\u201d in Florida in October. (Photo by Jeff Daly/Invision/Associated Press)\n\nHillary Clinton has said as much. In her \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with the president last year, she told Steve Kroft that during the campaign she realized they were two peas in a pod: \u201cWe could never figure out what we were different on.\u201d Indeed. As for her tenure at the White House, she cooed: \u201cI think there\u2019s a sense of understanding that, you know, sometimes doesn\u2019t even take words because we have similar views. We have similar experiences that I think provide a bond that may seem unlikely to some, but has been really at a core of our relationship over the last four years.\u201d\n\nOn the issues, it is hard to think of many differences, and where there are a few, Clinton wound up sometimes to Obama\u2019s left (Obamacare was really her campaign health-care plan) and only occasionally to his right, as she was on Syria. And even when there were differences, Clinton often applauded the president\u2019s decisions, as she did when he rubbed out the Syria red line and off-loaded the chemical weapons problem to the Russians in 2013.\n\nThey got along so famously because they see the world in similar terms. It\u2019s not clear where these supposed differences would even come from:\n\nRaising taxes on the rich? Both are for it. Pulling all troops out of Iraq? Both were for it. Obamacare? Both were strongly for it. Cap and trade? Both are for it. The sequester? Both want to get rid of it. Domestic spending on items like preschool education? Both want more. Russian reset? Big fans, both of them.\n\nThey are traditional liberals with conventionally liberal views. The left doesn\u2019t tolerate much intellectual diversity, so you can bet liberals with national ambitions are for abortion rights, pro-gay marriage, pro-Big Labor and pro-spending.\n\nThis was one reason why the midterm election results are so problematic for her. Insofar as the president\u2019s policies, every one of them, were on the ballot, Clinton\u2019s were too.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton does try to separate herself, I suspect she will do it in a rhetorical fashion only, using lots of adjectives and sounding different in tone. But parsing through the fog of words that she throws up, voters and even the media may find she favors essentially continuing the same policies with vague promises of \u201cimproving\u201d or fixing any glitches. If voters think these policies, some of which she designed, have not worked, that is a a serious problem for her in the general election. Just as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was burdened with the faults of the George W. Bush presidency, so too will Clinton be \u2014 and more so, given that she was a loyal official and loyal ex-official.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She has nowhere to run.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "She has nowhere to run.", "title": "Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t figure out how she differs from Obama", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/11/10/hillary-clinton-couldnt-figure-out-how-she-differs-from-obama/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/the-fix/Images/10-02-14_Hillary_Clinton_0017.jpg-08c03.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/11/10/hillary-clinton-couldnt-figure-out-how-she-differs-from-obama/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hillary and obama, hillary distance, hillary separate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "hillary and obama, hillary distance, hillary separate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceef7\"", "article_summary": "But I have different policies.\nIf voters think these policies, some of which she designed, have not worked, that is a a serious problem for her in the general election.\nAnd even when there were differences, Clinton often applauded the president\u2019s decisions, as she did when he rubbed out the Syria red line and off-loaded the chemical weapons problem to the Russians in 2013.\nIf Hillary Clinton does try to separate herself, I suspect she will do it in a rhetorical fashion only, using lots of adjectives and sounding different in tone.\nRight Turn readers know I have my differences with Sen.
