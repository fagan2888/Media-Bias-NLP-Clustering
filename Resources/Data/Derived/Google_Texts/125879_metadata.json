Today, Smith is as much administrator as physical therapist, grappling with a changing insurance landscape and making plans to expand. Regardless of how his day-to-day responsibilities change, Smith said his goal is the same: to change people\u2019s lives.\n\nSmith also applies that philosophy to his nonprofit work \u2014 efforts that earned Smith and his wife, Kami, honors at February\u2019s annual Hope Gala of the JDRF.\n\nQuestion: Why did you want to become a physical therapist?\n\nAnswer: After we graduated from high school, my best friend got hit on his motorcycle. This large Oldsmobile put him in the gutter, and he ended up being paraplegic. I watched his recovery, and saw what was going on in the hospital with therapists and everybody else. After he was sent home, I would go to his outpatient visits with him. I was really impressed with the care and the compassion in what they were doing. It\u2019s a person business if there ever were one.\n\nQuestion: You\u2019ve worked with a lot of interesting people. Any stories you can share?\n\nAnswer: I\u2019ve treated professional tennis players and taken care of some of the wealthiest casino executives in town. I\u2019ve taken care of one of our young, up-and-coming, iconic athletes, Bryce Harper (a Washington Nationals outfielder). From Claudia Schiffer to Kenny Rogers, you name it. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people, but that just means I\u2019ve been here a long time.\n\nI worked with Roy Horn prior to and after his injuries (following a 2003 tiger attack onstage), often at his private residence. Roy\u2019s a very athletic performer. He would get injured sometimes on an elephant, or doing various stunts. One time, in his room, they had this big, glass pen, and they had baby tigers in there.\n\nQuestion: You probably never thought you\u2019d pet baby tigers as a physical therapist.\n\nAnswer: Not at all. Vegas brings interesting opportunities, I will tell you that.\n\nQuestion: It also brought you the opportunity to run a hotel. What was that about?\n\nAnswer: Bill Bennett, the president of the Sahara Hotel Casino, was a patient (in the late 1990s). I had just resigned from HealthSouth. He said, \u201cCome and get into gaming.\u201d I told him I had no gaming experience, other than playing poker or blackjack. He pulled out a (profit/loss statement) and said, \u201cRead this.\u201d It made sense to me, because I had looked at them before. So he hired me, and on Day One, he put me in as president. It lasted a little over a year. I had gone through a divorce, and was working the day shift, graveyard and swing. It was time for me to get back into a normal lifestyle. So I got back into health care and never looked back. I started my current practice in 2000.\n\nQuestion: What\u2019s the most amazing recovery you\u2019ve seen?\n\nAnswer: One was a gentleman who worked at a bank, and who was involved in a horrific motorcycle accident (in 2011). His aorta was severed, and he was given a very small chance of survival (Wells Fargo Bank manager George Lawes had a 2 percent chance of surviving, and had a broken vertebra, ribs and shoulder bones). He\u2019s probably one of the most remarkable cases I\u2019ve seen. We saw him when he finally got out of the hospital, and we saw him go back to work.\n\nWith motorcycles and quads, when you have rollovers, people are just exposed to the environment, and the trauma can be significant.\n\nQuestion: Would you ever ride a motorcycle or quad?\n\nAnswer: I don\u2019t have one, I won\u2019t have one and I won\u2019t let my kids have one. The most catastrophic injuries we see are from those two items. You have the acceleration of the vehicle, and the entire body \u2014 especially the head \u2014 is exposed to whatever you hit.\n\nQuestion: What makes a good physical therapist?\n\nAnswer: You have to be smart. You always have to be learning, studying, reading, going to courses. But I\u2019ve seen people with book smarts who didn\u2019t have that connectivity with people. If you don\u2019t have a lot of passion for human beings, then this is not your profession. We don\u2019t offer you an injection, we can\u2019t give you a prescription. It\u2019s not a restaurant where you get a delicious meal, or a bar where you get a nice glass of wine. You have an experience when you see a physical therapist. That\u2019s all you get. We have to be very people-centric, with a lot of listening and empathy.\n\nQuestion: What makes a good patient?\n\nAnswer: Someone who is vested in their own recovery, who understands and takes ownership of getting better. Quite often, we have people who don\u2019t want to do their home exercises or work out at the gym. They may see us one, two or three times a week for 60 to 90 minutes, which is not much in the span of getting better. It can be overwhelming because of the pain and medication. People get depressed, so it\u2019s difficult. But you kind of know from Day One if patients will be on the fast track, or if we\u2019re going to be dragging them to the finish line.\n\nQuestion: How has the Las Vegas medical community changed in 30 years?\n\nAnswer: The consolidation on the payer side is big. With insurance through an employer, you have five options anymore, where you used to have 20 or 30. And with the corporatization of health care, we\u2019ve seen consolidation of primary care and specialists. You have bigger outside entities coming in. It\u2019s no longer a small, mom and pop town medically. It\u2019s corporate-driven. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a bad thing. It\u2019s just something that\u2019s happened.\n\nQuestion: How has it affected the way you practice?\n\nAnswer: We have had to change our business model over the years because of reimbursement and market consolidation. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any practitioner in this city who is not being pushed to see more patients to make ends meet. That\u2019s the reality of medical care.\n\nQuestion: How is the Affordable Care Act changing things for your business?\n\nAnswer: We\u2019re seeing a little uptick in people who have access to Medicaid, and now have access to our services. From the (state) health care exchange, we haven\u2019t seen a huge increase in enrollees. But all in all, it\u2019s given more people access to our services, which today, I would say, is a good thing.\n\nQuestion: What do you like best about your work?\n\nAnswer: Our company mantra is \u201cchanging lives.\u201d That has been very rewarding for me, helping patients get back to work and play and life. We\u2019ve also tried to take that sense of changing lives through therapy and implement it in the community with charitable programs we do quarterly. We just finished a Three Square food drive, and we do a clothing drive for an at-risk school in the fall. We do a Christmas toy drive, and we are involved in JDRF (formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). It\u2019s important to me that my 150 employees know I care about the community, and I want them to care about the community, too.\n\nQuestion: What do you like the least?\n\nAnswer: The regulatory oversight is more burdensome every year, and with less reimbursement.\n\nQuestion: What is your biggest accomplishment?\n\nAnswer: As a therapist, the business side of it. Vegas has been very kind to me and my family, and it has helped us find the success we have. But the most joy I get out of my day is when I\u2019m taking care of a patient. It concerns me that the day is coming where I will be not doing very much of that. It\u2019s a harsh reality, but it\u2019s where the business cycle takes a CEO as a business expands.\n\nOutside of work, I\u2019ve got four fantastic kids. I\u2019d say I\u2019m most proud of my babies.\n\nQuestion: What are your career goals?\n\nAnswer: We are raising capital to expand our model into other markets. We have a business plan to expand our platform, which we have spent a lot of time and money making scalable. I\u2019ve had the fortune of hiring a really good management team that\u2019s competent, driven and hard-working. Also, because of baby boomers, the amount of total joint replacements is increasing exponentially. We refuse to get old. We want to live forever. We want to play sports forever. I think our profession is only going to be more relevant in the future.\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com or 702-380-4512.
