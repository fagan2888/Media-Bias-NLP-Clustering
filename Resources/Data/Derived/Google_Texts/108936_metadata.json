That\u2019s not a typo. The deceased Bakaradze has been preserved for nearly two decades by his mother, Tsiuri Kvaratskhelia, in her home in the Eurasian country of Georgia.\n\nThe late Joni Bakaradze had died at the age of 22, leaving behind a one-year-old boy. Joni\u2019s father opted against interring the body, so that his grandson could one day see what his late-father had looked like. Joni\u2019s mother Tsiuri ultimately took over the care of her deceased son. After four years of treating the body with balsam, Tsiuri changed tactics and began wiping down Joni\u2019s body, which rests in a coffin in her house, with vodka. It\u2019s a practice that she repeats on a daily basis.\n\n\"One night I had a dream when a voice told me, \u2018Treat Joni using rubbing alcohol',\" Tsiuri told Georgian News. \"So from then on I\u2019ve been using wet sheets dipped in alcohol to preserve the body.\"\n\nDuring the first 10 years after Joni passed, his mother would also change his clothes on his birthday, swapping out his old coats and pants for fresh ones. According to Tsiuri, her grandson, who is almost in his 20s, has appreciated the gesture that her family made.\n\n\u201cThe child has been in love with his father since then,\u201d she said via translators. \u201cHe says his grandfather made the right decision.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mummy, deceased son, joni bakaradze, georgia, vodka", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Joni Bakaradze, who died at age 22, has has been preserved for nearly two decades by his mother, Tsiuri Kvaratskhelia, so that his grandson could one day see what his late-father had looked like.", "title": "Mom Preserves Son's Corpse For 18 Years Using Vodka [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/joni-bakaradzes-mom-preserved-his-dead-corpse-18-years-using-vodka-video-256314", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/mummysboy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joni Bakaradze, who died at age 22, has has been preserved for nearly two decades by his mother, Tsiuri Kvaratskhelia, so that his grandson could one day see what his late-father had looked like.", "title": "Mom Preserves Son's Corpse For 18 Years Using Vodka [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/joni-bakaradzes-mom-preserved-his-dead-corpse-18-years-using-vodka-video-256314", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/mummysboy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/mummysboy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-10T17:45:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-11T09:53:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Joni Bakaradze, who died at age 22, has has been preserved for nearly two decades by his mother, Tsiuri Kvaratskhelia, so that his grandson could one day see what his late-father had looked like."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2677\"", "article_summary": "\"One night I had a dream when a voice told me, \u2018Treat Joni using rubbing alcohol',\" Tsiuri told Georgian News.\nThe late Joni Bakaradze had died at the age of 22, leaving behind a one-year-old boy.\nJoni\u2019s mother Tsiuri ultimately took over the care of her deceased son.\nJoni Bakaradze is a real mummy\u2019s boy.\nThe deceased Bakaradze has been preserved for nearly two decades by his mother, Tsiuri Kvaratskhelia, in her home in the Eurasian country of Georgia."}
