(Photo: The Enquirer/Patrick Reddy)\n\nThe Christian ministry building an attraction based on the huge ark that was built in the biblical story of Noah is inviting the public to the construction site in central Kentucky.\n\nAnswers in Genesis says tourists can come and watch the work going on at the site in Grant County. Workers have completed the foundation and wood for the giant ark is beginning to arrive at the site.\n\nA viewing spot has been set up in the area. Answers in Genesis is charging $20 per vehicle or $10 for members of its nearby Creation Museum in Petersburg.\n\nThe Christian group is currently suing state officials over the loss of a tourism incentive that was denied for the $70 million ark project.\n\nThe attraction is scheduled to open next year.\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
