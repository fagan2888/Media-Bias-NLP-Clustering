SOUTHPORT, NC (WWAY)– The Southport Junior Women’s Club honored Memorial Day by using one of Southport’s trademarks.

At the 17th annual ceremony the co-president of the junior women’s club Stephanie Boehmer says historians shot a cannon from “Thor” to honor those who have fallen.

Boehmer says they have done this every year and she says it is important to keep the tradition.

“This day is not a day for barbecues or for beach goers,” Boehmer said. “This is a day for us to honor, to honor all of those who have fallen for our country. This is a day for us to remember what our country does for us and to be appreciative of that.”

Boehmer says every year the ceremony reaches its capacity of almost 100 people.
