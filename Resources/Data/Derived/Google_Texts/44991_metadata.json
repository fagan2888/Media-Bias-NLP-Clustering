I was proud to champion and help pass the Affordable Care Act \u2013 insuring millions of Americans for the first time.\n\nI represented Pennsylvania's 7th Congressional District during the Great Recession, and kept my office open until 9 p.m. every night.\n\nThere, 18,000 of my fellow countrymen and women came in and found help \u2013 four times more than the average Congressional office.\n\nWe helped families access healthcare and education, helped veterans transition back into civilian life, and saved nearly 1,000 homes from foreclosure at the height of the recession.\n\nI began my campaign for Senate by walking 422 miles across Pennsylvania, and the people I met along the way confirmed my deeply held belief: the biggest deficit in America today is not the budget, but the trust deficit.\n\nPeople have lost trust in their elected officials, because too many no longer serve the people who elected them.\n\nIf our nation is going to overcome the challenges we face, we don't just need politicians. We need public servants accountable to the people above party and type.\n\nI will be that public servant in the Senate, serving the people as I have my entire life.\n\nI will fight for affordable education for all families, for improved infrastructure and an economy that creates small businesses and good-paying jobs, for fair pay and women's rights, and for an improved Affordable Care Act that will continue strengthening our nation's health security.\n\nI want the people to know, as we say in the military to mean \"I've got your back,\" that \"I've got your six.\"\n\nJoe Sestak, of Delaware County, is a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in the April 26 primary.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Joe Sestak, United States Navy, United States Senate, joe-sestak, john-fetterman, katie-mcginty, pat-toomey, primary-2016, opinion", "title": "I've got your six, Pennsylvania: Joe Sestak", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "People have lost trust in their elected officials, because too many no longer serve the people who elected them.", "title": "I've got your six, Pennsylvania: Joe Sestak", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2016/04/ive_got_your_six_pennsylvania.html", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/opinion/photo/20168771-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/opinion/photo/20168771-standard.jpg", "description": "People have lost trust in their elected officials, because too many no longer serve the people who elected them.", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "I've got your six, Pennsylvania: Joe Sestak"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, April 19, 2016,  7:26 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, April 19, 2016,  2:45 PM", "article_author": "PennLive Op-Ed", "Description": "People have lost trust in their elected officials, because too many no longer serve the people who elected them."}, "article_summary": "I want the people to know, as we say in the military to mean \"I've got your back,\" that \"I've got your six.\"\nJoe Sestak, of Delaware County, is a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in the April 26 primary.\nI was proud to champion and help pass the Affordable Care Act \u2013 insuring millions of Americans for the first time.\nI ran for Congress as a payback tour to the American people who paid for my Navy health insurance.\nThere, 18,000 of my fellow countrymen and women came in and found help \u2013 four times more than the average Congressional office."}
