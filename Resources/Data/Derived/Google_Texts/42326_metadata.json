What can central banks and governments do to get things going?\n\nThe European Central Bank convened some of the world\u2019s most prominent economists Thursday through Saturday to probe those questions at the Penha Longa golf resort set amid steep, densely forested hills near the town of Sintra, Portugal, near the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMuch of the discussion was highly technical. Equations and charts flashed in quick succession on the projection screen in the conference room.\n\nHere are some of the more memorable utterances, no math background required.\n\nGET BUSY\n\nEuropean Central Bank head Mario Draghi started things off with a sharp call for pro-business reforms by governments.\n\nSuch reforms \u201care about unleashing an untapped potential for substantially higher output, employment and welfare,\u201d Draghi said in his opening remarks.\n\n\u201cAnd in the current environment, this would play a crucial role in ensuring that the ongoing cyclical recovery becomes a stronger, structural recovery. \u201c\n\nDraghi avoided most details, but such measures could include things like reducing the paperwork needed to start a business. It could also mean less restrictive rules governing hiring and firing, and reducing the gap in legal protection between established workers who are hard to lay off and younger workers who remain stuck with short-term contracts at low wages.\n\nDraghi said governments should take advantage of the breathing space afforded by ECB stimulus measures. Those include rock-bottom interest rates and a 1.1 trillion euro ($1.2 trillion) monetary stimulus in the form of bond purchases with newly printed euros.\n\nEurope\u2019s economy ticked up in the first quarter, showing growth of 0.4 percent. Yet the 19 European Union nations that use the shared euro currency are still struggling to get past a crisis over too much government debt in some countries. Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus needed bailout loans from other countries, and spending restraint has held back growth.\n\nUnemployment remains stubbornly high at 11.3 percent, and at 50 percent for young people in Greece and Spain.\n\nACTIVE MEASURES: \u201cThere is no way the central bank all on its own can solve all of Europe\u2019s problems, and there has been a tendency for policy makers to sit back and let the ECB do it all, and that is both unreasonable and unconscionable\u201d said Dennis J. Snower, president of the Kiel Institute of the World Economy in Germany.\n\nSnower advocates active measures to help people get back into work, such as retraining workers whose skills don\u2019t fit employer needs, or subsidies to companies that take on the long-term unemployed. \u201cFind the disadvantaged people and give them maximal incentives to get into the labor force, and give employers maximal incentives to hire them,\u201d he told The Associated Press on the conference sidelines.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What will get Europe\u2019s economy rolling again?", "title": "What will get Europe\u2019s economy rolling again?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "What will get Europe\u2019s economy rolling again?", "title": "What will get Europe\u2019s economy rolling again?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/what_will_get_europes_economy_rolling_again/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/portugal-europe-economy.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What will get Europe\u2019s economy rolling again?", "title": "What will get Europe\u2019s economy rolling again?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/portugal-europe-economy.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Mchugh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb2ee\"", "article_summary": "Europe\u2019s economy ticked up in the first quarter, showing growth of 0.4 percent.\nGET BUSYEuropean Central Bank head Mario Draghi started things off with a sharp call for pro-business reforms by governments.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSINTRA, Portugal (AP) \u2014 What\u2019s behind Europe\u2019s sluggish recovery and high jobless rate?\nDraghi said governments should take advantage of the breathing space afforded by ECB stimulus measures.\nThose include rock-bottom interest rates and a 1.1 trillion euro ($1.2 trillion) monetary stimulus in the form of bond purchases with newly printed euros."}
