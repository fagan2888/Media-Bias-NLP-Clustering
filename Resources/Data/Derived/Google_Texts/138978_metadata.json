Having an assigned contact person is a good idea in theory, but it\u2019s not going to do much unless there are some other major changes at the IRS,\u201d Dinesen said.\n\nDinesen, an accountant, knows firsthand what changes need to be made. One of his clients had a refund delayed by identity theft, and it took Dinesen 850 days to resolve the problem.\n\nWendy Boka wasn\u2019t just any client. She was a close friend and had been married to Dinesen\u2019s college roommate, Brian Boka. Wendy and Brian were Dinesen\u2019s first clients when he opened his accounting firm in Indianola.\n\nBrian Boka died in early 2010, leaving Wendy a widow at age 29. She moved to Texas in December 2010 to start a new chapter in her life.\n\nBut she didn\u2019t change accountants.\n\nIn April 2011, Dinesen e-filed Wendy and Brian\u2019s final joint tax return.\n\nThe e-file was rejected.\n\n\u201cI thought it was just a software glitch. That\u2019s not uncommon,\u201d Dinesen said.\n\nHe refiled and it was rejected again.\n\nDinesen called the IRS and was told a tax return using Brian Boka\u2019s Social Security number already had been filed.\n\n\u201cI had to call Wendy and tell her someone had stolen Brian\u2019s identity and was using it to try to get a refund check,\u201d Dinesen said.\n\nRead more on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jason Dinesen smiled politely and shook his head when asked about a new U.S. Senate bill that aims to improve how the IRS handles cases of identity theft.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jason Dinesen smiled politely and shook his head when asked about a new U.S. Senate bill that aims to improve how the IRS handles cases of identity theft.", "title": "How the IRS Handled a Case of Identity Theft ... in 850 Days", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/463582117.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-15T23:53:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1t8lvwA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jason Dinesen smiled politely and shook his head when asked about a new U.S. Senate bill that aims to improve how the IRS handles cases of identity theft.", "title": "How the IRS Handled a Case of Identity Theft ... in 850 Days", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/463582117.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "cyber", "published_time": "2014-08-16T03:01:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-15T23:53:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "IRS, taxes, identity theft, jason dinesen, irs incompetency, irs refund, irs scandal"}, "article_summary": "One of his clients had a refund delayed by identity theft, and it took Dinesen 850 days to resolve the problem.\nHaving an assigned contact person is a good idea in theory, but it\u2019s not going to do much unless there are some other major changes at the IRS,\u201d Dinesen said.\nDinesen called the IRS and was told a tax return using Brian Boka\u2019s Social Security number already had been filed.\nShe was a close friend and had been married to Dinesen\u2019s college roommate, Brian Boka.\nWendy Boka wasn\u2019t just any client."}
