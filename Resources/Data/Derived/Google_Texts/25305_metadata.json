The merger needs a total of 20 states for approval.\n\n\u201cWe completed the review with no objection,\" said Connecticut Insurance Department spokeswoman Donna Tommelleo on Wednesday.\n\nThe Connecticut Department of Insurance is the leading state regulator reviewing the Cigna-Anthem merger proposal, and that review is ongoing.\n\nBut even if all 20 states approve the Aetna-Humana merger, Missouri insurance officials said on Wednesday they would prevent certain lines of Aetna business and all of Humana\u2019s Medicare Advantage health insurance plans from continuing in that state.\n\nMissouri officials are concerned the merger would shrink competition in the state for Medicare Advantage plans, hurting seniors in the form of higher premiums. Medicare Advantage plans are a primary part of Humana's business and a prime reason Aetna officials said they want the merger.\n\nMissouri has given the insurers 30 days to respond with solutions that would address its concerns.\n\nOther problems have surfaced regarding the proposed marriage of Cigna and Anthem as well.\n\nIn letters between the companies cited in a recent Wall Street Journal story, Anthem accused Cigna of missing deadlines for submitting data to the Justice Department, which is reviewing the proposed insurance mergers. Cigna retorted that those documents took so long to file because problems with the documents and information Anthem provided \u201care too numerous to catalog fully.\"\n\nCiting anonymous sources, the Wall Street Journal said Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani and Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish \u201chave locked horns in the 10 months since the deal was struck.\u201d\n\nThe timeline guiding Justice Department review of the mergers has been worked out between the insurers and the department\u2019s Antitrust Division.\n\nA Justice Department spokesman said he could not comment on that timeline.\n\nBut Swedish told participants at a UBS Global Healthcare Forum Tuesday that he expects a determination soon, possibly in July.\n\nThe companies' pending $48 billion merger was announced last year within weeks of the one between Aetna and Humana, which is worth about $37 billion. The two mergers would consolidate the U.S. healthcare insurance market from five major insurers to three.\n\nAetna CEO Mark Bertolini told investors recently he expects the merger with Humana to become final this year.\n\nTo help win regulatory approval, Aetna has hired former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle to help. He is the latest in a stable of lobbyists the company has in Washington. According to lobbying disclosure reports, the company spent nearly $1.5 million lobbying federal officials in the first three months of this year.\n\nDaschle told the Connecticut Mirror he is \u201cadvising\u201d the company on issues relating to the merger. The former South Dakota senator, who helped craft the Affordable Care Act, also said \u201ca big part\u201d of his work for Aetna is helping the company with matters relating to the ACA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be able to bring value to so many areas in health care,\u201d Daschle said. \u201cIt\u2019s something Mark Bertolini is very interested in.\u201d\n\nInsurers face strong opposition\n\nThere\u2019s strong opposition to the insurance mergers by major players in the nation\u2019s health care system, including the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association and unions representing health care workers.\n\nThey say the mergers would shrink competition in many U.S. cities and states that would result in higher premium costs. The mergers would also give the insurers more clout to negotiate doctor and hospital fees.\n\nOn Wednesday, AMA President Steven J. Stack hailed Missouri\u2019s action, saying it gave \u201cthe prospect of the Aetna-Humana acquisition\u2026a bone-crushing defeat.\u201d\n\nCigna Corp.\n\n\u201cThe AMA strongly applauds Missouri regulators for taking the right approach to prevent the proposed acquisition of Humana by rival Aetna from creating anti-competitive market power that would have threatened Missouri\u2019s health care delivery system,\u201d Stack said.\n\nHe also said Missouri's action \"strongly validates concerns that AMA has expressed to Missouri regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, and officials in other states impacted by the proposed health insurer mergers.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, however, Aetna said, \u201cThis order does not impede the DOJ approval process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed with the Missouri order, but expect to have a constructive dialogue with the state to address their concerns,\u201d Aetna said.\n\nThere is also more cohesive Connecticut opposition.\n\nWednesday, the Connecticut State Medical Society, the Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut and the Connecticut Citizen Action Group joined state Rep. Gregory Haddad, D-Mansfield, in a press conference to criticize the mergers.\n\nHaddad also released a May 13 letter to Connecticut Insurance Commissioner Katharine Wade from 17 state legislators asking for a thorough review process of both deals, either of which \"may have a negative impact on both the cost and quality of care in Connecticut.\"\n\n\u201cI think they will have great influence over the health care delivery system in Connecticut,\u201d Haddad said. \u201cJobs are also involved,\u201d he said.\n\nThe letter asked Wade to include a job-loss analysis as part of her department's review, to grant \"intervenor status\" to \"interested consumer advocates\" and to hold \"multiple public hearings... at venues throughout Connecticut... that allow for maximum public participation.\"\n\nBertolini, the Aetna chairman, told shareholders in Avon last week that the deal with Humana included keeping Humana's operations in Kentucky. The company is based in Louisville.\n\nBertolini did not commit to keeping Aetna\u2019s headquarters in Hartford, saying \u201cuntil further notice our corporate headquarters is in Hartford.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/05/25/connecticut-signs-off-on-aetna-humana-merger-but-other-hurdles-remain/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Politics, Washington, Aetna, American Hospital Association, Anthem, anti-trust, Cigna, Connecticut Insurance Department, Connecticut State Medical Society", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/05/25/connecticut-signs-off-on-aetna-humana-merger-but-other-hurdles-remain/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Connecticut Insurance Department has signed off on Aetna\u2019s proposed merger with Humana, but other hurdles remain for that deal and another merger proposed by Cigna and Anthem.", "title": "CT signs off on Aetna-Humana merger, but other hurdles remain", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/05/25/connecticut-signs-off-on-aetna-humana-merger-but-other-hurdles-remain/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2013/05/Aetna_0-e1400772425906.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@radelat"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2016/05/25/connecticut-signs-off-on-aetna-humana-merger-but-other-hurdles-remain/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "AetnaWashington \u2013The Connecticut Insurance Department has signed off on Aetna\u2019s proposed merger with Humana, but other hurdles remain for that deal and another merger proposed by Cigna and Anthem.\nThe Connecticut Department of Insurance's approval of the Aetna-Humana deal makes it one of 15 states that have signed off.\n\u201cWe completed the review with no objection,\" said Connecticut Insurance Department spokeswoman Donna Tommelleo on Wednesday.\nThe Connecticut Department of Insurance is the leading state regulator reviewing the Cigna-Anthem merger proposal, and that review is ongoing.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to be able to bring value to so many areas in health care,\u201d Daschle said."}
