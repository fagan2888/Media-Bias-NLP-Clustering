The union had maintained that Kaiser was dangerously understaffed, especially since adding 422,000 members last year, many because of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called \"Obamacare.\"\n\nThe raises will be awarded through across-the-board pay hikes and lump-sum payments, the union said. Nurses also will keep a pension plan and won increased Kaiser contributions to their 401(k) retirement plans.\n\nKaiser Permanente said it wouldn't comment on the contract's specifics until after the nurses ratify it, but in a prepared statement, administrator Gregory A. Adams wrote: \"This agreement is aligned with our commitment to improve our quality and affordability and to be a national model for the delivery of health care.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdams is group president and regional president of Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Health Plan in Northern California.\n\nRoemer insisted that safety and quality of care were the union's paramount concerns.\n\n\"We feel like we've gotten some really good patient protections,\" she said. \"We were really concerned because of staffing.\"\n\nThe settlement calls for nurses to participate in a committee to work with Kaiser management to address nurses' concerns about care standards, according to the union.\n\nAlthough striking nurses last fall accused Kaiser of maintaining insufficient protections against the Ebola virus, the proposed contract language does not add new provisions to specifically protect against the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nIf ratified by the union membership, the contract will be retroactive to September and will extend through August 2017.\n\nThe proposed agreement does not affect a contract dispute between Kaiser Permanente and its mental health staff.\n\nContact Sharon Noguchi at 408-271-3775.
