This article \u2014 as engrossing as it is \u2014 will still be here when you reach your destination.\n\nWe provide that friendly bit of advice because, as The New York Times reported this morning, a whole bunch of motorists are occupying themselves with their smartphones \u2014 and distracting themselves from the road \u2014 in ways that go way beyond talking and texting, according to a new survey conducted by Braun Research for AT&T.\n\nThe pollsters surveyed 2,067 smartphone users who drive daily, and their findings should be frightening to anyone on the roads. More than six in 10 smartphone users surveyed say they text while driving. It gets scarier: Nearly 40 percent of smartphone users admit to checking in on social media while driving, with 27 percent admitting to using Facebook and another 14 percent saying they use Twitter and Instagram while behind the wheel. Of users who cop to posting on Twitter while driving, 30 percent say they do it \u201call the time.\u201d Given those figures, it\u2019s amazing that #TwitterAccident isn\u2019t always trending.\n\nRelated: Here's How Much Likelier You Are to Be Killed in a Car Than on Amtrak\n\nSome other troubling stats from the survey: 17 percent snap selfies or other pictures when in the driver\u2019s seat and 12 percent shoot videos \u2014 with 27 percent of those videographers thinking they can do so safely. Astoundingly, 10 percent of drivers say they video chat while on the roads.\n\nAT&T says it will expand its It Can Wait public service campaign about the dangers of distracted driving, which launched in 2010, to focus on hazards beyond just texting. But as Matt Richtel of the Times points out, the AT&T campaign and other efforts like it face a stiff challenge in trying to counter the social pressures and strongly ingrained habits that keep people constantly checking their phones.\n\nTough laws and widespread educational efforts have been effective at reducing drunk driving and encouraging use of seat belts. But we still have a way to go in getting drivers to understand that \u201cmobile\u201d doesn\u2019t mean when you\u2019re behind the wheel. Right now, 46 states and the District of Columbia have outlawed texting while driving. As you can see above, that hasn't helped much yet. Smartphone users still need to be convinced of the danger they pose \u2014 or face \u2014 if they use their devices while driving.\n\nAs Lori Lee, AT&T\u2019s global marketing officer, put it: \u201cFor the sake of you and those around you, please keep your eyes on the road, not on your phone.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/19/Amazingly-Stupid-Things-Smartphone-Users-Do-While-Driving", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you\u2019re reading this while driving, put your phone down right now.
