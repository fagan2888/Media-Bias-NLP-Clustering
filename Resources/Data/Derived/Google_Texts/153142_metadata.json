For a long time, Americans have paid more and received less in terms of health care.\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the falling rate of uninsured Americans \u2014 since the end of 2013, the percent of Americans without health insurance has declined 5.2 percentage points, according to Gallup.\n\nSome efficiency measures also appear to be working. In the June 2015 issue of Health Affairs, researchers looked at the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. The program allowed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to penalize hospitals with high rates for patients being readmitted within 30 days of treatment of certain conditions. Historically, there hasn't been much financial motivation for U.S. hospitals to decrease readmission rates. In fact, often higher readmission rates actually meant more money for hospitals, as patients who came in again required more treatment that could be billed to insurance. A lack of data transparency on readmission rates and patient outcomes also meant hospitals could largely keep these numbers to themselves.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nUnder the program, CMS will eventually be able to charge a penalty of 3 percent of the hospital's total Medicare reimbursement. The program started at 1 percent in October 2012.\n\nThe researchers looked at the readmission rates for patients at New York hospitals in 2008, before the law went into effect, and in 2012.\n\nThey found a reduction in readmission rates and some evidence that the benefits were spilling over for non-Medicare patients as well.\n\n\n\nLindsey Cook for USN&WR; Source: Health Affairs, June 2015\n\nThe researchers didn't find evidence that hospitals were delaying readmission to past 30 days to avoid patients being counted in their 30-day total, one possible way critics said hospitals may get around the penalty. The researchers found some rise in the use of observation services, another potential workaround, which they said needed more research.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Data Show Obamacare Is Working", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Data on readmission rates show a decrease for Medicare patients in New York state.&nbsp;", "title": "Data Show Obamacare Is Working", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/06/08/data-show-obamacare-is-working", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/7e/72/8812b1a94db394f1b50720409379/141208-diabetescheckup-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Data on readmission rates show a decrease for Medicare patients in New York state.&nbsp;", "card": "summary", "title": "Data Show Obamacare Is Working"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 8, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lindsey Cook,DatamineHealthcare,Affordable Care Act,Obama, Barack,Obama administration,health care reform,health,health insurance,Pulse,Medicare,senior health,hospitals,Data Mine [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Data on readmission rates show a decrease for Medicare patients in New York state.&nbsp;"}, "article_summary": "A lack of data transparency on readmission rates and patient outcomes also meant hospitals could largely keep these numbers to themselves.\nSorry to break it to you, but President Barack Obama's health care law seems to be working.\nThey found a reduction in readmission rates and some evidence that the benefits were spilling over for non-Medicare patients as well.\nHistorically, there hasn't been much financial motivation for U.S. hospitals to decrease readmission rates.\nThe researchers looked at the readmission rates for patients at New York hospitals in 2008, before the law went into effect, and in 2012."}
