There is only about 60 days until the primary.\"\n\nGrau also says the cash contest for the Minnesota Governor's race is heating up as the Republican candidates target Minnesota Democratic Governor Mark Dayton.\n\n\"He's not super vulnerable, but in the public opinion polls he is running less than fifty percent,\" Grau said. \"He is leading his opposition, but no one knows his opposition too much.\"\n\nWhile Dayton is focusing on the General election in November, the four Republican candidates are hard at work, raising money and campaigning across the state to increase needed name recognition for the August primary election.\n\n\"This race for Republican nomination for governor is pretty close,\" Ben Golnik said. \"I can see a path for any of the four candidates.\"\n\nGolnik is the Chairman of the Minnesota Jobs Coalition and previously worked on the Republican campaigns of former U.S. Presidential candidate John McCain, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, and former U.S. Congressman Chip Cravaack.\n\n\"I think Jeff Johnson has a little bit of an advantage as the endorsed candidate. Scott Honour has shown the ability to raise the most money thus far. You've got Marty Seifert who looks to be doing a rural strategy, focusing on earned media, and you have Kurt Zellers, the former Speaker of the House, who has good name ID,\" Golnik said. \"So I think it is a pretty open, fluid race right now.\"\n\nGolnik's third party group released an ad last week slamming Dayton's support for MNSure and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"We are using Governor Dayton's words where he said Obamacare in Minnesota was doing phenomenally well,\" Golnik said. \"Even as the program was continually missing goals and missing projections that were set.\"\n\nAt the Federal Level, the National Republican Congressional Committee said it will spend $3.2 million in Minnesota's 7th and 8th Congressional District races.\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is expected to spend a similar amount in those races.\n\n\"I think you will see more money spent by outside groups than you will from the individual candidates this cycle,\" Golnik said.\n\nGrau said candidates should notice the defeat of Republican U.S. Congressman Eric Cantor in Virginia, who held a major financial edge over his Republican opponent and still lost.\n\nGrau said that race shows that candidates with the most money, do not always win.\n\nNick Minock\n\nnminock@kbjr.com\n\nBiography\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KBJR 6 & Range 11 | KDLH 3", "description": "Duluth, MN (NNCNOW.com) --  Political insiders spent the day combing through the campaign finance reports of five Minnesota Gubernatorial candidates as they head into the August primary and November election.", "title": "Governor Mark Dayton leads Republican opponents in cash contest", "url": "http://www.northlandsnewscenter.com/elections/Governor-Mark-Dayton-Leads-Republican-Opponents-in-Fundraising-263566451.html", "image": "http://redirect.field59.com/video/thumb/f3ac4b02edb48abdc240c6fcdc75220c1ec9441d/w600/h400", "video": {"width": 470, "identifier": "http://www.northlandsnewscenter.com/v/?i=263566451", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "height": 264}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "jHftOZnnmMFaK6AGvsNdfMg5rMmnXdLDpDVIKd1h3po", "fb": {"app_id": 141612669206933}, "description": "Duluth, MN (NNCNOW.com) --  Political insiders spent the day combing through the campaign finance reports of five Minnesota Gubernatorial candidates as they head into the August primary and November election.", "title": "Governor Mark Dayton leads Republican opponents in cash contest"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1026\"", "article_summary": "Grau also says the cash contest for the Minnesota Governor's race is heating up as the Republican candidates target Minnesota Democratic Governor Mark Dayton.\n\"I think you will see more money spent by outside groups than you will from the individual candidates this cycle,\" Golnik said.\nDuluth, MN (NNCNOW.com) -- Political insiders spent the day combing through the campaign finance reports of five Minnesota Gubernatorial candidates as they head into the August primary and November election.\nGrau said that race shows that candidates with the most money, do not always win.\n\"This race for Republican nomination for governor is pretty close,\" Ben Golnik said."}
