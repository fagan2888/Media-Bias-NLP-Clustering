With Donald Trump looming as the possible nominee, these concerns intensified, as polls show Trump losing by a wide margin to Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nA Trump nomination could lead many Republicans, especially those aligned with the moderate wing of the party, like most Jewish GOP voters, to stay home on Election Day, possibly swinging control of the Senate to Democrats.\n\nBut RJC communication director, Mark McNulty suggested Trump is not necessarily the reason behind the group\u2019s fundraising appeal.\n\n\u201cEach and every election cycle is important. This one especially so for Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe intend to protect that majority by informing the Jewish communities in competitive senate races that electing Democrats means a less safe Israel and more appeasement of Iran.\u201d\n\nRJC listed 5 Senate seats it feels are at stake: New Hampshire, where Republican Kelly Ayotte will face governor Maggie Hassan in a race described by most pollsters as a tossup; Rob Portman\u2019s tough reelection bid in Ohio; Wisconsin, where Republican senator Ron Johnson will face a rematch against Russ Feingold, a Jewish Democrat who lost his seat to Johnson in 2010 and is now holding a slight advantage in polls in his attempt to win it back; Illinois\u2019 Mark Kirk, who is trailing in polls behind Democrat Tammy Duckworth; and Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey who has only a small lead over Democrat Katie McGinty in a tough reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cBottom line: we cannot afford to let that happen,\u201d Brooks concludes his email, \u201cthat is why your next decision is pivotal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79":
