It's a rough world out there, and this election season has led to intense rhetoric, political infighting, and other general nastiness. The country is incredibly polarized and there's no real sign of it stopping any time soon.

So let's just put that all aside for about a minute and admire these pictures and videos of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with two baby pandas. Trudeau was tasked with unveiling the names of the two lil' guys, who are now known as Jia Panpan ("Canadian Hope") and Jia Yueyue ("Canadian Joy"). They live at the Toronto Zoo with their mom and another fully-grown panda.

Today I had the pleasure to unveil the names of @TheTorontoZoo’s panda cubs! Say hello to Jia Panpan & Jia Yueyue: pic.twitter.com/iFCAlID7bc — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) March 7, 2016

Trudeau said that the panda is a symbol of peace and friendship, and noted that Canada's Chinese communities are thriving.

Aren't they just adorable? (The pandas, not Trudeau...although he does have his fair share of admirers stateside.)

The public will be able to meet Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue starting on March 12.
