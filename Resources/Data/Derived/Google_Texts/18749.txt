Captain sentenced to 36 years over South Korean ferry disaster

The captain of the South Korean ferry that sank in April, killing more than 300 people, was convicted for gross negligence and sentenced to 36 years in prison on Monday. The captain, Lee Joon-seok, was one of 15 crew members facing trial over the disaster. Lee, who is in his 60s, said he knew he would spend the rest of his life in prison, and apologized for leaving the doomed ship, the Sewol, with passengers still trapped inside.
