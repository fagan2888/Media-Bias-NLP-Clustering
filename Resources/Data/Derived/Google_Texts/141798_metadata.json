I am also active in the Death Cafe movement.\n\nI\u2019m within days of sending my manuscript to the publisher for a book titled: \u201cI Hear You\u2019re Afraid of Dying or Afraid Someone You Love Will Die Before You.\u201d It will be available July 9, 2015.\n\nToday I added the following to the book:\n\n\u201cIn June 2015 the California senate voted to move forward with an End of Life Option Act. When I read about it I smiled and immediately felt safer living here.\n\n\u201cIf this moves through the Legislature and is signed by the governor, it will allow, with good cause and proper medical attention, we who live here the right to end our life if the reason is confirmed in the judgment of those we trust, those we love, and ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Rev. George McLaird, Mill Valley\n\nLower taxes, better pay make housing affordable\n\n\u201cAffordable housing\u201d is just a euphemism for taking from people who can afford and giving to people who cannot.\n\nAside from the injustice of this, it is never-ending because once you give, there will still be many who cannot afford.\n\nThis approaches the concern from the wrong end.\n\nThe solution is to create jobs that pay more. Then more can afford.\n\nYou do this with policies that reduce the burdens which the government imposes upon business and by educating people to acquire skills that are useful and necessary.\n\n\u2014 Frederick J. Hass, San Rafael\n\nThose who served and died in Vietnam were heroes\n\nWilliam Rothman of Belvedere (Readers\u2019 Forum, May 30) insults every Vietnam veteran who died during that war. Shame on you.\n\nHe said that war was a disaster and that is not true. He said those who died serving in Vietnam did so \u201cfor no meaningful benefit to anyone.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears that Mr. Rothman needs to satisfy his guilt by again saying it was a mistake and only the U.S. military industrial complex benefited.\n\nOh, have I heard that before.\n\nBut the boys and girls who died in Vietnam, died in a noble effort to protect the weak and indefensible civilians of Vietnam and Cambodia. Those right-thinking people knew the evils of communism but Mr. Rothman apparently did not. We were there like we were in Europe and Asia in World War II, to protect the weaker against fascism and tyranny. We were in Vietnam to fight the tyranny of the communists.\n\nThe anti-war people were successful in extricating us from Vietnam in 1975. Because of the anti-war effort, from 1975 to 1980, communist Pol Pot of Cambodia killed 1.7 million of this own people. Ho Chi Minh, the communist despot of Vietnam, killed 1 million of those opposed to communism.\n\nThis unfolded because we were no longer there to protect them.\n\nThose in the U.S. military who died there were the heroes. There was a great meaning to their lives. They wanted the Vietnamese people to live in peace and freedom.\n\n\u2014 Robert A. Casper Sr., San Rafael\n\nReaction to Jenner\u2019s\n\nwell-publicized change\n\nWho believes the image of Caitlyn Jenner featured on the cover of Vanity Fair and featured in the Marin IJ represents anything authentic about who she is or who we are?\n\nThe values she is presenting and the support she is getting (or not getting) are old and harmful stereotypes about women as objects.\n\nThat\u2019s not a real woman or man. Can\u2019t we support something better about being who we are than that?\n\n\u2014 S.
