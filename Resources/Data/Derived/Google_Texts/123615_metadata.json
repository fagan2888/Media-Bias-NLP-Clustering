Patients with primary progressive diseaseAt the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) 2016 Forum, Birnbaum shared findings from their latest study.The team prescribed each patient to take one capsule per day of a 300mg dose of pharmaceutical grade biotin. The researches cautiously monitored neurologic exams and blood work for toxicity at baseline and at three-month intervals.A total of 21 patients were treated \u2013 11 with secondary progressive MS, four with primary progressive MS, and six with stable relapsing remitting, yet progressive MS.
