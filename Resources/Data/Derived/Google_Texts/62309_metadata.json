Only one race in the Senate remains, Mary Landrieu\u2019s brave battle to maintain her seat as the last of two Democratic Senators in the Deep South. With this new political landscape, many in the science and tech communities are looking for cues of what to expect.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already big [in the science and tech sectors] you are likely to get bigger. If you are a startup, you are going to have less regulatory help,\u201d according to telecom consultant Robert Harris. As a former aide to Congressman G. K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), the next chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Harris predicts the new Congress could focus 60 percent of its attention, at least at the outset, on undoing Obamacare and President Obama\u2019s other key policy initiatives.\n\nThis could spell bad news for those with salaries tied to federally funded R&D, alternative energy opportunities, or the space industry.\n\nThe recent fight over the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act provides an indication of what may lie ahead. This legislation would renew and, in some cases, expand the nation\u2019s investment in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and other pro-innovation programs. Like many bills, the COMPETES Act was stalled in the divided Congress. The Democratic-led Senate sought to fully support President Obama\u2019s proposals for education related initiatives such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Other Minority-Serving Institutions, Nanotechnology Research and Development, and Post-doctoral fellowships. The Republican-led House was less generous.\n\n\u201cIt would be a mistake for Republicans\u201d in Congress or those leading states like Maryland to reverse or stall \u201cprogress made over recent years in innovation,\u201d says Maryland Delegate Aisha Braveboy (D). As the outgoing chairperson of the Maryland State Legislative Caucus, Braveboy advises Governor-Elect Larry Hogan to stay the course on science and technology.\n\nDespite being a former Democratic candidate for Maryland Attorney General, garnering nearly 100,000 in the 2014 Primary elections, Braveboy sees some room for optimism in a Hogan administration. \u201cHe [Hogan] has made a commitment to reach across the aisle [even to the African American community] to make cabinet appointments,\u201d noted Braveboy.\n\nTech observers should look to the state\u2019s colleges and universities to be Maryland\u2019s \u201chubs for innovation, particularly HBCUs\u201d like Bowie State, Morgan State, and University of Maryland Eastern Shore, estimates Braveboy.\n\nBoyd Rutherford (R), Maryland\u2019s Lt. Governor-elect agrees that there is good reason for those in science and tech to be optimistic about his state. Staying away from making any new policy announcements, the African American, D.C.-native, reiterated Hogan\u2019s campaign talking-points. \u201cWe are about jobs and job creation. That\u2019s going to be the main focus for every cabinet position,\u201d said Rutherford.\n\nLike Braveboy, Rutherford is a graduate of Howard University and, while a conservative, is not shy about his outreach to Maryland\u2019s growing Muslim and immigrant populations. The Lt. Governor-Elect has been tapped to help the Hogan Administration find good people. \u201c[W]e don\u2019t believe in punishing people\u2026we\u2019re looking for competence and we believe we can find that in different ethnic groups, different genders, and political [affiliations],\u201d he said. Those interested in working in Maryland state government can submit their resumes online by contacting the Hogan headquarters.\n\n\u201cI would be thrilled to know that the incoming administration plans to pay more attention to STEM particularly at HBCUs,\u201d said Maryland Delegate and Senator-Elect Shirley Nathan-Pulliam. \u201cAs a strong Democrat, I\u2019m still mourning that we did not win,\u201d however \u201cI would love to see [Hogan] give [Rutherford] innovation as his portfolio.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am also concerned that our new governor does not seek to dismantle our health care delivery system,\u201d Nathan-Pulliam continued. \u201cAs a registered nurse, I can attest that sick children make poor students, sick adults make bad workers.\u201d\n\n1,263 total views, 1 views today", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Afro", "description": "The 2014 mid-term elections are all-but settled.\u00a0 Only one race in the Senate remains, Mary Landrieu\u2019s brave battle to maintain\u2026", "title": "2014 Election Aftermath: What Can Science, Tech Leaders Expect?", "url": "http://www.afro.com/2014-election-aftermath-what-can-science-tech-leaders-expect/", "image": "http://www.afro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1345122917741701421sciencetechnology.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "National News", "published_time": "2014-11-13", "modified_time": "2014-11-15", "author": "http://www.afro.com/author/scornish/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "description": "The 2014 mid-term elections are all-but settled.\u00a0 Only one race in the Senate remains, Mary Landrieu\u2019s brave battle to maintain\u2026", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce788\"", "article_summary": "With this new political landscape, many in the science and tech communities are looking for cues of what to expect.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already big [in the science and tech sectors] you are likely to get bigger.\nBoyd Rutherford (R), Maryland\u2019s Lt.
