For the second time in a week Glenn Beck has drawn a line in the sand, this time with the Republican Party.

A week after threatening to leave the National Rifle Association over concerns about possible ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, the conservative firebrand announced on his radio show Wednesday morning that he has left the Republican Party.

And he encouraged his millions of listeners to do the same.

“I’ve made my decision – I’m out. I’m out of the Republican Party,” Beck said. “I am not a Republican; I will not give a dime to the Republican Party. I’m out. I highly recommend – run from the Republican Party. They are not good.”

The decidedly libertarian Beck pointed to the GOP’s weak-kneed efforts to oppose Obamacare and illegal immigration.

“They ran and they said they were doing all of these great things and they were going to stand against Obamacare and illegal immigration – they set us up,” he said. “They set us up. Enough is enough.”

Beck also expressed disgust with the GOP for “torpedoing” the constitution and the party’s conservative members who stand up for it.

“They’re torpedoing the Constitution and they’re doing it knowingly,” he said. “They’re taking on people like [U.S. Sens.] Mike Lee and Ted Cruz and they are torpedoing them. Knowingly. And these guys are standing for the constitution.”

“So I’m done with them.”

“Four years ago, I was with them,” Beck added. “Four years ago, I said work from the inside: let’s change it. Let’s get new guys in there. It’s too late.”
