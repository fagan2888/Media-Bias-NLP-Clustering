On stage, they'll challenge an audience with an increasingly short attention span to think harder, about issues that are frequently slighted or ignored.\n\nThey'll then be pilloried by snarky, sometimes stupid critics who haven't done their homework and frequently don't understand what's being presented. And they're grossly underpaid for work that not only changes but also saves lives.\n\nTrue of actors, what I've written is equally applicable to teachers, as one sees in Nilaja Sun's semi-autobiographical \"No Child,\" featuring a teaching theater artist in a Bronx high school. Showcasing an amazing Marti Gobel playing eight of those students and eight additional characters, it's now on stage at Next Act Theatre under Mary MacDonald Kerr's direction.\n\nChanneling the Stage Manager in \"Our Town,\" Gobel first embodies a wizened janitor, who sets the scene while mopping Rick Rasmussen's spare set: chairs heaped upstage before bleak institutional windows, a nearly empty classroom and a free-floating door \u2014 which pivots to reveal a chalkboard, underscoring that what's learned provides a portal to other worlds.\n\nNot that these kids seem destined to travel anywhere. When Ms. Sun shows up to launch a program through which they'll read, analyze and then enact a play, these students are all starring in a self-produced drama as juvenile delinquents \u2014 true to what they've always been told they are.\n\nHence Ms. Sun's strategically chosen script for this exercise: Timberlake Wertenbaker's \"Our Country's Good,\" riffing on the true story of how Australia's first convicts staged a play \u2014 and discovered they need not remain forever trapped within the confining roles they'd long inhabited.\n\nSo much for theory. Practice is another matter.\n\nPlaying Ms. Sun's students, Gobel makes clear how hard it is for them to leave behind their own imprisonment within the comforting if limiting roles they've always known, in which various poses and plenty of attitude mask their hungry need to take themselves seriously \u2014 and their crippling fear of all they risk if they actually do.\n\nThere's no time within this play's brief, 75-minute span to fully sketch each student's ensuing liberation, and some of Gobel's impersonations are sharper than others. But the best among them \u2014 often involving students at the moment when they come into their own while reciting lines from Wertenbaker's play \u2014 will stay with me a long time.\n\nI'll more readily forget this script's weaker moments.\n\nIt's no accident that Sun invokes Arthur Miller; while funnier than anything Miller ever wrote, her script occasionally flirts with being equally sentimental and preachy, despite all Gobel does to keep it real. And I could do without a setup that generates some of its humor by trading on ethnic stereotypes involving two ridiculously hapless female teachers, only to see a male teacher ride to everyone's rescue.\n\nBut the abiding and inspiring impression left by the highly recommended \"No Child\" involves a teacher who, like the phenomenally talented actor who plays her, isn't afraid to live her passionate conviction that theater can remake the world's stage \u2014 and that there's a vital role awaiting every child making an entrance upon it.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\n\"No Child\" continues through Feb. 22 at Next Act Theatre, 255 S.
