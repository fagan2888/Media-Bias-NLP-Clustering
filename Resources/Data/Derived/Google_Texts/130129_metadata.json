That representative said Wal-Mart intends to bring the primary care clinic concept to Indiana by 2016.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s significant because Wal-Mart isn\u2019t just trying to handle patients\u2019 sinus infections and cases of flu, as is the case with the retail clinics operated by Walgreens and CVS. Instead, Wal-Mart wants to make the nurse practitioners staffing its clinics the \u201cprimary medical provider\u201d for its shoppers.\n\n\n\nAnd, as usual, Wal-Mart is doing it at an always-low price\u2014$40 a visit\u2014that will come in below the typical rate its competitors, the traditional office-based physicians, are charging.\n\n\n\nThe good news for rural hospital systems, Kelso said, is that QuadMed is saying it wants to work with local hospital systems to provide the lab tests, imaging scans and the physician oversight that will be necessary for its clinics to provide their full spectrum of services.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to have a corporate doctor in Arkansas, for example,\u201d Kelso said. Although, he noted that national lab testing companies, such as North Carolina-based LabCorp., already have courier services that pick up lab samples in his town\u2014Washington, Indiana, population 11,500\u2013and ship them out of state for analysis.\n\n\n\nSo local hospital systems would have to compete with those providers on price, Kelso said. Right now, as I noted recently, hospital-based lab testing isn\u2019t even close to the independent facilities on price.\n\n\n\nIf Wal-Mart is able to control the referrals of a large chunk of patients, it\u2019s a threat to local hospital systems\u2019 business.\n\n\n\nBut they\u2019re not worrying about it right now, Kelso said, because they have bigger concerns on their radar screen. Namely, that payments changes from the federal Medicare program, as well as advances in medical technology, are starting to empty out their hospital beds.\n\n\n\nKelso said his members have seen occupancy decline about 10 percent over the past two years.\n\n\n\nThat acceleration in the move away from inpatient care has sparked a few rural hopstials to look at getting out of the inpatient business altogether, and instead offer outpatient services, an ER and then transportation to larger hospitals for more complex care.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s what appears to be happening at Indiana University Health\u2019s Morgan County Hospital in Martinsville, although the hospital is getting input from local residents and the chamber of commerce before it finalizes its plans.\n\n\n\nIU Health Morgan CEO Doug Puckett said IU Health would invest \u201cseveral million dollars\u201d to help its hospital facility switch from an acute care, inpatient facility to an outpatient health center, according to the Reporter-Times newspaper in Martinsville.\n\n\n\nThese changes led to the end of obstetrical care last year and will result in the shuttering of IU Health Morgan\u2019s histology lab next year. And there could be more to come.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs long as it doesn\u2019t have an adverse outcome for a patient, we will do that because overall costs going down is beneficial to the patient,\u201d Puckett told the Reporter-Times\u2014a jaw-dropping statement I can\u2019t recall any local hospital executive saying in my seven-plus years covering health care.\n\n\n\nOther hospitals haven\u2019t gone public with these kinds of plans because they fear they\u2019ll get the reaction that Puckett has. He said he was bombarded recently at the Morgan County Fair with people saying, \u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard the hospital is closing.\u201d\n\n\n\nEven so, Kelso thinks financial pressures will push things that way\u2014as soon as three years from now.\n\n\n\nIf he\u2019s right, that means health care in rural areas will soon consist of outpatient centers, perhaps an ER, ambulances (or other transport vehicles) and a Walmart clinic.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s dramatically different than what we\u2019re used to.
