Tyndall Air Force Base kicked off the Fourth of July with activities for military men and women and their families.

The Tyndall 325th Force Support Squadron (FSS) held several events for military families to enjoy, like canoe and kayak rentals on Bonita Bay, games at the Tyndall bowling alley, shuttles to Shell Island and much more.

All of these activities were absolutely free on Independence Day.

"Days like today are great, because it's Independence Day, it's the whole reason why we volunteer to wear this uniform," said 1st Lt. Chris Bowyer-Meeder, Tyndall Air Force Base Public Affairs Officer. "We appreciate the independence and the freedoms that we fight for. Having a day where we can come out and enjoy some of those freedoms that we fight for everyday is just a great opportunity for our military members."
