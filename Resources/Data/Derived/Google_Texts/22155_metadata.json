I\u2019m not unsympathetic, especially in that there\u2019s a huge \u201cwho knows?\u201d to all of this. I often get stuck in these settings on the realization that we can\u2019t predict next month\u2019s jobs numbers very reliably; what makes us think we can see at all clearly that far down the road?\n\nStill, there\u2019s something potentially useful going on here. There are trends\u2014some ongoing, some new \u2014 that are worth thinking about and planning for from the perspective of future economic policy. (To state what I hope is obvious, the thing we want to act most quickly and aggressively on vis-\u00e0-vis the future is the impact of carbon emissions on the environment.)\n\nAmong the most notable of these trends is what people are calling the \u201cgig economy:\u201d the growth of freelance, independent or contingent labor. That trend has been growing for decades, of course, but there\u2019s a new task-creation function at the intersection of technology, apps and interconnectivity, giving rise to \u201csharing economy\u201d jobs and raising important questions about the changing nature of work (in this regard, I think of \u201cgig\u201d as referring to both what musicians call a freelance job, as well as to gigabytes).\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone knows the magnitude of the gig economy. One estimate says a third of the workforce are now freelancers, but I suspect that\u2019s high (or at least it should not be taken at face value as many of us, myself included, do both standard and freelance work).\n\nWhile the gig economy is sometime romantically touted as fostering micro-enterprise and entrepreneurism, my take is closer to that of economist Gerald Friedman who puts not too fine a point on it:\n\nThe gig economy is associated with low wages, repression, insecurity, and chronic stress and anxiety. Freelance workers fear to complain about working conditions, fear to ask for higher pay, and fear to reject any conditions imposed by prospective employers. By removing any social protection, the gig economy returns us to the most oppressive type of cut-throat and hierarchical capitalism, a social order where the power to hire and fire has been restored to employers, giving them once again unfettered control over the workplace.\n\nThat captures the downside of this growing sector, and it is thus essential for those contemplating a future path toward more social and economic justice to incorporate these concerns in our thinking and planning.\n\nThe upside is labor demand, as in \u201cjobs.\u201d While there\u2019s considerable anxiety about technology increasingly displacing work (though systematic evidence is lacking, as economist Larry Mishel points out here), history is replete with examples of technology creating more jobs, on net, though often after periods of painful disruption.\n\nThe intervening variable, and it is absolutely crucial, is consumer demand. In this regard, there are at least two future-oriented things we should be worried about in terms of jobs and incomes: inequality and bargaining power.\n\nEven in the future, there\u2019s an econ 101 principle that will still be operative: Labor demand is derived demand. It\u2019s derived from the goods and services that consumers and investors and governments need and want. Economist Joe Stiglitz has long argued that inequality and its constraining impact on middle and low-income growth have hurt job growth by reducing demand among those who are \u201cliquidity constrained\u201d and thus have a high propensity to consume the marginal dollar.\n\nMore plainly, if the people who already have much of the old money also get most of the new money, we should expect consumer demand to falter. As I\u2019ve explained elsewhere, that didn\u2019t happen so much in the 2000s because the liquidity constraint was loosened through access to cheap credit. Sprinkle in a housing bubble and a wealth effect (consumer spending goosed by asset appreciation), and you have an alternate, albeit unsustainable, source of growth.\n\nEven more plainly, you can have all the apps you want offering handy delivery of all kinds of stuff we want and need (including stuff we didn\u2019t know we needed, like powdered food), but if consumers are too strapped, or worried about being too strapped, don\u2019t expect much in the way of job creation.\n\nThat\u2019s job quantity. Equally important is job quality, and here the warning above about the low quality of many freelance jobs is highly germane. Noodling about the future in this space strikes me as essential. How should these workers by classified (are they employees, subcontractors, or do we need a new category)? When it comes to health coverage, can they access the exchanges in the Affordable Care Act, or do they need to figure out a way to pool risk as firms now do in order to provide affordable coverage? Is there some way they can work against their atomized status and come together to collectively bargain (the Freelancer\u2019s Union has long been active and effective in this space; can it scale up)?\n\nAlthough it is common in these brain storming sessions to hear about a coming world without much in the way of work, I don\u2019t see it. This time could always be different, but the message from history is that the living standards of most working-age people \u2014 and if anything, we\u2019re working longer, not shorter \u2014 will continue to depend on our jobs and our paychecks.\n\nIf I\u2019m right, the quantity and quality of the jobs of the future will be much improved if we employ public policy to lean against growing inequality and weak bargaining power. In that regard, when it comes to the future of work, it\u2019s not the robots that worry me. It\u2019s the policymakers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There will still be jobs in the future.
