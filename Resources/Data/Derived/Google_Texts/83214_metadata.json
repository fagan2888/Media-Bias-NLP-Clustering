A budgetary impasse may lead to a shutdown similar to the standstill that followed heated disagreement over the Affordable Care Act two years ago.The U.S. economy will shrink in inflation-adjusted terms by 0.2 percentage point for each week the government is closed, Goldman economists Jan Hatzius and Alec Phillips estimated in a Sept. 21 report obtained by Newsmax Finance.The Commerce Department said gross domestic product likely grew 3.7 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier. That expansion included $121.1 billion of inventories that piled up faster than Wall Street economists had forecast.Goldman said a shutdown will hit the economy in four ways:\u201cIf a shutdown occurs next week and were handled the same way as prior shutdowns, about 40 percent of federal workers would be sent home \u2026 representing about $2 billion in lost compensation for each week that funding lapsed,\u201d the report said.The effect would be reversed in the first quarter of 2016 if the government gets back to work.The last government shutdown overlapped with a deadline that capped the government\u2019s ability to borrow money.Goldman estimates the debt limit won\u2019t be reached again until mid-November, or possibly six weeks after the government\u2019s spending authority expires.\u201cThe current debate does not involve the debt limit. However, Congress looks increasingly likely to set the next expiration of spending authority around the time of the debt limit deadline,\u201d the New York-based bank said. \u201cAbsent an increase in the debt limit, Treasury\u2019s cash balance would probably run dry sometime by early December.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Goldman Sachs, economy, government, shutdown", "pubdate": "2015-09-22T12:43:04", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Next week's possible U.S. government shutdown will damage the economy in four significant ways as federal activity grinds to a halt, echoing the effects of the 2013 closure, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "title": "Goldman: 4 Ways Federal Shutdown Will Hurt Economy, Consumers", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/RobWilliams/Goldman-Sachs-economy-government-shutdown/2015/09/22/id/692725/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=9c63c5df-ca9e-4dd3-b8f7-895ba9dca6f4&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/RobWilliams/Goldman-Sachs-economy-government-shutdown/2015/09/22/id/692725/", "title": "Goldman: 4 Ways Federal Shutdown Will Hurt Economy, Consumers", "description": "Next week's possible U.S. government shutdown will damage the economy in four significant ways as federal activity grinds to a halt, echoing the effects of the 2013 closure, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "epoch": 1442925784, "google-site-verification": "G8ES7h3vwQTlFRuKZLTkGYYr-GOyLKJVunu1JffVHbs", "keywords": "Goldman Sachs, economy, government, shutdown", "article": {"section": "RobWilliams", "published_time": "2015-09-22T12:43:04"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/RobWilliams/Goldman-Sachs-economy-government-shutdown/2015/09/22/id/692725/", "description": "Goldman: 4 Ways Federal Shutdown Will Hurt Economy, Consumers"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAbsent an increase in the debt limit, Treasury\u2019s cash balance would probably run dry sometime by early December.\u201d\nHowever, Congress looks increasingly likely to set the next expiration of spending authority around the time of the debt limit deadline,\u201d the New York-based bank said.\nLost pay to furloughed federal workers.\nReduced federal purchases of goods and services.\nShock to confidence on employment, investment and consumer spending."}
