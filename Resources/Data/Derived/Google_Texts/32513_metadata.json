Rand Paul?\n\nA lot of his critics think he\u2019s ready to dismantle the federal government until there\u2019s virtually nothing left.\n\nBut in an interview at his home in Bowling Green, Ky., back in the spring of 2013, he says that\u2019s simply not true.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I believe in no government, Paul, R-Ky., told The Daily Signal. \u201cI just believe we should have the amount of government that we bring in in taxes, spend what comes in. That\u2019s an enormous amount of government, $2.6 trillion (the amount at the time of the interview in 2013). The problem is we spend $3.8 trillion and we only bring in $2.6 trillion. $2.6 trillion is a lot of money; you could do a lot of things. It wouldn\u2019t be no government but we would have to get rid of some of the wasteful parts of government.\u201d\n\nPaul is trying to position himself as a different kind of Republican, and when asked what he wants people to know about him, his answer was vintage Rand Paul.\n\n\u201cI consider myself to be a family man and a good husband. I mow my own grass, I compost because I care about the environment\u2026I truly care about trying to make the country a better place for everybody, to try and have such prosperity that I can come home from Washington and go back to being a doctor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an interview at his home in Bowling Green, Ky., back in the spring of 2013, Rand Paul described himself as a normal guy.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In an interview at his home in Bowling Green, Ky., back in the spring of 2013, Rand Paul described himself as a normal guy.", "title": "Who is Rand Paul?
