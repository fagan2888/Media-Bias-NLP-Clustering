His job as a structural welder gets him out in the open air on skyscrapers and bridges, but he wants to give that job up for a seat in Congress.\n\nDigby is one of five candidates running to replace retiring Congressman Sam Farr. He\u2019s running as an independent. Journalist Lewis Leader interviewed him about why he\u2019s running and what being an independent means to him.\n\nLewis Leader (LL): Tell me why you are running for office?\n\nJack Digby (JD): Well I\u2019m running for office because I want to be a Congressman. I\u2019m not running because of fault or deficit and any of the other candidates. In fact, they\u2019re all great people. I want to be a voice of the Central Coast. I want to fight for freedom and democracy. I want to fight oligarchy, aristocracy and oppression. I want to bring new blood to Congress from the 20th District. That\u2019s why I\u2019m standing up. That\u2019s why I\u2019m running.\n\nLL: You said, it\u2019s unacceptable the way that Sam Farr retired and has left his seat to Panetta\u2019s son, Jimmy. Tell me more about that.\n\nJD: If you look at the way that Leon Panetta gave the seat to Sam and now Sam is giving it back to Jimmy. The evidence of that is that no other reputable democrat has run. Look at Bill Monning. Look at Mark Stone. None of them have decided to run. Why wouldn\u2019t they run? They\u2019re qualified for that job. Why aren\u2019t they running? The answer is maybe they don\u2019t have as much courage as I do.\n\nLL: Let\u2019s presume you are elected. What are some of the initial steps you would take as a Congressman?\n\nJD: Well the first thing I\u2019m going to do is make sure that we get an adequate water supply here on the Central Coast. Water is very important. People don\u2019t realize how close we came to running out of water last year. With a big agricultural base here, and a growing population. We need to make sure that we have water on the Central Coast.\n\nLL: In addition to water, what do you see as pressing issues?\n\nJD: Healthcare. I want to see all Americans have some access to healthcare. I want to see prescription drug prices go down. I\u2019m tired of seeing old women in the grocery stores looking through their cart, holding their pills in their hands. I know they don\u2019t have enough money to buy food and their medication. We owe more to the people. Who gave us this great nation than to see them suffer in poverty in their later years?\n\nLL: Speaking of affordable health care, do you think the affordable healthcare act, also known as Obamacare, do you think it went far enough?\n\nJD: I don\u2019t\u2019 think that it went far enough. However, President Obama has faced hurdles at every juncture of his presidency, so it\u2019s really hard to hold it against him. It\u2019s a step in the right direction, but I think single payer for all is the way to go.\n\nLL: If you are elected, who would you presumable work with more closely? The Democrats? The Republicans? The Independents? How do you see yourself in Congress?\n\nJD: I will work with those who fight for the principles of freedom and democracy whether or not they are a Republican or a Democrat or a Socialist. I will look for people who will work hard and will work hard with them.\n\nLL: In the current Congress, are there particular people who you find yourself aligned with?\n\nJD: Elizabeth Warren. I like Elizabeth Warren. I want to come after the big banks. I want to get rid of all student debt and I would definitely enlist my services with Elizabeth Warren.\n\nLL: How would the government pay for the elimination of student debt?\n\nJD: It\u2019s easy. We live in a Federal Reserve world. The money doesn\u2019t have any real gold value. It\u2019s basically a merit system. It only has value because we believe it has value. If Americans believe there\u2019s a value in our economy by erasing all student debt, it\u2019s not going to hurt us.\n\nYou know I just want to be that candidate that\u2019s going take money from defense and put it into education. People say that you can\u2019t pay for progressive ideas. I\u2019m here to tell you they\u2019re wrong. I can pay for these progressive ideas. I can help Americans have more money for their retirement. I can help Americans get an education. I can help the American children rise the levels we\u2019ve been at before. I can help us be number one again.\n\nJack Digby is running as an independent for the seat in California Congressional District 20, which represents the Central Coast.
