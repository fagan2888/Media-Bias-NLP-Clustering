But these plans provide far from comprehensive coverage, and buyers need to understand their limitations.\n\nIn contrast to regular health plans, applicants for short-term coverage may be rejected because they have pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nEven if they\u2019re accepted by the plan, the drugs and medical care necessary to manage their diabetes, for example, generally wouldn\u2019t be covered, says Carrie McLean, director of customer care at online health insurance vendor ehealth.com.\n\n\n\nNor do short-term plans typically cover preventive care or pregnancy and maternity services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to function like a regular health plan,\u201d says McLean.\n\nLifetime coverage maximums are typical as are high deductibles. Between April and June, the average deductible for short-term individual plans sold by ehealth.com was $3,391, while families faced an average deductible of $8,252. Premiums averaged $107 for individuals and $249 for families.\n\nPlans with similar limitations and restrictions used to be commonplace on the individual market. But the health law changed that. Today, regular insurance plans sold on the individual and small group markets must all cover a comprehensive set of 10 \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d and they can no longer turn people away because they have pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nThe 2014 enrollment for these plans ended in March, but some people who have specific changes in their life, such as losing job-based coverage or having a baby, can still get a special enrollment period to sign up for regular insurance plans.\n\nBecause short-term plans don\u2019t meet the standards of the health law for \u201cminimum essential coverage,\u201d they also expose consumers to the health law penalty for not having health insurance of $95 or 1% of income, whichever is greater.\n\nSo why would someone buy a short-term plan, anyway? Basically, it provides some protection against catastrophic hit-by-a-bus expenses. Some consumers are looking for just that.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
