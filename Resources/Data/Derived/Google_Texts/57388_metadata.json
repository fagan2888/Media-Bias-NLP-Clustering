According to a recent study of Republican base voters conducted by Democracy Corps, Obamacare \u201cgoes to the heart of Republican base thinking about the essential political battle.\u201d\n\nThey think they face a victorious Democratic Party that is intent on expanding government to increase dependency and therefore electoral support\u2026 [They believe that] insuring the uninsured dramatically grows those dependent on government. Tea Party participants, in particular, were very focused on those who claim \u201crights\u201d in the form of government services, without taking responsibility for themselves.\n\nRace, according to the study\u2019s authors, plays an unspoken role in determining who is and isn\u2019t counted among the \u201cdeserving\u201d poor.\n\nIt also dovetails perfectly with the overarching mythology that animates today\u2019s conservative movement: the belief that there exists a large group of shiftless people whose lifestyles are subsidized by an increasingly overburdened class of hard-working Americans. It\u2019s the \u2018makers versus takers\u2019 narrative that animates the movement \u2013 from the lowliest right-wing blogger to Mitt Romney\u2019s claim that 47 percent of Americans don\u2019t pay taxes and refuse to take care of themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s also complete nonsense. The reality is that virtually all Americans are, at various stages in their lives, both \u201cmakers\u201d and \u201ctakers.\u201d\n\nAmericans subsidize each other all the time, in dozens of ways, and the biggest beneficiaries are not the poor, but the middle class and the wealthy. But as Suzanne Mettler, a professor of government at Cornell University, found in her research, many of those receiving taxpayer subsidies don\u2019t realize it. In fact, according to Mettler\u2019s 2008 study, \u201c94 percent of those who had denied using [government] programs had benefited from at least one; the average respondent had used four.\u201d\n\nIn other words, many of those hardworking \u201ctaxpayers\u201d outraged at the idea that they\u2019re now being asked to subsidize health insurance for people with modest incomes themselves enjoy mortgages, health insurance, retirement accounts and other social goods that are being subsidized by other taxpayers, including those at the bottom of the income ladder.\n\nConsider this: the subsidies that represent the heart of Obamacare (which don\u2019t benefit the poor exclusively \u2013 a family of four making under $94,000 per year will be eligible for some help) will average $100 billion per year over the next decade, slightly less than the cost of the home mortgage deduction, which tallied $105 billion in 2011, according to Mettler. Seventy-seven percent of that subsidy flowed to households that made over $100,000 per year, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP). And Obamacare\u2019s subsidies pale in comparison to the $177 billion we dished out to subsidize employer contributions to health insurance plans in 2011. Subsidized pensions cost us another $111 billion that year. To put all that in perspective, states and the federal government spent a combined total of $31.4 billion last year on the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, which most people know as \u201cwelfare.\u201d\n\nMuch of our hidden welfare state is obscured by design. Americans are, as Johns Hopkins political scientist Steven Teles puts it, \u201cideological conservatives and operational liberals.\u201d\n\nThat is, they want to believe in the myth of small government while demanding that government address public needs and wants regarding everything from poverty and retirement security to environmental protection and social mobility\u2026 The easiest way to satisfy both halves of the American political mind is to create programs that hide the hand of government, whether it is through tax preferences, regulation, or litigation, rather than operating through the more transparent means of direct taxing and spending.\n\nMettler writes that as a result of this dynamic many government programs are successfully \u201clargely hidden from the public\u2026\u201d\n\nThrough them, government benefits people, providing them with opportunities and relieving their financial burdens, often without them even knowing it. Appearing to emanate from the private sector, such policies obscure the role of the government and exaggerate that of the market.\n\nThe other side of the mythology \u2013 that the \u201ctakers\u201d don\u2019t pay taxes \u2013 is equally as divorced from reality. It\u2019s based on the fact that around 40 percent of the population pays no federal income taxes in a given year, largely as a result of Republican policies like the child tax credit. But the claim is the height of cherry-picking data because the federal income tax represents only around a quarter of the taxes paid in this country. When one includes all taxes, those in the bottom fifth of American households forked over around 16 percent of their incomes in taxes, and the next fifth paid 21 percent of theirs, according to CBPP. And many of those tax dollars ultimately subsidize the lifestyles of those who fancy themselves to be self-made \u201cmakers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the case that, contrary to the belief that people who don\u2019t pay federal income taxes are a discrete group of Americans, most families don\u2019t pay them for a year or two when their incomes fall below the threshold, but do pay those taxes in other years. Almost one in five people who don\u2019t pay federal income taxes are students who will, one hopes, earn enough to pay federal income taxes when they graduate. Another fifth are seniors who paid those taxes before retirement.\n\nIt\u2019s perverse to condemn all of these people as shiftless moochers, but that\u2019s the foundational myth that supports most mainstream conservative thinking about government programs these days.\n\nSo here\u2019s something to keep in mind when you hear someone grousing about being forced to help pay for health insurance for what they see as \u201cthe undeserving poor\u201d: in all likelihood, that person has enjoyed subsidized college tuition or health insurance or home ownership or retirement plans\u2013 or any of a dozen other hidden government benefits in our submerged welfare state \u2014 and the idea of one group of Americans subsidizing another didn\u2019t seem to be a cause of outrage then.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans subsidize each other all the time and the biggest beneficiaries are the middle class and the wealthy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "Americans subsidize each other all the time and the biggest beneficiaries are the middle class and the wealthy.", "title": "Most of Those Outraged by Obamacare Enjoy Big Taxpayer Subsidies Themselves | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/iStock_000003655048-tax-return.jpg", "height": 360}, "updated_time": "2013-11-11T12:40:09-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2013/11/11/most-of-those-outraged-by-obamacare-enjoy-big-taxpayer-subsidies-themselves/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Americans subsidize each other all the time and the biggest beneficiaries are the middle class and the wealthy.", "creator": "@JoshuaHol", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/iStock_000003655048-tax-return.jpg", "title": "Most of Those Outraged by Obamacare Enjoy Big Taxpayer Subsidies Themselves | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2013-11-11T12:06:58-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-11T12:40:09-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20131111, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce04b\"", "article_summary": "Almost one in five people who don\u2019t pay federal income taxes are students who will, one hopes, earn enough to pay federal income taxes when they graduate.\nThe other side of the mythology \u2013 that the \u201ctakers\u201d don\u2019t pay taxes \u2013 is equally as divorced from reality.\nAnd Obamacare\u2019s subsidies pale in comparison to the $177 billion we dished out to subsidize employer contributions to health insurance plans in 2011.\nIt\u2019s the \u2018makers versus takers\u2019 narrative that animates the movement \u2013 from the lowliest right-wing blogger to Mitt Romney\u2019s claim that 47 percent of Americans don\u2019t pay taxes and refuse to take care of themselves.\nIt\u2019s based on the fact that around 40 percent of the population pays no federal income taxes in a given year, largely as a result of Republican policies like the child tax credit."}
