The Obama administration’s planned new rules to reduce oil and gas industry methane emissions should sound familiar.

That’s because Colorado has been down this path, last year becoming the first state to restrict industry emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.

With the federal effort still in its nascent stages, it’s difficult to analyze how U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rules will differ from Colorado’s. But there is one thing we’re reasonably sure of: The feds could learn a lot from the ways in which government, industry and environmentalists worked together in Colorado to craft strict yet reasonable regulations.

So far, indications are that the Colorado experience has made an impression on Washington.

“We are very encouraged about the way the EPA is talking about working with states, industry and others,” said Martha Rudolph, director of environmental programs for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

Of course, there was not universal support for the Colorado rules. Some critics pointed to declining industry methane emissions and said voluntary reductions were working. However, overall emissions are expected rise 25 percent by 2020, according to White House figures.

At this point, the planned rules would apply only to new operations, which has drawn criticism from environmentalists. However, EPA officials have stated the intent is to include existing operations in the future.

The Obama administration is on the right track with efforts to reduce oil and gas industry methane emissions, and Colorado is a shining example of how to do it right.
