By 2020, Raju said, \u201cwe will embrace ambulatory care models that emphasize primary care, preventive care and population health.\u201d Raju wants to grow the health system\u2019s patient base to 2 million people, and double the enrollment of its Metroplus health plan.\n\nNYC\u2019s health system faces a $1.7 billion deficit by 2018.\n\nRaju took the helm of the $6.7 billion system last year, in something of a homecoming. An adopted New Yorker by way of his native India and surgical training in London, Raju started his career at Brooklyn\u2019s Lutheran Medical Center before becoming chief medical officer at HHC\u2019s Coney Island Hospital in 2002. In 2006 became CMO of the whole HHC system, working there through the increased demand from uninsured patients during Great Recession.\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\nHe most recently was CEO of Cook County Health and Hospitals System in Chicago.\n\nHHC\u2019s Metroplus health plan currently covers about 500,000 New Yorkers in Medicare, Medicaid and, more recently, subsidized exchange plans. Part of the pitch of the health plan will be an affordable, high quality primary care service, Raju said.\n\nHHC, which employs 39,000, includes 11 hospitals that have historically made up the bulk of its service and revenue as places for the city\u2019s poor and uninsured seeking emergency and acute healthcare. The HHC also has more than 70 community-based clinics, which Raju wants to leverage as a way to scale its patient-centered medical home model.\n\n\u201cWe are committed to reducing primary care wait time to a maximum average of 14 days, and no more than 5 days for pediatric clinics,\u201d he said. By 2020, the goal is to have inpatient satisfaction scores of 80 percent and outpatient satisfaction scores of 93 percent.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cMany New Yorkers who have traditionally been our patients, now have insurance. They have a new-found option to seek care wherever they choose,\u201d Raju said. \u201cIn this new environment, the marketplace will dictate which hospitals will remain open, which hospitals will struggle, and which hospitals will close.\u201d\n\nAfter spending much of his first year meeting with facility nurses, physicians and patients, \u201cI think we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d Raju said.\n\nWhile preparing for a new focus on bringing patients strong primary care, the HHC has made some financing wins, growing patient service revenue 10 percent and its Metroplus health plan revenue 6 percent, garnering an A+ bond rating from Fitch, and negotiating a release of additional Medicaid upper payment limit funding.\n\nHHC also scored $1.7 billion from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to cover reconstruction and repair to damages from Hurricane Sandy. However, the health system is still seeking authority from the New York State Health Department to revise its Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital funding. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s reductions to federal DSH payments will leave HHC without nearly $3 billion between fiscal years 2017 and 2014.\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/new-york-city-public-health-system-unveils-plan-right-its-finances", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/NYC-skyline-wiki-feature_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "CEO Ram Raju wants to grow the health system's patient base to 2 million people and double the enrollment of its Metroplus health plan.", "title": "New York City public health system unveils plan to right its finances"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/NYC-skyline-wiki-feature_0.gif"}, "description": "CEO Ram Raju wants to grow the health system's patient base to 2 million people and double the enrollment of its Metroplus health plan.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New York City public health system unveils plan to right its finances"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Facing a mounting deficit, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp, the country\u2019s largest municipal hospital system, released a financial plan this week that it hopes will trim its budget gap while improving care in the city.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "However, the health system is still seeking authority from the New York State Health Department to revise its Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital funding.\nHHC\u2019s Metroplus health plan currently covers about 500,000 New Yorkers in Medicare, Medicaid and, more recently, subsidized exchange plans.\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]He most recently was CEO of Cook County Health and Hospitals System in Chicago.\nPart of the pitch of the health plan will be an affordable, high quality primary care service, Raju said.\nBy 2020, Raju said, \u201cwe will embrace ambulatory care models that emphasize primary care, preventive care and population health.\u201d Raju wants to grow the health system\u2019s patient base to 2 million people, and double the enrollment of its Metroplus health plan."}
