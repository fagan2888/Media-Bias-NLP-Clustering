For the first few years we were together\u2014before I shifted my focus to the science of sexual health, collaborating with counselors and researchers and educators\u2014I dragged him to launch parties for porn flicks and erotic art gallery openings and, every time he merely wanted to enjoy a simple roll in the hay, I produced a new sex toy with a flourish, a product I was reviewing for this or that publication.\n\nOne time, we even did a photo shoot with Women\u2019s Health after testing out and reporting upon a particular couples\u2019 toy. I couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty when a coworker of his discovered the published article while flipping through the magazine at work. By the end of the day, it had circulated around the entire office.\n\nI felt doubly guilty because he didn\u2019t even want all of those bells and whistles. He just wanted me. The toys I brought into the bedroom for research purposes didn\u2019t do anything for him. \u201cIt just feels weird,\u201d he said when I pressed him for details. I was disappointed. The very first time I had used a clitoral vibrator, it had been a revelation.\n\nThe past 15 years have seen the evolution of the vibrator from novelty sex toy to \u201cpersonal massager\u201d to well-designed piece of high-end gadgetry\u2014gadgetry that has become especially proficient at bringing women to orgasm. And it makes sense. Sometimes, women need a little extra help during partner play to experience arousal. Sometimes, a toy can do a better job than a finger during a round of solo sex. And after all, we have that pesky orgasm gap to bridge. According to the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, conducted back in 2009, 91 percent of men said they climaxed during their last sexual encounter while only 64 percent of women could report the same. Don\u2019t we deserve a little extra help?\n\nStill, much more recently, we have seen the rise of the \u201cguybrator\u201d and other male masturbators, toys for men that go far beyond the minimalism of products such as the Fleshlight. To be honest, I\u2019ve found this trend perplexing. Do guys need extra help achieving orgasm? Also, with my guy, toys haven\u2019t enhanced sex for anyone but me. So what gives?\n\nA Man\u2019s First Sex Toy\n\nIt seems that, for many men, the gateway to solo sex toy use is partner play. In a 2009 paper published in The Journal of Sexual Medicine, researchers found that, of the men they surveyed\u2014about half of whom had used a vibrator\u2014most had used them with their partners during foreplay and/or intercourse. (Only 16.6 percent had used them during solo masturbation.) When men were asked what led them to incorporate vibrators into their intimate lives in the first place, the most common reasons were wanting to please one\u2019s partner, or wanting to aid them in achieving orgasm.\n\nSuch is the case for Paolo William, a 51-year-old straight male who has used vibrators and other toys with his partners for at least 25 years. Though he\u2019s tried the Fleshlight, in addition to several prostate stimulators, most of his toy usage is within the context of partner play. \u201cI am a pleaser, so I like toys that she likes,\u201d says William. When asked whether toys enhance his own sexual experience, or if they are primarily used in the service of his partner\u2019s pleasure, he says that both are true. \u201cI get off watching her get off,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd William certainly isn\u2019t an anomaly. \u201cIn terms of men\u2019s attitudes toward vibrators,\u201d says Tristan Weedmark, We-Vibe\u2018s Global Passion Ambassador, \u201cin actuality, more men than women buy vibrators. And so the notion that men are intimidated by them is a myth.\u201d In fact, in looking more closely at the JSM survey, while 24.2 percent of men reported having used a vibrator in the past year, a whopping 44.8 percent had tried them at some point over the entire course of their lives.\n\nSo Where Has the Rise of Male-Specific Sex Toys Come From?\n\n\u201cOver the last decade,\u201d says Weedmark, \u201cthere has been an increase in sexual education, which has prompted higher acceptance and comfort around the subject of sexual pleasure and toys. Women and men alike have become more at ease talking about what they want, and they are more open to conversations around ways they can enhance their sexual experience.\u201d\n\nAnd with this ease has come a greater understanding of what has the potential to feel good. \u201cMy clients who use vibrators are often surprised by the way they change the sexual experience,\u201d says Dr. Jess, Astroglide\u2019s Resident Sexologist. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about enhancement, but about learning to derive and experience sexual pleasure from parts of their bodies aside from their penises. They use them on their perineums (behind the balls) and they report that their orgasms become more intense; rather than simply feeling concentrated pleasure in their groin, they find that they feel orgasmic sensations in other parts of their bodies, from their nipples to their fingertips.\u201d\n\nThis dawning realization of sexual possibility was also evident in a study conducted by researchers in Canada. For the purposes of this study, participants were given a couples\u2019 vibrator that they were asked to incorporate into their sex play over the course of six weeks. In the end, 71.4 percent of men reported enjoying the vibrator, saying it enhanced sexual pleasure, while 87.8 percent said they planned to keep using the vibrator after the study was over.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Noticing the proliferation of male sex toys, I wondered what was up; do men now need help achieving orgasm?", "title": "\u201cIt felt like the entire world was coming out of my d*ck\u201d: For purveyors of \u201cguybrators,\u201d fleshlights, and other male masturbators, business is booming", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Noticing the proliferation of male sex toys, I wondered what was up; do men now need help achieving orgasm?", "title": "\u201cIt felt like the entire world was coming out of my d*ck\u201d: For purveyors of \u201cguybrators,\u201d fleshlights, and other male masturbators, business is booming", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/10/it_felt_like_the_entire_world_was_coming_out_of_my_dck_for_purveyors_of_guybrators_fleshlights_and_other_male_masturbators_business_is_booming/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/life_essay_sex_toys.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Noticing the proliferation of male sex toys, I wondered what was up; do men now need help achieving orgasm?", "title": "\u201cIt felt like the entire world was coming out of my d*ck\u201d: For purveyors of \u201cguybrators,\u201d fleshlights, and other male masturbators, business is booming", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/life_essay_sex_toys.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steph Auteri", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Pick, Life stories, Love and Sex, male sex toys", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Editor's Pick, Life stories, Love and Sex, male sex toys, Life NewsMy husband is a hapless victim of my sex writing career.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about enhancement, but about learning to derive and experience sexual pleasure from parts of their bodies aside from their penises.\nA Man\u2019s First Sex ToyIt seems that, for many men, the gateway to solo sex toy use is partner play.\nSo Where Has the Rise of Male-Specific Sex Toys Come From?\nSuch is the case for Paolo William, a 51-year-old straight male who has used vibrators and other toys with his partners for at least 25 years."}
