But, I assure you, it was nowhere near as bad as how we handled the ISIS situation. I mean, our various Secret Service mishaps, or the scandals of the IRS and NSA. And I don\u2019t know if you guys remember, but the Obamacare website had some pretty serious problems too. In fact, if you look at all the stuff that\u2019s happened in my second term, this whole Ebola thing is probably one of my greatest accomplishments.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe president\u2019s new Ebola czar Ron Klain argues that his lack of medical experience is irrelevant because \u201cI did serve as Chief of Staff to Vice President Joe Biden. So, I do have some experience with a little something called foot in mouth disease.\u201d He also argues against a travel ban with a reporter, stating \u201cwe could all go throwing statistics around,\u201d and then admitting, \u201cI don\u2019t have any with me at the moment, but if you just give me some time, everything will be 100% cool as hell\u201d when he is asked to provide some.\n\nWhen the Klain character is asked whether he is simply meant to make the president look good before the midterm elections, he responds, \u201cI am not worried about winning elections, however there are a few safety tips that people should know heading towards Election Day. For example, the Ebola virus actually flourishes in warmer climates. So, if you live in a southern state, such as Louisiana, Arkansas, or Kentucky, you actually may want to avoid any large public spaces like, say, a polling booth. One exception, however, is that we believe Latinos in red states may actually have an immunity to Ebola. So, they\u2019re good to go.\u201d\n\nLater, Al Sharpton is called in because no other Democrats in New York are willing to be seen with the president. Sharpton\u2019s character mispronounces words and misstates basic facts, referring to Klain as \u201cEbola Caesar,\u201d expressing a belief in \u201csewer monsters\u201d in New York City, and advising New Yorkers to brush their teeth with hand sanitizer.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "SNL Rips Obama on Ebola", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "SNL Rips Obama on Ebola", "title": "SNL Rips Obama on Ebola - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/25/SNL%20Obama%20Ebola%20Thumbnail.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/10/25/snl-rips-obama-on-ebola/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SNL Rips Obama on Ebola", "title": "SNL Rips Obama on Ebola - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/10/25/SNL%20Obama%20Ebola%20Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Secret Service, SNL, Twitter,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-10-25T21:11:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d mocked President Barack Obama for his handling of Ebola and other problems in his administration\u2019s second term.\nOne exception, however, is that we believe Latinos in red states may actually have an immunity to Ebola.\nFor example, the Ebola virus actually flourishes in warmer climates.\nIn the sketch, Obama says \u201csome people want to criticize the way our administration has handled this crisis, and it\u2019s true we made a few mistakes early on.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if you guys remember, but the Obamacare website had some pretty serious problems too."}
