As unpopular as it is, we have to take a step back and see how things function and ask how we're going to change this,\u201d Leslie Osche said.\n\nWith just a couple of weeks before the 2013-14 fundraising campaign ends, Osche said the agency is about $200,000 short of its $1.6 million goal. She doesn't expect to make up any ground.\n\n\u201cUntil our goals are specifically defined, we're not going to raise additional dollars,\u201d she said.\n\nAn agency breakfast featuring awards and volunteer recognition that had been scheduled for Thursday will be delayed until Sept. 4.\n\nInstead, the United Way will meet Thursday with participating agencies and board members to refine its mission and determine what issues it should focus on.\n\n\u201cFinancial security and poverty, we're looking at the problems. Have we moved the needle? The answer to that is probably no,\u201d Osche said.\n\nThe nonprofit organization raised $1.48 million in 2012-13, $200,000 short of its $1.68 million goal. For 2011-12, the organization raised a record $1.7 million.\n\nLast year's shortfall has meant cuts in funding to various programs, though Osche said she hopes some funding could be restored as the financial picture improved.\n\nThe Paul Laurence Dunbar Community Center in Butler Township lost $40,000 this year in funding, which would have gone to after-school and summer programming that serves more than 1,000 children, in addition to other efforts.\n\n\u201cI do believe times have changed with the Internet, Facebook, and Twitter, and all the abilities that agencies have to raise their own money, and with the shortage of dollars, we all have to look at where we're spending our money,\u201d Dunbar Executive Director Heather Dovenspike said.\n\nShe added that with an annual budget of $300,000 from federal, state and private sources, the center has made up some of the loss through private donations, but it's still a significant hit.\n\n\u201cAll nonprofits need to get better administratively,\u201d Dovenspike said.\n\nOsche noted that the United Way cut funding to one food program in Butler. But there's another non-United Way agency within a half-mile that serves hundreds of people.\n\n\u201cFeeding more and more isn't solving the problem. It isn't changing people's financial security. We're not working together,\u201d Osche said.\n\nThe United Way of Allegheny County announced this month that it raised nearly $34 million in its 2013 campaign, the fourth straight year-over-year increase. But, as in Butler, other smaller United Way chapters are struggling.\n\nThe United Way of Beaver County extended its fundraising campaign through July, hoping to raise nearly $700,000 of its $750,000 goal.\n\n\u201cIt's the economy, and the loss of high-paying jobs in the workplace,\u201d Executive Director Bruce Simmeth said. \u201cThe backbone of giving for the United Way is payroll deductions, and we've lost a lot of high-paying positions. Entire companies have closed their doors here.\u201d\n\nOsche said her organization has lost money from corporate partners, but she would not identify them.\n\nOne of Butler County's largest employers, AK Steel, with nearly 1,300 employees, has remained consistent with its corporate and payroll donations over the past several years, giving about $150,000 annually, said spokesman Mike Wallner.\n\n\u201cThe United Way has been supporting the community for so many years, and we're proud to contribute,\u201d Wallner said.\n\nBill Vidonic is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
