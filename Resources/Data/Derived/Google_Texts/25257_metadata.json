David Trawin, CC BY-SA 2.0.\n\nNew York's medical marijuana program (MMP) may soon be underway now that Governor Andrew Cuomo has selected the five companies that will be permitted to grow and sell the drug within the state. According to Howard Zucker, the state\u2019s health commissioner, these companies convinced state officials \u201cthey are the best suited to produce and provide quality medical marijuana to eligible New Yorkers in need, and to comply with New York\u2019s strict program requirements.\u201d Currently, officials project the program will be up and running by January, but the exact date is to be determined.\n\nWhen asked about the selection process, the administration said that they chose these companies based on their proven ability to make approved medical marijuana products, the efficacy of their transportation and distribution systems, their current financial standings, as well as other important factors. Even though this is a large step towards New York\u2019s long-awaited MMP, a registration program has not been put in place for patients and physicians wishing to participate in marijuana-related treatments. Officials, too, were not able to provide any clues as to when this would happen.\n\nSince New York's state legislature passed the Compassionate Care Act over a year ago, which legalized medical marijuana in the state, it has since fallen under much criticism. The program, one of the strictest in the country, only allows a narrow number of patients to receive the medication, specifically those suffering from cancer, HIV/AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy.\n\nAlso, current state rules for the program dictate that programs cannot produce medical marijuana to be smoked \u2014 they are only permitted to create liquids and oils that can be vaporized or eaten (otherwise known as edibles), along with capsules to be swallowed. Companies are also limited to a total of five products.\n\nAs of now, PharmaCann (one of the selected companies) is looking to open facilities within northern counties in New York. They are planning to build a growing facility in Hamptonburgh, the Wall Street Journal reported, while also setting up dispensaries in the Bronx, Amherst, Salina and Guilderland.\n\nPharmaCann is currently well established in Illinois, licensed to operate two medical marijuana growing facilities, plus four dispensaries within the state. John Leja, the chief of operations of the company, says that his business is deeply rooted in helping those suffering from illnesses that could benefit from medical marijuana \u2014 currently, every co-founder of the company has a family member who needs and utilizes medical marijuana. Leja says that his own mother has rheumatoid arthritis, and other forms of treatment did little to relieve her symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe thought we could bring professionalism [to the MMP], a seriousness to providing patients true medicine that is pure, consistent and science-based,\u201d he said.\n\nCuomo and his administration selected PharmaCann, among 4 others out of a pool of 43 applicants. Other selected companies include Columbia Care NY, Empire State Health Solutions, Etain, LLC, and Bloomfield Industries, Inc.\n\nOne of the more positive regulations the state has put upon these chosen companies is the requirement to test all of their products to ensure they are contaminant-free and consistent in quality; the new companies are ready to comply.\n\n\u201cWe are ready to start production immediately and are confident that we will meet the state\u2019s deadline and be ready to serve patients in January,\u201d says Kyle Kingslev, chief executive of Empire State Health Solutions. A subsidiary of Vireo Health, this company already has experience selling and producing medical marijuana in Minnesota.\n\nNow that choosing the five companies to run the program is out of the way, we can only hope that instituting a registration program will quickly follow suit so that New York state\u2019s MMP can finally start to help patients.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "governor, cuomo, picks, 5, companies, grow, new, york, states, medical, marijuana, program", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Five companies have been chosen to sell and distribute medical marijuana in New York, but when the program will finally be underway is still unknown.", "title": "New York State's Medical Marijuana Program Is Finally Growing", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/governor-cuomo-picks-5-companies-grow-new-york-states-medical-marijuana-program-345690", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/01/mm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Five companies have been chosen to sell and distribute medical marijuana in New York, but when the program will finally be underway is still unknown.", "title": "New York State's Medical Marijuana Program Is Finally Growing", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/governor-cuomo-picks-5-companies-grow-new-york-states-medical-marijuana-program-345690", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/01/mm.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/01/mm.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-08-01T12:36:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-01T12:36:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Five companies have been chosen to sell and distribute medical marijuana in New York, but when the program will finally be underway is still unknown."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0e6\"", "article_summary": "John Leja, the chief of operations of the company, says that his business is deeply rooted in helping those suffering from illnesses that could benefit from medical marijuana \u2014 currently, every co-founder of the company has a family member who needs and utilizes medical marijuana.\nNew York state finally has the 5 companies that will be selling and distributing its medical marijuana, but when the program will finally be underway is still unknown.\nNew York's medical marijuana program (MMP) may soon be underway now that Governor Andrew Cuomo has selected the five companies that will be permitted to grow and sell the drug within the state.\nA subsidiary of Vireo Health, this company already has experience selling and producing medical marijuana in Minnesota.\nAs of now, PharmaCann (one of the selected companies) is looking to open facilities within northern counties in New York."}
