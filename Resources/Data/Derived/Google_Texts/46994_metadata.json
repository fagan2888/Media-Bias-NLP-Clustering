Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had some tough words for the media\u2019s concentration on political personalities rather than the merits of campaigns.\n\nStelter asked Sanders about whether he felt that media outlets were providing serious coverage of his campaign and policies, or if the media was using him as a headlining foil to Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe have gotten more serious discussion on our issues than I might have thought about,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cBut this is what I worry about: In terms of campaign coverage, there is more coverage about the political gossip of a campaign, about raising money, about polling, about somebody saying something dumb.\u201d\n\nWhen Sanders talked about his perceived shortage of coverage to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Stelter responded, \u201cWe might say that they cover it on there website, or we might say there are niche outlets that can do a better job of covering this issue.\u201d Sanders turned it back to broadcast news, saying \u201ctelevision is an important medium, you cannot ignore that.\u201d\n\nSanders conceded that there are two sides to every issue, but he stressed the importance of focusing on the debate, rather than campaign spectacle. When Stelter asked about how the media can maintain audience interest, Sanders said, \u201cI just hope that we are concerned about the state of American democracy. We need serious discussion on serious issues.\u201d\n\nWatch the video here, via CNN:\n\n[Image via Screengrab]\n\n[h/t The Hill]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brian Stelter asked Bernie Sanders about whether he felt that media outlets were providing serious coverage of his campaign and policies, or if the media was", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/PicMonkey-Collage.jpg", "title": "Bernie Sanders Slams Media Focus on \u2018Political Gossip\u2019 over Policy"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brian Stelter asked Bernie Sanders about whether he felt that media outlets were providing serious coverage of his campaign and policies, or if the media was using him as a headlining foil to Hillary Clinton.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Slams Media Focus on 'Political Gossip' over Policy", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/PicMonkey-Collage.jpg", "creator": "@KenMeyer91", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-05-25T17:02:13+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd128\"", "article_summary": "Stelter asked Sanders about whether he felt that media outlets were providing serious coverage of his campaign and policies, or if the media was using him as a headlining foil to Hillary Clinton.\nDuring an interview with Brian Stelter on CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources, Sen.
