They\u2019ve upped the ante against House Republicans by coming up with an entire slate of legislation meant to address the actual concerns of actual citizens. They\u2019re calling it Middle Class Jumpstart. It\u2019s meant to jumpstart the middle class and those trying to get into the middle class.\n\nHouse Democrats are promising to pass this legislation within 100 days a Democratic House Majority.\n\nThey say the Jumpstart puts the middle class ahead of special interests. Jumpstart has three prongs: Good paying jobs, support for women, and affordable and accessible education.\n\nIn a phone conference with reporters today, Leader Pelosi explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a very positive agenda\u2026 These are issues the public has been telling us they are concerned about.\u201d Pelosi said the economy is improving, but the folks at home still have concerns. What Democrats are promising isn\u2019t just rhetoric, \u201cFor every initiative we are putting forth, we have legislation to match it.\u201d She continued, \u201cOne of the things we can do is bring Republicans around, but it won\u2019t help to elect more people with the same agenda.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) said that a key point in their plan is the \u201cMake it in America\u201d plan, \u201cSomething both sides agree on and has bipartisan support, which will expand manufacturing so we can get good paying jobs.\u201d The Democrats want to give tax breaks to folks who create jobs here \u2013 \u201con-shoring\u201d jobs, as opposed to Republicans who have worked hard to protect the tax breaks for companies that offshore.\n\nHoyer talked about the difference between Republicans and Democrats, using the Republican refusal to help during Sandy as an example of how the Republican approach is \u201cYou\u2019re on your own.\u201d\n\nHe said that the Jumpstart plan will show Americans that the Democrats are on their side and armed with a plan to help, \u201cIt will be clear to Americans that no only do we have a plan, but we are on their side, while Republicans have been telling Americans \u2018You\u2019re on your own\u2019. A perfect example is when Sandy hit the coast, and Republicans said \u2018We\u2019re not going to help.'\u201d\n\nHoyer hit the sweet spot when he said, \u201cWe think Americans want a Congress that is on its side.\u201d If that is possible, it is surely what the public not only wants and needs, but deserves.\n\nThe Democrats\u2019 Make It In America plan:\n\n\u2022 Republicans voted to give tax breaks to companies that ship American jobs overseas\n\n\u2022 Democrats will introduce the \u201c21st Century Make It In America Act\u201d to provide tax incentives for creating good-paying jobs here at home\n\n\u2022 Republicans blocked legislation to make long-term investments in our nation\u2019s aging highway system and opposed creating clean energy jobs of the future\n\n\u2022 House Democrats will pass the \u201cBuild America Bonds Act\u201d to boost job growth and modernize America\u2019s infrastructure by building roads, bridges, broadband technology and investing in clean energy initiatives \u2013 paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes\n\n\u2022 Republicans refused to raise the minimum wage but gave massive tax giveaways to corporate special interests and the ultra-wealthy\n\nHouse Democrats will pass the \u201cFair Minimum Wage Act\u201d and the \u201cCEO/Employee Pay Fairness Act\u201d to deny CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions for pay over $1 million unless they give their employees a raise\n\nAssistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn (D-SC) drew attention to the fact that our children are on the table this election, saying, \u201cPeople are scared for their children.\u201d Clyburn touched on how his own deep red state of South Carolina refused to expand Medicaid, something that impacts children.\n\nClyburn called out the media for not covering the issues of the People, \u201cThe media will not be our friends,\u201d he started, before Leader Pelosi cut him off to diplomatically point out that the media were on the call, \u201cLet\u2019s hope that they will, especially those on the call, and thank you for the focus on children.\u201d\n\nCongresswoman Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) detailed what Pelosi called \u201cwoman-onomics\u201d \u2013 which is basically a comprehensive economic program, including the Paycheck Fairness Act, \u201cHealthy Families Act\u201d to ensure paid sick leave for men and women, and increase access to affordable child care, and strengthen the \u201cViolence Against Women Act\u201d and will expand women\u2019s access to comprehensive health care and family planning. DeLauro said these changes were \u201clong overdue.\u201d\n\nRepublicans voted no on equal pay for women, voted against paid sick leave, voted to turn the Violence Against Women Act into a Pro-Violence Against Women Act, and voted to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nFor education, Dems promise to pass:\n\n\u2022 House Democrats will pass the \u201cBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act\u201d to help Americans refinance their college loans to new, lower rates, and will increase access to Pell Grants for higher education\n\n\u2022 House Democrats will pass the \u201cStrong Start for America\u2019s Children Act\u201d to increase access to effective early childhood learning\n\nSo much for the \u201cboth parties are the same\u201d meme. Policy talks.\n\nRepublicans have made it very easy for Democrats to use the GOP\u2019s record against them in the 2014 midterm elections.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats say, \"We think Americans want a Congress that is on its side.\" And they promise to pass legislation to back up that promise within 100 days of a Democratic House Majority.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Democrats say, \"We think Americans want a Congress that is on its side.\" And they promise to pass legislation to back up that promise within 100 days of a Democratic House Majority.", "title": "Fired Up Democrats Unveil A List Of Bills They Will Pass If They Take Back The House", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/08/06/democrats-promise-list-legislation-pass-100-days-house-dem-majority.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-06-at-2.27.04-PM-1-485x298.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-06T20:11:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "2014 Elections,Democratic Party,Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-08-06T17:10:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-06T20:11:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7b7\"", "article_summary": "House Democrats are promising to pass this legislation within 100 days a Democratic House Majority.\nThey\u2019ve upped the ante against House Republicans by coming up with an entire slate of legislation meant to address the actual concerns of actual citizens.\nHouse Democrats are on the warpath.\nDeLauro said these changes were \u201clong overdue.\u201dRepublicans voted no on equal pay for women, voted against paid sick leave, voted to turn the Violence Against Women Act into a Pro-Violence Against Women Act, and voted to defund Planned Parenthood.\nFor education, Dems promise to pass:\u2022 House Democrats will pass the \u201cBank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act\u201d to help Americans refinance their college loans to new, lower rates, and will increase access to Pell Grants for higher education\u2022 House Democrats will pass the \u201cStrong Start for America\u2019s Children Act\u201d to increase access to effective early childhood learningSo much for the \u201cboth parties are the same\u201d meme."}
