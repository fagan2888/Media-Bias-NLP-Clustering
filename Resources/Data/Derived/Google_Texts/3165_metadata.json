And they\u2019re hoping it will motivate you to sign up for ObamaCare.\n\nThis outdated slang features prominently in at least one lewd new ad promoting ObamaCare, featuring an open-mouthed, smiling young blonde woman giving the \u201cthumbs up\u201d to a packet of contraceptive pills while lustfully eyeing her male companion. Neither wears a wedding ring.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Get Physical,\u201d reads the ad\u2019s copy (another outdated cultural reference likely to be lost on the ad\u2019s target demographic), which is written from the girl\u2019s perspective. The ad copy reads:\n\n\u201cOMG, he\u2019s hot! Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s as easy to get as this birth control. My health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers. I got insurance. Now you can too. Thanks Obamacare!\u201d\n\nBelow the pair\u2019s photo, the text reads, \u201cSusie and Nate. Hot to trot.\u201d\n\nThe ad is just one in a series aimed at young adults in Colorado which portray the Millennial generation as overgrown adolescents with terrible grammar who are interested mostly in casual sex, binge drinking, and questionable athletic pursuits.\n\nAdam Fox, director of strategic engagement for the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, which co-produced the ads with ProgressNow, told the Daily Caller the ads were intended to appeal to the state\u2019s target market, \u201cyoung adults and women, primarily.\u201d This demographic is critical to the success of ObamaCare in order \u201cto stabilize the insurance prices throughout the nation and Colorado.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that we\u2019re encouraging any particular behavior,\u201d Fox told the Daily Caller, \u201cbut I think we\u2019re acknowledging the reality that a lot of different behaviors happen whether we like it or not.\u201d\n\nAlthough the ads have been widely criticized for encouraging immoral and unhealthy behavior, along with poor grammar, Fox said they were intended to be realistic.\n\nBut the behavior displayed in the ads is so over-the-top that many people have mistakenly assumed that they are satirical, including Planned Parenthood VOTES of Colorado, which took to Twitter to condemn \u201canti-Obamacare folks\u201d for producing the ads, which they called \u201cslut shaming.\u201d\n\nAfter users flooded the group with replies, pointing out that the ad was created by ObamaCare\u2019s supporters, not its detractors, Planned Parenthood quickly changed its tune.\n\n2 B clear, ads encouraging women 2 B healthy are good! So is dialogue about birth control #ThanksObamacare http://t.co/g5gkA1NZAk \u2014 PPVotesColorado (@PPVotesColorado) November 12, 2013\n\nThe new ads\u2019 portrayal of lust as a motivator for women to engage in activities as varied as working out, binge drinking, taking birth control pills, and petty theft has led many observers to call this round of the campaign \u201cHosurance.\u201d\n\nAnother ad features five young women holding a snow ski with shot glasses full of alcohol balanced on top. \u201cGet your shots,\u201d proclaims the ad. \u201cShotskis keep us happy. Flu shots keep us healthy. Saving money on flu shots leaves us more money for fun shots.\u201d\n\nStill other ads play on the popular Ryan Gosling \u201cHey Girl\u201d internet meme, showing women lusting after a cardboard cutout of the star.\n\nPopular Millennial blogger Matt Walsh called the ad campaign \u201cboring,\u201d \u201clame,\u201d and \u201ctedious.\u201d\n\n\u201cSleeping around? Begging for free birth control? Self indulgence? Hedonism? That\u2019s how our parents\u2019 generation rolled,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nWalsh added, \u201cAs Chesterton might say, that idea has been tried and found wanting. It\u2019s been tried for 40 years. We\u2019ve got a whole bunch of divorce, disease, and depression to show for it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "\u201cMy health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers,\u201d one ad reads.", "title": "ObamaCare ads so raunchy Planned Parenthood thought they were satire", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.data.lifesitenews.com/images/news/Hot2TrotAd-FULL.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/obamacare-ads-so-raunchy-planned-parenthood-thought-they-were-satire", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "\u201cMy health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers,\u201d one ad reads."}, "description": "\u201cMy health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers,\u201d one ad reads.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95c5\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s as easy to get as this birth control.\nBegging for free birth control?\n\u201cLet\u2019s Get Physical,\u201d reads the ad\u2019s copy (another outdated cultural reference likely to be lost on the ad\u2019s target demographic), which is written from the girl\u2019s perspective.\n2 B clear, ads encouraging women 2 B healthy are good!\nMy health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers."}
