Taking 'Obama' out of health care\n\nPresident Barack Obama and loyal Democrats once embraced the term Obamacare to sell the American people on health care reform.\n\nNot anymore.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith the president\u2019s approval ratings at record lows, a broken website and Obama under fire for his pledge that people could keep their plans, the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d has returned.\n\nThe president didn\u2019t say \u201cObamacare\u201d once during his nearly hourlong news conference last week, while he referred to the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d a dozen times. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi went so far as to correct David Gregory on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday on the proper terminology. And White House talking points distributed to Democrats and obtained by POLITICO repeatedly refer to the Affordable Care Act in suggested sound bites, not Obamacare.\n\n( WATCH: Best lines from Obama\u2019s ACA mea culpa)\n\nCalling it the Affordable Care Act has advantages for Democrats seeking to defend health care reform while still criticizing the bungled White House rollout. The phrase polls better than Obamacare \u2014 and people have responded more positively to the law\u2019s benefits when they haven\u2019t been told they come from Obamacare.\n\n\u201cYou want the law to have approval rating higher than POTUS has,\u201d a Democratic official said Monday.\n\n\u201cObamacare\u201d started out as a pejorative term during Obama\u2019s first campaign, and Republicans, especially the tea party, embraced it during protests and rallies against the health care bill. The media generally steered clear as well \u2014 using phrases such as \u201chealth care reform\u201d to describe the issue.\n\n( WATCH: 6 major players in HealthCare.gov debacle)\n\nBut Obama last year reappropriated the term for himself, making the phrase a staple of his stump speech and hawking \u201cI (heart) Obamacare\u201d bumper stickers.\n\n\u201cWe passed Obamacare \u2014 yes, I like the term \u2014 we passed it because I do care, and I want to put these choices in your hands where they belong,\u201d Obama said at a typical stop in Iowa last October.\n\nNow, the phrase is vanishing from official use. White House website posts in July (\u201cObamacare in Three Words: Saving People Money\u201d) and late September (\u201cWhat Obamacare Means for You\u201d) called the health care law the O-word. But now HealthCare.gov is almost entirely scrubbed of \u201cObamacare\u201d and the law is called the Affordable Care Act in nearly every instance. Health insurance exchanges run by states don\u2019t use the term Obamacare at all.\n\n( PHOTOS: 10 Sebelius quotes about the Obamacare website)\n\nA 22-page White House document issued to Democratic Sunday show guests uses the word Obamacare only under a \u201cgeneral points\u201d subheading and in a section debunking a purported myth that increased Medicaid enrollment would lead to an older, sicker population signing up for health care through the exchanges.\n\nInstead, the document contains standard White House health care talking points: \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is more than a website\u201d; \u201cWe have a great product that people like and tons of interest in the product\u201d; and Obama\u2019s \u201cadministrative proposal will give consumers more information and choices, including keeping their old plans.\u201d\n\nThe White House talking points suggest that Democrats respond to GOP attacks by pointing to October, when the government was shut down and Congress was staring at a potential default.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: President Obama to insurers: No bailout)\n\n\u201cThe GOP has an obsession with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the White House talking points read. \u201cThey were willing to shut down the government and threaten our economy and full faith and credit just to try to stop it.
