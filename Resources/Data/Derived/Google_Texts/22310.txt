On Saturday’s broadcast of “Justice” on Fox News Channel, host Judge Jeanine Pirro noted in her “Opening Statement” that the neighbors of San Bernardino attackers Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik thought something was up with Farook and Malik, but elected not to say anything in fear of being called Islamaphobes.

Judge Pirro said the fear of being labeled an Islamaphobe is “part of the terrorist plan” and that Americans need to stop “this politically incorrect nonsense” in order to protect this country.

“It’s time,” Pirro said. “Time to stop pussyfooting around. Time to stop this politically incorrect nonsense worrying about other people’s feelings, pull out all the stops and start fighting for the survival of this country and our way of life.”

“Since our Commander in Chief won’t even call them what they are, Islamic terrorists, but instead prefers to preach what Islam is and isn’t, and that we shouldn’t denigrate all Muslims on the actions of a few, while he denigrates the rights of gun owners based on the actions of a few,” she continued.

She concluded, “Talk to your neighbors, create organizations to stay current on questionable behavior, not just in your community but around the country. We’re told to say something when we see something but don’t say anything against people who act suspiciously who happen to be Muslim, because that would be Islamaphobic. Syed Farook’s neighbors were afraid to say something when they saw something because they were afraid of being called Islamaphobic. When our Attorney General says her greatest fear is the rhetoric against Muslims, we’ve got a problem. And I’m here to tell you, it is part of the Islamic terrorist plan. If we are stopped from saying something against Muhammad, the Muslim religion or Muslims in religion, then Sharia law is already here. We are living in dangerous times.”
