The mother of Eric Garner said Monday she would not be voting for Daniel Donovan — the Staten Island district attorney whose office oversaw the grand jury that declined to indict a police officer in her son’s death — in his race for Congress.

“He doesn’t get my vote,” Ms. Carr said of Mr. Donovan, a Republican who is running to replace former U.S. Rep. Michael Grimm in a special election May 5.

Ms. Carr made the comments at a news conference Monday where U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries announced the introduction of federal legislation that would make it illegal for law enforcement officials to use chokeholds.

The bill, called “The Excessive Use of Force Prevention Act,” would make the use of a chokehold by law enforcement a violation of federal civil rights law.

Mr. Jeffries, a Brooklyn congressman and a Democrat, called the chokehold “a poster child for violent police tactics” that has damaged the relationship between police and communities across the country.

“It is an unreasonable measure. It is an unnecessary measure. It is an uncivilized measure,” Mr. Jeffries said at a news conference outside the New York Police Department headquarters in lower Manhattan Monday.

Mr. Garner died last summer after being placed in an apparent chokehold by a police officer on Staten Island during an arrest for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes. Police have said he was resisting arrest.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Donovan declined to comment.
