I feel it\u2019s already the second best sports property here after cricket\u2019s Indian Premier League.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason for its success has been the use of cricketers like Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, as well as a handful of Indian film stars, to market the league across the country.\n\nBut despite the added glamour, some critics believe Indian football will not benefit greatly if the country\u2019s top domestic league, the I-League, is left to rot.\n\nBrazilian great Zico, who helped lead the transformation of domestic football in Japan, said the existence of two separate leagues could be an impediment to the sport\u2019s growth.\n\n\u201cIn Japan, the difference was that everyone was playing in one league only and not two leagues like in India,\u201d said Zico, who is coaching the Goa club in the ISL. \u201cHere, some of the very good players are not playing in ISL.\u201d\n\nTop football officials such as FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke and AIFF President Praful Patel insist the I-League remains India\u2019s only league and the ISL is merely a tournament.\n\nNarinder K. Bhatia, vice president of the Delhi Soccer Association, fears that a clash of systems could negatively impact the game in the long run.\n\n\u201cState associations are being sidelined. I fear the football culture will suffer rather than improve as even the present feeder system will collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the one hand, people are getting to watch the likes of players like Messi on television, and on the other these semi-retired players. Do you think people will become fans of these players? They\u2019ll forget our own players and past stars.\u201d\n\nSingh, too, is in favor of having just one league in the country.\n\n\u201cWe have resourceful companies backing teams in either league and I would love to see them combined and play a six-to-eight month league,\u201d he said. \u201cI would ideally like a situation where everyone is working toward improving the grassroots and instilling club culture.\u201d\n\nIndian football journalist and author Mohammad Aminul Islam also doubts the new league will successfully raise the standard of football in India because it\u2019s dominated by foreign players and, in his opinion, the quality of the matches has so far been mediocre.\n\nBrazilian midfielder Blumer is the leading scorer with eight goals, while players like Anelka and Del Piero clearly have too much still for Indian players, despite being past their primes.\n\n\u201cThe ISL should have only one or two active marquee players in each team instead of several over-the-hill stars,\u201d Islam said. \u201cThe ISL should\u2019ve encouraged locals more than foreigners.\u201d\n\nAs for the fans, many are happy to shell out 200 rupees (about $3) for the spectacle, even if the level of play isn\u2019t so great.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really backing teams,\u201d said student Aryan Singh after watching a game in New Delhi. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of getting a feel of watching a football match live rather than cricket.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "When the Indian Super League kicked off, it certainly seemed to add the zing that football needed in a country which FIFA chief Sepp Blatter once called \"a sleeping giant\" of the game.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When the Indian Super League kicked off, it certainly seemed to add the zing that football needed in a country which FIFA chief Sepp Blatter once called \u201ca sleeping giant\u201d of the game.", "title": "India\u2019s new football league making a big splash", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/20/indias-new-football-league-making-a-big-splash/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/a2f04055a21cf22d650f6a706700d797.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/20/a2f04055a21cf22d650f6a706700d797.jpg", "description": "When the Indian Super League kicked off, it certainly seemed to add the zing that football needed in a country which FIFA chief Sepp Blatter once called \"a sleeping giant\" of the game.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "India\u2019s new football league making a big splash"}, "Author": "C.RAJSHEKHAR RAO", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97fc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIndian football has never been packaged so well before,\u201d said Sukhvinder Singh, managing director of the football marketing consultancy Libero Sports.\nBut despite the added glamour, some critics believe Indian football will not benefit greatly if the country\u2019s top domestic league, the I-League, is left to rot.\nThe tournament, which began in October and finishes in December, has big money and sponsors behind it - organized by IMG-Reliance in collaboration with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Star India group and the All India Football Federation.\nAnd interest among fans has been high through the first half of the tournament, with attendance averaging 22,639 per match, the highest for a football league in Asia.\nBrazilian great Zico, who helped lead the transformation of domestic football in Japan, said the existence of two separate leagues could be an impediment to the sport\u2019s growth."}
