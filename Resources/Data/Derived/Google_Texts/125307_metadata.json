AUGUSTINE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 America\u2019s oldest city is slowly drowning.\n\nSt. Augustine\u2019s centuries-old Spanish fortress and other national landmarks sit feet from the encroaching Atlantic, whose waters already flood the city\u2019s narrow, brick-paved streets about 10 times a year \u2014 a problem worsening as sea levels rise. The city has long relied on tourism, but visitors to the fortress and Ponce de Leon\u2019s mythical Fountain of Youth might someday have to wear waders at high tide.\n\n\u201cIf you want to benefit from the fact we\u2019ve been here for 450 years, you have the responsibility to look forward to the next 450,\u201d said Bill Hamilton, a 63-year-old horticulturist whose family has lived in the city since the 1950s. \u201cIs St. Augustine even going to be here? We owe it to the people coming after us to leave the city in good shape.\u201d\n\nSt. Augustine is one of many chronically flooded communities along Florida\u2019s 1,200-mile coastline, and officials in these diverse places share a common concern: They\u2019re afraid their buildings and economies will be further inundated by rising seas in just a couple of decades. The effects are a daily reality in much of Florida. Drinking water wells are fouled by seawater. Higher tides and storm surges make for more frequent road flooding from Jacksonville to Key West, and they\u2019re overburdening aging flood-control systems.\n\nBut the state has yet to offer a clear plan or coordination to address what local officials across Florida\u2019s coast see as a slow-moving emergency. Republican Gov. Rick Scott is skeptical of man-made climate change and has put aside the task of preparing for sea level rise, an Associated Press review of thousands of emails and documents pertaining to the state\u2019s preparations for rising seas found.\n\nDespite warnings from water experts and climate scientists about risks to cities and drinking water, skepticism over sea level projections and climate change science has hampered planning efforts at all levels of government, the records showed. Florida\u2019s environmental agencies under Scott have been downsized and retooled, making them less effective at coordinating sea level rise planning in the state, the documents showed.\n\n\u201cIf I were governor, I\u2019d be out there talking about it (sea level rise) every day,\u201d said Eric Buermann, the former general counsel to the Republican Party of Florida who also served as a water district governing board member. \u201cI think he\u2019s really got to grab ahold of this, set a vision, a long-term vision, and rally the people behind it. Unless you\u2019re going to build a sea wall around South Florida, what\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\nThe issue presents a public works challenge that could cost billions here and nationwide. In the third-most populous U.S. state, where most residents live near a coast, municipalities say they need statewide coordination and aid to prepare for the costly road ahead.\n\nCommunities like St. Augustine can do only so much alone. If one city builds a seawall, it might divert water to a neighbor. Cities also lack the technology, money and manpower to keep back the seas by themselves.\n\nIn a brief interview with the AP in March, Scott wouldn\u2019t address whether the state had a long-range plan. He cited his support for Everglades restoration and some flood-control projects as progress but said cities and counties should contact environmental and water agencies to find answers \u2014 though Scott and a GOP-led legislature have slashed billions in funding from those agencies. Spokespeople for the water districts and other agencies disputed that cuts have affected their abilities to plan.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to make investments and find solutions to protect our environment and preserve Florida\u2019s natural beauty for our future generations,\u201d the governor said in a statement.\n\nFlorida\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection is in charge of protecting the state environment and water but has taken no official position on sea level rise, according to documents. DEP spokeswoman Lauren Engel said the agency\u2019s strategy is to aid local communities and others through the state\u2019s routine beach-nourishment and water-monitoring programs.\n\nIn St. Augustine, downtown streets around 19th century buildings built by oil tycoon Henry Flagler often close during nor\u2019easters because of flooding. While the city\u2019s proximity to the sea has always made flooding a problem, residents say it\u2019s worsened over the past 15 to 20 years.\n\nSt. Augustine\u2019s civil engineer says that the low-lying village will probably need a New Orleans-style pumping system to keep water out \u2014 but that but no one knows exactly what to do and the state\u2019s been unhelpful.\n\n\u201cOnly when the frequency of flooding increases will people get nervous about it, and by then it will be too late,\u201d engineer Reuben Franklin said. \u201cThere\u2019s no guidance from the state or federal level. \u2026 Everything I\u2019ve found to help I\u2019ve gotten by searching the Internet.\u201d\n\nAcross coastal Florida, sea levels are rising faster than previously measured, according to federal estimates. In addition to more flooding at high tide, increasing sea levels also mean higher surges during tropical storms and hurricanes, and more inundation of drinking wells throughout Florida.\n\nWater quality is a big concern for many communities. It\u2019s especially bad in South Florida \u2014 just north of Miami, Hallandale Beach has abandoned six of eight drinking water wells because of saltwater intrusion. Wells in northeast and central Florida are deemed at risk too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sea rise threatens Florida coast, but no statewide plan", "title": "Sea rise threatens Florida coast, but no statewide plan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sea rise threatens Florida coast, but no statewide plan", "title": "Sea rise threatens Florida coast, but no statewide plan", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/sea_rise_threatens_florida_coast_but_no_statewide_plan/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/floridas-rising-seas.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sea rise threatens Florida coast, but no statewide plan", "title": "Sea rise threatens Florida coast, but no statewide plan", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/floridas-rising-seas.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jason Dearen and Jennifer Kay", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u2026 Everything I\u2019ve found to help I\u2019ve gotten by searching the Internet.\u201dAcross coastal Florida, sea levels are rising faster than previously measured, according to federal estimates.\nFlorida\u2019s environmental agencies under Scott have been downsized and retooled, making them less effective at coordinating sea level rise planning in the state, the documents showed.\nIt\u2019s especially bad in South Florida \u2014 just north of Miami, Hallandale Beach has abandoned six of eight drinking water wells because of saltwater intrusion.\nFlorida\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection is in charge of protecting the state environment and water but has taken no official position on sea level rise, according to documents.\nRick Scott is skeptical of man-made climate change and has put aside the task of preparing for sea level rise, an Associated Press review of thousands of emails and documents pertaining to the state\u2019s preparations for rising seas found."}
