(National Transportation Safety Board via AP)\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Federal accident investigators are considering launching another search of the wreckage of a freighter that sank in October in an attempt to locate the ship\u2019s \u201cblack box.\u201d\n\nTom Roth-Roffy, the lead investigator for National Transportation Safety Board, told the Associated Press that a weeks-long search found one of the El Faro\u2019s missing decks, but not the mast where the ship\u2019s voyage data recorder was attached. The agency on Sunday released the first images of the ship in its final resting place.\n\n\u201cThere were no human remains found whatsoever, and no personal effects whatsoever,\u201d Roth-Roffy said. \u201cI think we found one boot.\u201d\n\nThe El Faro sank Oct. 1 after losing engine power and getting caught in a Category 4 hurricane while sailing from Jacksonville to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There were 33 mariners aboard \u2014 including two graduates of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in Bourne and several from Maine \u2014 and no survivors.\n\nRoth-Roffy said the NTSB would need to launch a second search of the wreckage 15,000 feet below the sea if it wants to find the data recorder, which would have recorded the captain\u2019s final transmissions. They are still determining if and when such a search would occur.\n\nThe images of the sunken ship show a breach in the El Faro\u2019s hull and its main navigation tower missing.\n\nRoth-Roffy says crews did locate one of the missing decks about a half-mile away from the main ship. Images show it resting on the seafloor, its windows broken out.\n\nThe ship\u2019s stern, or rear end, was buried more deeply than the bow, or front, Roth-Roffy said.\n\nInvestigators are still piecing events of the sinking together, but at this point they\u2019ve ruled out a major structure failure as a cause of the El Faro\u2019s sinking, Roth-Roffy said.\n\n\u201cThe issue with the detachment of the upper two decks, we\u2019re looking at that carefully,\u201d he said.\n\nEven without the data recorder, the images taken by remote-controlled underwater vehicles are helping to shed some light on the case.\n\nRoth-Roffy says all of the ship\u2019s cargo containers except for four were gone. The El Faro was carrying automobiles.\n\nDetermining what happened to the ship will be more difficult without the data recorder, but NTSB\u2019s investigators have said they are still confident they\u2019ll be able to find answers.\n\nAfter suspending their search for the data recorder in November, Roth-Roffy says they may go back to search again. The recorder was attached to the ship\u2019s main mast, a 35-foot tall structure that crews haven\u2019t yet located.\n\nThe data recorder charts the date, time and speed of a marine vessel, and also records conversations on the bridge that could include key decision-making between captain and crew.\n\nWhile recovering a small piece of equipment at such depth is difficult, there is precedent.\n\nThe black box of the Air France jetliner that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009 on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris was found in about 12,800 feet of water.\n\nCrews also retrieved the black box of a South African Airways airplane that crashed into the Indian Ocean in 1987 in more than 15,000 feet of water.\n\nFamilies of the crew members have filed multiple lawsuits against the El Faro\u2019s owners, Tote Marine, alleging wrongful death and negligence. They argue the ship should never have tried to outrun a hurricane, and that the decision to do so was motivated by money.\n\nTote Marine has asked a federal judge to limit or release its liability, and company officials have claimed the El Faro was maintained properly and in good condition. The company says it does not comment on individual lawsuits.\n\nWritten by Jason Dearen\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/03/shipwrecked-el-faro-presents-a-puzzle-to-investigators/", "article_author_name": "Associated Press", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Missing-Ship_Bunk.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Bahamas, freighter, hurricanes, Maine, maritime disasters, Massachusetts, sank, sunken ships, wreckage"}, "description": "Federal accident investigators are considering launching another search of the wreckage of a freighter that sank in October in an attempt to locate the ship's", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Missing-Ship_Bunk.jpg"}, "keywords": "wreckage,freighter,sank,massachusetts,bahamas,hurricanes,maine,maritime disasters,sunken ships", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Shipwrecked El Faro presents a puzzle to investigatorsPrinted from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/01/03/shipwrecked-el-faro-presents-a-puzzle-to-investigators/In this photograph released by the National Transportation Safety Board on Sunday, the detached navigation bridge of the sunken freighter El Faro is seen on the seafloor, 15,000-feet deep near the Bahamas.\nFamilies of the crew members have filed multiple lawsuits against the El Faro\u2019s owners, Tote Marine, alleging wrongful death and negligence.\nTote Marine has asked a federal judge to limit or release its liability, and company officials have claimed the El Faro was maintained properly and in good condition.\n\u201cI think we found one boot.\u201dThe El Faro sank Oct. 1 after losing engine power and getting caught in a Category 4 hurricane while sailing from Jacksonville to San Juan, Puerto Rico.\nThe El Faro was carrying automobiles."}
