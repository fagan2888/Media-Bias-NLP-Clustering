ABC and Kimmel apologized for the segment.\n\nThe White House, which accepts petitions and responds to the most popular ones, noted that ABC and Kimmel have \"already apologized independently\" and said that the comments \"do not reflect mainstream views of China in the United States.\"\n\n\"As the president has stated publicly, the United States welcomes the continuing peaceful rise of China,\" the White House said in its official response to the petition.
