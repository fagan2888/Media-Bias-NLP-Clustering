Madison\n\nThis decision established the system of checks and balances and the power of the Supreme Court within the federal government.\n\nSituation: Federalist William Marbury and many others were appointed to positions by outgoing President John Adams. The appointments were not finalized before the new Secretary of State James Madison took office, and Madison chose not to honor them. Marbury and the others invoked an Act of Congress and sued to get their appointed positions.\n\nThe Court decided against Marbury 6-0.\n\nHistorical significance: Chief Justice John Marshall wrote, \u201cAn act of the legislature repugnant to the constitution is void.\u201d It was the first time the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a law that had been passed by Congress.\n\n1857 \u2013 Dred Scott v. Sandford\n\nThis decision established that slaves were not citizens of the United States and were not protected under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSituation: Dred Scott and his wife Harriet sued for their freedom in Missouri, a slave state, after having lived with their owner, an Army surgeon, in the free Territory of Wisconsin.\n\nThe Court decided against Scott 7-2.\n\nHistorical significance: Slaves are not citizens and thereby cannot sue in federal court. The decision overturned the Missouri Compromise, where Congress had prohibited slavery in the territories. The Dred Scott decision was overturned later with the adoption of the 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery in 1865 and the 14th Amendment in 1868, granting citizenship to all born in the U.S.\n\n1896 \u2013 Plessy v. Ferguson\n\nThis decision established the rule of segregation, separate but equal.\n\nSituation: While attempting to test the constitutionality of the Separate Car Law in Louisiana, Homer Plessy, a man of 1/8 African descent, sat in the train car for whites instead of the blacks-only train car and was arrested.\n\nThe Court decided against Plessy 7-1.\n\nHistorical significance: Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote, \u201cThe argument also assumes that social prejudice may be overcome by legislation and that equal rights cannot be secured except by an enforced commingling of the two races\u2026 if the civil and political rights of both races be equal, one cannot be inferior to the other civilly or politically. If one race be inferior to the other socially, the Constitution of the United States cannot put them upon the same plane.\u201d The Court gave merit to the \u201cJim Crow\u201d system. Plessy was overturned by the Brown v. Board of Education decision.\n\n1954 \u2013 Brown v. Board of Education\n\nThis decision overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and granted equal protection under the law.\n\nSituation: Segregation of the public school systems in the United States was addressed when cases in Kansas, South Carolina, Delaware, and Virginia were all decided together under Brown v. Broad of Education. Third-grader Linda Brown was denied admission to the white school a few blocks from her home and was forced to attend the blacks-only school a mile away.\n\nThe Court decided in favor of Brown unanimously.\n\nHistorical significance: Racial segregation violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\n\n1963 \u2013 Gideon v. Wainwright\n\nThis decision guarantees the right to counsel.\n\nSituation: Clarence Earl Gideon was forced to defend himself when he requested a lawyer from a Florida court and was refused. He was convicted and sentenced to five years for breaking and entering.\n\nThe Court decided in favor of Gideon unanimously.\n\nHistorical significance: Ensures the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to counsel is applicable to the states through the 14th Amendment\u2019s due process clause.\n\n1964 \u2013 New York Times v. Sullivan\n\nThis decision upheld the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\n\nSituation: The New York Times and four African-American ministers were sued for libel by Montgomery, Alabama, police commissioner L.B. Sullivan. Sullivan claimed a full-page ad in the Times discussing the arrest of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and his efforts toward voter registration and integration in Montgomery were defamatory against Sullivan. Alabama\u2019s libel law does not require Sullivan to prove harm since the ad did contain factual errors. He was awarded $500,000.\n\nThe Court decided against Sullivan unanimously.\n\nHistorical significance: The First Amendment protects free speech and publication of all statements about public officials made without actual malice.\n\n1966 \u2013 Miranda v. Arizona\n\nThe decision established the rights of suspects against self-incrimination.\n\nSituation: Ernesto Miranda was convicted of rape and kidnapping after he confessed, while in police custody, without benefit of counsel or knowledge of his constitutional right to remain silent.\n\nThe court decided in favor of Miranda 5-4.\n\nHistorical significance: Upon arrest and/or questioning, all suspects are given some form of their constitutional rights \u2013 \u201cYou have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?\u201d\n\n1973 \u2013 Roe v. Wade\n\nThis decision the right to privacy extends to include a woman\u2019s right to choose pregnancy or abortion.\n\nSituation: \u201cJane Roe\u201d (Norma McCorvey), single and living in Texas, did not want to continue her third pregnancy. Under Texas law, she could not legally obtain an abortion.\n\nThe Court decided in favor of Roe 7-2.\n\nHistorical significance: Abortion is legal in all 50 states. Women have the right to choose between pregnancy and abortion.\n\n1974 \u2013 United States v. Nixon\n\nThis decision established that executive privilege is neither absolute nor unqualified.\n\nSituation: President Richard Nixon\u2019s taped conversations from 1971 onward were the object of subpoenas by both the special prosecutor and those under indictment in the Watergate scandal. The president claimed immunity from subpoena under executive privilege.\n\nThe Court decided against Nixon 8-0.\n\nHistorical significance: The president is not above the law. After the Court ruled on July 24, 1974, Richard Nixon resigned on August 8.\n\n1978 \u2013 Regents of the U. of California v. Bakke\n\nThis decision ruled that race cannot be the only factor in college admissions.\n\nSituation: Allan Bakke had twice applied for and was denied admission to the University of California Medical School at Davis. Bakke was white, male, and 35 years old. He claimed under California\u2019s affirmative action plan, minorities with lower grades and test scores were admitted to the medical school when he was not, therefore his denial of admission is based solely on race.\n\nThe Court decided in Bakke\u2019s favor, 5-4.\n\nHistorical significance: Affirmative action is approved by the Court, schools may use race as an admissions factor. However the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment works both ways in the case of affirmative action; race can not be the only factor in the admissions process.\n\n2012 \u2013 Dept. of HHS v. Florida (11-398); Florida v. Dept. of HHS (11-400); Natl. Federation of Business v. Sebelius (11-393) \u2013 Healthcare Reform Situation:\n\nThe constitutionality of the sweeping health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Court voted 5-4 in favor of upholding the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHistorical significance: The ruling upholds the law\u2019s central provision \u2013 a requirement that all people have health insurance\n\n2013 \u2013 United States v. Windsor\n\nThis decision ruled that the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined the term \u201cmarriage\u201d under federal law as a \u201clegal union between one man and one woman\u201d deprived same-sex couples who are legally married under state laws of their Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection under federal law.\n\nSituation: Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer were married in Toronto, Canada in 2007. Their marriage was recognized by New York state, where they resided. Upon Spyer\u2019s death in 2009, Windsor was forced to pay $363,000 in federal taxes, because their marriage was not recognized by federal law.\n\nThe court voted 5-4 in favor of Windsor.\n\nHistorical significance: The court rules that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional.\n\nHonorable mentions: 1944 \u2013 Korematsu v. United States \u2013 The Court ruled Executive Order 9066, internment of Japanese citizens during World War II, is legal, 6-3 for the United States.\n\n1961 \u2013 Mapp v. Ohio \u2013 \u201cFruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d evidence obtained through an illegal search cannot be used at trial, 6-3 for Mapp.\n\n1967 \u2013 Loving v. Virginia \u2013 Prohibition against interracial marriage was ruled unconstitutional, 9-0 for Loving.\n\n2008 \u2013 District of Columbia v. Heller \u2013 The Second Amendment does protect the individual\u2019s right to bear arms, 5-4 for Heller.\n\n2010 \u2013 Citizens United v.
