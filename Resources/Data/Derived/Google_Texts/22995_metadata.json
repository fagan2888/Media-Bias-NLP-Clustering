The negotiators worked diligently, but in the end, the JCPOA allows Iran to remain a nuclear threshold state while simultaneously reaping the benefits of relief from international sanctions.\" The Jewish Press reports Hastings' opposition puts him with 10 other House Democrats who've announced their intention to vote \"no\" on the pact, listing them as: New York's Grace Meng, Kathleen Rice, Nita Lowey, Steve Israel and Eliot Engel; California's Juan Vargas and Brad Sherman; New Jersey's Albio Sires; Florida's Ted Deutch, and Georgia's David Scott.\"We must maintain a strong sanctions regime \u2014 to do otherwise is to give up our leverage,\" Hastings writes. \"Sanctions are what brought Iran to the table, and they depend on large-scale international cooperation and compliance.\"Hastings vowed to introduce legislation next month authorizing the president or his successors \"to use military force to prevent Iran from becoming a nuclear weapons state.\"\"Iran\u2019s sincerity in forgoing the procurement of a nuclear weapon makes these steps, in my opinion, an absolute necessity \u2014 regardless of how Congress votes,\" he writes.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Alcee Hastings, Democrat, nuclear deal, Iran", "pubdate": "2015-08-13T17:57:28", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Florida Rep.
