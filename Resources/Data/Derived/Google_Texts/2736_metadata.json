(AP) - It\u2019s arguably Washington\u2019s most famous trail: Ninety-three miles of ups and downs looping around Mount Rainier.\n\nAs the Wonderland Trail celebrates its centennial this summer, we offer 100 things hikers ought to know about the trail:\n\n1. The park finished linking trails in 1915 to form the loop around the mountain in an effort to make patrolling easier for rangers. The Wonderland Trail quickly became popular with hikers.\n\n2. It was about 1920 when visitors and park staff started referring to the loop as the Wonderland Trail.\n\n3. The majority of hikers give themselves 10 or more days to finish the Wonderland.\n\n4. Backpackers are allowed a maximum of 15 days (14 nights) to hike the trail.\n\n5. The best part of the Wonderland Trail is a nap on the bank of Mystic Lake.\n\n6. Rainier suspended reservation requests this spring after receiving a record 2,600 backcountry permit requests, a 225 percent increase from pre-2013 averages.\n\n7. In April, park officials blamed media coverage for the sudden dramatic increase in permit requests.\n\n8. While reservations for overnight Wonderland trips are suspended, walk-up reservations, which can be secured not earlier than a day before departure, are still available.\n\n9. The Wonderland has been designated a National Recreation Trail.\n\n10. The park holds about 30 percent of backcountry space for walk-up permits and distributes them on a first come, first served basis.\n\n11. If you\u2019re planning ahead to next summer, the permitting process starts March 15.\n\n12. All permits received March 15-April 1 are treated equally.\n\n13. If you can\u2019t get a permit, sections of the Wonderland make ideal day trips. Permits aren\u2019t required for day trips.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's arguably Washington's most famous trail: Ninety-three miles of ups and downs looping around Mount Rainier.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "It\u2019s arguably Washington\u2019s most famous trail: Ninety-three miles of ups and downs looping around Mount Rainier.", "title": "On Wonderland Trail\u2019s centennial, 100 things to know", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/25/on-wonderland-trails-centennial-100-things-to-know/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/23/36dab4a4abb4e1207c0f6a7067008f18.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/23/36dab4a4abb4e1207c0f6a7067008f18.jpg", "description": "It's arguably Washington's most famous trail: Ninety-three miles of ups and downs looping around Mount Rainier.", "card": "summary", "title": "On Wonderland Trail\u2019s centennial, 100 things to know"}, "Author": "CRAIG HILL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "As the Wonderland Trail celebrates its centennial this summer, we offer 100 things hikers ought to know about the trail:1.\nThe best part of the Wonderland Trail is a nap on the bank of Mystic Lake.\nIt was about 1920 when visitors and park staff started referring to the loop as the Wonderland Trail.\nThe Wonderland Trail quickly became popular with hikers.\nWhile reservations for overnight Wonderland trips are suspended, walk-up reservations, which can be secured not earlier than a day before departure, are still available."}
