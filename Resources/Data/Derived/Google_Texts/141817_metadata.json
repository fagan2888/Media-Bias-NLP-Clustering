It also manages two ACOs for physicians, specialists and others in Athens.\n\nCAAP\u2019s first ACO was formed in April 2012 and was one of the first 27 in the country to be approved by Medicare. A second one followed in January 2013.\n\n\u201cCAAP\u2019s whole purpose is to be a service organization for doctors to help them perform medicine more easily,\u201d said CAAP CEO Janet Parham.\n\nCAAP assists doctors in raising the quality of care and lowering health costs by looking through claim information provided by Medicare to find patients who have had multiple trips to the emergency room for unmanaged chronic diseases such as uncontrolled diabetes and asthma.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focusing on unmanaged chronic diseases right now because we feel like that\u2019s where we can make the most impact,\u201d Parham said. \u201cWe are identifying the highest utilizers of emergency rooms and asking them why they are constantly going to the emergency room and then showing them how to manage the symptoms of their chronic diseases so they can stay out of the emergency room.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way we are lowering costs. Going to the emergency room is much more expensive than seeing a primary care physician.\u201d\n\nDiscovering the root of why people make multiple trips to the emergency room and getting them in to see a primary care physician to reconcile the problem also leads to preventive care.\n\nAnother way CAAP and the ACOs assist in preventive care is by ensuring that patients meet with a primary care doctor after their hospital release.\n\n\u201cCAAP\u2019s goal is to make contact with the patient within 72 hours of discharge from a hospital so we can get them an appointment to follow up with their primary care doctor immediately,\u201d Parham said.\n\nModels similar to the ACO that CAAP created are used outside of Athens and, Parham said, as doctors in other areas of Georgia begin to work with patients, they will look to Athens to see how to respond.\n\n\u201cACOs are very different from other models,\u201d Parham said. \u201cThere\u2019s an active outreach to patients to make sure they have whatever they need to be able to get the care they need. We\u2019re one of the first in the country to do ACOs, and we\u2019re definitely blazing a trail.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Follow faith, health and Blueprint reporter April Burkhart at www.facebook.com/AprilBurkhartABH.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Health, Local News, April Burkhart", "og": {"url": "http://onlineathens.com/health/2013-09-15/coalition-athens-doctors-creates-groups-focus-preventive-care", "site_name": "Online Athens", "type": "article", "description": "Physicians and specialists in Athens are moving toward their goal of improving patient care and lowering health care costs through the collaborative efforts of the Coalition of Athens Area Physicians (CAAP) and its Accountable Care Organizations (ACO).", "title": "Coalition of Athens doctors creates groups to focus on preventive care"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "article_summary": "Physicians and specialists in Athens are moving toward their goal of improving patient care and lowering health care costs through the collaborative efforts of the Coalition of Athens Area Physicians (CAAP) and its Accountable Care Organizations (ACO).\nAnother way CAAP and the ACOs assist in preventive care is by ensuring that patients meet with a primary care doctor after their hospital release.\nFormed in 1994 by a group of local primary care physicians, CAAP works to alleviate the burden of administrative work doctors face on a daily basis to free them up to practice medicine.\nGoing to the emergency room is much more expensive than seeing a primary care physician.\u201dDiscovering the root of why people make multiple trips to the emergency room and getting them in to see a primary care physician to reconcile the problem also leads to preventive care.\n\u201cCAAP\u2019s goal is to make contact with the patient within 72 hours of discharge from a hospital so we can get them an appointment to follow up with their primary care doctor immediately,\u201d Parham said."}
