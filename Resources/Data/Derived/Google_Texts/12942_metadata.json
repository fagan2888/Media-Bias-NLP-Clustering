She is the daughter of a successful Hollywood actress and producer. She has an Academy Award and an Emmy and has had sex with Brad Pitt. She didn\u2019t just marry the guy from Coldplay, she consciously uncoupled from him. She is an entire lifestyle industry. And when she wears pretty dresses or talks about her hair, or recommends steaming your vagina, she is in the zone. But when she attempts to be relatable, it\u2019s a little like when, in the movies, the space alien tries to emulate human behavior. Like last month when she unnervingly announced, \u201cI\u2019m incredibly close to the common woman in that I\u2019m a woman and I\u2019m a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers.\u201d The latest example? Her strange foray into food stamp-budget dining.\n\nPaltrow is the latest high-profile figure to take the SNAP challenge \u2014 a hunger awareness initiative that invites participants to experience what it\u2019s like to live and eat for seven days on the amount a person on his or her state\u2019s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would have to budget. On Thursday, Paltrow announced she\u2019s doing it as part of the Food Bank NYC fundraising challenge, after being nominated by her buddy Mario Batali. And to kick off, she tweeted a photo of a paltry array of groceries and said, \u201cThis is what $29 gets you at the grocery store\u2014what families on SNAP (i.e. food stamps) have to live on for a week.\u201d Let the latest round of Paltrow judging begin!\n\nJezebel quickly mitigated Paltrow\u2019s act with the observation that \u201cGwyn still gets to cook her $29 food in an expensive outdoor oven, have access to the world\u2019s best healthcare and sleep in a mansion.\u201d The Washington Post, while noting that her heart may be in the right place, observed of her grocery haul that \u201cThe spread looks more like it was concocted to be featured on a glossy Instagram or Pinterest page than to actually provide nutrition. And like everything Paltrow does, it seems to be imbued with evidence of her extravagant wealth.\u201d Perhaps Time expressed it most pithily, with writer Darlena Cunha\u2019s assertion that Paltrow\u2019s experiment is \u201cpoverty tourism.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing about poverty that one week can teach anyone with a safety net in place,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt\u2019s a game.\u201d\n\nBut is the objection here to the SNAP challenge itself, or to how Gwyneth is conducting it? When Cory Booker did the challenge in 2012, he was far more generously lauded for his \u201cimmersion politics.\u201dAnd I can attest that when my children and I did it two years ago, it wasn\u2019t because we were play acting at poverty \u2014 we were genuinely attempting to understand more about how we as Americans feed ourselves, and how we can work together to be better at it. It was about imparting skills and understanding the high cost of our culture\u2019s astonishing wastefulness. We didn\u2019t go into it expecting to eradicate hunger, but we did raise a little money and we did come away with deeper empathy. I have no regrets about doing it and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to encourage others to try it. It\u2019s one thing to snark on Gwyneth \u2014 and God knows, I can and often do \u2014 it\u2019s another to put yourself out there and try something that may be difficult.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Her week on a food stamp budget draws outrage as \"poverty tourism\"", "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Her week on a food stamp budget draws outrage as \"poverty tourism\"", "title": "Too many limes: Why Gwyneth\u2019s SNAP challenge is a bust", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/14/too_many_limes_why_gwyneths_snap_challenge_is_a_bust/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/gwyneth_paltrow3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Her week on a food stamp budget draws outrage as \"poverty tourism\"", "creator": "@embeedub", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/gwyneth_paltrow3.jpg", "title": "Too many limes: Why Gwyneth\u2019s SNAP challenge is a bust", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Too many limes: Why Gwyneth\u2019s SNAP challenge is a bust", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Cory Booker, Gwyneth Paltrow, SNAP Challenge", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Cory Booker, Gwyneth Paltrow, SNAP Challenge, Life News, Entertainment NewsGwyneth Paltrow is not like the rest of us.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game.\u201dBut is the objection here to the SNAP challenge itself, or to how Gwyneth is conducting it?\nOn Thursday, Paltrow announced she\u2019s doing it as part of the Food Bank NYC fundraising challenge, after being nominated by her buddy Mario Batali.\nfood stamps) have to live on for a week.\u201d Let the latest round of Paltrow judging begin!\nAnd when she wears pretty dresses or talks about her hair, or recommends steaming your vagina, she is in the zone."}
