(Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)\n\nNeil Pradhan, 28, user experience consultant, Infomatics.\n\nI grew up in Mumbai. I was always interested in computers, so I did my bachelor\u2019s in information technology. Then I came across the field of user experience for Web and mobile applications. It\u2019s obviously technical. But it also involves aesthetics and psychology. I talk with the users and I try to understand their mental model so we have a Web site designed in a way that makes the content easy to find.\n\nIn India, the field of human-computer interaction is still very new. There isn\u2019t much research going on. I found a lot of different programs for it at American universities. I went to Georgia Tech and I graduated with a master\u2019s in 2009.\n\nIt was kind of difficult to get a job. I was on a student visa. To work in the United States, I need a work permit, an H-1B work visa. If a company doesn\u2019t find a U.S. citizen for that particular job, then a company will sponsor the work visa. I got a lot of calls from different recruiters. But they didn\u2019t want to go through the hassle of the paperwork. It took me about three months to find [my first] job.\n\nAbout six months ago, I joined Infomatics Corp. Right now I\u2019m working on a project at D.C. government. Under the Affordable Care Act, D.C. is coming up with its own health insurance exchange. I\u2019m trying to make a good design so when people go online to register for health insurance, the screens will be easy to use.\n\nI did find one thing different from India, that\u2019s really nice. There is less of a hierarchy in American workplaces. In India, most of the time, people will just follow whatever the manager is saying. In the U.S., obviously you will take directions from the manager. But you can still have a debate in terms of having a rational approach to thinking.\n\nIn my previous job, we had a team of 12 to 15 people, many different nationalities. They were from Russia; someone was from the United Kingdom. I read in papers the things people say about immigration reform. Fortunately, I haven\u2019t faced anything like that. Everyone has been really nice.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "immigrant labor day, immigrant india, immigrant high tech, india tech, indian immigrants tech", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\u2018There is less of a hierarchy in American workplaces\u2019", "title": "Neil Pradhan: \u2018There is less of a hierarchy in American workplaces\u2019", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/neil-pradhan-there-is-less-of-a-hierarchy-in-american-workplaces/2013/09/01/0242bbce-119a-11e3-b4cb-fd7ce041d814_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/08/31/Others/Images/2013-08-31/_MG_02051377967643.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CMorelloWP"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "immigrant labor day, immigrant india, immigrant high tech, india tech, indian immigrants tech", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "0242bbce-119a-11e3-b4cb-fd7ce041d814", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "\u2018There is less of a hierarchy in American workplaces\u2019"}, "article_summary": "(Dayna Smith/For The Washington Post)Neil Pradhan, 28, user experience consultant, Infomatics.\nTo work in the United States, I need a work permit, an H-1B work visa.\nThen I came across the field of user experience for Web and mobile applications.\nIf a company doesn\u2019t find a U.S. citizen for that particular job, then a company will sponsor the work visa.\nNeil Pradhan, working in the U.S. on an H-1B guest worker visa, is a user experience contractor currently working with the D.C. government to design a webpage for Affordable Care Act insurance."}
