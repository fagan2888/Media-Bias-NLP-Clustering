While some supporters see a movement in its early stages, others, even many who are sympathetic, see an exercise in futility on the wrong side of the state\u2019s political and cultural divide.\n\n\u201cThe South belongs to the right wing,\u201d says Ray Strother, 73, who has managed dozens of prominent political campaigns for Democrats across the South. \u201cMoral Monday was just born out of frustration. It is a desperate battle for political relevance.\u201d\n\nThose odds did not dampen the fervor of the activists in Atlanta on Tuesday. Shortly after the State Senate opened for business, four people in the gallery leapt up, shouting and holding a banner saying \u201cExpand Medicaid now.\u201d\n\nThe protesters were handcuffed, charged with disrupting official business, and taken to the Fulton County jail. When the session was gaveled back to order, another group repeated the action, then another.\n\nAfter lunch, the Rev. Dr. Raphael G. Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the longtime pulpit of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., led 11 protesters to the governor\u2019s office, where they blocked the entrance until they, too, were arrested.\n\n\u201cWe have people dying every day just because they don\u2019t have access to health care,\u201d one protester, Shayna Adelman, 32, said in an interview before she was jailed. \u201cIt\u2019s morally repugnant to me. Sometimes you have to take dramatic action to get people\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhile these groups embrace a variety of liberal issues, from public education to voting rights, the focus in Georgia and South Carolina on Tuesday was Medicaid expansion. Both states have turned down federal funds to finance expanding the program under the health care law.\n\nIn South Carolina, 17 members of the Truthful Tuesday coalition were arrested outside the Statehouse in Columbia, the group\u2019s largest action, bringing its total arrests to 39 over the last three Tuesdays.\n\n\u201cThese folks are doing the service of drawing attention to it in a very crude way,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a former chairman of South Carolina\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cGetting plasticuffed behind your back, you\u2019re not going to have a very deep discussion of the issues, but you do get attention.\u201d\n\nRepublican officials have been less charitable. The party\u2019s chairman in North Carolina, Claude Pope, dismissed the state\u2019s protest group as having a \u201cfringe liberal agenda,\u201d while State Senator Thom Goolsby called it \u201cMoron Monday.\u201d\n\nIn Atlanta on Tuesday, as protesters disrupted the Senate session for the fifth time, State Senator Frank Ginn, a Republican, referred to them as \u201cfecal matter.\u201d\n\nIf any of these groups can claim to have budged the political needle, it is North Carolina\u2019s. Its coalition started seven years ago under a Democratic administration and claims credit for successfully pressing for several laws, including the Racial Justice Act, which allowed death-row inmates to challenge their sentences if they could prove that race was a significant factor in imposing it.\n\nThat law and others were repealed after the state elected Pat McCrory, a Republican, as governor in 2012, liberating an already Republican-majority legislature. Since then, a state once known as one of the most moderate in the South has become a virtual laboratory for Tea Party-style policies.\n\nLast April, the N.A.A.C.P.-led coalition started the weekly protests at the Statehouse in Raleigh known as Moral Mondays. Nearly 1,000 of its protesters were arrested last summer, and a rally last month there drew more than 80,000 people.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nPolling suggests the protests may be having an effect. A series of polls by High Point University show approval ratings of Mr. McCrory and the state legislature plummeting since the governor took office, though the polls do not identify the cause. \u201cWe can assume it had something to do with the agenda,\u201d said Martin J. Kifer, a political scientist at the university and the poll\u2019s director. \u201cIt stands to reason that part of the promotion of that agenda was something the Moral Monday protests played a role in.\u201d\n\nWith the legislature out of session, the group has continued weekly meetings across the state and this summer plans to send volunteers to 50 counties in a voter registration and education drive, part of a multipronged effort to counter a restrictive new voting law, which is also being challenged by the Justice Department.\n\nPerhaps most noteworthy, the model is proliferating, with new groups forming in Florida and Alabama as well as Wisconsin and New York.\n\nIn Atlanta, after the political theater ended Tuesday, lawmakers adopted the Medicaid bill the protesters had come to oppose, which reinforces the state\u2019s decision not to expand the program. Moral Monday took place on Tuesday this week because the legislature was closed on Monday for St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\n\nThere was no indication that the disruptions changed a single mind, feeding the argument that the whole movement is a quixotic quest. To that, however, Hodding Carter III, a former assistant secretary of state and now a public policy professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, says compared to what?\n\n\u201cIt is a long haul,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only way to stay on the long haul is to keep sounding the bugle.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140318135414, "twitter":
