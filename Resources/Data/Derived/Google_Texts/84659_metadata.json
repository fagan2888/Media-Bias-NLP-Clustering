Ricardo Lara, a Democrat, said if the current focus of healthcare reform is make sure everyone has access to coverage programs, the millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States cannot be omitted.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made enormous strides to reduce California\u2019s uninsured population with the implementation of the [federal] Affordable Care Act, but we won\u2019t have a truly healthy state until everyone has access to quality, affordable coverage,\u201d said Lara, head of the state Latino legislative caucus, in a press release. \u201cImmigration status shouldn\u2019t bar individuals from health coverage, especially since their taxes contribute to the growth of our economy.\u201d\n\nFederal laws preclude undocumented immigrants from many programs \u2013 including state insurance ones \u2013 that receive federal funding.\n\nThe healthcare reform measure, called the Affordable Care Act (ACA), does not allow participation by undocumented immigrants. In California, Covered California, the healthcare exchange that is part of ACA, excludes undocumented immigrants, the Los Angeles Times said.\n\nLara\u2019s office said in a press release that about a million California residents would be left out of the coverage overhaul because they are undocumented. About another million undocumented immigrants get some form of health care benefits through their place of work, the Times said.\n\nSome of the possible ways undocumented immigrants could get access to health care coverage are expanding Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s plan for low-income people, or through a program linked to Covered California that does not receive federal funding, the Times said.\n\n\u201cAccess to preventive care keeps people healthier by providing regular check-ups and screenings, and early diagnosis of health problems ensures those problems can be treated before they become overly expensive,\u201d said Lara\u2019s press release.\n\n\u201cBy ensuring everyone has access to health care, we can improve the health of our entire community, limit the overcrowding of emergency rooms, and reduce the costs of healthcare in California.\u201d\n\nSome state Republicans object to Lara's views on allowing undocumented immigrants to get access to government insurance programs.\n\nAssemblyman Tim Donnelly of Twin Peaks, a candidate for governor, said, \"California cannot afford to create another incentive to attract people to come to our state illegally in pursuit of taxpayer-subsidized benefits. It's shameful that \u2026 Lara would trade on the plight of those who are ineligible.\"\n\nFollow us on twitter.com/foxnewslatino\n\nLike us at facebook.com/foxnewslatino", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2014-01-13 14:37:38 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/FNL/Politics/0/0/ricardo%20lara.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"California Lawmaker Pushes Bill Extending Obamacare To Undocumented Immigrants\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2014/01/13/california-lawmaker-pushes-for-government-health-care-plans-to-cover/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/FNL/Politics/0/0/ricardo%20lara.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"7e8e33b890d83410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-13T19:37:38Z\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "United States,health insurance,Affordable Care Act,health,healthcare", "description": "La conferencia para desarrolladores WWDC de Apple comienza el pr\u00f3ximo 13 de junio y cada a\u00f1o se filtran varios rumores sobre el esperado keynote de Apple.
