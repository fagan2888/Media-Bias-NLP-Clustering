ATLANTA — Jordan Spieth already has the best year in golf. He’s one round away from having the richest year in golf history.

Spieth battled through a tough, rainy Saturday at the Tour Championship and overtook Henrik Stenson with a 2-under 68. The Masters and U.S. Open champion saved par with a 20-foot putt on the 16th hole and took the lead for the first time with a 20-foot birdie on the 18th.

Stenson made three bogeys on the back nine for a 72 and was one shot behind.

The FedEx Cup finale is Sunday, and it was shaping up as a big one. Rickie Fowler shot a 67, the best score of the third round, and was four shots back. If any of them win, they get the $10 million bonus.
