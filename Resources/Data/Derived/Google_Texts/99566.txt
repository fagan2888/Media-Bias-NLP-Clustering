The Country Music Awards are a lot like every Tyler Perry play: everyone is laughing except me, and I have no idea what the hell is going on. (This happens in real-life, too. Friends? Sure, I’ve got Lefty and Righty *raises fists with eyes drawn on them*) Last night at the CMAs in Nashville, where country music has been replaced by pop with cowboy hats, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood began the show with a mocking musical tribute to Obamacare, a bit that began with a twerking joke and ended with Taylor Swift wondering if she’s contractually obligated to laugh.

Lest you think that’s the worst thing ever, no, that would go to the Duck Dynasty parody of “Blurred Lines.”

Jimmie Rodgers is Kacey Musgraves not impressed-facing the world right now.
