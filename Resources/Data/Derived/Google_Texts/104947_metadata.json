Bush and President Barack Obama both used executive authority to take on congress and quoted Obama when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a pen and I\u2019ve got a phone\u201d in regard to his executive actions.\n\nHowever, the major point of Esenberg\u2019s presentation focused on the political divide in the country and how he believes it boils down to a disagreement over the definition of constitutional liberty, such as in cases of religious liberty claims versus equality claims.\n\nHe visited topics such as religious employers being pushed to supply contraceptives or abortion-inducing drugs in their health care plans and photographers not wanting to take photos of same-sex weddings.\n\n\u201cOn one hand, you have this claim of religious liberty that people should not be compelled by the law to act contrary to their conscience,\u201d Esenberg said. \u201cOn the other hand, you have an equality claim with people saying that not providing this service would constitute discrimination.\u201d\n\nEsenberg believes this is a tension that is constantly coming up in today\u2019s debates concerning constitutional liberty.\n\nWhile he said his own view tends to side more with liberty claims as opposed to equality claims, he wants to inform people that these are very real differences that cannot be readily dismissed as either \u201cbigotry on the one hand or political correctness on the other hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are part of a larger debate we have about the capacity of the government to intervene and make things well versus people like me who tend to be more skeptical of the government\u2019s ability to do that and are more concerned with individual liberty,\u201d Esenberg said.\n\nHe explained that too often we view the disagreement over the definition of constitutional liberty as \u201ca battle between forces of light and darkness.\u201d\n\nBuy Photo Atty.

Klein/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)\n\n\u201cBut it is really a fundamental disagreement about how competing values ought to be resolved,\u201d Esenberg said.\n\nHe stressed that the purpose of his speech was to highlight the complexity of today\u2019s common political disagreements and prompt discussion on the topic, but one audience member was quick to ask, \u201cHow do we stop the erosion of liberty?\u201d\n\nIn reply, Esenberg said, \u201cWe need to return to the idea of structural limitations on government\u201d before turning to a broader scope.\n\n\u201cWe also need to redevelop a taste for diversity, and by that I don\u2019t simply mean diversity that turns on one\u2019s race, gender or sexual orientation, but also a diversity of belief,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to understand that people who disagree with us are not misbegotten and evil, and sometimes they need to be permitted to persist in their disagreement.\"\n\nLaw Day celebrates the rule of law and recognizes the role of courts in our democracy and the contributions of the legal system to freedom. In addition to Esenberg\u2019s presentation, Sheriff Todd Priebe was recognized as the Law Day Volunteer of the Year.\n\nThe event marked Sheboygan Circuit Court Judge James Bolgert\u2019s final law day before he steps down from the bench at the end of July.\n\nReach Leah Ulatowski at 920-453-5134, Lulatowski@sheboyganpress.com or @Leah_Bekah on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://shebpr.es/1T1t1Xi", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Attorney Rick Esenberg presents at John Michael Kohler Art Center for Law Day", "og": {"site_name": "Sheboygan Press Media", "description": "Attorney Rick Esenberg presents at John Michael Kohler Art Center for Law Day", "title": "'Advocate at heart' attorney speaks at Law Day", "url": "http://www.sheboyganpress.com/story/news/2016/05/05/advocate-heart-attorney-speaks-law-day/83990528/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sheboyganpress.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Attorney Rick Esenberg presents at John Michael Kohler Art Center for Law Day", "title": "'Advocate at heart' attorney speaks at Law Day", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3df2026b7628e53284a28ce91129fc326b962e2/c=237-0-2027-1790&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/05/WIGroup/Sheboygan/635980689738377107-she-n-Law-Day-0505-gck-01.JPG", "creator": "@sheboyganpress", "site": "@sheboyganpress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=879193382", "fb": {"app_id": 140019942719126}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0930\"", "article_summary": "Law Day celebrates the rule of law and recognizes the role of courts in our democracy and the contributions of the legal system to freedom.\nIn addition to Esenberg\u2019s presentation, Sheriff Todd Priebe was recognized as the Law Day Volunteer of the Year.\nThe event marked Sheboygan Circuit Court Judge James Bolgert\u2019s final law day before he steps down from the bench at the end of July.\nEsenberg, president and general counsel for the conservative public interest law firm Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, touched on what he believes to be an overreach of governmental power that was never intended to exist.\nHe explained that too often we view the disagreement over the definition of constitutional liberty as \u201ca battle between forces of light and darkness.\u201dBuy Photo Atty."}
