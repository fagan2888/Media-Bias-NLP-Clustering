President Obama’s appeal to youth supporters to enroll through his health-care law’s marketplaces is a hollow effort, according to Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus.

“What the Obamacare package is is it was intentionally designed to screw over young people,” he said on Fox News on Thursday. “It wasn’t a mistake; it wasn’t an accident — it was a package intentionally designed to screw over young people.”

Priebus rejected the president’s claims that Republicans haven’t offered alternatives to health-care reforms, citing a number of past examples, including Representative Tom Price’s (R., Ga.); he also mentioned an open-pricing model or health-insurance pools, among other ideas. These have never had a fair hearing, Priebus stated, because Democrats aren’t willing to budge on anything but their own plan.

“What the Democrats are arguing today to the American people is that it’s either European health care or nothing,” he added.
