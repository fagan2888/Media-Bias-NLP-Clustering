Additionally, the legislation would repeal Obamacare\u2019s annual limits on flexible savings account contributions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to allow women the ability to make their own decisions about safe, effective, and long-established methods of contraception,\u201d Gardner said.\n\n\u201cMost other drugs with such a long history of safe and routine use are available for purchase over the counter, and contraception should join them,\u201d he added. \u201cMaking this medication available over the counter would increase access in rural and underserved areas, save consumers money by increasing competition and availability, and save women time by increasing the ease of getting the safe contraception they need.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur legislation will help increase women\u2019s access to safe and effective contraceptives and further empower women to make their own health care decisions,\u201d adds Ayotte. \u201cIn addition, our bill restores the ability of Health Savings Accounts and Flexible Spending Accounts to be used to purchase over-the-counter medications, giving women more purchasing power.\u201d\n\nSens. Dean Heller, Joni Ernst, Richard Burr, Ron Johnson, and Thom Tillis are co-sponsoring the legislation.\n\nDuring their campaigns for the U.S. Senate last year, Gardner and Tillis provoked the ire of abortion heavyweights NARAL, Planned Parenthood, and Emily\u2019s List by turning the tables on Democrats who are eager to cast Republican candidates as members of the \u201cwar on women\u201d brigade who would repeal Obamacare and take away \u201cfree\u201d birth control for women.\n\nGardner and Tillis responded by advocating for OTC birth control \u2013 available without a prescription and, consequently, without Obamacare providing it. The two candidates presented the economic argument that birth control pills could be even more accessible \u2013 and less expensive \u2013 if women could purchase them without having to obtain a doctor\u2019s prescription. Obamacare\u2019s requirement of full coverage of birth control in health insurance plans requires a prescription and, as a result, would keep the cost of the contraceptives rising for taxpayers who foot the bill for the \u201cfree\u201d birth control.\n\nSince pro-abortion groups are reaping many benefits from Obamacare\u2019s so-called \u201cfree\u201d contraceptives, the argument presented by Gardner and Tillis sent them into a tailspin, and when the two Republicans won their Senate races, the wounded organizations said they would hold them accountable to their stance of making birth control available over the counter.\n\nWhile the economic argument of lowering costs of contraceptives by having them available over-the-counter may carry weight, the choice of which oral contraceptives are \u201csafe and effective for routine OTC use\u201d is an issue that may need to be addressed.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in April, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), observed that \u201ca link exists between hormonal contraception and breast cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe World Health Organization declared forms of birth control pills\u2026as Group I carcinogens\u2013and it makes biological sense,\u201d she added.\n\nAdditionally, a recent study published by the journal Human Brain Mapping, found the use of the combination form of birth control pills to be associated with significantly lower cortical thickness in certain brain structures believed to be important in the response to emotional stimuli.\n\nThe authors of the study noted that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, oral contraceptives \u201care used by the majority of women in the United States for at least one period of time during their reproductive years and are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for pediatric use\u201d after the onset of the first menstrual period.\n\n\u201cSome women experience negative emotional side effects from taking oral contraceptive pills, although the scientific findings investigating that have been mixed,\u201d the study\u2019s co-author, Nicole Petersen, a neuroscientist at UCLA, recently told The Huffington Post. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible that this change in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex may be related to the emotional changes that some women experience when using birth control pills.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the reaction of study co-author Larry Cahill of the University of California-Irvine was most revealing, when he told Catholic News Agency he was amazed at the lack of research on birth control pills, considering they have been taken by many women for half a century to prevent pregnancy.\n\n\u201cYou might think after 50 years and hundreds of millions of women taking various incarnations of the pill, there would be a large and cohesive and impressive body of evidence on it, but there\u2019s next to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly find that amazing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sens.
