Rick Scott, a Republican, who had changed his mind in the past on whether to support any such enlargement but was firmly opposed this time.\n\nOne after another, opponents of the bill stood in the House chamber and called the measure an example of federal overreach, a too-expensive entitlement program and an offspring of President Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nThe vote in the House was 72 to 41 against the measure, with all 37 Democrats and four Republicans voting yes. It was a far different outcome from the one in the Senate, which solidly backed the plan in a 33-to-3 vote on Wednesday.\n\nThe Florida Health Insurance Affordability Exchange would have used more than $18 billion over 10 years in federal funds to expand the pool of low-income Floridians eligible for health insurance and help them buy it from private providers.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, House Republicans, using their 81-to-39 majority and an almost uniform opposition to using federal dollars to broaden the pool of patients covered under Medicaid, criticized the new plan, calling it nothing more than Medicaid expansion under another name.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something we cannot afford, not only in Florida but in the rest of the nation, if we have government controlled health care,\u201d said Representative Doug Broxson, a Republican in the Third District, in the Florida Panhandle. \u201cHistory tells us that anything the government is involved in tends to expand. I\u2019m very concerned that we could spend all our gross national product on health care, and it would take away from every other program we have in the state.\u201d\n\nFlorida is one of 22 states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCensus Bureau figures show that 4.8 million Floridians, or 24.2 percent of the state\u2019s population, are uninsured, compared with 15.3 percent nationally.\n\nRejection of the bill came despite an appeal from the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Jason Furman, who argued in a report issued by his office on Thursday that a vote to expand Medicaid coverage in Florida \u201cwould have major health benefits for its low-income citizens.\u201d The report said that Florida\u2019s price tag for uncompensated care would be $790 million lower in 2016 if expanded coverage were fully in effect.\n\nThe bill\u2019s failure means that its proponents will not have another chance to expand coverage until next year. The vote came during a special session, scheduled to end on June 20, that was called to prepare and vote on a budget.\n\nGovernor Scott, who is allied with Republicans in the House, is in a dispute with Republicans in the Senate over a separate $1 billion that Florida will lose by July if Medicaid is not expanded. That money is part of a program that helps public hospitals pay for the unreimbursed cost of patients who cannot pay their bills, and legislators are trying to find ways to make up the shortfall.\n\nDuring Friday\u2019s hearing before the vote, Representative Shevrin D. Jones, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Broward County, waved off Republicans\u2019 objections to what they derisively called Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWho cares what care it is?\u201d he asked. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re taking care of the people.\u201d\n\nMr. Jones went on to recount how in 2009, before he became a lawmaker, he suffered a blood clot and was found to have Protein S deficiency. Since he was uninsured, his parents covered the $37,000 cost of his hospitalization and treatment, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to those individuals who can\u2019t afford that?\u201d Mr. Jones asked in a telephone interview during the hearing. \u201cWhat happens when they can\u2019t go get themselves checked?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCharly Norton, the executive director of the independent advocacy group FloridaStrong, said in an email that the vote was \u201cyet another example of representatives choosing senseless political games over Florida families.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150605205035, "twitter": {"description": "It was the third time that legislators had considered and spurned some version of health
