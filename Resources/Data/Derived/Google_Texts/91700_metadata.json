Yet Peters has hope. The president\u2019s unilateral delays in Obamacare mandates have eased planned layoffs by local governments and businesses.

Her new treatment may not take into account out-of-pocket costs. If her drugs are off the formulary, then [an ACA-mandated cost cap on out-of-pocket drug costs] doesn\u2019t apply.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I do not receive my medication, I will die,\u201d worries Boonstra, who was invited to the State of the Union address as the guest of Representative Tim Walberg (R., Mich.). \u201cI believed the president when he said I could keep my health-insurance plan. I feel lied to. Congressman Peters, your decision to vote for Obamacare jeopardized my health.\u201d\n\nPeters and the media have come out swinging, claiming Boonstra is a right-wing Koch-brothers tool (the Kochs donate to AFP).
