Q: Why is it a struggle for me to cut back on sugar in my diet?

A: If you have discovered that sugar has an unexpected hold on you, you are not alone. The game is rigged in sugar’s favor for three main reasons: We are born to like it, it is everywhere, and it is addictive.

We taste sugar and our pleasure sensors fire like crazy. When our ancestors were running around in loincloths, that genetic predisposition helped them survive, as sweet foods provided valuable energy and were less likely to be poisonous than bitter foods.

Now, sugar is everywhere, and Americans are downing a lot of it, on average nearly 17 teaspoons daily. Our ancestors might find it odd that now we have to hunt to find a packaged food that doesn’t have added sugar.

On top of that, more and more research reveals that sugar stimulates the brain and causes dependence and withdrawal the same way addictive drugs do. This doesn’t mean you have to shun sugar altogether or that bringing cupcakes to school is akin to giving cocaine to a bunch of fourth-graders. But it may be helpful to think of sugar as we do alcohol: Most people can enjoy it in moderation without harm, but it could be a danger when overdone or to those with addictive tendencies.
