Ben Sasse of Nebraska acknowledged what is plainly true: if the Supreme Court\u2019s GOP justices gut the Affordable Care Act, the impact on many families\u2019 lives will be devastating: \u201dChemotherapy turned off for perhaps 12,000 people, dialysis going dark for 10,000. The horror stories will be real.\u201d\n\nNaturally, Sasse\u2019s op-ed blames the Obama administration. \u201cHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell claimed in Senate testimony earlier this month that the administration has no plan to help the seven million citizens who could lose their coverage in the weeks following such a ruling,\u201d he complained.\n\nThis is a surprisingly familiar tack. Congressional Republicans are outraged that the White House has not yet unveiled a backup plan on what to do if the Supreme Court takes a sledgehammer to the American health care system. The whining is built on a curious foundation \u2013 Republicans used to say, \u201cWe\u2019re outraged you reformed the healthcare system.\u201d Now these same Republicans are adding, \u201cWe\u2019re also outraged you didn\u2019t create a backup plan for what happens after we tear down the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all the more reason to take note of President Obama\u2019s response to the GOP criticisms.\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Monday said he thinks there is no \u201cplausible legal basis\u201d for the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down a key plank of Obamacare, defending his administration\u2019s lack of a contingency plan. [\u2026] \u201cLook, this should be a pretty straightforward case of statutory interpretation,\u201d Obama said.\n\nIn the same Reuters interview, the president added, \u201cThere is, in our view, not a plausible legal basis for striking it down. And what if the Supreme Court takes an implausible path?\n\n\u201cIf they rule against us, we\u2019ll have to take a look at what our options are. But I\u2019m not going to anticipate that. I\u2019m not going to anticipate bad law,\u201d Obama told Reuters.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfectly defensible posture. There\u2019s no reason for this president \u2013 or any president, really \u2013 to craft sweeping policy proposals in anticipation of ridiculous court rulings that defy the law, history, and common sense. Health care reform is extraordinarily difficult; the notion that the White House will just whip together a new plan to cover 7 million consumers, presumably without congressional approval, is plainly silly.\n\nIndeed, it takes a breathtaking amount of chutzpah for Republicans to demand an \u201cObamacare Plan B\u201d from the president and his team in the first place. GOP lawmakers want to set fire to the nation\u2019s health care system and they want a White House plan to put the fire out? Please.\n\nBut there\u2019s also a legal strategy at play.\n\nAdministration officials insist that any steps they could take to prepare for the potential crisis would be politically unworkable and ineffective, and that pursuing them would wrongly signal to the justices that reasonable solutions existed. The do-nothing strategy is meant to reinforce for the court what White House officials believe: that a loss in the health care case would be unavoidably disastrous for millions of people.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Republicans are now effectively telling Obama, \"We're outraged you didn't create a backup plan for what happens after we tear down the healthcare system.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-balks-health-care-backup-plan", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Republicans are now effectively telling Obama, \"We're outraged you didn't create a backup plan for what happens after we tear down the healthcare system.\"", "title": "Obama balks at health care backup plan", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-balks-health-care-backup-plan", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/ob4.jpeg?itok=0TBMDOpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-balks-health-care-backup-plan", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/ob4.jpeg?itok=kRbbbOwT", "height": 553}, "title": "Obama balks at health care backup plan", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Republicans are now effectively telling Obama, \"We're outraged you didn't create a backup plan for what happens after we tear down the healthcare system.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-04T09:20:27-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Obama balks at health care backup plan", "tags": "affordable-care-act,barack-obama,health,health-care,health-care-reform,obamacare,supreme-court,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "03/04/2015 09:20:27 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/obama-balks-health-care-backup-plan"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Republicans are now effectively telling Obama, \"We're outraged you didn't create a backup plan for what happens after we tear down the healthcare system.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, Health Care, Obamacare, Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "GOP lawmakers want to set fire to the nation\u2019s health care system and they want a White House plan to put the fire out?\nCongressional Republicans are outraged that the White House has not yet unveiled a backup plan on what to do if the Supreme Court takes a sledgehammer to the American health care system.\nHealth care reform is extraordinarily difficult; the notion that the White House will just whip together a new plan to cover 7 million consumers, presumably without congressional approval, is plainly silly.\nThe do-nothing strategy is meant to reinforce for the court what White House officials believe: that a loss in the health care case would be unavoidably disastrous for millions of people.\nAnd what if the Supreme Court takes an implausible path?"}
