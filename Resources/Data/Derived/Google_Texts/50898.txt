Iowa Health Insurance Marketplace- Premium Tax Credits

The above rates reflect the premium prices before any cost-sharing or premium tax credits, which may further decrease healthcare costs for eligible consumers. The actual premium amount that Iowa residents will be responsible for will depend on their household income.

The premium tax credits cap the cost of health insurance at two to 9.5 percent of the household income for enrollees for households with income up to 400 percent above the federal poverty line (FPL).
