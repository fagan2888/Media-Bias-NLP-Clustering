Two federal courts of appeals have issued conflicting rulings about how to interpret Congress\u2019 poorly chosen words. And while the more favorable ruling seems likely to prevail, the act is still in grave danger. That\u2019s because even the more favorable one leaves it up to the executive to decide which interpretation of the Act is correct. That means that while Obamacare might seem safe for now, a future president could interpret the act in a way that would destroy it.\n\nThe problem revolves around the subsidies the act provides to help people buy health insurance. A poorly drafted provision, it says that subsidies are available to people who buy insurance on a healthcare exchange \u201cestablished by [a] state.\u201d Read in isolation, this language suggests that subsidies are not available to people who buy insurance on HealthCare.gov, the exchange run by the federal government in states that have not created an exchange. That\u2019s 36 states, so the point makes a big difference to whether the act can work.\n\nThe act also, however, contains other language that leaves room for a different reading. It says that if a state does not create an exchange, the federal government will establish and operate \u201csuch exchange\u201d within the state. This language (along with some other, rather opaque provisions) creates the possibility that the federal exchange is, for purposes of the act, deemed an exchange \u201cestablished by [a] state.\u201d The IRS adopted this reading when it promulgated regulations allowing subsidies to people who buy insurance through HealthCare.gov.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear why Congress wrote the statute this way. Probably it\u2019s just a mistake \u2014 the sort of thing that happens all the time when a huge statute is passed. Normally, it would be fixed by a \u201cTechnical Corrections\u201d bill. But obviously the Republicans are not going to let an \u201cObamacare Corrections Bill\u201d get through Congress. So we\u2019re stuck with the act as drafted.\n\nThe statute therefore presents a classic clash between statutory interpretation philosophies. On the one hand, some of the statutory text could be read, narrowly and literally, to say that subsidies are available only in states that run their own exchanges. On the other hand, Congress can\u2019t have intended that result. The subsidies are critical to the success of the whole statutory scheme. Congress can\u2019t have intended to let individual states destroy the act by choosing not to create exchanges.\n\nWhat is a court to do when statutory text conflicts with likely legislative intent? Some \u201ctextualist\u201d judges believe that a court\u2019s job is simply to read the statutory text and do what it says, even if what it says seems silly. That\u2019s what the D.C. Circuit did last month. It said that \u201cestablished by [a] state\u201d means \u201cestablished by [a] state,\u201d and it prohibited the IRS from allowing subsidies to people who buy insurance on HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe 4th Circuit refused to read that one phrase in isolation. Also ruling last month, the 4th Circuit saw ambiguity in the statutory text. The 4th Circuit concluded that while the statute could be read to prohibit giving subsidies to people who buy health insurance on HealthCare.gov, it could also be read to allow them.\n\nThe 4th Circuit therefore invoked a tie-breaking principle established by the Supreme Court in the 1980s: Where statutory language is ambiguous, a court should uphold the interpretation given to the statute by the federal agency that administers it, as long as that interpretation is reasonable. Here, the 4th Circuit found the IRS\u2019s interpretation to be reasonable in light of the vital role that subsidies play in the overall statutory scheme.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember those conflicting court rulings about the ACA?
