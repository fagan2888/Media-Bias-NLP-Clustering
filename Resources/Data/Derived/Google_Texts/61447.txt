Friday the 13th became a lucky day for the Lorain County Free Clinic when it received a donation of $15,300 to help pay for medicine and health care for its patients.

The group 100 Guys Who Care About Lorain County donated a packet of checks their members gave as part of its quarterly donation program.

We rely on the generosity of the entire community to help our mission and support our work in providing medical care to the most vulnerable in Lorain County, said Paul Baumgartner Jr., executive director of the Free Clinic.

The center is a grassroots, volunteer-driven organization that offers medical care, prescription drugs and ways to help people get well, he said.

To do that is always a challenge, particularly working in health care, working in Lorain County, and so the need to provide care comes at a cost, he said. Donations like this truly make it sustainable and possible.

On Feb. 13, Baumgartner gathered with clinic board President Ed Ruth and Medical Director Dr. Don Sheldon to receive the donation presented by 100 Guys members Jim Leone and Spencer Ryan.

The 100 Guys formed in 2014 and is modeled after the group 100 Women Who Care About Lorain County, which started in August 2010.

Members of both groups meet quarterly to give money to Lorain County charitable organizations.

The concept is wicked easy, Ryan said.

Having 100 members who each donate $100 adds up to $10,000 a quarter, an amount that has an immediate helpful effect in the community, Ryan said.

For the 100 guys, members meet for about an hour to nominate good causes, then pick three of those in a random drawing.

The members who nominate each cause then make a brief presentation about why it would a worthy recipient.

Sheldon, who suggested the Free Clinic, recounted how he and other members stood on a chair to make their cases for each nominee.

The members have an anonymous vote to pick the charity. Then they write their checks.

Organizations can win once a year, and those not selected can be nominated again.

The less moving parts, the better, Leone said. Its very quick, its to the point and its very beneficial to the organization thats chosen that evening.

In January, the group had 80 members who donated. Leone and Ryan credited Sheldon for donating, along with Dan Klimas, president of Lorain National Bank. Once the group topped $10,000, another donor added $5,000, for a total of $15,300.

The 100 Guys members also noted the 100 Women group donated $10,000 to the Free Clinic this quarter, for a total of $25,300 given for charitable health care in the county in 2015.

The Free Clinic started in 1986 and began serving the community in March 1987. It is located in the basement of Christ Lutheran Church, 3323 Pearl Ave. in South Lorain, with office hours at three other locations in Lorain, Elyria and Oberlin.

In 2014, the clinic logged 2,600 primary care patient visits and more than 7,000 medical service encounters with a rotating staff of 36 physicians and nurse practitioners, along with 75 specialists available for appointments.

The free clinic has an annual budget of about $380,000 a year and supplies about $3.6 million worth of health care a year, Baumgartner said.

The reputation of the clinic is one of the reasons it was selected, Sheldon said.

One, is that its been here a long time doing its mission, he said. We know its value. We know it works.

The Affordable Care Act does not supplant the need for a free clinic, Sheldon said. People think the need for these things is going away, he said.

Before the Affordable Care Act, about 85 percent of the population had some form of health care coverage, Sheldon said.

With the ACA, it is projected about 95 percent of people will get coverage, Sheldon said.

But that means 5 percent of people wont have health insurance, and using the estimated percentages, Lorain County could have 15,000 or more people without health coverage among the countys population of about 300,000 people, Sheldon said.

Even when the Affordable Care Act is optimally implemented, they still need care, he said.

Some people qualified for Medicaid based on broader criteria for coverage, but they may not qualify again when that coverage is up for renewal, Baumgartner said.

The 100 Guys first recipient was Genesis House Domestic Violence Center of Lorain County.

100 Guys will meet again at 7 p.m. April 9 at Quaker Steak & Lube in Sheffield Village, 4900 Transportation Drive. Leone said he hopes to grow 100 guys to 250 members.
