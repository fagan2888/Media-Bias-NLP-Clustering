Defense Secretary Ashton Carter is detailing the commitment to counter Russian aggression and the threat from ISIS. He is meeting with his NATO counterparts in Europe. Carter sat down with CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan for an interview you'll see only on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nISIS online\n\nThe U.S. is struggling with ISIS on two fronts: on the ground in the Middle East, where it has deployed more troops, and in the online world, which is creating a supply of real-world fighters for the ISIS cause. Its abilities online are formidable.\n\nJames Horner\n\nHollywood is remembering one of its greatest composers, James Horner. He died yesterday at the age of 61 in a Southern California plane crash. His small plane went down in a remote area north of Santa Barbara, triggering a brush fire. \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Charlie Rose reports the two-time Oscar winner composed music for more than 100 movies, resulting in some of Hollywood's most iconic soundtracks.\n\nShifting views\n\nAs the Supreme Court prepares to announce its ruling on same-sex marriage, a CBS News/New York Times poll shows 54 percent of Americans think there should be a federal law regarding same-sex marriage. Thirty percent of those who now support legalizing it say they once held the opposite view.\n\nSCOTUS v Obamacare\n\nAs early as this week, the Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling that could radically change -- and perhaps even doom -- Obamacare. The case the justices are mulling, King v. Burwell, poses a legal challenge to the tax credits offered to consumers in 34 states who bought health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's federally run exchanges. About 6 million people in those states who used the government program to buy insurance could lose their subsidies.\n\nSpreading plague\n\nThe case of a Colorado teenager who died this month of a rare case of plague has revived concerns about a disease many people wrongly assume died out in the Middle Ages. How is this modern day plague spread, and where does it come from?\n\nSinging vampire\n\nThe singer-actress Kat Graham says she's into everything from the 1990s -- from the era's music and films to the models and fashion. So it's no surprise that her upcoming album will feature '90s-inspired songs that tap into Graham's musical influences: Madonna, Prince, Boyz II Men and TLC. Now the Vampire Diaries actress is readying all-new material.\n\nFood and Finance High\n\nEighty New York City high school seniors found their passion in the kitchen instead of the classroom. They take their next steps Wednesday after studying at Food and Finance High School, where 80 percent of students are considered \"economically disadvantaged.\" CBS News Correspondent Michelle Miller reports on how their future is heating up.\n\nWorld\n\nISIS operative killed in U.S. airstrike\n\nExtreme heat wave kills hundreds in Pakistan\n\nThis pic made astronaut Scott Kelly do a double take\n\nPolitics\n\nLawsuit challenging presidential debate rules\n\n2016 hopefuls react to Nikki Haley's call to more Confederate flag\n\nU.S.\n\nSevere weather sweeps through 3 Midwest states\n\nU.S. women advance in World Cup with 2-0 win over Colombia\n\nTar from central California oil spill washes up in L.A. area\n\nDiddy arrested on assault charge at UCLA\n\nMoney Watch\n\nWalmart to remove items with Confederate flag\n\n7 things debt collectors aren't allowed to do\n\nShould you hitch a ride with a stretched-out car loan?\n\nSummer jobs and tax questions\n\nHealth\n\nClimate change poses \"medical emergency\"\n\nHow skinny jeans landed a fashion victim in the hospital", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter details U.S. plans to beef up NATO&#039;s deterrent against Moscow, and new polling shows shifting views on same-sex marriage", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-june-23-2015/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/05/24/f7612c6a-a413-4c4c-a9a9-e9f4fe462b03/thumbnail/1200x630/acf7f0d78549caa103c7be4fa804ac1c/gettyimages-472437768.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter details U.S. plans to beef up NATO's deterrent against Moscow, and new polling shows shifting views on same-sex marriage", "title": "This Morning from CBS News, June 23, 2015"}, "twitter": {"description": "Defense Secretary Ashton Carter details U.S. plans to beef up NATO's deterrent against Moscow, and new polling shows shifting views on same-sex marriage", "title": "This Morning from CBS News, June 23, 2015", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-june-23-2015/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-june-23-2015/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-june-23-2015/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/05/24/f7612c6a-a413-4c4c-a9a9-e9f4fe462b03/thumbnail/1200x630/acf7f0d78549caa103c7be4fa804ac1c/gettyimages-472437768.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-june-23-2015/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/this-morning-from-cbs-news-june-23-2015/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda457\"", "article_summary": "Carter sat down with CBS News correspondent Margaret Brennan for an interview you'll see only on \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\"CBS This Morning\" co-host Charlie Rose reports the two-time Oscar winner composed music for more than 100 movies, resulting in some of Hollywood's most iconic soundtracks.\nAshton CarterThis morning, the U.S. military is pledging weapons, aircraft and commandos as part of a new rapid reaction force in Europe.\nCBS News Correspondent Michelle Miller reports on how their future is heating up.\nSummer jobs and tax questionsHealthClimate change poses \"medical emergency\"How skinny jeans landed a fashion victim in the hospital"}
