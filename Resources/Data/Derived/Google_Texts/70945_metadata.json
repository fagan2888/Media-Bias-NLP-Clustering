She said the decision was based on predicted future needs.\n\n\u201cEmergency medicine physicians are in great demand,\" she said, \"and difficult to recruit.\u201d\n\nFlorida will be short nearly 7,000 doctors by 2025 if more residency programs are not created throughout the state to keep up with demand, according to a recent study by teaching and safety-net hospitals.\n\nFlorida ranks 42nd out of the 50 states in the number of residency positions per capita. That has led many Florida medical school graduates to complete their training in other states. Once done, they often decline to return to Florida --- where they are badly needed.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was meant to enroll more people into healthcare plans so they wouldn\u2019t end up in the emergency rooms for primary care, Carroll said. But there is a rise in the number of elderly patients presenting at emergency rooms with heart attacks, strokes and age-related illnesses.\n\nThe new residency programs will start in 2017. The expansion is part of an effort by the Hospital Corporation of America\u2019s North Florida Division, parent company of Ocala Health, and the University of Central Florida College of Medicine to increase the number of residencies and fellowships in Florida.\n\nThere is a gap between what healthcare is offering patients and what patients will need in the coming years, Carroll said, \u201cand it\u2019s that gap we\u2019re trying to fill.\u201d\n\nThe expansion is just the latest change in Marion's ever-changing healthcare industry. Local experts say the changes create a perpetual race to adapt to market forces.\n\nIn the economic marketplace, Marion County\u2019s healthcare industry is the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the room. Marion\u2019s three hospitals -- Munroe Regional Medical Center, Ocala Regional and West Marion \u2013 combined employ more than 4,600 people. That does not include peripheral businesses and workers who benefit financially because of those large institutions.\n\nMunroe, with 421 beds, provides more than 5,000 jobs and has a countywide economic impact of more than $500 million, one 2010 University of Florida study showed.\n\nOcala Regional and West Marion have a combined annual economic impact of more than $220 million and relationships with nearly 500 physicians.\n\nOn the periphery of the hospitals are dozens of medical offices, imaging centers, specialized care facilities and doctor offices.\n\nIn Marion, 27 percent of the 340,000 or so residents are 65 or older. Hundreds of millions of Medicare dollars flow through the county each year.\n\nThe medical industry in the area is such an economic heavyweight that the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity predicts a 21 percent increase in healthcare job growth between 2014 and 2022 in Marion, Levy and Citrus counties.\n\nThere are nearly 2,000 registered nurses in Marion County alone, with an expected demand of 360 more in the next five years, according to Chmura Economics and Analytics.\n\nThe demand for nursing assistants will be similar, with that field expected to see an average annual growth of 1.7 percent. The medical assistant field will grow 2.7 percent; vocational nurses will grow 2.0 percent per year; and personal care aides 3.5 percent.\n\nThe growth is happening over a broad spectrum of the industry and the spectrum will continue to change as hospitals grow. Some of that change is happening as hospitals create partnerships or buy doctor\u2019s clinics, build stand-alone emergency facilities, and buy or partner with imaging and treatment centers. The number of walk-in clinics also is on the rise.\n\nAnd they are all competing for market share.\n\nSome of the changes have been happening for years and the result of economic pressures. Ocala Health CEO Randy McVay said hospitals have been aligning themselves with primary care offices for years, taking over the business side of those operations. Those relationships have become so common that hospitals have staff just to oversee those partnerships, he said.\n\nThe hospitals provide office staff with financial and retirement benefits, clerical help and insurance. And in return, the hospital gains \u201canother access point to the community,\u201d McVay said.\n\nIt\u2019s happening across the country as well as in Marion County. And there is still potential for growth with similar partnerships, McVay said. Hospitals also are looking to partner with other specialized service centers such as catheterization labs and imaging centers.\n\nThe medical industry is also changing in that hospitals are building stand-alone emergency centers, McVay said. But the facilities don\u2019t come cheap, costing about $10 million. Ocala Health is building an emergency center in Summerfield. It will be operational in early 2016. Munroe already operates Timber Ridge Medical Center.\n\nMcVay said that, if placed at convenient locations, stand-alone emergency facilities will be popular, especially for seniors who may have driving limits.\n\nMany people who don\u2019t have primary care doctors still use emergency rooms to get access to medical care, McVay said. Some of them wind up in stand-alone emergency facilities.\n\nAnother change in the medical industry is the growing popularity of walk-in clinics. There are 20 in Marion County, including two affiliated with Ocala Health.\n\nDr. Larry Popeil, an Ocala family practitioner, said walk-in clinics are popular with patients who need medical care after their doctor\u2019s offices have closed, especially during evenings and weekends.\n\nPopeil said walk-in clinics are good for treating minor ailments that warrant medical care but aren't bad enough to require an emergency room visit. The problem is that while these clinics are staffed with qualified medical personnel, there is no follow-up care comparable to what a primary care physician would provide, Popeil said.\n\nHe predicts walk-in clinics will become more popular with patients and eventually take some business away from traditional primary care offices that are staffed with one or two doctors.\n\nThe long-term result of all this? McVay said hospitals in the next 30 years will be left treating the acutely ill. Everyone else will be going to clinics, doctor\u2019s office, stand-alone facilities offering specialized care, stand-alone emergency rooms, and walk-in clinics.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re evolving to,\u201d he said.\n\nPopeil predicts that in time that many doctor\u2019s offices will be replaced with multi-functional clinics staffed with fewer doctors and more nurse practitioners and physician assistants. It will mean patients will not always get to see the same healthcare provider or doctors, and thus won't be able to create strong caregiver-patient relationships.\n\nBut regardless of how and where health care is provided, the industry will need qualified staff to do it. Faye Peraza, vice president of human resources at Munroe Regional Medical Center, said there is a constant search for skilled healthcare providers to staff hospitals and satellite facilities. Especially needed are nurses.\n\nThe demand is so great that she has to recruit nurses from outside the area. \u201cIt\u2019s very tough. We\u2019ve exhausted our market here,\u201d Peraza said.\n\nThe medical community is also encouraging healthcare professionals to be as efficient as possible in their work, Peraza said.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t see the healthcare industry, locally at least, waning anytime soon.\n\n\u201cIn healthcare I think we\u2019re still into growth. We will always need registrars. We will always need case managers,\u201d she said.\n\nMany people are leaving other industries, getting healthcare training, and joining this profession, she said. The problem is that many do it because their former career fields have shrunk and because of the potential financial rewards that the health profession offers.\n\nAs a result, Peraza said, there is a \u201cskills gap,\u201d with some nurses, for example, maybe less dedicated than in previous years.\n\n\u201cYou have people who became nurses because it made (financial) sense,\u201d she said.\n\nLaura Byrnes, CareerSource Citrus levy Marion communications manager, said healthcare \u201cis one of our targeted industries.\u201d\n\nEmployers also posts job openings with CareerSource.\n\nSeven of the 10 top employers by job opening advertisements are in the healthcare industry, she said. Community Health System (which leases Munroe) posts the most healthcare company jobs, followed by HCA (which owns Ocala Regional and West Marion) and Citrus Memorial Hospital in Inverness.\n\nIn Marion County alone there are 56 healthcare employers listed with 941 open positions in CareerSource\u2019s jobs listing system, Byrnes said earlier this month.\n\nCareerSource works closely with the local hospitals in helping job seekers get the certifications they need to find work, she said. Of the 164 CareerSource clients enrolled in the organization\u2019s education/training programs during August, 78 percent were getting medical training, she said.\n\nCareerSource also provides employees in target fields, such as healthcare, generous financial packages to continue their training or obtain licenses.\n\n\u201cMoreover, we work with scores of employers with hundreds and hundreds of jobs in the healthcare industry,\u201d she said. \u201cHealthcare \u2026remained robust here during and in the wake of the Great Recession, and as recently as January and February, the industry reported 24-25 percent job growth gains.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the healthcare (market),\u201d Byrnes said, \u201cit\u2019s been very, very solid.\u201d\n\nReach Fred Hiers at fred.hiers@starbanner.com and 352-867-4157.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just a year after getting its internal medicine residency program off the ground, Ocala Health has announced that it will expand the program to include residency programs in emergency medicine and general surgery.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-65450546-3970-4FD5-9F2C-EBE4A5C509A0-pubOS"}, "og": {"site_name": "Ocala.com", "description": "Just a year after getting its internal medicine residency program off the ground, Ocala Health has announced that it will expand the program to include residency programs in emergency medicine and general surgery.", "title": "Ocala Health to expand residency program", "url": "http://www.ocala.com/article/20151026/articles/151029867", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.gainesville.com/global/images/fb/OS.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 160}, "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20151026, "fb": {"admins": 100004135120432, "app_id": 162010827183725}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-151029867-pubOS"}}, "keywords": "OCALA (FL),  Article"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1787\"", "article_summary": "Just a year after getting its internal medicine residency program off the ground, Ocala Health has announced that it will expand the program to include residency programs in emergency medicine and general surgery.\nHundreds of medical school graduates applied for the internal medicine residency program when it opened a year ago at Ocala Health's two hospitals: Ocala Regional Medical Center and West Marion Community Hospital.\n\u201cMoreover, we work with scores of employers with hundreds and hundreds of jobs in the healthcare industry,\u201d she said.\nMany people who don\u2019t have primary care doctors still use emergency rooms to get access to medical care, McVay said.\nSeven of the 10 top employers by job opening advertisements are in the healthcare industry, she said."}
