The Associated Press\n\nThe latest numbers for sign-ups through the federal health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act show the government is just a quarter of the way to its goal of 9 million enrollees.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office originally predicted 2015 open enrollment \u2013 the second round of enrollment under the law \u2013 would bring 13 million sign-ups. Days before sign-ups began on Nov. 15, officials with the Department of Health & Human Services projected enrollments to reach between 9 and 9.9 million.\n\nThe department's latest release of Web traffic for HealthCare.gov and sign-ups through the site counts stats through Friday, while Monday was the first deadline for sign-ups. Enrollees needed to select a plan before that day to have coverage at the beginning of 2015, although the period for open enrollment doesn't actually end until Feb. 15.\n\nOf the 2.5 million people who have picked a plan, 1 million did so during the week that ended Friday \u2013 the fourth week of open enrollment. Officials expected sign-ups to surge leading up to the deadline, as they did last year.\n\nBut the administration is still far off from its projection. At the close of the fourth week, it was 25 percent of the way to 9 million enrollees, with nearly 2.5 million plans selected. However, applications for more than 4 million consumers seeking coverage have been submitted so far.\n\n\n\nLindsey Cook for USN&WR; Source: HHS\n\nWebsite traffic and call center volume in the fourth week, meanwhile, were similar to the first week of open enrollment. It's likely the next release of traffic numbers will show a big spike as Americans rushed to finish selection in the last days before Monday.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "25% of 9 Million Goal Signed Up For Health Care in Federal Marketplace", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The administration is still a ways away from its enrollment goal.", "title": "2.5 Million Sign Up for Obamacare", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/12/16/25-of-9-million-goal-signed-up-for-health-care-in-federal-marketplace", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/bd/e9fb0080df202c4a162f052e03ace5/media:88d282fc302a4160830628d75de87dacHealthOverhaul.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The administration is still a ways away from its enrollment goal.", "card": "summary", "title": "25% of 9 Million Goal Signed Up For Health Care in Federal Marketplace"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lindsey Cook,Affordable Care Act,Pulse,DatamineHealthcare,health,health insurance,HHS,Data Mine [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The administration is still a ways away from its enrollment goal."}, "article_summary": "At the close of the fourth week, it was 25 percent of the way to 9 million enrollees, with nearly 2.5 million plans selected.\nOf the 2.5 million people who have picked a plan, 1 million did so during the week that ended Friday \u2013 the fourth week of open enrollment.\nThe Congressional Budget Office originally predicted 2015 open enrollment \u2013 the second round of enrollment under the law \u2013 would bring 13 million sign-ups.\nHealth and Human Services released the latest stats on health insurance sign-ups through HealthCare.gov on Tuesday.\nThe Associated PressThe latest numbers for sign-ups through the federal health insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act show the government is just a quarter of the way to its goal of 9 million enrollees."}
