Tuesday\u2019s threat referenced a law the Ukrainian parliament passed April 9 banning Communist and Nazi symbols. The law calls for a nationwide purge of Communist symbols, including statues of Soviet luminaries such as Vladimir Lenin, street names with Soviet references, the display of the hammer and sickle, and the playing of the Soviet national anthem.\n\nResponding to the bill, on April 11, a group of pro-Ukraine demonstrators tore down statues of Soviet leaders in Kharkiv. Ekozyants referenced the teardown in his Tuesday threats.\n\n\u201cTheir fate will be the same as the monuments they\u2019ve destroyed,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill\u2019s \u201cdecommunization\u201d measures have also sparked backlash from different quarters. Pro-Ukrainian opponents of the move say the measure is too financially costly and risks unnecessarily enflaming separatist violence.\n\n\u201cWe have real problems in this country like the war and a bad economy, but we\u2019re stuck talking about ideology,\u201d said Rostislav, a 28-year-old lawyer in Kharkiv. He is pro-Ukrainian and asked to not have his last name used due to security concerns.\n\n\u201cWe need money for things other than renaming cities and changing street signs,\u201d he said.\n\nRussia\u2019s top diplomat also criticized the law, claiming it could derail the fragile truce in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe constantly draw the attention of our partners to it. I think they realize how disastrous such activity of the Verkhovna Rada is for the peace process,\u201d Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said about the law Wednesday, according to UNIAN.\n\nWhile Nazi symbols are also banned under the law, Lavrov pointed to ban of Soviet symbols as evidence of a pro-Nazi movement in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI think they all understand that the continuation of the line on the glorification of the Nazis and de-glorification of real heroes of the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War has risks to undermine the Minsk process,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvocates of the law acknowledge the financial cost of decommunization, but say the prolific reminders of the U.S.S.R. degrade Ukrainians\u2019 sense of independence, ultimately leaving the country vulnerable to Russian propaganda.\n\n\u201cWe are at war,\u201d Ostap Kryvdyk, an adviser to the vice speaker of Ukraine\u2019s parliament and an advocate of the law, said in an interview. \u201cThe attack of Russia on Ukraine is not only a military attack, it is first and foremost an information attack that was started by the Soviet Union before and continued by Russia as the heir to the Soviet empire.\u201d\n\n\u201cEstablishing historical justice and paying tribute to the millions killed by hunger and executed in gulags is not a trivial thing,\u201d said Andriy Kohut, a member of the Center for Research on the Liberation Movement, in an interview with Euromaidan Press. \u201cOne cannot place bad roads, the currency rate and rising prices, and symbols, dignity, and a pursuit of justice on the same scale of an ideological discussion.\u201d\n\nResponding to questions about the law\u2019s timing amid a fragile cease-fire and weak economy, Kryvdyk said failed attempts to purge Ukraine of its Soviet past dating back to 1991 are to blame for the current conflict.\n\n\u201cThis is the time for change, since it is wartime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe destruction of the symbols is definitely traumatic. But if we don\u2019t try to resolve these issues today, they will bite later.\u201d\n\nKryvdyk also pushed back against worries that the move would enflame separatist violence.\n\n\u201cThose people are psychopaths who were looking for an excuse for their crimes,\u201d Kryvdyk said, referring to the Kharkiv Partisans threat. \u201cThey already wanted to kill Ukrainians.\u201d\n\nSoviet-era symbols have played a key role in the current Ukraine conflict, often serving as a dividing line between pro-Ukraine and pro-Russia factions.\n\nThe black and yellow St. George\u2019s Ribbon, which is a symbol for Soviet victory over Nazi Germany and was awarded as a military and civilian honor in the U.S.S.R., became a symbol for pro-Russia separatists in the current Ukraine conflict and is now banned in cities like Kharkiv.\n\nSoviet symbols are still prolific throughout Ukraine more than two decades after the fall of the U.S.S.R. The red star and the hammer and sickle still adorn many government buildings. Nearly every settlement in Ukraine has a monument dedicated to Soviet war dead in World War II, and major cities on the fringes of the conflict areas like Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Mariupol still have streets named after Vladimir Lenin, which, according to the new law, will have to be renamed.\n\nEven the name of Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine\u2019s fourth largest city with about 1 million residents, will have to be changed. In 1926 the city was named after Grigory Petrovsky, a Soviet bureaucrat who helped draft the Treaty of the Creation of the U.S.S.R. and was an organizer of the Ukrainian famine of 1932 to 1933.\n\nNotably, the bill also renamed the \u201cGreat Patriotic War\u201d as the \u201cSecond World War,\u201d abandoning a Soviet-era name for the war, which is still used in Russia, weeks before Moscow hosts world leaders on May 9 for the 70th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany.\n\nSome opponents claim the law is unfair to Ukraine\u2019s Red Army veterans who fought under the hammer and sickle in conflicts from World War II to Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cWe had Stalin, OK, that\u2019s our history,\u201d said Rostislav, whose grandfather died in World War II while serving in the Red Army. \u201cBut why should we rewrite our history and tell our children something different? We should just remember the people who died.\u201d\n\nKryvdyk acknowledged the law would be \u201ctraumatic\u201d for Ukraine\u2019s Red Army veterans, but said it was a strategic step to change Ukraine\u2019s political culture.\n\n\u201cWe will not change the consciousness of those who are 60 or even 40 years old,\u201d Kryvdyk said. \u201cBut we have a chance to change the symbolic future of those who are younger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A pro-Russian separatist group said it would execute Ukrainian civilians, underscoring worries that a recent law banning Soviet symbols may boost tensions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A pro-Russian separatist group said it would execute Ukrainian civilians, underscoring worries that a recent law banning Soviet symbols may boost tensions.", "title": "Ukraine Faces Backlash as it Tries to Purge Communist Past", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SovietsFeature.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-15T19:00:17+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1E2MDpw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A pro-Russian separatist group said it would execute Ukrainian civilians, underscoring worries that a recent law banning Soviet symbols may boost tensions.", "title": "Ukraine Faces Backlash as it Tries to Purge Communist Past", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/SovietsFeature.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "europe", "published_time": "2015-04-15T16:01:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-15T19:00:17+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ukraine, cease-fire, Russia, Putin, NATO, Lavrov, U.S. Army, Victory Day, May 9, World War II, Great Patriotic War"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd886a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe had Stalin, OK, that\u2019s our history,\u201d said Rostislav, whose grandfather died in World War II while serving in the Red Army.\nSoviet symbols are still prolific throughout Ukraine more than two decades after the fall of the U.S.S.R.\nWhile Nazi symbols are also banned under the law, Lavrov pointed to ban of Soviet symbols as evidence of a pro-Nazi movement in Ukraine.\nTuesday\u2019s threat referenced a law the Ukrainian parliament passed April 9 banning Communist and Nazi symbols.\nThe threat followed a Monday meeting in Berlin between delegates from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany to defuse the Ukraine conflict\u2019s recent uptick in violence."}
