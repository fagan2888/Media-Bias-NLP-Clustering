But what about McGregor, the Smoking Grandpa?\n\nJoel Magee , better known as the Toy Scout, knows the stogie-puffing Scotsman well and paid $50 for a mint-condition McGregor in its original box.\n\nIt was one of dozens of deals Magee executed Saturday morning at the Denver Vintage Toy Buying Show in Glendale. The show, which runs from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Hampton Inn & Suites, continues through Tuesday.\n\nOne item Magee was unable to secure was a 19-inch-tall Shirley Temple doll in its original outfit. Magee\u2019s offer of $250 was turned down by the doll\u2019s owner.\n\n\u201cThe few items that don\u2019t sell? It\u2019s usually an emotional attachment,\u201d said Magee, who tours the country appraising and buying vintage toys. \u201cI\u2019m the middle guy. We restore these items and sell them to collectors.\n\nThat included a beat-up metal kitchen set with missing handles and an oven door that no longer closes that Magee purchased for $20.\n\nSome people want nothing more than a chance to do some spring cleaning and pocket a bit of playing-around money while they are at it, Magee said.\n\nPopular items this year are Star Wars memorabilia \u2014 the older stuff, mind you \u2014 and Masters of the Universe action figures.\n\n\u201cOur focus has been on the early Star Wars items from the 70s and 80s,\u201d Magee said.\n\nThat meant a box of 1990s Star Wars and Star Trek toys brought in Saturday by Kathy Croom , of Bailey, wasn\u2019t ripe enough to fetch a good price. Magee suggested she hang on to the items a few more years and try and sell them then.\n\nCroom did manage to sell a 1960s Marx Streamline train set for $100 and a some old figurines from the 1920s that her 91-year-old father had passed down to her.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any space to display them and they\u2019ve been sitting in boxes for years,\u201d Croom said. \u201cNobody in the family is attached to them so there they go.\u201d\n\nAs for the $200 she got for the entire loot?\n\n\u201cIt was a lot more than we thought we would get,\u201d Croom said.\n\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or twitter.com/abuvthefold\n\nDenver Vintage Toy Buying Show\n\nHampton Inn & Suites, 4150 Kentucky Ave., Glendale. 9:30 a.m. \u2013 5 p.m. through Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Vintage toy sale in Glendale clearing attics, garages of old memories", "title": "Vintage toy sale in Glendale clearing attics, garages of old memories", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/17/vintage-toy-sale-in-glendale-clearing-attics-garages-of-old-memories/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140517__BZ08TOYS_AC13282xp1.jpg", "height": 440}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140517__BZ08TOYS_AC13282xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-17T13:32:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T13:22:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8357\"", "article_summary": "It was one of dozens of deals Magee executed Saturday morning at the Denver Vintage Toy Buying Show in Glendale.\nJohn Aguilar: 303-954-1695, jaguilar@denverpost.com or twitter.com/abuvthefoldDenver Vintage Toy Buying ShowHampton Inn & Suites, 4150 Kentucky Ave., Glendale.\n\u201cOur focus has been on the early Star Wars items from the 70s and 80s,\u201d Magee said.\nPopular items this year are Star Wars memorabilia \u2014 the older stuff, mind you \u2014 and Masters of the Universe action figures.\nIt\u2019s usually an emotional attachment,\u201d said Magee, who tours the country appraising and buying vintage toys."}
