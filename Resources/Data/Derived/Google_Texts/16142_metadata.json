Even, from time to time, on the Seaside Heights beach.\n\nOn Sunday, the King of Rock and Roll showed up as a sand sculpture, mysteriously carved on the beach at Carteret Avenue.\n\n\"It's as big as a table!\" Police Chief Thomas Boyd exclaimed. \"Someone really went to a lot of effort here.\"\n\nIndeed, sand sculpture Elvis' serious stare looked out from what appeared to be a gramophone, with the words \"RCA Victor\" emblazoned above his head on multi-colored sand. In 1955, RCA Victor purchased the recording contract of a young Elvis Presley from Sam Phillips' tiny Sun Records for the then-astronomical price of $35,000. It was a wise investment.\n\nPresley became RCA's biggest-selling artist, striking gold for the first time in 1956 with \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" He would sell millions of records in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nBoyd said that the sculpture appeared on the beach Sunday. He was impressed with the artist's attention to detail, including the dark outline of Elvis' inimitable face.\n\nUnlike the flesh and blood King, whose body of work continues to influence rock and roll even to this day, sand-sculpture Elvis was not meant for immortality.\n\n\"With the full moon and the high tide, he probably didn't make it through the night,\" Boyd said.\n\nJean Mikle: (732) 643-4050, jmikle@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
