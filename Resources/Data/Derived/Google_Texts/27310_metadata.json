The curious can apply to join a private beta, which will be launching this fall.\n\nYou can pick your new girlfriend or boyfriend\u2019s name and age, and even flesh out their personality, all for \u201ca small one-time fee.\u201d If you lack creative inspiration, the sites will help you craft a story about where and how you two met and who took the first brave step.\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for Jobs That Let You Have a Life\n\nIn the longer term, the company is planning to add other ways to communicate with your non-existent significant other, such as phone calls and voicemails, as well as gifts, personalized notes and flower deliveries.\n\nThe company isn\u2019t completely making up those virtual partners it provides. Users can volunteer to become an invisible girlfriend or boyfriend by simply submitting a selfie. They won\u2019t be paid for the first photo, but if someone selects the picture as their fake special someone, they\u2019ll be paid for each additional selfie they submit.\n\nThe company says it will never share the real identities of those submitting selfies with anyone else and also promises it will even use their zip codes to make sure the photos aren\u2019t available to users in the same area.\n\nWhat happens when mom wants to meet your significant other? You broke up, of course, because you found someone new. He\u2019s invisible\u2026of course.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If your mom is constantly asking you whether you\u2019re dating anyone in the hope you\u2019ll soon get married and start a family, these sites may be able to solve part of your problem.", "title": "A Fake Boyfriend to Get Mom Off Your Back", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/06/Fake-Boyfriend-Get-Mom-Your-Back", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01272014_Cheating_Online_Dating.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/06/Fake-Boyfriend-Get-Mom-Your-Back", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/01272014_Cheating_Online_Dating.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If your mom is constantly asking you whether you\u2019re dating anyone in the hope you\u2019ll soon get married and start a family, these sites may be able to solve part of your problem.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "What happens when mom wants to meet your significant other?\nWhile having dinner with your parents and inquisitive friends, you can text your new girlfriend or boyfriend and, guess what--they\u2019ll text you right back.\nUsers can volunteer to become an invisible girlfriend or boyfriend by simply submitting a selfie.\nIf your mom is constantly asking you whether you\u2019re dating anyone or when you\u2019ll be getting married already, the startup behind a couple of new websites wants to help.\nThey won\u2019t be paid for the first photo, but if someone selects the picture as their fake special someone, they\u2019ll be paid for each additional selfie they submit."}
