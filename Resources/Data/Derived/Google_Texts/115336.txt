NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – A 28-year-old woman was shot in the head and lives to tell the story. Despite all she has been through, Tara Ellis is staying positive.

Ellis was at an apartment complex in Bellevue with a group of people on Sept. 7 when the man who lives there showed his gun to everyone.

Metro police said another man was holding the gun when it accidentally went off, striking Ellis in the back of the head.

“We were at a friend’s apartment. We were about to go to the movies and that’s kind of the last thing I remember other than waking up with the paramedics,” said Ellis.

She was hospitalized at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center for over a week and released Tuesday.

“It’s terrifying not being able to do simple things I could do last week,” said Ellis.

Ellis told News 2 she can’t see out of her left eye, she has no feeling on her left side and has to endure months of physical rehab.

“Washing my hair is a huge issue it’s really difficult you know it’s hard to wash my hands or open the refrigerator,” said Ellis.

“Way better than I should be doing,” she said when asked how she was. “I am more than fortunate, more than blessed. Just trying to stay focused on my rehab and becoming 100 percent again.”

Metro police said they are still investigating the incident.

“Educate yourself, educate your family on any kind of gun safety. It’s such a simple act and it can save so many lives,” said Ellis.

Ellis doesn’t have insurance to cover the cost of physical therapy. A GoFundMe account was set up to help with the bills.
