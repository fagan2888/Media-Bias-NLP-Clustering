The Baltimore Ravens will help advertise the upcoming plans in Maryland\u2019s new state-level insurance marketplace, which will open for enrollment in a little less than a month. Maryland\u2019s health department officials note that will be an important way to reach the people who will soon be able to benefit from Obamacare, since they estimate that 71 percent of uninsured people in the state have either watched, attended, or listened to at least one Ravens game in the past year.\n\nMaryland may be the first state to partner with a sports team (the Obamacare administration did attempt to pursue a national partnership with the NFL, but the league declined after massive conservative outcry). However, it hardly provides the only example of a creative strategy to educate people about the health reform law. With Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period fast approaching, here are other innovative efforts currently being used to publicize it:\n\nA California county is running Obamacare ads with naked people in them.\n\nEach state is branding their own state-level marketplace differently, and the Golden State is going with \u201cCovered California.\u201d In keeping with that theme, some counties are running ads illustrating what it\u2019s like to go uncovered \u2014 with photos of naked people holding strategically-placed signs that read, \u201cCover your family.\u201d\n\nConnecticut is handing out Obamacare-themed sunscreen to people on the beach.\n\nCREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nAs another play on the same coverage theme, beachgoers in Connecticut this summer have been receiving packets of sunscreen that tell them to \u201cGet Covered.\u201d The sunscreen labels include the logo and website for the state\u2019s upcoming Obamacare marketplace. State officials are also handing out similarly-branded containers of hand sanitizer and packets of band-aids.\n\nOregon hired singer-songwriters to make Obamacare more appealing for the hipster crowd.\n\nCREDIT: Cover Oregon\n\nIn July, Oregon launched ads for its state marketplace that play to the Portlandia crowd. The TV ads feature local songwriters who composed songs about why it\u2019s so important to have health insurance, and they promise to get the word out to \u201ceach logger and lawyer and stay-at-home dad.\u201d\n\nOne Oregon official took to Reddit to answer questions about Obamacare.\n\nCREDIT: reddit.com\n\nOne of the business managers for Oregon\u2019s new marketplace turned to the social media site Reddit to give residents an opportunity to ask her questions about the upcoming changes under Obamacare. \u201cI am Georgann Helmuth, Cover Oregon subject matter expert. Ask me anything about getting financial help for health insurance through Cover Oregon!\u201d she wrote to introduce her personal Ask Me Anything thread, which ended up getting more than 200 comments.\n\nKentucky is using bourbon festivals to get people to sign up for Obamacare.\n\nCREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nStates tend to be marketing their new marketplaces by personalizing their campaigns to their own regions. Kentucky is a prime example. It\u2019s planning on doing outreach efforts to people at several bourbon festivals this fall. The state\u2019s spokesperson told Wonkblog\u2019s Sarah Kliff they\u2019re trying to go to events that will be well-attended by lots of young people.\n\nMinnesota is relying on Paul Bunyan and his blue ox to spread the word about Obamacare.\n\nCREDIT: Rupa Shenoy/MPR News\n\nAnother state playing to regional culture is Minnesota, where state officials are using Paul Bunyan and Babe the Ox in their advertisements about the health law. \u201cWe liked Paul and Babe because everybody seems to recognize them. They were easy to work with. We were looking for what was unique to Minnesota. The ball of twine\u2018s agent was harder,\u201d explained a spokesperson for the advertising company that\u2019s helping to produce the ads. They\u2019re aiming for ads that are \u201ceasy to understand, local, and upbeat.\u201d\n\nWashington wants to put Obamacare ads on Pandora Radio and Porta-Potties.\n\nCREDIT: Shutterstock\n\nWashington State officials are having a hard time figuring out how to reach uninsured people in rural areas. They want to experiment with creative advertising strategies, like putting Obamacare ads on prescription drug bags and on the Internet radio service Pandora. They\u2019re also considering sponsoring Porta-Potties at outdoor concerts.\n\nKaty Perry\u2019s tweeting about Obamacare.\n\nCREDIT: HD Wallpaper\n\nA cadre of celebrities met with top White House advisers over the summer to talk about how they can help get the word out about health care reform. Now, some of them are taking to their social media accounts to follow through on that. Pop star Katy Perry recently tweeted out information about Obamacare enrollment, and President Obama\u2019s official Twitter account thanked her for the publicity (Perry has about eight million more followers than the president does).\n\nFunny or Die is producing videos to help educate people about Obamacare.\n\nCREDIT: Funny or Die\n\nThe comedy site has produced several light-hearted videos about health reform that are aimed at twentysomethings. They\u2019re housed on a new Obamacare section on the site. Funny or Die\u2019s president of production, Mike Farah, told Mother Jones that he hopes the videos will help make signing up for Obamacare \u201ca normal thing, something that isn\u2019t politicized, something that comes second nature to younger people (like putting your seatbelt on).\u201d Farah says the site didn\u2019t get any money from the federal government to promote the health law, but wanted to lend a hand to reach out to young Americans anyway. \u201cWe heard they needed help and we wanted to get working,\u201d he explained.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "State officials are pulling out all the stops to get people interested in signing up for health insurance.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "State officials are pulling out all the stops to get people interested in signing up for health insurance.", "title": "Athletes, Pop Stars, And Booze: The Most Creative Efforts To Promote Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/09/04/2572281/creative-obamacare-promotion/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obamacare-ads.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State officials are pulling out all the stops to get people interested in signing up for health insurance.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obamacare-ads.jpg", "title": "Athletes, Pop Stars, And Booze: The Most Creative Efforts To Promote Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obamacare-ads.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/obamacare-ads.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-04T16:48:17+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa2a\"", "article_summary": "They want to experiment with creative advertising strategies, like putting Obamacare ads on prescription drug bags and on the Internet radio service Pandora.\nWith Obamacare\u2019s open enrollment period fast approaching, here are other innovative efforts currently being used to publicize it:A California county is running Obamacare ads with naked people in them.\nThey\u2019re aiming for ads that are \u201ceasy to understand, local, and upbeat.\u201dWashington wants to put Obamacare ads on Pandora Radio and Porta-Potties.\nHealth Athletes, Pop Stars, And Booze: The Most Creative Efforts To Promote Obamacare CREDIT:This week, news broke that the Obama administration has formed its first official partnership with a professional sports team to help spread the word about the health reform law.\nCREDIT: Cover OregonIn July, Oregon launched ads for its state marketplace that play to the Portlandia crowd."}
