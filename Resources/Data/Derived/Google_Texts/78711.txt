Rookie minicamp is the “Fast and The Curious.” Young players, with the Broncos’ draft picks and undrafted free agents are no different, try to adapt to the speed of the professional game while also burying their heads in their playbooks.

It was a three-day cram session at Dove Valley. Broncos coach John Fox left impressed with his new crew of players as they dropped the curtain Sunday on the rookies’ practices.

“It’s really so much mental for young guys. They are new to us and new to our terminology,” Fox said. “Repetition is very important. They came in last Monday, and this weekend it was great because we are short on people so they get every rep.”

The Broncos drafted six players last week. Cornerback Bradley Roby was taken in the first round, and will be expected to contribute this season. Denver is working with Roby on improving his ball-recognition skills — “Getting his eyes right so he doesn’t get beat on double moves,” explained defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio. Roby impressed in his early snapshot.

“He has great skills,” Fox said. “And he’s been really pleasant in the way he’s conducted himself in meetings and throughout the building.”

There are few days that pass without Fox getting asked about Peyton Manning. You’ve probably heard of him. Sunday was not an exception as Fox said he heard some of Manning’s address at the University of Virginia commencement on Saturday.

“He’s a busy guy in the offseason I have come to realize. It’s all good. I look forward to seeing him (Monday),” Fox said. “He’s amazing. His time management skills are off the chart. It doesn’t surprise me (that does so many public events) because I see how he operates in our building. And that gives you pretty good idea how he is off the field.”
