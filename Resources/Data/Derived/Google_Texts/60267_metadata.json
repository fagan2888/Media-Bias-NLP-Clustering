Several of their clients will perform on the biggest stage in American sports this Sunday.\n\n\u201cOur effort is in building technology that can capture the data, codify our expertise and design a specific plan for an individual person,\u201d Dan Burns, CEO of EXOS told International Business Times. \u201cWe assign as much data as possible on the human and build a personalized game plan.\u201d\n\nThe process begins with the emerging field of wearable technology. Working with groups like Adidas MiCoach, advanced sensors in practice jerseys capture biometric data from the athletes. EXOS has developed software to analyze the data, and experts use it design a workout customized to the unique needs of each player.\n\nOn the Seattle Seahawks, EXOS has worked with players like Golden Tate, JR Sweezy, Robert Turbin, Bobby Wagner, Max Unger, and Marshawn Lynch, Seattle\u2019s celebrity running back known for his \u201cBeast Mode\u201d plays and sideline Skittles.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nFor the Denver Broncos, EXOS has worked with Sione Fua, Malik Jackson, Brandon Marsphall, Brock Osweiler, Manny Ramirez, Sylvester Williams, and two of quarterback Peyton Manning\u2019s favorite targets \u2013 Eric Decker and Demaryius Thomas.\n\nSome of the players came to EXOS before they were drafted to prepare for the NFL combine, a week-long showcase where scouts and coaches judge the ability of candidates. Others came for physical rehabilitation after an injury \u2013 something all too familiar to NFL players \u2013 to get back into the game as soon as possible.\n\nOne of the technologies used is \u201cPower Plate,\u201d a full-body vibration system that simulates thousands of muscle repetitions in a way that\u2019s much easier on the body. Others include a gravity-free treadmill that helps players to move without impact to accelerate their return.\n\nInjuries are a major focus of the NFL these days, especially the abnormally short time it has taken some NFL players to return from a traumatic break or tear. Burns said that the technology at EXOS helps speed up recovery time, but that the safety of players comes first. EXOS remains independent from the league and its data is protected by HIPAA, making it a place players trust for second opinions about their injuries.\n\nBurns said that technology goes beyond physical training. EXOS also uses platforms that simulate gameplay to help players practice on-field decision-making skills without the bruising physical contact.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong correlation between emotional intelligence and on-field performance,\u201d Burns said. \u201cThe ability to assimilate information and cognitive training can build champions.\u201d\n\nEXOS has extended its expertise in software and physical training beyond athletes to the military and even tech professionals. EXOS now provides personalized training programs to companies like Google, Intel and Tesla.\n\nWith more emphasis placed on physical health than ever before -- including parts of Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act that provide incentives to companies that keep employees healthy \u2013 Burns hopes more companies will see the advantage in using technology to build workouts custom-tailored to each individual. He sees \u201ccorporate wellness\u201d growing to a $6 billion industry, and EXOS wants to be at the forefront.\n\nThis article has been updated to state that EXOS was founded in Tempe, Ariz. rather than Tuscon, as the article originally states. IB Times also misprinted the name of the full-body vibration system as \"Power Play,\" and has corrected it to \"Power Plate.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "sports tech, sports technology, exos, athletic performance, super bowl, super bowl 2014, seattle seahawks, denver broncos, marshawn lynch, demaryius thomas, eric decker, nfl injuries", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "EXOS has used advanced sensors, data analytic software and wearable technology to build customized workout plans for the world's top athletes.", "title": "EXOS At Super Bowl 2014: The Technology That Turned Seattle Seahawks And Denver Broncos Players Into Champions", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/exos-super-bowl-2014-technology-turned-seattle-seahawks-denver-broncos-players-champions-1552727", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/02/01/ap-arizona-3_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "EXOS has used advanced sensors, data analytic software and wearable technology to build customized workout plans for the world's top athletes.", "title": "EXOS At Super Bowl 2014: The Technology That Turned Seattle Seahawks And Denver Broncos Players Into Champions", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/exos-super-bowl-2014-technology-turned-seattle-seahawks-denver-broncos-players-champions-1552727", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/02/01/ap-arizona-3_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2014/02/01/ap-arizona-3_0.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Technology", "published_time": "2014-02-01T13:53:44-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-03T10:02:47-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ryanwneal"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "EXOS has used advanced sensors, data analytic software and wearable technology to build customized workout plans for the world's top athletes."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce47f\"", "article_summary": "Injuries are a major focus of the NFL these days, especially the abnormally short time it has taken some NFL players to return from a traumatic break or tear.\nBurns said that the technology at EXOS helps speed up recovery time, but that the safety of players comes first.\nOthers came for physical rehabilitation after an injury \u2013 something all too familiar to NFL players \u2013 to get back into the game as soon as possible.\nBurns said that technology goes beyond physical training.\nEXOS also uses platforms that simulate gameplay to help players practice on-field decision-making skills without the bruising physical contact."}
