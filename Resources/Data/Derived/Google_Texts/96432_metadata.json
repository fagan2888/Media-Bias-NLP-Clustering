Customers know that BSI works fully independently from BTG,\" he said without being more specific. Latin American clients accounted for 10-15 percent of assets under management, he said.\n\nAsked about the impact of a credit rating downgrade from Moody's, he said BSI's rating was the biggest challenge given its importance for counterparties and investors. He noted Moody's rating for BSI was three notches above its parent's.\n\nShould BTG Pactual be downgraded again \"then we need to find a solution establishing BSI as an independent entity, as least from Moody's perspective\", he added.\n\nHe said BSI was in close contact with Swiss financial watchdog Finma, but he declined to discuss details of the talks. It was delivering daily reports to Finma, which he said had set new lower limits for some things like liquidity levels.\n\nPressed on sale prospects, he said: \"Our clients have trust, but not forever. The immediate developments in Brazil are highly important. Either BTG Pactual's situation stabilizes or an alternative solution needs to be found for BSI.\"\n\nHe said BSI would have made a record gross profit this year had the crisis not erupted and said 2015 accounts would show that no funds had flowed back from BSI to its parent.\n\nHe said regulators had ring-fenced BSI from the start so that BSI shares are parked in a Swiss holding company under Finma supervision. The bank and holding company had independent boards.\n\n(Reporting by Michael Shields.
