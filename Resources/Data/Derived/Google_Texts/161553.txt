A home built in 1902 was relocated to a permanent location Sunday.

The Victorian Style home was located at Topeka and Murdock; the home was moved in early September of 2015 to that location temporarily.

Quik-Trip made it possible for the home to be moved, but also required it moved so their gas station at Broadway and Murdock could expand.

As the home was traversed through the city streets of Wichita, it required power lines to be taken down, as well as cable lines, street signs and stop lights removed and traffic was shut down on Broadway, 13th Street, St Francis Street and 12th Street.

Many trees had to be trimmed and about 15 trees had to be removed so the home, which spanned an entire four lane road, could fit to its new location.

The home weighed in at around 240,000 pounds and it cost around $125,000 to move the home and place it on a new lot with a new foundation.

The home is said to be a one-of-a-kind given its' condition.

The home is now located at 12th and Emporia. Many homes in that area are historic homes, built around the same time with similar architecture.

The Historic Preservation Alliance of Wichita & Sedgwick County says the home will be used as a venue that people can rent out for events like weddings.

The home will be placed on its new foundation on Monday or Tuesday. The process includes placing the home on steel beams, lubricating the beams with soap and sliding it into place.
