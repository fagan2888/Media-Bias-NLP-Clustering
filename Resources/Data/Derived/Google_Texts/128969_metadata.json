And in the case of Al Sharpton declaring that Tuesday\u2019s resounding defeat for his party was not the fault of an unpopular president nor inept candidates, but of Hillary and Bill Clinton, it\u2019s painfully obvious where the activist/host/liaison is getting his marching orders are coming from:\n\nValerie Jarrett.\n\nAs he\u2019s enjoyed mentioning in the past, Sharpton has a direct line to the White House. He\u2019s visited numerous times, trades daily emails with Ms. Jarrett. So when the Democrats went down in flames three days ago, guess who President Obama met with the next day? Not Mitch McConnell, not John Boehner, not DNC Chairwoman (for now) Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Instead, it\u2019s was MSNBC\u2019s ratings \u2014 challenged 6:00 p.m. host (along with other civil rights leaders), a White House official had confirmed. On the docket\u2013because Sharpton is obviously an expert in all of these things \u2014 was Obamacare implementation, education and criminal justice. Speaking of criminal (in)justice, just what is Tawana Brawley up to these days?\n\nPer the White House communication team: \u201cThe President also highlighted how we are looking forward to working with the leaders over the next two years to advance these and other crucial issues facing the country.\u201d\n\nIt appears Sharpton must have been in the bathroom during the whole working-with-other-leaders part, as he proceeded to stage an upside down protest (seen here) of Republicans on his show yesterday.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why the President seems to be getting nothing but bad advice these days with the likes of Plouffe, Axelrod and Gibbs gone, or how this administration has become such a rudderless ship with no port, look no further to the kind of people Mr. Obama is turning to for council in times of need.\n\nFor this part, Sharpton uses his national TV platform to attack the Clintons, who won\u2019t be trading Christmas cards with Ms. Jarrett anytime in the next century. It all seems so nice and neat in retrospect: Sharpton goes to the White House and leaves with not an interview but instructions instead. Hillary and Bill\u2019s coattails during this campaign season proved to be quite short\u2026this is true. And with Hillary already distancing herself via blaming the president for not heeding her advice on ISIS while she was still Secretary of State, any bond between the Obamas/Jarrett and the Clintons is already likely long gone.\n\nThere\u2019s obvious and painfully obvious.\n\nAl Sharpton serving as a proxy soldier for the Obama White House is undoubtedly the latter.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Joe Concha on Twitter @JoeConchaTV", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's obvious and then there's painfully obvious.
