Alex Ristea, CC by 2.0\n\nWhether we find certain faces attractive or not, we routinely read other people based on their facial features and expressions. In a series of four linked experiments, NYU researchers explored whether different expressions (and micro-expressions) might impact judgments of trustworthiness and competence. Participants judged a face as competent based on facial structure, the researchers discovered, while basing trustworthiness ratings on facial expression.\n\n\u201cYou can influence to an extent how trustworthy others perceive you to be,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Freeman, an assistant professor of psychology and the study's senior author, in a press release. \u201cBut perceptions of your competence or ability are considerably less able to be changed.\u201d\n\nThe first experiment began with participants, both women and men, each looking at five photos of 10 different adult men of different ethnicities. Generally, the participants rated the happier photos of each man as more trustworthy and the angrier faces as less trustworthy. Perceptions of ability, on the other hand, remained consistent. No matter which photo they viewed, whether angry or happy, the participants\u2019 judgments of each man\u2019s competence did not vary.\n\nIn a second experiment, participants evaluated 40 computer-generated faces that slowly evolved from \u201cslightly\u201d happy to \u201cslightly\u201d angry, resulting in 20 different more-or-less neutral instances of each face. Once again, perceptions of competence remained unchanged for each given face, while trustworthiness varied according to how happy the expression appeared.\n\nIn a third experiment, participants viewed an array of computer-generated faces and were asked one of two questions: \"Which face would you choose as your financial advisor?\" And, \"Which face would win a weightlifting competition?\" Participants generally chose the happy faces to advise them on their finances. Emotion, apparently, did not enter into their choices for a successful weightlifter. Most often participants selected faces with a distinct form: a wider as opposed to more narrow structure, one generally associated with testosterone and physical ability.\n\nFinally, over 100 trials, participants selected one of two faces as either a trusted financial advisor or competent weightlifting champion \u2014 each time the features of the base face varied. This fourth experiment revealed which facial cues drove perceptions. One final time, the participants most often chose happy faces as an advisor, while their weightlifting champ's faces had wider structural variations.\n\nPutting Knowledge to Use\n\nIn the end, perceived ability appears to be more tied to a face\u2019s static structure, while perceived trustworthiness (or intention) is malleable and influenced by expression.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have focused on two social dimensions, intentions and ability, we speculate any number of dimensions would be candidates for the effects observed here,\u201d wrote the authors in their conclusion.\n\nThe following Ted Talk offers suggestions about how we may put our knowledge of facial expressions to good use. In particular, the speakers analyze micro-expressions, the fleeting and mostly involuntary expressions of emotion that pass across our face. Originating from our feelings \u2014 rather than our rational thoughts \u2014 micro-expressions give a clue to the range of emotions we may be experiencing in any given moment while also suggesting how we may act. Interestingly, even people who are blind from birth will display the same micro-expressions as their parents.\n\nSource: Hehman E, Flake JK, Freeman JB.
