I realize that few businesses and organizations distinguish between debit cards and credit cards when accepting payment. However, this practice bothers me a lot when it comes to churches.\n\nNow, I think e-giving in itself is fine. But if I were the pastor or on the leadership board, and we had an e-giving process, I would strongly encourage people to use debit cards and not credit cards. There\u2019s nothing wrong with a draft or an ACH kind of thing. A lot of people do that and like the ability to give online.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want a giving situation to your church turn into debt to you. And it does just that when it\u2019s a credit card.\n\nI just bought a new smartphone, and the company I\u2019m with offers insurance for the device. Do you think it would be wise or foolish to do this?\n\nThe purpose of insurance is to transfer a risk that you can\u2019t afford to take. When it comes to things like cars or houses, I absolutely recommend that people have insurance. Most folks couldn\u2019t just write a check for another car if the one they drive were totaled. It\u2019s the same with a house. If your home is destroyed, the insurance takes care of things instead of putting you in the position of having to pull tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars out of your own pocket for a new home \u2014 also something most people can\u2019t do.\n\nNo, I don\u2019t insure inexpensive things like smartphones. And if a smartphone is an expensive item to you, then you probably shouldn\u2019t have that phone. I mean, there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a cellphone if you can afford it. But if you tear up a phone or it breaks down and you can\u2019t afford to replace it out of your own pocket, then you\u2019ve got too much phone.\n\nDave Ramsey is a personal money management expert, author and national radio personality.
