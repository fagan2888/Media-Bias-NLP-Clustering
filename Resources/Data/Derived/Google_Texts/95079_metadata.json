That\u2019s the margin by which Democrats beat Republicans among women nationwide in the vote for the House. That\u2019s a significant decline from President Obama\u2019s winning margins among women (11 in 2012, 13 in 2008), though it\u2019s an improvement from the 2010 midterms, when Democrats lost the women\u2019s vote by a point. Still, the massive focus of Democratic candidates across the country on the Republican Party\u2019s supposed \u201cwar on women\u201d clearly didn\u2019t persuade large numbers of female voters to abandon the GOP. Assuming Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, the historic nature of her candidacy as the first female may erase any doubts about a shrinking gender-gap edge for Democrats. But, in midterm elections at least, women are simply not an overwhelmingly Democratic constituency.\n\nRelated: The New Senate Power Grid: Here's Who Has the Juice\n\n\u25a0 62. That\u2019s the percentage of the vote for Democrats among those who said they \u201cnever\u201d attend any sort of religious services; Republicans won just 36 percent among that group. Compare that with the 18-point edge Republicans enjoyed over Democrats among those who go to some sort of religious service weekly and you see that one\u2019s religiosity continues to be among the most reliable predictors of how they will vote. Consider yourself a religious person, or, at least, someone who attends religious services regularly? There\u2019s a strong likelihood you are voting Republican. Not a churchgoer? You are voting Democratic.\n\n\u25a0 54. A majority of Americans who went to the polls Nov. 4 believe that the \u201cgovernment is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals,\u201d while just 41 percent think \u201cthe government should do more to solve problems.\u201d Those numbers suggest that the long-running battle over what government can and should do (and how much it should do) is tilting back toward the smaller-is-better crowd that dominated in the mid- and late 1990s. The early years of Obama\u2019s presidency were defined by a belief that government might need to do more than it had during the latter days of the George W. Bush administration. (Think Hurricane Katrina.) But the pendulum is in the process of swinging back to the government-shrinkage folks.\n\nRelated: How the Media Helped the GOP Walk Away with the Midterms\n\n\u25a0 79. How people feel about their government is this number, which represents the percentage of people who say you can only \u201csometimes\u201d (60 percent) or \u201cnever\u201d (18 percent) trust Washington \u201cto do what is right.\u201d That\u2019s stunning. The number is partly attributable to a Republican-flavored electorate and the natural suspicion among many within the GOP of the federal government \u2014 particularly when it\u2019s run by a Democratic president. But the number is so high that it\u2019s hard not to see the problems surrounding the Internal Revenue Service, Veterans Affairs and, of course, the National Security Agency\u2019s spying revelations as part of that deepening distrust among broad swaths of the American public.\n\n\u25a0 48. That\u2019s the percentage of people who said same-sex marriage should be legal in their state, the same number that said it should be illegal. That even split is a significant break from most polling on the issue; Gallup\u2019s most recent poll, in May, on same-sex marriage showed 55 percent of Americans supporting it while 42 percent opposed it. What explains the discrepancy? Maybe the difference between asking whether same-sex marriage should be legal in your state versus asking, more broadly, about its legality. Or maybe that people are less willing to tell someone over the phone what they really feel about a divisive social issue than in person. (That seems odd.) Maybe the difference between \u201clegal\u201d (the exit poll language) and \u201cvalid\u201d (Gallup\u2019s language). Or that this midterm electorate was a Republican-friendly one.\n\nRelated: Election 2014: The Most Expensive Midterms Ever\n\n\u25a0 75. Three-quarters of the 2014 electorate was white (and they voted for Republicans by 22 points) on Nov. 4. That might seem like great news for Republicans. It\u2019s not. Whites made up 77 percent of the 2010 electorate \u2014 and the decline in whites as a percentage of the overall electorate is happening in presidential cycles, too.\n\n\u25a0 38. The percentage of the white vote that Democratic candidates won nationwide. That\u2019s the same percentage Democrats got among white voters in the 2010 midterms and virtually equal to the 39 percent Obama won in the 2012 election. That\u2019s a trend \u2014 and a downward one for Democrats. From 1996 to 2008, the Democratic presidential nominee always won 41 to 43 percent of the white vote.\n\nRelated: Hillary's 3 Million Ground Forces Are Armed and Ready for 2016\n\n\u25a0 36. That\u2019s the percentage of the Hispanic vote that Republicans won Nov. 4, an improvement on the 34 percent they won in 2010 and a major step up from the 27 percent that Mitt Romney took in 2012. It was the strongest showing for Republicans among Hispanic voters since Bush won 44 percent of the Latino vote in the 2004 election. (Bush\u2019s showing was, by far, the best performance for a Republican presidential nominee since 1972.) It remains to be seen how Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration \u2014 and the Republican response to it \u2014 will affect those numbers in the long run, but 2014 was a step in the right direction for Republicans among Latinos.\n\n\u25a0 53. A majority of voters who identified as \u201cmoderates\u201d (four in every 10 voters) cast ballots for Democrats. Republicans got 45 percent of the moderate vote. That\u2019s a good reminder that a) \u201cmoderate\u201d does not equal \u201cindependent\u201d (Republicans won \u201cindependents\u201d by 12 points) and b) this election was not decided by \u201cthe middle.\u201d It was decided by the Republican base or, put another way, the no-show of the Democratic base.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:\n\nPessimism grows on eve of Iran nuclear deadline\n\nAt least 45 Afghan deaths blamed on suicide bomber\n\nBoy with fake gun in Ohio dies after officer shooting", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The best thing about elections \u2014 if you are a numbers nerd like me \u2014 is the massive am", "title": "The State of the American Electorate in 9 Numbers", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/24/State-American-Electorate-9-Numbers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02102011_voters_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/24/State-American-Electorate-9-Numbers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02102011_voters_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The best thing about elections \u2014 if you are a numbers nerd like me \u2014 is the massive am", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf955\"", "article_summary": "I sifted through the national exit poll in search of clues about the state of the American electorate.\nThat\u2019s the percentage of people who said same-sex marriage should be legal in their state, the same number that said it should be illegal.\nWhites made up 77 percent of the 2010 electorate \u2014 and the decline in whites as a percentage of the overall electorate is happening in presidential cycles, too.\nThree-quarters of the 2014 electorate was white (and they voted for Republicans by 22 points) on Nov. 4.\nThat\u2019s the margin by which Democrats beat Republicans among women nationwide in the vote for the House."}
