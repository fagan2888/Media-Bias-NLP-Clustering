(Photo: ORNL)\n\nOAK RIDGE, Tenn. \u2014 A top official at Oak Ridge National Laboratory says at least eight workers received internal radiation while carrying out a classified project earlier this year at the facility.\n\nThe Knoxville News Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1xdVbpH) reports that ORNL Deputy Director Jeff Smith confirmed the Aug. 25 incident, which involved an unexpected airborne release of radioactive material.\n\nSmith characterized the radiation doses as \u201cminor\u201d and said they were well below the level that requires the lab to report the incident to the Department of Energy.\n\nHowever, he said the lab did report the incident to DOE and conducted a thorough evaluation to prevent a recurrence.\n\n\u201cWe never want to have an unplanned radiological exposure,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe treat them all seriously.\u201d\n\nHe said the laboratory was performing the work for the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant and that the incident occurred in a building on the lab\u2019s central campus.\n\nThe facility contains a number of shielded \u201chot cells,\u201d where radiological work can be performed remotely, but the Aug. 25 activity was not performed in a hot cell or a sealed glovebox.\n\nSmith said the work took place in an \u201cenclosure\u201d but he declined to be more specific. He also said that the radioactive material associated with the exposures was uranium, but he would not discuss what isotopes of uranium were involved or what other materials were involved in the operations.\n\nOfficials said there were actually 11 people present during the operation \u2014 eight ORNL workers and three observers from Y-12.\n\nAccording to Y-12 spokeswoman Ellen Boatner, nasal smears and bioassays for the three did not indicate any uptake of radioactive material.\n\n\u201cThey were observing (the operation at Building 3525) from outside the radiological area,\u201d Boatner said. \u201cThey had the advantage of some distance and possibly some shielding.\u201d\n\nSmith said some employees at ORNL have jobs in which it\u2019s anticipated they\u2019ll receive some low-level radiation exposures. The lab tries not to have any unplanned radiation exposures, but it\u2019s not unusual for there to be one or maybe two per year, he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1Dxc2ae", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A top official at Oak Ridge National Laboratory says at least eight workers received internal radiation while carrying out a classified project earlier this year at the facility.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "A top official at Oak Ridge National Laboratory says at least eight workers received internal radiation while carrying out a classified project earlier this year at the facility.", "title": "Oak Ridge workers exposed to radiation during secret project", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2014/12/14/oak-ridge-workers-exposed-radiation-secret-project/20400333/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A top official at Oak Ridge National Laboratory says at least eight workers received internal radiation while carrying out a classified project earlier this year at the facility.", "title": "Oak Ridge workers exposed to radiation during secret project", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d324205b27385800efa347ff5e5b02cf2f366af1/c=334-0-1667-1333&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/14/B9315494520Z.1_20141214144431_000_GO89DCP0O.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Energy", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Department of Energy", "title": "Oak Ridge workers exposed to radiation during secret project", "author": "Associated Press", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac20add3f92adfd1d6e695591937e6e42c30dd09/c=500-0-1500-1333/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/14/B9315494520Z.1_20141214144431_000_GO89DCP0O.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46837b90ae998993d99356e31057d6d0ad0c3903/c=334-0-1667-1333/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/14/B9315494520Z.1_20141214144431_000_GO89DCP0O.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/65cf2a46e294251efac8980d44d4354bd635d5ce/c=112-0-1889-1333/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/14/B9315494520Z.1_20141214144431_000_GO89DCP0O.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ad857ff3f471a9f423b391a57ab1297845aebf6/c=0-104-2000-1229&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/14/B9315494520Z.1_20141214144431_000_GO89DCP0O.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-12-14T13:44:49.450000-06:00", "shorthed": "ORNL workers exposed to radiation", "articleid": 20400333, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d93021e91b0ec7a084ab7d527e0eff44827b6fb/c=0-104-2000-1229/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/14/B9315494520Z.1_20141214144431_000_GO89DCP0O.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8e536322b64e5e9bd07b1b166217d069e2b028e/c=625-0-1375-1333/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/12/14/B9315494520Z.1_20141214144431_000_GO89DCP0O.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2978\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: ORNL)OAK RIDGE, Tenn. \u2014 A top official at Oak Ridge National Laboratory says at least eight workers received internal radiation while carrying out a classified project earlier this year at the facility.\nOak Ridge National Laboratory.\nThe facility contains a number of shielded \u201chot cells,\u201d where radiological work can be performed remotely, but the Aug. 25 activity was not performed in a hot cell or a sealed glovebox.\nOfficials said there were actually 11 people present during the operation \u2014 eight ORNL workers and three observers from Y-12.\nHowever, he said the lab did report the incident to DOE and conducted a thorough evaluation to prevent a recurrence."}
