Malignant tumors are made up of cells that are largely homogenous, with heterogeneity confined to late emerging tumor growth. A non-cancerous mass of cells with equivalent mass would be highly heterogeneous due to normal mutations that occur with each cell division. Researchers observed how one cell can multiply to become a malignant tumor, and they saw the different changes that occur in cancerous cells as they move within the tumor itself.\n\nThey found that this movement and cell turnover within a tumor allows cells that are well suited to the environment to flourish and grow \u2014 any one of these types of cells is capable of taking over a tumor very quickly, often within months. This finding helps explain why malignant tumors are often made up of only one type of cell when healthy tissue is so heterogeneous.\n\nThe scariest part about this mechanism, though, is that it does not entirely mix the cells inside the tumor, according to the team. This means that part of the tumor could become immune to certain drugs before other parts, which means they cling on even when another part of the tumor is destroyed by a chemotherapy treatment. Then, they can repopulate and regrow the tumor.\n\nResearchers say that this new information could help develop cancer treatments that target smaller movements of cancerous cells, which could slow the progression of malignant cells within a tumor.\n\n\u201cComputer modeling of cancer enables us to gain valuable insight into how this complex disease develops over time and in three dimensions,\u201d said Dr. Bartomiej Waclaw, of the University of Edinburgh\u2019s School of Physics and Astronomy, and lead author of the study.\n\nSource: Waclaw B, Bozic I, Pittman M, Hruban R, Vogelstein B, Nowak M.
