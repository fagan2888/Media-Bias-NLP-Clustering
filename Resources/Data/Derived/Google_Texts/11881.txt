The truth will set you free

To help you filter truths from untruths this campaign season, be mindful of some facts listed below.

I’ve included some personal opinions, so see if you can identify them.

Most people on welfare are hardworking, taxpaying citizens just like the rest of us. President Barack Obama has governed a strong economy — unemployment’s 5 percent, gas prices are $2, GDP rose to more than $18 trillion and inflation is relatively flat. Our founding fathers believed in the separation of church and state. The Senate voted against providing health care access to 9/11 first responders. Between 1978 and 2014 CEO pay adjusted for inflation increased by almost 1,000 percent while typical workers in the U.S. saw a pay raise of just 11 percent.

Obamacare is based on policy ideas that originated in conservative think tanks. Reagan raised federal taxes 11 times. Most food stamp recipients are working people who do not make enough money to feed their families without this assistance. World rankings would conclude the U.S. is not an exceptional country — 34th in childhood poverty, 43rd in life expectancy and 58th in primary education.

The numbers of abortions and pregnant teenagers in the U.S. are at their lowest levels in 40 years. Twenty-five percent of private sector American workers make less than $10 per hour. The Koch brothers received about $200 million in state and federal corporate welfare, euphemistically called subsidies. The Pledge of Allegiance was written by a socialist. Deficit spending has not caused soaring interest rates and bankruptcy and did not produce runaway inflation. Those who watch Fox News are the “most ... misinformed media viewers.” Undocumented immigrants cannot be on welfare.

Oops, I forgot to include opinions, so they’re all facts.
