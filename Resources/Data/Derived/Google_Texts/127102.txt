Santa Rosa County Sheriff's officials are investigating the death of a Louisiana woman.

56 year old Joetta Goss's body was found in the water over the weekend near the Navarre Beach causeway.

Authorities say two women who were fishing near the causeway spotted Goss along with a kayak.

Goss was last seen kayaking late Friday.

Law enforcement also believe that alcohol may have been a factor in Goss's death.

She was vacationing with family in the Navarre Beach area.
