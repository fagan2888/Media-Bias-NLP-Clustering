Actor Steven Seagal says that President Obama would be impeached if the truth about Benghazi came out.

Mr. Segal spoke at the Western Conservative conference on Friday after a series of comical speakers, but his speech took a serious turn when he gave criticism of the Obama administration, the Independent Journal Review reported.

“Never in my life did I ever believe that our country would be taken over by people like the people who are running it at this day,” he said, adding, “if the truth about Benghazi were to come out now, I don’t think that this man would make it through his term. I think he would be impeached.”

He continued to criticize the department of Justice and the fiasco with the “Fast and the Furious” operation.

“What’s happened with the fast and the furious?” he asked. “What’s happened with the truth about any of the greatest scandals in American history that have happened right before our eyes?”

He ended his speech by saying that Americans must look past party lines to work together to take the country back.
