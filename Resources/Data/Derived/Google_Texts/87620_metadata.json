A variety of reasons may underlie that choice, including personal preference, religious conviction, or the inability or decision not to provide original documents needed to verify identity, citizenship, or lawful status in the United States. No inferences or assumptions should be drawn about the particular reason an individual possesses a card with this mark, including inferences or assumptions about the person\u2019s citizenship or immigration status.\n\nThe Agency notes individuals affected by the Real ID requirements may use an alternative form of identification documents such as a U.S. passport or Permanent Residency Card.\n\nThe new rules will go into effect sometime in 2016 (the exact date has not been announced), and there will be a three-month forgiveness period, during which people with these licenses will be warned that their IDs are no longer valid for flights. Here\u2019s the breakdown: if you're from one of these states, \u201cacceptable\u201d IDs include passports and passport cards, as well as permanent resident cards, U.S. military ID, and DHS trusted traveler cards such a Global Entry and NEXUS. The TSA will also accept Enhanced Driver\u2019s Licenses, the kind that are currently used to replace passports for travel to and from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean. Of the noncompliant states, only New York and Minnesota issue enhanced licenses. For families from these states, at least children under 18 years old do not need ID when traveling with a companion.\n\n\"Preventing terrorists from obtaining state-issued identification documents is critical to securing America against terrorism,\" DHS explains. \"As the 9/11 Commission noted, \"For terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons.\"\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beginning in 2016, individuals from New York, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Louisiana, and American Samoa will no longer be able to board a domestic commercial flight with their just their drivers licenses as proof of identification..05/27/2016 8:18:50AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Beginning in 2016, individuals from New York, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Louisiana, and American Samoa will no longer be able to board a domestic commercial flight with their just their drivers licenses as proof of identification.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Travelers From Some States Will Soon Be Required to Show a Passport to Fly Domestically", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/22/some-states-will-soon-require-a-passport-to-fly-domestically-n2055416", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/2014-07-16T212408Z_3_LYNXMPEA6F151_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRAVEL-THANKSGIVING.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Beginning in 2016, individuals from New York, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Louisiana, and American Samoa will no longer be able to board a domestic commercial flight with their just their drivers licenses as proof of identification.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Travelers From Some States Will Soon Be Required to Show a Passport to Fly Domestically", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/09/22/some-states-will-soon-require-a-passport-to-fly-domestically-n2055416", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/2014-07-16T212408Z_3_LYNXMPEA6F151_RTROPTP_3_USA-TRAVEL-THANKSGIVING.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Travelers From Some States Will Soon Be Required to Show a Passport to Fly Domestically , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Agency notes individuals affected by the Real ID requirements may use an alternative form of identification documents such as a U.S. passport or Permanent Residency Card.\n\"Preventing terrorists from obtaining state-issued identification documents is critical to securing America against terrorism,\" DHS explains.\nThe TSA will also accept Enhanced Driver\u2019s Licenses, the kind that are currently used to replace passports for travel to and from Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\nFor families from these states, at least children under 18 years old do not need ID when traveling with a companion.\n\"As the 9/11 Commission noted, \"For terrorists, travel documents are as important as weapons.\"\""}
