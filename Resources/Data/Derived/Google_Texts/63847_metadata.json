In addition, employers taking such an approach will be hit with an ACA-mandated penalty of $2,000 for each full-time employee.\n\nFor example, the Affordable Care Act's least expensive bronze plans still have deductibles that may reach $4,000 to $6,000, he said.\n\nSome employers provide high-deductible plans in that range but \u201cameliorate that deductible\u201d with a health savings account or a health reimbursement arrangement, he said, but \u201cthat's not available on the public exchange.\u201d\n\nStill, the majority of employers \u201cexpect and want to continue to offer benefits to their employees \u2026 and not just because it's mandated or required, but because it's the right thing to do\u201d and its value proposition, said Rob Harkins, Willis' Boston-based practice leader for private exchanges.\n\nPrivate exchanges, though not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d for tackling all costs, may offer opportunities to control annual increases by establishing a set dollar amount on how much employers will contribute toward coverage, Mr. Harkins said.\n\nCurrently, only 2% of organizations use a private health exchange, according to SHRM research. However, there is a large amount of interest, said Bruce Elliott, manager of compensation and benefits for SHRM, and more employers may jump on the trend as the Cadillac tax \u201cgets closer and closer\u201d and more employers figure out they'll be affected, Mr. Elliott said.\n\nSome large companies, like Walgreen Co., CVS Health Corp. and IBM, have already moved to a private exchange, Mr. Elliott said, and he predicts midsize and smaller companies will shift as 2018 approaches.\n\nA private exchange offers a defined contribution model, so the employer can decide whether it wants to provide a set amount of money per type of benefit or a lump sum per month for all benefits combined, Mr. Harkins said.\n\nThat way, the employer has \u201cvalue in addressing your long-term costs because your budget can be set a little bit better than what you're doing right now,\u201d he said.\n\nFamiliar shopping experience\n\nOne thing to note is that private exchanges are technology platforms that essentially provide an online shopping experience to employees, Mr. Harkins said, and \u201cthat's something people know how to do and do often.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe intuitively know how to shop for something, to pay the least amount of money to get the highest value for what we're buying,\u201d he said. And though it's a complicated subject, exchanges help answer a lot of the questions that employees have about benefits, he said.\n\nThey also provide more choice for plans than the one, two or three plans typically offered by employers, and \u201cpeople like choice,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, private exchanges will help with the extensive IRS reporting requirements for full-time employee health coverage by providing a \u201cvehicle that could take all your benefits and put it into one neat package, and give you the employer the ability to (create) the report that you need to submit to the government,\u201d Mr. Harkins said.\n\nThey also reduce the administrative burden on employers. Mr. Harkins said Willis moved to a private exchange during the past year for its 8,000 U.S. employees. In the past, the Willis human resources team handled questions and issues employees had during enrollment about benefits choices.\n\nBut last season, the private exchange \u201chelped navigate a lot of the questions individuals had,\u201d and the exchange provider offered a team of people to address further questions.\n\nWhen deciding which exchange to use, employers should look at the structure of the platforms, which insurance providers the exchanges use, whether they allow fully insured or self-insured plans or both, and whether they have any limitations on plan design, Mr. Harkins said.\n\nIf a platform is prebuilt by an exchange provider, make sure it's in line with what you hope to offer employees. If not, look for a more customizable platform, he said.\n\n\u201cWe're in the midst of a transformation in our industry,\u201d Mr. Harkins said. \u201cI do believe that five years, 10 years down the line, the concept of a private exchange is going to be the norm.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business Insurance", "description": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The 40% excise tax on high-cost health care plans set to go into effect in 2018 is driving employer interest in private health insurance exchanges as a way to control costs and avoid the tax, Willis North America Inc. experts said at the Society for Human Resource Management Inc....", "title": "Employers look to private exchanges to control health costs - Business Insurance", "url": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150701/NEWS03/150709988", "image": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CB/20150701/NEWS03/150709988/AR/0/health-insurance-costs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 The 40% excise tax on high-cost health care plans set to go into effect in 2018 is driving employer interest in private health insurance exchanges as a way to control costs and avoid the tax, Willis North America Inc. experts said at the Society for Human Resource Management Inc....", "image_src": "http://www.businessinsurance.com/assets/rwd/bi-logo-footer.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "title": "Employers look to private exchanges to control health costs - Business Insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce9ce\"", "article_summary": "Currently, only 2% of organizations use a private health exchange, according to SHRM research.\n\u201cI do believe that five years, 10 years down the line, the concept of a private exchange is going to be the norm.\u201d\nPrivate exchanges, though not a \u201csilver bullet\u201d for tackling all costs, may offer opportunities to control annual increases by establishing a set dollar amount on how much employers will contribute toward coverage, Mr. Harkins said.\nMr. Harkins said Willis moved to a private exchange during the past year for its 8,000 U.S. employees.\nBut last season, the private exchange \u201chelped navigate a lot of the questions individuals had,\u201d and the exchange provider offered a team of people to address further questions."}
