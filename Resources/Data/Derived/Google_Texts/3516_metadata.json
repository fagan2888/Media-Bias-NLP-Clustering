That\u2019s why it carried such weight when Reid described the Koch brothers in a speech on the Senate floor as \u201cabout as un-American as anyone that I can imagine.\u201d Coming from a typical Democratic politician lacking Reid\u2019s powers of patriotic discernment, this would have been shameful hyperbole. From Reid, it was a peerless act of taxonomy.\n\nWhat immediately had him so exercised was anti-Obamacare ads funded by the Koch brothers, but surely other potentially un-American activities lurked in the back of his mind. David Koch gave $100 million to a theater in New York City so people can perform ballet and opera there. Has David Koch never thought to invest in cowboy poetry? No wonder Reid harbors the darkest suspicions about his true loyalties.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nActually, of course, Harry Reid long ago established his comfort making any half-witted partisan attack. In his cracked version of forensic accounting, he said in 2012 that Mitt Romney hadn\u2019t paid taxes in 10 years \u2014 because he had heard it from some guy.\n\nIf you want to score a contest between the Koch brothers and Harry Reid over who has contributed more to America, it doesn\u2019t seem close. The Koch brothers got wealthy creating productive industries that employ tens of thousands of people. Harry Reid got (obviously much less) wealthy as a career politician.\n\nAny one of the Koch brothers\u2019 many major philanthropic ventures \u2014 say, the $100 million to New York Presbyterian Hospital, or just the $35 million to the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Natural History \u2014 will do more good than Harry Reid\u2019s constant maneuvers to try to protect his vulnerable incumbents.\n\nReid\u2019s maligning of the Koch brothers is part of a deliberate, party-wide effort to attack the politically engaged libertarian duo. Groups that the Kochs have donated to or are affiliated with have spent some $30 million on the midterm elections so far, with more on the way. For Democrats, that is a mortal sin.\n\nThere is no consistent standard here. In 2004, Reid didn\u2019t complain about a globe-trotting billionaire who made a mint through currency speculation spending more than $25 million trying to defeat President George W. Bush. By Reid\u2019s standard, George Soros was as robustly American as John Wayne in the \u201cSands of Iwo Jima.\u201d\n\nYou can litigate the accuracy of the ads by Koch-supported groups, but as a genre, attack ads play fast and loose (although there\u2019s no reason for anti-Obamacare ads to be anything but strictly accurate, since there\u2019s so much material to work with). You can disagree with their politics, but they broadly represent about half of America. You can lament their spending, but welcome to our world.\n\nIt used to be that political parties mattered much more. In their wisdom, campaign-finance reformers passed restrictions hamstringing them. This predictably elevated the importance of outside players. The Koch brothers are hugely influential, but the left doesn\u2019t lack for people trying, in Reid\u2019s stilted terms, \u201cto buy America.\u201d Green billionaire Tom Steyer has pledged to spend $100 million supporting Democrats this year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Opinion: The break-glass-in-emergency Democratic option in tough midterms is finding a boogeyman.", "title": "The Un-American Anti-Koch Campaign", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/03/anti-koch-campaign-rich-lowry-104604.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/12/140312_lowry_reid_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Opinion,Koch Brothers,Harry Reid,Lowry Opinion", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Opinion: The break-glass-in-emergency Democratic option in tough midterms is finding a boogeyman.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9617\"", "article_summary": "Opinion The Un-American Anti-Koch CampaignSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has high standards for American-ness.\nWhat immediately had him so exercised was anti-Obamacare ads funded by the Koch brothers, but surely other potentially un-American activities lurked in the back of his mind.\nThe Koch brothers got wealthy creating productive industries that employ tens of thousands of people.\nHarry Reid got (obviously much less) wealthy as a career politician.\nStory Continued BelowActually, of course, Harry Reid long ago established his comfort making any half-witted partisan attack."}
