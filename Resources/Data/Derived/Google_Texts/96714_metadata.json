The researchers believe the influence of positive care-taking and emotional support for Alzheimer's patients goes a long way. While these patients may not remember the most recent visit from loved ones, those feelings will still remain; caring actions can have a lasting impact.\n\nThe authors of the study discovered this after showing Alzheimer's patients clips of happy and sad movies, and seeing that the patients sustained emotional states of either happiness or sadness despite the fact that they couldn't remember the movies. \u201cThis confirms that the emotional life of an Alzheimer's patient is alive and well,\u201d Edmarie Guzm\u00e1n-V\u00e9lez, a doctoral student in clinical psychology and an author of the study, said in the press release. Interestingly, the patients who remembered less of the movies experienced longer sadness.\n\nIn other words, providing patients with small joys really does make a difference \u2014 even if you automatically assume they won't remember these things. While Alzheimer's patients' ability to retain memories, languages, or reasoning might deteriorate, their ability to feel emotions and sense other people's emotions remains strong even at the end.\n\nIn a previous study, fellow authors Daniel Tranel of University of Iowa and Justin Feinstein of the University of Tulsa studied the emotional needs of Alzheimer's patients, stating that it was extremely important to pay attention to these as the number of people living with the disease is expected to increase to some 16 million by 2050. Other research has shown that the emotions of Alzheimer's patients mimics that of people around them. So if you're ever caring for an Alzheimer's patient, remember that every little action counts in providing them with a happy environment.\n\n\u201cOur findings should empower caregivers by showing them that their actions toward patients really do matter,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n-V\u00e9lez said in the press release. \u201cFrequent visits and social interactions, exercise, music, dance, jokes, and serving patients their favorite foods are all simple things that can have a lasting emotional impact on a patient's qualify of life and subjective well-being.\u201d\n\nSource: Guzm\u00e1n-V\u00e9lez E, Feinstein J, Tranel D. \"Feelings Without Memory in Alzheimer Disease.\" Cognitive & Behavioral Neurology, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "emotion, alzheimer's emotional state, dementia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "While Alzheimer's patients may forget your face and name, they won't forget the happiness you bring them.", "title": "Even Without Their Memories, Alzheimer's Patients Feel Strong Emotions", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alzheimers-patients-still-feel-strong-emotions-despite-fading-memories-why-caretakers-305060", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/25/alzheimers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While Alzheimer's patients may forget your face and name, they won't forget the happiness you bring them.", "title": "Even Without Their Memories, Alzheimer's Patients Feel Strong Emotions", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/alzheimers-patients-still-feel-strong-emotions-despite-fading-memories-why-caretakers-305060", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/25/alzheimers.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/25/alzheimers.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-09-25T14:45:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-25T14:45:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "While Alzheimer's patients may forget your face and name, they won't forget the happiness you bring them."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11b1\"", "article_summary": "While Alzheimer's patients' ability to retain memories, languages, or reasoning might deteriorate, their ability to feel emotions and sense other people's emotions remains strong even at the end.\nOther research has shown that the emotions of Alzheimer's patients mimics that of people around them.\nProviding Alzheimer's patients with emotional care and support even when their memory has faded is essential to giving them a higher quality of life.\nThe researchers believe the influence of positive care-taking and emotional support for Alzheimer's patients goes a long way.\nIn other words, providing patients with small joys really does make a difference \u2014 even if you automatically assume they won't remember these things."}
