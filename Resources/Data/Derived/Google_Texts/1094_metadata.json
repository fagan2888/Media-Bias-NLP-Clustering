The authors have appealed that decision to the 2nd Circuit.\n\nTuesday\u2019s decision also allows disabled users who cannot read printed material to gain access to copies of the works in alternative forms, including using software that converts the text into spoken words.\n\n\u201cNever before has disability been irrelevant to the opportunity to conduct library research,\u201d lawyer Daniel Goldstein, who argued the case on behalf of the National Federation for the Blind, said in an email. \u201cUntil now, the number of library books available to the blind were minuscule.\u201d\n\nThe decision largely affirmed an October 2012 dismissal of the case by the late U.S. District Judge Harold Baer.\n\nThe appeals court returned the case to district court to determine a narrow issue over whether authors can challenge the library\u2019s policy of offering replacement copies to member libraries if their copies are destroyed and cannot be obtained at a fair price.\n\nBaer died last month at age 81. The case will be reassigned to another judge.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Tom Brown)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Universities and research libraries that created a searchable online database for millions of books did not violate copyright protections belonging to auth", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "Universities and research libraries that created a searchable online database for millions of books did not violate copyright protections belonging to auth", "title": "Court Rules Searchable Database Is 'Fair Use' of Copyrighted Books", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "updated_time": "2014-06-15T22:37:03-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/06/15/331789.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Universities and research libraries that created a searchable online database for millions of books did not violate copyright protections belonging to auth", "title": "Court Rules Searchable Database Is 'Fair Use' of Copyrighted Books", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "creator": "@ijournal", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2014-06-15", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "Google fair use doctrine", "published_time": "2014-06-15T22:32:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-15T22:37:03-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "Universities and research libraries that created a searchable online database for millions of books did not violate copyright protections belonging to authors whose works were scanned, a U.S. appeals court ruled last week.\nCircuit Court of Appeals in New York said the HathiTrust Digital Library, which began in 2008 and has scanned more than 10 million works, constituted a \u201cfair use\u201d of copyrighted works.\nThe court also said the authors had to show how the library harmed them economically, because the search function is not a substitute for the books themselves.\n\u201cUntil now, the number of library books available to the blind were minuscule.\u201dThe decision largely affirmed an October 2012 dismissal of the case by the late U.S. District Judge Harold Baer.\nWriting for a unanimous three-judge panel, Circuit JudgeBarrington Parker said the database did not simply reproduce the books but offered a \u201ctransformative use\u201d of them."}
