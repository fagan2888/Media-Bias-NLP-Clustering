White House DENIED: Judge Clears Way For Obamacare Lawsuit To Proceed

Rachel Stoltzfoos

A federal judge dealt House Republicans another win in their lawsuit against the Obama administration Monday, denying the White House a chance to appeal her ruling that the House has grounds to sue over Obamacare.

Federal Judge Rosemary Collyer rejected the administration’s request for a quick appeal of her ruling, reinforcing her earlier decision and clearing the path for the suit to move forward, reported the Associated Press.(RELATED: Judge Rules Republicans Can Proceed With Lawsuit)

“It’s another important step toward holding the president accountable for his unconstitutional actions,” House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement Monday.

The suit centers on more than $150 billion in federal health insurance subsidies provided by Obamacare to low-income enrollees to reduce their payments. The House argues the subsidies are illegal, because Congress never appropriated the funds, but the administration argues its drawing the funds from an appropriate pool of already authorized funds.

The administration requested the fast-track appeal on the grounds the ruling will have far-reaching consequences. As a result of Judge Collyer’s decision, the White House will not be able to appeal until next year after the court hears arguments from both sides and issues a ruling.
