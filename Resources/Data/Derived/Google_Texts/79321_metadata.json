Some states that run their own sign-up systems extended their deadlines beyond the end of January, meaning the numbers could still increase.

When the law was passed in 2010, the Congressional Budget Office projected enrollment would reach a total of 21 million enrollees by 2016.\n\n\n\nThe sign-ups topped the midpoint of the government\u2019s estimate from October, when the U.S. predicted that 11 million to 14.1 million people would pick marketplace plans for 2016, the third year of Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges. Investors and politicians have been tracking the weekly figures closely as an indicator of how the Affordable Care Act is faring.\n\n\n\nGovernment officials had been expecting smaller coverage gains this year on the marketplaces. Burwell has previously said it would be tougher to increase enrollment this year than last, because those who remain uninsured are harder to reach.\n\n\n\nPresident Barack Obama, Burwell and other administration officials gave more than 250 radio and television interviews and traveled at least 48 times to visit local sign-up events.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 12.7 million people signed up for individual health insurance or renewed policies under the Affordable Care Act, as enrollment accelerated during the final deadline week for most people to buy 2016 Obamacare coverage.
