But political reality could force the next president to uphold the agreement regardless of how sceptically they view it \u2013 especially if Iran appears to be complying with its terms come January 2017.\n\n\u201cIf there is a relatively good record of compliance with the deal for the next year and a half or so, it would be quite challenging for the next president, whoever that may be, to actually throw that out,\u201d said Liz Rosenberg, a senior fellow and director of the energy economics and security programme at the Center for a New American Security.\n\nAlthough a future president technically has the power to reimpose sanctions for which Obama has offered relief, such a move would come with all sorts of challenges to international and diplomatic relationships with both allies and adversaries, she added.\n\nThe US and European sanctions were successful in bringing Iran to the negotiating table due in no insignificant part to the fact that they operated in tandem. Without buy-in from Europe to also reimpose its own sanctions on Iran, such action by an American president would serve as more of a symbolic move than one bearing substantial leverage.\n\n\u201cThere is a mistaken belief amongst many that the US has an overwhelming and punishing amount of economic pressure that it can turn on whenever it wants, against whomever it wants in any circumstance,\u201d said Rosenberg.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the European Union has already telegraphed its approval of the deal to the US Congress, where lawmakers have 60 days to review the terms before holding an up-or-down vote to either approve or reject it. The Senate foreign relations committee will hold its first hearing on Iran on Thursday, and a vote is not anticipated until after Congress returns from recess in September.\n\nObama has said he will veto any efforts to block the agreement, and Republicans would need 43 House Democrats to band with them in order to achieve the two-thirds majority required to override a presidential veto. Although Democratic lawmakers were cautious in their reaction to the deal last week, it\u2019s unlikely that many of them would buck their own president on what is being viewed as a legacy-defining moment for the Obama White House.\n\nIn a bid to persuade sceptics of the deal, EU foreign ministers emphasised that there was no better alternative following a unanimous vote by the UN security council that endorsed the nuclear accord.\n\nHow much international support there would be if the US walked away from the deal and called for the restoration of sanctions would be a critical factor in any new administration\u2019s assessment of how to proceed, said Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served on the US delegation to the Iran nuclear negotiations from 2009 to 2013.\n\n\u201cIf the assessment was that no one would follow the US in striking the sanctions, that would be a factor arguing against walking away \u2026 If Iran is complying with the deal and is not making trouble in the region, then the administration may well find it may not have support,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, if Iran is dragging its feet and compliance problems have arisen, that would make it much easier for a new president to walk away from the deal.\u201d\n\nEinhorn also expressed doubts that a Republican president, for all of the bluster among the current crop of candidates, would actually turn his back on an agreement if it appeared to be working.\n\n\u201cWhatever candidates may say today, his administration will take a look at the situation prevailing at the time. It won\u2019t rely exclusively on what was said a year and a half earlier,\u201d he said.\n\nBush has conceded as much in recent days, pointing out in what was seen as a thinly veiled shot at Walker that a day-one promise to rescind US support for the deal would be impractical.\n\n\u201cOne thing that I won\u2019t do is just say, as a candidate: \u2018I\u2019m going to tear up the agreement on the first day.\u2019 That\u2019s great, that sounds great but maybe you ought to check in with your allies first, maybe you ought to appoint a secretary of state, maybe secretary of defence, you might want to have your team in place, before you take an act like that,\u201d Bush told reporters after a town hall in Carson City, Nevada, on Friday.\n\nHe later expanded upon those comments amid criticism from some on the right that he was weakening his position, reiterating his belief that the deal must be revoked \u2013 but again taking a more nuanced approach that acknowledged the role that must be played by US allies in order for a new round of sanctions to be impactful.\n\n\u201cAs president I would begin immediately to responsibly get us out of this deal, with a comprehensive strategy that is responsive to the conditions at the time and confronts Iran\u2019s continued pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability, its support for terrorism and instability, its ballistic missile proliferation, and its horrific human rights record,\u201d Bush said in a statement to the Weekly Standard.\n\n\u201cSuch a strategy will require a new national security team that is committed to rebuilding our defences and restoring our alliances, starting with our relationship with Israel. It will require sustained diplomatic efforts to put significant financial, diplomatic, and military pressure on Iran to change its behavior. And because of the massive sanctions relief provided by this terrible deal, the impact of unilateral US sanctions will be limited and it will be important to work with our allies to reimpose multilateral sanctions and pressure.\u201d\n\nRubio took an opposing view during an interview with CNN on Sunday when asked what he would do as president if allies refused to go along with the US.\n\n\u201cOur foreign policy as a nation is not subject to what China wants to do or Russia wants to do or the EU wants to do or anybody wants to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have our own foreign policy. It needs to be in the national security interests of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut in charting its own course of action, irrespective of whether Iran was complying with the deal or not, the US might only be inflicting harm upon itself.\n\n\u201cThe US would be in a situation where it would presumably then say we\u2019d reimpose sanctions which would only hurt, for the most part, US businesses, which would then turn on whichever administration,\u201d said George Perkovich, vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nPushback from the business community, which traditionally favours Republicans, would be especially salient. Perkovich, an expert on Iran who focuses on nuclear strategy and nonproliferation, added that the US acting alone to dismantle the deal would also do little to change Iran\u2019s behaviour if they\u2019re already complying with the agreement and not beholden to similar threats from other supporters of the agreement.\n\nIf anything, he said, it could backfire and energise moves by other countries to become less dependent on the US financial system.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that it could accomplish is to make Republican primary voters feel better that their candidates are expressing their fears and passions,\u201d Perkovich said. \u201cOne of these people might get elected \u2026 the question will be, do they feel like they\u2019re obligated to do something just because they said it at this moment.\u201d\n\nPolling at this particular moment finds that a slim majority of Americans, at 56%, supports the Iran deal but remains sceptical that it will succeed.\n\n\n\nViews differ sharply when broken down by party affiliation, offering further rationale for Republican candidates blasting the agreement - just four in 10 Republicans support it, while 54% are opposed. Democrats, on the other hand, support the deal by a 69 to 25% margin.\n\nObama, for his part, projected confidence last week that history was on his side as far as how the deal would ultimately be viewed \u2013 as would efforts to squander it.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t choose wisely, I believe future generations will judge us harshly for letting this moment slip away,\u201d he said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "If Iran is complying with terms of the nuclear accord then any future Republican president may find dismantling it a very difficult task", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Sabrina Siddiqui", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "If Iran is complying with terms of the nuclear accord then any future Republican president may find dismantling it a very difficult task", "title": "Why Republican promises to scrap Iran nuclear deal may not be met", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/21/iran-nuclear-deal-why-republican-promises-scrap-may-not-be-met", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3908272d9f9099d68e5cf30130d1a9ac9bd3d611/0_0_3752_2252/master/3752.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=2c99bd41f27aa5670542261025658cc8", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2015/jul/21/iran-nuclear-deal-why-republican-promises-scrap-may-not-be-met?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/21/iran-nuclear-deal-why-republican-promises-scrap-may-not-be-met", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2015/jul/21/iran-nuclear-deal-why-republican-promises-scrap-may-not-be-met?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "creator": "@SabrinaSiddiqui", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3908272d9f9099d68e5cf30130d1a9ac9bd3d611/0_0_3752_2252/master/3752.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2015/jul/21/iran-nuclear-deal-why-republican-promises-scrap-may-not-be-met?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Iran's nuclear programme,Iran,US news,Republicans,World news,Middle East and North Africa,US politics,US elections 2016,Nuclear weapons", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-07-21T10:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sabrina-siddiqui", "section": "World news", "modified_time": "2016-05-25T14:19:40.000Z", "tag": "Iran's nuclear programme,Iran,US news,Republicans,World news,Middle East and North Africa,US politics,US elections 2016,Nuclear weapons"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3908272d9f9099d68e5cf30130d1a9ac9bd3d611/0_0_3752_2252/3752.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=ffe8b07618a5dbe3c3f97faefb86c5f3", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Iran's nuclear programme,Iran,US news,Republicans,World news,Middle East and North Africa,US politics,US elections 2016,Nuclear weapons"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd449\"", "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidates have almost uniformly declared their intentions to unravel Barack Obama\u2019s nuclear accord with Iran if elected to the White House in 2016.\nDemocrats, on the other hand, support the deal by a 69 to 25% margin.\nIt will require sustained diplomatic efforts to put significant financial, diplomatic, and military pressure on Iran to change its behavior.\nBut according to numerous foreign policy experts their bold campaign pledges might be difficult to keep 18 months from now.\nThe statements are not surprising in an election year where national security has emerged as a highly potent issue among Republican primary voters, who view the Iran deal as the latest in a string of foreign policy failures under the Obama administration."}
