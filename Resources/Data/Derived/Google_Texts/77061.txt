Richie Incognito, the Miami Dolphins offensive guard, granted his first TV interview to Fox Sports. Speaking to Fox’s Jay Glazer, the football player defended the racial slurs he had sent to former teammate Jonathan Martin, which reportedly prompted Martin to quit the team and led to Incognito’s suspension.

In the interview, Incognito suggests that racist parlance and goading is simply an entrenched part of locker room culture. “This isn’t an issue about bullying,” Incognito said. “This is an issue of my and John’s relationship. You can ask anybody in the Miami Dolphins locker room, ‘Who had John Martin’s back the absolute most?’ and they will undoubtedly tell you me.”
