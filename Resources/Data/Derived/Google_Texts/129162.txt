Wichita Police say a man was stabbed to death after trying to break into a car early Sunday morning.

It happened around 4 a.m. Sunday in the 400 block of South Clifton. Police say 32-year-old Carl Cooper was trying to break into a car in a driveway when he was spotted by the woman who owns it. At the same time, two friends of the woman were pulling up and started chasing Cooper.

Eventually, they caught up with Cooper and allegedly stabbed him multiple times. Cooper walked to a nearby home and the occupants called 911. He died yesterday at a Wichita hospital.

Officers have arrested two men, ages 30 and 34, for the stabbing. Cooper and both suspects have criminal records.
