The highway will be down to one northbound lane, as the \u201cclimbing lane\u201d will be closed for the duration of the project and speed limits will be reduced. One lane will be open in each direction, but CDOT advises motorists to expect delays of up to 15 minutes.\n\nQuestions about the project are directed to CDOT\u2019s public information team at 720-770-1770 or via e-mail at us285@publicinforteam.com.\n\nJosie Klemaier: 303-954-2465, jklemaier@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JosieKlemaier", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "U.S. 285 construction to curb dangers at Shaffer\u2019s Crossing to be complete in October", "title": "U.S. 285 construction to curb dangers at Shaffer\u2019s Crossing to be complete in October", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/25/u-s-285-construction-to-curb-dangers-at-shaffers-crossing-to-be-complete-in-october/", "image": {"width": 302, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825__mapp1.jpg", "height": 290}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150825__mapp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-25T13:18:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T05:01:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Crews are installing tensioned cable rail barriers near mile marker 231 at Elk Creek Road, commonly known as Shaffer\u2019s Crossing.\nA portion of U.S. 285 is under construction this week to improve a section of the highway that has been plagued with accidents.\nThe now $683,000 project is expected to be completed in October and also includes a wider median, the installation of gutters, rumble strips and new striping.\nOne lane will be open in each direction, but CDOT advises motorists to expect delays of up to 15 minutes.\nIn March, two people were killed when the motorcycle they were riding was hit by a car traveling in the wrong direction."}
