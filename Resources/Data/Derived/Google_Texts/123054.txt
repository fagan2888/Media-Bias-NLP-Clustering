Wyoming

Retirement security score: 9 out of 10

The Cowboy State received the best overall score, thanks to its lack of a tax on pension income, and low housing costs. Wyoming consistently ranks among the best states for taxes (for retirees and non-retirees alike), and it looks like itâ€™s going to stay that way: A recent report by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University ranked its overall fiscal condition second in the country (after Alaska).
