The most talked about health care issues have centered on the rollout of new health insurance and Medicaid coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act. However, another watershed reform of our health care system has been taking root across the country, relatively unnoticed and with many governors at the helm.\n\nThese efforts are focused on broad, statewide reforms designed to dramatically alter the way we think about, deliver and pay for health care. The reforms move away from a siloed and fractured delivery system and are focused on two key objectives: improving the health of the nation, and reducing the financial burden of health care on the government, employers and individuals.\n\nThe drive for these reforms results from several key pressures. Perhaps most urgent is the fiscal pressure bearing down on states. Governors have acutely experienced the effect of decades of rapidly escalating health care costs, and almost all states are under a requirement to balance their budgets. Governors must, therefore, account for growth in spending in Medicaid and CHIP, state employee and retiree health insurance, and indigent health care. Often these increases must be funded by increased tax revenue or reductions in other areas of state spending, for example education or transportation.\n\nThese concerns are underscored by constituents who routinely and with greater frequency reach out for help. They struggle with the cost of health care on their household budgets as well as the negative effects of the fragmented delivery system on their health outcomes. Similarly, large and small employers reach out to governors about health care costs and quality issues, which can significantly affect governors\u2019 ability to create high-quality and sustainable jobs in their states.\n\nWe work with governors to develop and implement innovative solutions to public policy challenges. In that context, we assist governors with many projects focused on reforming state health care systems. Governors\u2019 approaches to these reforms are as varied as their constituencies\u2019 philosophical and political ideologies. The projects leverage the unique ability and interests of governors in reforming the health care systems of their states.\n\nControl of Supply: A Critical Strategic Tool for Governors\n\nThis post focuses on the key roles that states play in reforming their individual health care systems. Given the expansion of states\u2019 purchasing roles in the Affordable Care Act, the health policy community recently has focused on governors\u2019 ability to significantly affect demand for services as major purchasers of health care, as well as their abilities to develop a statewide vision and unify reform activity in the public and private sector.\n\nAlthough important, there is another critical, often underutilized ability of governors: the ability to affect the supply of services (see figure 1). Supply-focused reforms can have a dramatic effect on the health care system, including increased access to care, reduced costs, greater efficiency, and higher quality of care. As discussed below, governors are beginning anew to think about the most efficient ways to oversee the supply of services. Many of these reforms are targeted at improving the training and accreditation of the health care workforce, not only to meet current needs, but also to refashion the workforce to operate in a more integrated and efficient manner.\n\nIn addition, governors are examining the appropriateness of antitrust restraints on the integration and consolidation of health care providers as systems move toward population health-focused delivery systems and payment reforms built upon payer-provider shared risk. Governors also are considering the supply of new technologies related to telehealth, pharmaceuticals, medical procedures, medical devices, and the degree to which the supply of these services can facilitate efforts to drive toward higher-quality and more efficient care.\n\nFIGURE 1\n\nGovernors as Purchasers\n\nThroughout the nation, states represent one of the most significant sources of funding for health care, including as purchasers of Medicaid, the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, state employee health coverage, state retiree health coverage, and indigent care. In addition, states and localities are the most significant purchasers of public health and behavioral health services, as well as community support services. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, states may opt to take on another important purchasing role through oversight of the new state-based health insurance exchanges or \u201cmarketplaces.\u201d\n\nTaken together, these purchasing roles and responsibilities provide governors with the ability to profoundly shape the payment and delivery of health care as well as fundamentally define access to services. Equally important, these reforms set influential market signals for employers and other private sector health care purchasers.\n\nStates define payment rates, benefit structures network adequacy, and scope of benefits through their purchasing role. One of the most direct effects can be the result of the contract terms governors set with payers and providers. For example, we are working with states to develop best practices around Medicaid purchasing and contracting related to quality, value, program integrity, and data use to improve quality and reduce costs. Some states and employers also have reintroduced \u201creference pricing,\u201d which establishes a price cap allowed for specific high-volume or high-cost procedures and can include a warranty to cover follow-up care over a period of time (for example, six months).\n\nGovernors are leading the way in delivery and payment reforms. For example, we are currently working with states through the State Innovation Models (SIM) design program run by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. These governors are harnessing all of their purchasing roles to reorganize the delivery and payment systems. In some cases, they are designing statewide medical home initiatives that provide payments to clusters of primary care providers. Those providers act as coordinators of care and advocates for patients as they navigate secondary, tertiary, quaternary and post-acute sites of care.\n\nOther governors are considering more aggressive reforms that organize providers and hospitals by episodes of care, or even more broadly into risk-bearing accountable care organizations. These models aim to alter fee-for-service economics and the underlying drive toward siloed, high-volume care by allowing providers to profit by keeping patients healthy or more efficiently addressing patients\u2019 medical needs as they arise.\n\nSome of the most powerful governor-led purchasing reforms (as well as regulator and convener reforms) are creating more interoperable and data-driven health care systems. Governors are re-examining contracts to explore if claims and real-time clinical data can be made available to providers. With robust near-real-time data exchange, providers can identify problems prospectively and prevent negative outcomes and inefficient use of resources. For example, providers can use new real-time systems to identify specific inpatients who are likely to return as unnecessary readmissions and alter their care to prevent this. In addition, these data are being used to identify outpatients whose chronic illness is not being managed adequately, and to allow providers to identify patients who may be \u201cleaking\u201d out of coordinated care teams and networks such as medical homes and accountable care organizations.\n\nImportantly, these data can be used to empower consumers. Data can be analyzed to provide information to consumers about quality, cost, and patient satisfaction. For example, when follow-up testing, ancillary services, or other care is recommended, data about quality and cost are being integrated with provider payment rates and cost-sharing rules to inform patients about the quality of care and out-of-pocket costs associated with different providers throughout a community (e.g., out-of-pocket cost of different MRI providers, physical therapists or dialysis centers). In addition, new algorithms integrate patient clinical data so that patients can understand the effect of specific behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation) and chronic disease management (e.g., pharmaceutical compliance) on their health outcomes.\n\nOne of our newest projects focuses on governors using data to identify \u201csuper-utilizers\u201d within Medicaid programs. The work builds on the success of the Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers and Dr. Jeffrey Brenner, a partner on the project. States aggregate key data sources such as Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurer pharmacy, laboratory and health-information-exchange data to identify patients receiving extraordinarily high levels of service with poor outcomes. For example, the data might identify a Medicaid patient who is visiting the emergency department monthly or being admitted to the hospital many times a year. Once these \u201csuper-utilizer\u201d patient categories and characteristics have been identified, we work with governors to significantly improve patient outcomes and produce significant savings. Many interventions focus on breaking down the silos among health care programs, behavioral health programs, and community and social support services. Governors, who oversee all these silos, are uniquely suited to focus on these efforts.\n\nThese efforts are allowing a small portion of health care spending to be redirected in novel ways to address the medical and psychosocial needs of patients. Thus, these reforms dramatically improve patients\u2019 quality of life and outcomes, while at the same time saving state Medicaid programs and the larger health care system millions of dollars.\n\nFIGURE 2\n\nGovernors as Regulators and Administrators\n\nGovernors also are tackling health reform as their states\u2019 chief regulators and administrators. In this role, governors directly affect both the supply and demand for services as well as functioning in an oversight capacity, pushing toward greater health care transparency and addressing population-level factors that affect disease incidence and prevalence.\n\nPerhaps one of the most important areas of activities being leveraged anew in many states is the regulation of the supply of health care services. For example, governors have oversight or influence over most systems that develop and train the health care workforce. Through state funding, they finance and regulate many of the training programs at state colleges and universities, as well as provide support for clinical and community-based training programs. Governors also can influence accreditation standards and scope-of-practice laws, as well as leverage certificate-of-need or other state legal restrictions on the supply of health.\n\nIn many states, governors also work to address health workforce shortages by developing recruitment and retention strategies, such as tax credits for practicing in underserved communities, loan repayment programs, or credentialing simplification programs. Governors are at the forefront of building telehealth capacity to expand the reach of services.\n\nWe are currently working with governors to create a strategic vision for the health care workforce in their states. This effort focuses on addressing current health care workforce shortages as well as training the workforce needed in the coming decades to meet the demands of an aging population and increased disease burden across evolving delivery models. This work also examines the roles of returning veterans and the ways in which health care training within the armed services can be leveraged to fill civilian workforce needs.\n\nIn addition, we are focused on helping governors oversee health care systems through regulation. For example, governors are working to unify and broaden the application of quality standards and value-based purchasing strategies across both public and private systems. In addition, new federal law has provided governors resources and new requirements in overseeing the health insurance industry that can be leveraged to drive whole-scale change in the system.\n\nAs the private and public sectors examine changes in delivery systems and payments to organize providers and aggregate risk, governors also are re-examining state responsibilities to oversee antitrust regulation and other anti-competitive practices. In some cases, NGA is working with governors to examine ways to relax laws and regulation to allow providers to organize more easily when financial incentives are properly aligned. In other instances, we are working with governors to strengthen review and promote transparency as a counterbalance to widespread consolidation occurring in the health industry.\n\nSimilarly, governors are considering action around state medical malpractice laws and the implications of malpractice regimes for states\u2019 efforts to seek more efficient care.\n\nGovernors are examining new roles within longstanding public health administrative responsibilities to affect the overall health of a population or community, decrease demand for services, and provide sustainable funding for public health systems. For example, in some projects governors are focusing on reinvesting in community resources such as obesity prevention programs, sidewalks, and parks. These efforts are directly affected by governors\u2019 environmental oversight and administrative responsibilities to protect air and water quality as well as other forms of environmental pollution. In addition, public health education campaigns and efforts \u2013 particularly those related to healthy behaviors and chronic illness \u2014 can improve the overall health of state residents and decrease the demand for health services.\n\nSimilarly, governors oversee the management of state parks and recreation resources, urban redevelopment, and youth programs, all of which can affect the overall health of a community. Governors are leveraging their administrative roles within education to help develop a strong foundation of health and nutrition knowledge, healthy behaviors, and physical activity in children and adolescents. They are also exploring funding mechanisms like prevention trusts and public impact bonds that provide funding in the shorter-term for public health investments that pay-off in the longer term.\n\nFIGURE 3\n\nGovernors as Conveners\n\nAnother powerful role for governors in the transformation of the U.S. health care system transcends direct gubernatorial authority and relates to governors\u2019 abilities to convene stakeholders from across the states. First and foremost, governors have the ability to set and communicate a statewide vision around transformation. These efforts are found in a multitude of projects with states.\n\nFor example, in our SIM work, governors convene stakeholders to generate input and buy-in for their State Health Innovation Plans. In addition, much of our workforce technical assistance to states is focused on developing a statewide strategy, including helping governors craft a stakeholder buy-in process to develop consensus and broad-scale support for a new health care workforce for the state. Much of our maternal and child health (MCH) work focuses on convening key stakeholders within the MCH community to build a statewide vision for improving birth outcomes for mothers and babies. In some of the instances through our SIM, workforce, or MCH work, governors tie their new vision of reform to a package of state legislative reforms. Thus, vision setting is a critical step in building support for legal and regulatory reforms.\n\nEqually important, governors have the ability to bring together the public and private sectors to develop a unified vision of health care transformation. This is particularly important as reform efforts aim to shift economic incentives away from fee for service and toward a more efficient and high-quality population health-focused delivery system. For example, in NGA\u2019s work on payment reform, governors have focused on bringing large employers and small businesses together with providers and payers to create unified payment and delivery strategies. Without private sector buy-in, it is more difficult for governors to create an economic incentive strong enough to overwhelm existing fee-for-service incentives. Moreover, governors can bring these same groups together to create unified data-sharing agreements to meet federal requirements and push past longstanding concerns that prevent providers and payers from opening up data sources for the public good. These efforts often focus on developing voluntary consensus across stakeholders to bridge the interests of consumer advocates, providers, employers and payers.\n\nConclusion\n\nMomentum continues to build across the nation toward reforming the way we think about, pay for, and deliver health care. Many governors are at the center of these efforts and are pushing to develop a more cost-effective system that integrates care, promotes wellness and drives out waste. While political wrangling will continue for some time around the new health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion, important and constructive work is underway in states to ensure better outcomes for Americans and to reduce the financial burden of health care costs on the country, states, employers, and individuals. The imperatives for these reforms will grow even more powerful if the new coverage reforms take root.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/12/17/the-untold-story-of-2013-governors-lead-in-health-care-transformation/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "The Untold Story Of 2013: Governors Lead In Health Care Transformation"}, "description": "The Untold Story Of 2013: Governors Lead In Health Care Transformation | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca032\"", "article_summary": "The most talked about health care issues have centered on the rollout of new health insurance and Medicaid coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act.\nIn that context, we assist governors with many projects focused on reforming state health care systems.\nFIGURE 1Governors as PurchasersThroughout the nation, states represent one of the most significant sources of funding for health care, including as purchasers of Medicaid, the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, state employee health coverage, state retiree health coverage, and indigent care.\nGovernors must, therefore, account for growth in spending in Medicaid and CHIP, state employee and retiree health insurance, and indigent health care.\nThe projects leverage the unique ability and interests of governors in reforming the health care systems of their states."}
