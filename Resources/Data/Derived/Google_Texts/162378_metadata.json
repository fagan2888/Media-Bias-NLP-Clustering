After announcing the rate hikes, Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Mike Rothman said the state would still have some of the cheapest individual health insurance rates in the country.

They have turned out to be \"sicker\" and \"more expensive\" than they anticipated. The rate hikes led Republican House Leader Kurt Daudt to call for the abolition of MNsure, and for it to be replaced by\u00a0the\u00a0federal health exchange, Healthcare.gov.
