People who tried to cancel were stuck with an extra fee of up to $480.\n\nThe agency also accused DirecTV of failing to tell people that premium channels such as HBO and Showtime \u2014 which come for free during the first three months of their subscription \u2014 will automatically renew for about $48 per month, unless the subscriber actively orders them to be canceled.\n\nDirecTV spokesman Darris Gringeri called the FTC\u2019s decision \u201cflat-out wrong\u201d and said the company \u201cwill vigorously defend ourselves, for as long as it takes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go above and beyond to ensure that every new customer receives all the information they need, multiple times, to make informed and intelligent decisions,\u201d he added in a statement to The Hill. \u201cFor us to do anything less just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nThe agency is seeking refunds for people affected by the practice and also wants a court to prohibit DirecTV from instituting similar practices in the future.\n\nAll told, that could add up to \u201cmany millions of dollars,\u201d according to Jessica Rich, the head of the FTC\u2019s consumer protection division.\n\n\u2014 This report was updated at 1:28 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The FTC is charging the nation's largest satellite provider with deceptive pricing.", "description": "The FTC is charging the nation's largest satellite provider with deceptive pricing.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The FTC is charging the nation's largest satellite provider with deceptive pricing.", "title": "Feds accuse DirecTV of pricing scam", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/235339-feds-accuse-directv-of-pricing-scam", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/directtv_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-11T14:19:50-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-11T14:19-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/235339-feds-accuse-directv-of-pricing-scam", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-11T12:46-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "DirecTV, Federal Trade Commission,Edith Ramirez,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-11T12:46:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-11T14:19:50-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/235339-feds-accuse-directv-of-pricing-scam", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The FTC is charging the nation's largest satellite provider with deceptive pricing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds accuse DirecTV of pricing scam"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds accuse DirecTV of pricing scam"}, "article_summary": "Federal officials are charging DirecTV with bilking its subscribers by locking them into long-term contracts without clear details about future rates.\n\u201cDirecTV sought to lock customers into longer and more expensive contracts and premium packages that were not adequately disclosed.\nAfter an introductory 12-month period, subscribers\u2019 bills rose by as much as $45 per month, the FTC alleged.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cDirecTV misled consumers about the cost of its satellite television services and cancellation fees,\u201d FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement.\nAll told, that could add up to \u201cmany millions of dollars,\u201d according to Jessica Rich, the head of the FTC\u2019s consumer protection division."}
