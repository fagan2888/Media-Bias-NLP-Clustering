With students not paying into SHIP remaining students end up paying more.\n\nThere are currently about 2,500 students enrolled in SHIP that will need to find a new health insurance plan for the fall.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a mere business decision on Boise State\u2019s half,\u201d said Dominick Carlyle, a sophomore sociology major. \u201cEssentially what the Affordable Care Act does is make it so that they can\u2019t skimp out on certain requirements being met for health insurance, so it\u2019s going to cost the university a lot more money.\u201d\n\nAccording to Brooks, Health Services will be working with Your Health Idaho and local health insurance brokers to assist students in finding health insurance.\n\nWhile students no longer have to worry about the countless emails at the beginning of the semester reminding them to waive out of SHIP, all full-time students must provide proof of health insurance coverage in compliance with Affordable Care Act compliant policy.\n\nAccording to the SBOE meeting\u2019s archives, students who are found not having insurance while enrolled at an institution will be ineligible for full-time enrollment in future terms until insurance is obtained and proof of that insurance is provided.\n\n\u201cWe certainly had students that were unhappy that the university required them to be enrolled in the SHIP, and I\u2019m sure that there will be students who are going to be unhappy now that it\u2019s removed,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cI think that the balance is just trying to make sure that everybody has resources available to them.\u201d\n\nBrooks said that Health Services will invite students to campus and ask questions. They can get information on and have assistance in finding insurance coverage that\u2019s best for their individual situations.\n\n\u201cThe university should provide health insurance, especially when they\u2019re requiring it,\u201d said Faris Aldosary, a senior finance major. \u201cBut when I look at the price tag I say, \u2018You know, it\u2019s not that worth it.\u2019 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s suitable for students at all since it\u2019s a state college.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.boardofed.idaho.gov/meetings/board/archive/2015/02_18-19_15/08_IRSA.pdf", "article_metadata": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=id380802889?", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "description": "Boise State discontinues student health insurance plan.
