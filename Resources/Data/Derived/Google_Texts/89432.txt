Donald Trump said he'll probably make an announcement about a presidential campaign in June or July.

KCCI's Mark Tauscheck said he sure sounded like he's planning on running as he spoke to a group of reporters on his private plane Wednesday.

The jet prominently features Trumps name on the outside.

Trump greeted reporters like a flight attendant. He then gave a tour of his plane.

"I do well in polls, and no one thinks I'm running. We may very well surprise a lot of people," said Trump.

He sells himself as an unconventional candidate.

"Every country in the world takes advantage of the United States like we're a bunch of babies, and that won't happen if I'm in charge -- believe me," said Trump.

He said that if he runs his priorities would include stopping nuclear proliferation, building up the military and health care.

"I would end Obamacare and replace it with something terrific, for far less money for the country and for the people," said Trump.

From his plane, he went straight to Simpson College in Indianola, where he talked business success and imparted life advice.

The head of Simpson's political science department, Dr. Kedron Bardwell, said he doesn't think Trump could win a presidential election, but said his presence and his money could shape the rest of the Republican field.

"I think the problem for all those candidates is Trump takes attention, and if he can buy a spot at the straw poll and can pay for a lot of volunteers, he can wind up pushing people further back into the second tier than they otherwise would have been and if that happens we know from past experience their campaign is over," said Bardwell.
