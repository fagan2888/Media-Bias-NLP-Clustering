It didn't go well. As he explains in a column:\n\nMy use of the words \u201cmentally retarded\u201d (when Samantha Bee asked me who might be willing to work for $2 per hour \u2013 a figure she suggested) has come to define the entire interview. Although I had no intention of offending anyone, I just couldn\u2019t remember the politically correct term currently in use (it is \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d). Assuming she knew it, Bee could have prompted me with the correct term, but she chose not to. By including those comments in the final package, \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d proved that they did not care who they offended, as long as they could make me look bad in the process. The volume of hate mail I have received in the show\u2019s aftermath confirms their success on that front....\n\n\u201cThe Daily Show\u201d was never interested in an honest debate about the minimum wage. Nor is it concerned with the intellectually disabled, whom they have no qualms about offending if they can get a laugh. In fact, it's \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d that wants to tell the intellectually disabled they are worthless, as they want to make it illegal for them to have jobs. I did not notice any intellectually disabled people working at \u201cThe Daily Show.\u201d I\u2019m sure many would jump at the chance, particularly if they were offered minimum wage or higher. But since they choose to pay their intellectually capable interns zero, why should they be expected to pay the intellectually disabled more?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/02/01/peter-schiff-on-the-daily-show-talking-m", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "Investment guru and free-market proponent Peter Schiff was recently on The Daily Show for a segment about the minimum wage.
