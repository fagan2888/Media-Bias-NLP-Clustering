The total for auto loans is now $1.008 trillion. Nearly 75 million consumers have an open car loan account, 5 million more than the same period last year.\n\nThe average car loan balance also rose to $14,515, up 2.7 percent from the second quarter, while the delinquency rate remained flat at 1.16 percent.\n\n\u201cWhen people feel good about their job prospects and finances, they go on vacation, they buy a new car,\u201d says Ezra Becker, vice president of research and consulting in TransUnion\u2019s financial services unit. \u201cWhen balances go up, it\u2019s not necessarily a harbinger of doom.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Ways the Fed\u2019s Looming Rate Hike Touches You\n\nThe car loan figures echo growth in credit cards, too. Balances on credit cards rose 4.7 percent, while the delinquency rate inched up 1.43 percent, half of where it was in the third quarter 2009.\n\nIn the second quarter, the most recent data, 15.2 million new cards were issued, up 12 percent from last year and the most since the third quarter of 2009. New cards issued to those with blemished credit increased 25.3 percent year over year.\n\n\u201cWe believe the number of consumers having access to credit cards to be at a new modern high,\u201d says Paul Siegfried, senior vice president and credit card business leader for TransUnion.\n\nTransUnion\u2019s credit report also noted that the mortgage delinquency rate continued its five-year decline to 2.4 percent. Millennials and those over 65 represent the least risky mortgage borrowers, while Florida experienced the biggest decline in its mortgage delinquency rate, to 3.75 percent from 6.42 percent a year ago.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "U.S.", "title": "Americans Now Owe $1 Trillion in Car Loans", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Americans-Now-Owe-1-Trillion-Car-Loans", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-03-17T174425Z_2_CBREA2G18EO00_RTROPTP_2_GM-DEALERS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/18/Americans-Now-Owe-1-Trillion-Car-Loans", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-03-17T174425Z_2_CBREA2G18EO00_RTROPTP_2_GM-DEALERS.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd309c\"", "article_summary": "Nearly 75 million consumers have an open car loan account, 5 million more than the same period last year.\nTransUnion\u2019s credit report also noted that the mortgage delinquency rate continued its five-year decline to 2.4 percent.\nThe average car loan balance also rose to $14,515, up 2.7 percent from the second quarter, while the delinquency rate remained flat at 1.16 percent.\nMillennials and those over 65 represent the least risky mortgage borrowers, while Florida experienced the biggest decline in its mortgage delinquency rate, to 3.75 percent from 6.42 percent a year ago.\n\u201cWhen balances go up, it\u2019s not necessarily a harbinger of doom.\u201dRelated: 10 Ways the Fed\u2019s Looming Rate Hike Touches YouThe car loan figures echo growth in credit cards, too."}
