(London Guardian) He was a trusted heart specialist who stepped in swiftly whenever he thought his patients were in peril, rushing them in for sophisticated tests and the promise of life-saving surgery.

But federal investigators found that behind his professional demeanor, patients were falling victim to a vast confidence trick driven by greed.

Dr Harry Persaud, 56, protested his innocence to the Guardian on Tuesday after it was revealed that the Ohio-based cardiologist will spend 20 years in prison for putting patients through invasive tests and open heart surgery that they did not need – billing insurers for millions in the process.

He claims the US government has targeted him under the auspices of President Obama’s Affordable Care Act, to try to force doctors to cut down on procedures, thus saving money.
