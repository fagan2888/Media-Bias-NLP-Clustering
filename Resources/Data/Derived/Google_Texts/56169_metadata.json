Gen. William \u201cJerry\u201d Boykin and retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Paul E. Vallely condemned Obama\u2019s decision, as U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel approved up to 4,000 boots on the ground from a previous ceiling of 3,000.\n\nWND Exclusive: Why deploy soldiers to fight Ebola? Joseph Farah asks pertinent questions about U.S. military mission in West Africa\n\nThe concern is that these soldiers, who will be exposed to the environment where the virus is prevalent, could bring it to the United States and potentially spread the disease as they rotate back to the United States and are assigned to other units.\n\nAs WND reported, the soldiers would be responsible for command, control, logistics, civil affairs and medical assistance, even though U.S. officials emphasized that their exposure to Ebola would be limited.\n\nThe soldiers would not be exposed to patients, except for Navy units that will maintain labs to test samples for the Ebola virus. Already two such portable labs have been set up. They can process some 100 samples in one day.\n\n\u201cThis is a president who thinks like a community organizer and not like a commander-in-chief who takes his responsibility for his troops seriously,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cAt a time when our military has been at war for 13 years, suicide is at an all-time high, [post-traumatic stress disorder] is out of control and families are being destroyed as a result of 13 years of war, the last thing the president should be doing is sending people into West Africa to fight Ebola.\u201d\n\nThese military personnel, Boykin said, don\u2019t have any qualifications to fight an Ebola epidemic environment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what the military does,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen [General] Douglas MacArthur in 1962 stood in the mess hall of West Point and made a very impassioned statement, he looked at [the cadets] and said, \u2018Your mission remains fixed, determined and inviolable. It is to fight and to win the nation\u2019s wars.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat should be what the president is focused on now. The mission of the military is to fight war, not to fight Ebola,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cIt is a misuse of our military, and I for one am very opposed to this [deployment].\u201d\n\nBoykin pointed out that there will be no inoculation for Ebola prior to troop deployment. Defense Department spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said that the only preparation service members will receive before heading to West Africa will be briefings on the disease.\n\n\u201cIt still comes back to the question whether this is a military mission,\u201d Boykin said. \u201cAt this point, no. It is not a military mission, and given the 13 years of war, this is the last thing we should be doing.\u201d\n\nBoykin questioned where the United Nations was in forming a coalition to send into West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic.\n\n\u201cWhat about the other African nations? What about a coalition? Where is the U.N.?\u201d Boykin asked. \u201cThere should be a U.N. coalition to try to stem the tide of this Ebola [epidemic]. This isn\u2019t a U.S. military operation, and it should not be a U.S. military-led operation.\u201d\n\nKirby, the Pentagon spokesman, made clear to WND in response to a question at his daily news conference that other countries\u2019 response to the epidemic, including the U.N., comes only from an invitation of the government of Liberia, basically evading the issue of any U.N. initiative.\n\nHe said that the government of Liberia specifically had asked for U.S. assistance.\n\nIn questioning the lack of a U.N. response, Boykin expressed outrage over its immediate response when Israel defends itself from Hamas rockets in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\u201cLet the Israelis respond to one bombing or one missile attack,\u201d Boykin said, \u201cand the U.N. will come out of hiding.\u201d\n\nEchoing Boykin\u2019s concern over the use of the military to fight Ebola, Vallely not only said it\u2019s a \u201cbad idea,\u201d but also warned the U.S. military already has been \u201cput through so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of other assets that America has if it wants to go over there and build hospitals and clearing centers and things like that,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSo, I think it is a very bad misuse especially when [U.S. troops] now are being asked to step up to the plate again in Iraq. So, I think it is a very bad decision on Obama\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nThree weeks ago, Obama had declared the Ebola outbreak to be a \u201cnational security priority.\u201d\n\nHowever, Vallely said the Ebola event can be \u201ctwisted or contorted into that, but the military isn\u2019t the only one involved in the security of America.\u201d\n\nIn fighting the Ebola disease, he said there is the Center for Disease Control and, \u201cOther parts of the government can step up to the plate to put up the necessary security or contractual-type arrangement to build facilities for security. I just think it is a very bad misuse of our military. It\u2019s just another bad decision on Obama\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nPentagon officials emphasized that U.S. service personnel would be in a support role only and would not have direct access to Ebola patients, even though U.S. Navy lab technicians will be handling samples to determine whether patients are infected with Ebola or not.\n\n\u201cIt is so na\u00efve to say (U.S. troops) won\u2019t be exposed but they\u2019ll be in an area of infectious diseases,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSo, just by the nature of being over there puts you in an environment of exposure of an infectious disease.\n\n\u201cWe have so many threats on our border, so many threats coming out of the Middle East and the threat of terrorists coming into the United States that there are other assets that can be put to a contractual use to provide security [in Ebola-affected regions] or to provide other support activities,\u201d Vallely said.\n\nPentagon officials said that the military also would be providing command and control, in addition to logistical support, but Vallely underscored that the military isn\u2019t the only asset to provide such services.\n\n\u201cThere are many capabilities that can support communications \u2013 again that\u2019s something that can be contracted out, and it\u2019s been done before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good idea to put our soldiers in harm\u2019s way especially when you look at how Obama has treated our military.\n\n\u201cSoldiers will do what you ask them to do, but there\u2019s a certain point where you have to say, \u2018Let\u2019s see, what\u2019s the purpose?\u2019 and the purpose of our soldiers is to fight a war and win,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not to fight medical battles. That\u2019s up to other assets.\u201d\n\nF. Michael Maloof, senior staff writer for WND/ G2Bulletin, is a former security policy analyst in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
