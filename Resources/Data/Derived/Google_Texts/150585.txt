Anthony Delmundo/New York Daily News Mayor de Blasio holds up his new Municipal ID card on Monday.

The rollout of the city’s municipal ID program won’t turn into a debacle like Obamacare enrollment, Mayor de Blasio promised Wednesday.

De Blasio insisted the city could cope with demand for the cards after the website set up to let New Yorkers make appointments to get an ID crashed Wednesday. The city switched to an appointment-only system because of long lines that had swamped enrollment centers.

“I don’t think I could find a better case of apples and oranges,” de Blasio said of a comparison of the faulty Obamacare website.

“This is a very, very important initiative that will ultimately, I think, reach tens of thousands, and over time probably hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers. But the demand we saw on the first day was in the thousands. It wasn’t like healthcare.gov where you had to deal with millions and milion of people.”

De Blasio said the appointment system at nyc.gov/idnyc would be fixed.

“We're going to fix the website situation,” he said. “This was a high demand dynamic. That's a good thing. But we're going to fix that situation. That's going to be back up and running soon.”

As of Wednesday afternoon, the site was still not allowing visitors to schedule appointments.

In the meantime, people interested in getting a card can show up in person at an enrollment center to make an appointment for a later time to apply, de Blasio said.

The municipal IDs, which launched Monday, are intended to help undocumented immigrants, the homeless, and others who have trouble getting government identification. They're available to all New Yorkers.
