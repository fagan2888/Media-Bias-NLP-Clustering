EarthSky.org brought the below list to my attention today. It lists some of the hottest and coldest places on Earth. GB Energy put together this image.

Death Valley here in the United States holds the record for the hottest air temperature every recorded. For many years there was a debate on this hot location. Some believed a location in Libya held the record, while others claimed it was Death Valley. After an investigation of records, it was determined Death Valley was the winner.

The Grand Canyon is on the list for reaching 120° on three separate locations at Phantom Ranch, which is at the bottom of the canyon. The hottest temperature ever recorded in Arizona is 128°.

One of the most interesting hot places on the list is the Cave of the Crystals in Mexico, about a four hour drive straight south of El Paso. Click here to see photos taken inside this cave published in a National Geographic article. Note in the picture how small the people in the orange jumpsuits are compared to the massive crystals. It looks surreal but it certainly is a reality.

The United States is also on the list for some of the coldest spots on Earth. Mount McKinley in Alaska is the coldest mountain on Earth. While Mount Everest is the highest, that peak is close to the equator. Mount McKinley is near the Arctic Circle. Not too far away is Barrow, Alaska, which is also on the list and inside the Arctic Circle. Barrow spends about 90% of each year below freezing.
