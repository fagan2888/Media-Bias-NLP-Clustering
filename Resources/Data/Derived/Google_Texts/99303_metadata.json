She then leaned in toward pharmacy manager Tim Logan and asked softly, \u201cDoes licorice cause high blood pressure?\u201d\n\nSmiling, Logan turned to his computer. After about a minute, he told her it could, if someone consumes 30 grams or more a day for several weeks.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the Paradise Valley resident said with a sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t eat that much.\u201d\n\nThe brief exchange between Sellers and Logan has become an increasingly common scenario. Today\u2019s pharmacists are taking a more hands-on approach to patient care by going back in time to when interactions were more personal, not just another sale at the cash register. And consumers are making a visit to the pharmacist their first-line defense for health care.\n\nThe trend is timely. Some pharmacists are anticipating an increase in customer questions, as people who navigate the Affordable Care Act look for convenience and cost savings to manage their health.\n\nEven Marigene Starr, a retired nurse in Phoenix, relies on her local pharmacist, Teresa Stickler, to help her stay well. \u201cI\u2019ve had questions about whether different medications will work well with each other or which supplements are OK. Over time, I\u2019ve needed to change my drugs for one reason or another and they are really super-helpful.\u201d\n\nTeresa Stickler, who owns Melrose Pharmacy in central Phoenix, also enjoys educating people about their medicines and symptoms.\n\nShe says most of her customers are between 40 and 60 years old; some tell her it\u2019s less embarrassing to ask a pharmacist about low testosterone, for example, than it is to ask a doctor.\n\nAlong with routine questions about side effects for prescribed medicines, Stickler says customers often have very specific concerns. \u201cCan niacine cause flushing?\u201d Yes. \u201cWhat can I do to improve my sex drive?\u201d Prescribed hormones may help. \u201cCan I eat grapefruit with my medicine?\u201d Grapefruit interacts with so many medicines that she advises against it.\n\nAnother local pharmacist, Rosy Vallin, who runs Rosy\u2019s Pharmacy in north Phoenix, grew up in a small town in Texas and wanted to be a doctor. But when she volunteered at the local pharmacy, she watched in awe as the pharmacist dealt with customers.\n\n\u201cI saw how everything worked and how he knew every single person in town.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe interacted with customers. They had known each other for a long time. They\u2019d say, \u2018I trust you more than I trust my doctor.\u2019 I wanted that. I wanted to help guide them through their medications.\u201d\n\nKelly Ridgway, chief executive officer of the Arizona Pharmacy Association, says people are going to pharmacists more often today for vaccinations and help figuring out medications. The ease of getting a flu shot at the local drugstore encouraged some people to get other vaccines, like immunizations against shingles and pertussis, taken care of there as well, she says.\n\nBut pharmacists, who complete years of training and study to obtain a doctor of pharmacy degree, can do much more than give shots and advice. Some are entering into collaborative agreements with doctors to help consumers manage such chronic conditions as diabetes and high cholesterol. They also are allowed to check a customer\u2019s blood pressure and cholesterol and conduct other preventive health screenings. Medicare and most insurers won\u2019t reimburse them for those procedures, but Ridgway says the industry is working to change that.\n\nLike Vallin, Richard Herrier, a professor at the University of Arizona College of Pharmacy in Tucson, remembers a time when the pharmacy was the first stop for a community\u2019s medical needs. As a teenager in a small California town during the 1960s, \u201cWe never went straight to a doctor,\u201d Herrier says. \u201cWe went straight to the pharmacist. He triaged things and if it was something complicated, then he\u2019d suggest going to see one of the docs.\u201d\n\nBut more often than not, Herrier says, customers were able to get their basic medical questions answered right in the drugstore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what pharmacists used to do all the time, but the profession kind of got away from that,\u201d Herrier said.\n\nThey went from spending much of their time at the front counter where they could easily engage customers to being several feet away where they\u2019d concentrate on sorting pills into bottles.\n\nTo help reinforce the transition, several businesses, such as Safeway and Walgreen Co., are revamping their pharmacies, creating lower counter fronts and casting them in cheerful colors.\n\nSome of the remodeling adds space for private consultations between pharmacist and customer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we want to be independent physicians,\u201d Herrier says. But pharmacy is heading toward the clinical practice of medicine.\n\n\u201cMoney makes the world go round and now the profession is working hard to get Medicare-provider status. Don\u2019t be surprised someday at a (walk-in medical) Minute Clinic to see a nurse practitioner working with a pharmacist.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Connie Cone Sexton", "description": "Pharmacists taking more personal approach to health care,Some pharmacists are anticipating an increase in customer questions, as people who navigate the Affordable Care Act look for convenience and cost savings to manage their health.", "pubdate": "Sun Nov 10, 2013  2:58 PM", "creditline": "The Republic | azcentral.com", "headline": "Pharmacists taking more personal approach to health care", "section": "Healthyliving", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2he4", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "title": "Pharmacists taking more personal approach to health care"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Pharmacists taking more personal approach to health care, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"description": "Some pharmacists are anticipating an increase in customer questions, as people who navigate the Affordable Care Act look for convenience and cost savings to manage their health.", "title": "Pharmacists taking more personal approach to health care", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/healthyliving/articles/20131110pharmacists-personal-health-care-vaccines.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "account_id": 13115682}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda00\"", "article_summary": "Today\u2019s pharmacists are taking a more hands-on approach to patient care by going back in time to when interactions were more personal, not just another sale at the cash register.\nAs a teenager in a small California town during the 1960s, \u201cWe never went straight to a doctor,\u201d Herrier says.\nEven Marigene Starr, a retired nurse in Phoenix, relies on her local pharmacist, Teresa Stickler, to help her stay well.\nSome pharmacists are anticipating an increase in customer questions, as people who navigate the Affordable Care Act look for convenience and cost savings to manage their health.\nBut when she volunteered at the local pharmacy, she watched in awe as the pharmacist dealt with customers."}
