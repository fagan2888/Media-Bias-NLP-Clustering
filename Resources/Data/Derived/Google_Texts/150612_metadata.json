In her home, Betts primarily experiences a problem with smells and uses chlorine to combat the problem.\n\nOther homes, though, routinely experience sewage backups, backups that in at least one case ultimately required thousands of dollars in renovation work, Betts said.\n\ncaleb.bedillion@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @CalebBedillion", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Caleb Bedillion Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Sewer problems have afflicted residents of the Green Tee Road area for many years \u2013 including raw sewage backing into homes and the lingering presence of foul odors \u2013 and the Lee County Supervisors are now seeking a federal grant to help alleviate these issues. \u201cGreen Tee has \u2026", "title": "Lee County leaders seek solution to sewer issues - Daily Journal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://djournal.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/42/files/2015/03/county_lee_green-130x130.png", "url": "http://djournal.com/news/lee-county-leaders-seek-solution-to-sewer-issues/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "By Caleb Bedillion Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Sewer problems have afflicted residents of the Green Tee Road area for many years \u2013 including raw sewage backing into homes and the lingering presence of foul odors \u2013 and the Lee County Supervisors are now seeking a federal grant to help alleviate these issues. \u201cGreen Tee has [\u2026]", "creator": "@djournalnow", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/djournal.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/42/files/2015/03/county_lee_green-130x130.png?fit=130%2C130", "title": "Lee County leaders seek solution to sewer issues - Daily Journal", "site": "@djournalnow", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=486426430, affiliate-data=1l3vpBD, app-argument=http://djournal.com/news/lee-county-leaders-seek-solution-to-sewer-issues/", "fb": {"admins": 26506061, "app_id": 441890629197277}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/djournalnow", "section": "Local Government", "published_time": "2016-04-09T07:06:59-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=1075"}, "article_summary": "\u201cGreen Tee has been suffering for years and years,\u201d said District 4 Supervisor Tommie Lee Ivy.\nGladys Betts, vice president of the Green Tee neighborhood association, spoke to supervisors during a public hearing Monday on the proposed grant application.\nBetts has lived in the Green Tee neighborhood more than 30 years.\n\u201cThe sewer was never properly put in.\u201dOfficials and residents estimate that anywhere from 140 to 170 homes are impacted by the inadequate sewer infrastructure.\nThe Three Rivers Planning and Development District is assisting the county and preparing an application for a Community Development Block Grant."}
