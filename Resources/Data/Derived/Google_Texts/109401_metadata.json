As a nation, we waste 31 percent of the food we produce each year. Yet 14.3 percent of American households found it difficult to put food on their table last year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) could not sit idly by as managers from farms, processing facilities, supermarkets, dining facilities, and restaurants voiced their concerns on donating wholesome unsold food because of fear of liability.\n\nThe USDA hosted its third platform in its U.S. Food Waste Challenge Webinar series designed for leading food recovering initiatives to share their strategies and efforts, and debunk any misconceptions on donating. Five panelists presented during the \u201cDonating Unsold Food - A Primer on Liability, Food Safety & the Good Samaritan Act,\u201d including Food Recovery Network, Feeding America, University of Arkansas School of Law, Rock and Wrap It Up!, and Bon App\u00e9tit Management Company Foundation. The webinar was the most highly attended webinar event for the USDA to date and invited food recovery advocates and interested listeners to ask questions at the end of the presentation.\n\nOne of the questions posed is frequently asked by parents who are searching for a way to help in their community: Can whole fruit that was placed on a tray and not eaten be donated? New research our of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found six out of 10 students won\u2019t even take one bite of a healthy food option off their school lunch tray. After a short 20- to 30-minute lunch period in the U.S., students or lunchroom workers dump their trays into the trash. Food safety regulations intimidate most schools from saving an uneaten fruit cup, banana, or bag of pretzels. So can they?\n\n\u201cYes, but you have to check with your local health department to see what rules they have around that,\u201d Waste Specialist Claire Cummings, from Bon App\u00e9tit Management Company Foundation, said in the webinar, adding:\n\nSometimes if there are rules against donating some fresh produce, you can work around it by getting the organization you are donating to sign a waiver. I would like to add that milk is always in high demand at food pantries and food banks. Donated milk from schools would help. You just have to make sure recovered food is refrigerated quickly and properly. But food recovery programs in schools are always great, especially if they involve students. It\u2019s a great teaching opportunity showing students how food waste impacts environment and hunger.\n\nThere is a heaping 133 billion pounds of uneaten food thrown out in America every year. A large majority of the food is perfectly safe and nutritious and had the potential to be donated to a hunger relief organization to feed hungry people. Instead, it wastes away in a landfill, representing laziness, gluttony, and ignorance. There is a disconnect from farm to fork, which is why the USDA handpicked the five webinar organizations to offer a solution and intervention before the food hits the landfill.\n\nFood Recovery Hierarchy on U.S. Food Waste Challenge Webinar series Photo courtesy of Bon App\u00e9tit Management Company Foundation\n\nTo highlight just one of the many organizations, Bon App\u00e9tit Management Company Foundation is a leader in food recovery. It's been serving seafood that strictly meets the Seafood Watch sustainability guidelines since 2002, serving rBGH-free milk, and has been reducing antibiotic use in farm animals since 2003, among other efforts.
