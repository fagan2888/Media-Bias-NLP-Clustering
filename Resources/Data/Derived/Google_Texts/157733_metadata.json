What would be the best insurances to get as an organ transplant post-patient? I am considering either Blue Shield/Blue Cross or Aetna under PPO category (not HMO). Your input would be much appreciated!\n\n\n\nLone Star State Survivor\n\nDear Lone Star State Survivor,\n\nBecause of health reform, you will find that plans are more similar to one another than they used to be. So, there is no such thing as a \u201cbad\u201d plan or a \u201cgood\u201d one at least not insofar as what drugs or services are covered. There are wide differences in co-pays and deductibles, and perhaps in rates depending upon how many carriers are competing. The Texas health insurance exchange has 12 carriers, though not all may have coverage statewide.\n\nInsurers cannot turn you away, or charge you more based upon your being an organ transplant patient. However, this is only true during open enrollment or when you have a family status change that lets you change or join a plan mid-year.\n\nAs an organ transplant patient, you will be affected by the plan\u2019s benefit for prescription drugs and the provider network. You will want to find out whether your doctor is in the plan, and how much you will have to pay for your anti-rejection drugs. You might want to \u201cscreen\u201d plans based upon this criteria, and then look at the deductibles, co-pays, and rates.\n\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to get help from an insurance agent, who can advise you about your specific situation. You can find a licensed agent at the National Association of Health Underwriter\u2019s directory.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Health Unsurance", "description": "Hello from Texas!
