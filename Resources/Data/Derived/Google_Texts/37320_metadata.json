The floors of the MSU Riley Center as well as 5th Street were packed with vendors from all over who were selling jewelry, shirts, and unique Christmas gifts.\n\n\"It's just a lot of handmade crafts that people have put their heart and soul into making,\" Collinsville native Beverlee Grey said. \"We've tasted some of the foods so a lot of great foods.\"\n\nMany of the vendors say that shoppers took advantage of the numerous deals that they had whether it was the indoor market or the outdoor market. Organizers say the local economic impact from this is significant, as it draws people to the Merry Meridian Market.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity for people who don't necessarily have a business,\" Meridian Main Street Spokesman Rusty McAlister said. \"They just have a passion or a craft that they have and they want to showcase that product and make a little money. Also, you'll have the larger boutiques who come and will display a portion of their store right here in the Riley Center.\"\n\nAlthough the weather was a little rainy to start the day off, shoppers and vendors say since then the weather has been cooperative even though the sun wasn't shining.\n\n\"It was a little rough this morning with setting up in the rain and getting the bottoms of the jeans a little soggy, but it's been nice this afternoon,\" Grey said.\n\nOrganizers as well as vendors say all in all the day has been a successful one for the market whether it be coming for the food, the vendors, or just to have fun.\n\n\"We are very pleased,\" McAlister said. \"It has been a crowd that is continual. You know people shop, they eat, and then they leave and a whole new group of faces will come.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Shoppers take in the annual Merry Meridian Market.", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "Shoppers take in the annual Merry Meridian Market.", "title": "Christmas Shopping at Merry Meridian Market", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Christmas-Shopping-at-Merry-Meridian-Market-284979341.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/915/CCA/915CCA938CEE47919FCE04BB64CEC74E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/BA5/F10/BA5F10BBB9984B979B5BA6F0E87ABCF4.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Shoppers take in the annual Merry Meridian Market.", "title": "Christmas Shopping at Merry Meridian Market", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Christmas-Shopping-at-Merry-Meridian-Market-284979341.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Merry+Meridian+(400x225).jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Christmas Shopping at Merry Meridian Market", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Christmas Shopping at Merry Meridian"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc2bd\"", "article_summary": "Organizers say the local economic impact from this is significant, as it draws people to the Merry Meridian Market.\nMany of the vendors say that shoppers took advantage of the numerous deals that they had whether it was the indoor market or the outdoor market.\n\"This is a great opportunity for people who don't necessarily have a business,\" Meridian Main Street Spokesman Rusty McAlister said.\nOrganizers as well as vendors say all in all the day has been a successful one for the market whether it be coming for the food, the vendors, or just to have fun.\nIt's an event that's expected to boost the local economy and get many in the Christmas spirit."}
