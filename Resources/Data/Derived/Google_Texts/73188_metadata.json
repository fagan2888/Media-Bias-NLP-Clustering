Michele Bachmann.\u201d Nor \u201cCongressman Steve Stockman.\u201d Nor a host of other lawmakers with fringe right-wing views on gay people, science, poverty, and other important issues.\n\nHowever, with every election comes a host of new politicians looking to fill their shoes. Unsurprisingly, there is no shortage of new Tea Party blood in Congress this year.\n\nIncoming :\n\nREP. TOM EMMER (R-MN) \u2013 Bachmann is leaving an outsized role to fill, but if anyone is up to the task, it\u2019s the man succeeding her in Minnesota\u2019s sixth congressional district. While running for governor in 2010, Emmer didn\u2019t argue that the minimum wage was too low, but rather too high. He proposed slashing the minimum wage for waiters, a slightly more moderate version of his 2005 plan to eliminate the minimum wage for everyone. Emmer also promised to veto anti-bullying legislation, despite the fact that a number of gay teens had recently committed suicide in Minnesota. Finally, Emmer spearheaded a conservative push to \u201cnullify\u201d Obamacare, a unconstitutional tactic used that nearly triggered a civil war three decades before the actual war of secession. REP. BARBARA COMSTOCK (R-VA) \u2013 As if the Koch Brothers didn\u2019t have enough influence over American politics already, they now have one of their own former lobbyists in the halls of Congress. (Comstock has also lobbied for the military contractor Blackwater and the private prison giant GEO Group.) In the Virginia House of Delegates, Comstock led the push for a mandatory ultrasound law, which would have originally required women who wanted an abortion, even victims of rape or incest, to first undergo a transvaginal ultrasound. She was also one of the most stringent staff investigators during 1990s-era Republican-led inquiries into Bill Clinton. REP. GLENN GROTHMAN (R-WI) \u2013 Grothman\u2019s views are as prolific as they are extreme. He believes that women are paid less because \u201cmoney is more important for men.\u201d He thinks Martin Luther King Day shouldn\u2019t be a holiday, nor should Kwanzaa because \u201calmost no black people today care about Kwanzaa \u2013 just white left-wingers who try to shove this down black people\u2019s throats in an effort to divide Americans.\u201d Grothman also doesn\u2019t believe teachers should be allowed to mention homosexuality in the classroom, doesn\u2019t believe workers should have a guaranteed weekend, and argued that voter ID might help Republicans win a close presidential election. REP. ALEX MOONEY (R-WV) \u2013 A former Maryland state senator who also once ran for the New Hampshire House, Mooney has settled on West Virginia as his new political base. During his stint as state senator, Mooney garnered a virulently anti-gay reputation, warning that LGBT people were attempting to be legally recognized as minorities, according to TPM. He also warned that advocates of gay rights were trying to curb free speech. \u201cIf you actually speak against the homosexual lifestyle, maybe from the pulpit if you\u2019re a pastor then you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said in 2008. REP. KEN BUCK (R-CO) \u2013 In 2010, Buck was one of a host of Tea Party Senate candidates, along with Christine O\u2019Donnell and Sharron Angle, who helped Republicans snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Republicans didn\u2019t make the same mistake this year, ushering in a deal for Buck to run in a conservative House district more suited to his extreme views. Those include the belief that being gay is a choice, just like being an alcoholic. He also declared in 2010 that voters should support him because, unlike his female opponent, \u201cI do not wear high heels.\u201d Finally, despite being a heavy military state with thousands of veterans, Buck once called for privatizing their health care. REP. JODY HICE (R-GA) \u2013 If Hice had his druthers, the more than 100 women currently elected to Congress better have permission from their husbands to be there. \u201cIf the woman\u2019s within the authority of her husband, I don\u2019t see a problem,\u201d he declared in 2004 when asked about the growing number of women in politics. Unsurprisingly, Hice\u2019s radical views aren\u2019t confined to gender equality. He doesn\u2019t believe Muslims should be protected by the First Amendment because Islam is \u201cnot\u201d a religion, but rather \u201ca totalitarian way of life with a religious component.\u201d He also believes homosexuality is a choice, states can (unconstitutionally) nullify federal laws like Obamacare, and the cause of the Civil War is still an open debate.\n\nOutgoing :", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Goodbye, Michele Bachmann and Steve Stockman.
