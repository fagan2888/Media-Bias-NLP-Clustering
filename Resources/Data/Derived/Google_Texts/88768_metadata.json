On the play before the game was briefly halted, Harwich third baseman Danny Zardon laced a double into left center field that made the Gatemen outfielders disappear into the mist like characters from \"Field of Dreams.\"\n\nThe Wareham offense proved to be another disappearing act.\n\nAfter a 13-3 trouncing of Chatham on Thursday, the Gatemen only managed three hits against the Harwich pitching trio of Zack Erwin, Jacob Evans, and Robby Kalaf.\n\nDespite the lack of offense, the Gatemen got a promising start from pitcher Brock Hartson, who went five innings giving up four hits and two earned runs with six strikeouts.\n\nThe other bright spot for the Gatemen was catcher John Bormann, Hartson's battery-mate at the University of Texas San Antonio. Bormann caught two runners stealing in the sixth inning and had one of Wareham's three hits.\n\nBefore the game, local youth baseball and softball teams got the chance to lineup on the field for the national anthem before longtime Tabor Academy teacher and baseball coach Dick Duffy threw out the ceremonial first pitch.\n\nThe next home game for the Gatemen (1-4) will be a double header against Chatham on Sunday, June 22 at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Sports", "google-site-verification": "Lxh-TQqnfjqDP3kBHi9EWBzFlV8uaDhicg3nJfqF3Jc", "description": "After an 90-minute delay to drain the rain-soaked Spillane Field and another 10-minute delay in the second inning due to fog, the Gatemen bats went quiet as they lost their home opener 7-0.\nHome ...", "og": {"url": "http://wareham-ma.villagesoup.com/p/1198369", "image": "http://wareham-ma.villagesoup.com/media/Common/18/61/1204484/t600-IMG_2599.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Gatemen drop home opener to Harwich 7-0 - By Bill Whelan"}, "robots": "NOARCHIVE"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8956\"", "article_summary": "The opening ceremonies for the first Gatemen game at Spillane Field in 2014.\nAfter an 90-minute delay to drain the rain-soaked Spillane Field and another 10-minute delay in the second inning due to fog, the Gatemen bats went quiet as they lost their home opener 7-0.\nAfter a 13-3 trouncing of Chatham on Thursday, the Gatemen only managed three hits against the Harwich pitching trio of Zack Erwin, Jacob Evans, and Robby Kalaf.\nThe other bright spot for the Gatemen was catcher John Bormann, Hartson's battery-mate at the University of Texas San Antonio.\nThe next home game for the Gatemen (1-4) will be a double header against Chatham on Sunday, June 22 at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m."}
