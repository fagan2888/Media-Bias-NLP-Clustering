(And if that doesn\u2019t happen this quarter, it very likely will occur when the companies report their fourth-quarter earnings next February.)\n\nOf course, Fannie and Freddie aren\u2019t allowed to \u201crepay\u201d the money they\u2019ve received from the U.S. Treasury. Here\u2019s how their agreement works: The government in 2008 agreed to inject massive sums of aid so that Fannie and Freddie would stay solvent, allowing mortgage markets to operate smoothly. In exchange, the Treasury took a new class of \u201csenior preferred\u201d shares in the companies that originally paid a 10% dividend; they also received warrants to acquire up to 80% of the firms\u2019 common shares.\n\nThe agreement doesn\u2019t provide any mechanism for Fannie and Freddie to buy back the government\u2019s senior preferred shares, which now total $188 billion. If it sounds like Fannie and Freddie are making interest payments on a loan that can\u2019t ever be repaid, that\u2019s because they are. So any discussion of \u201crepayment\u201d needs this disclaimer: Even once Fannie and Freddie have paid $188 billion in dividends, they\u2019ll still owe $188 billion.\n\nThis makes any \u201crepayment\u201d of taxpayers a mostly symbolic event\u2014one that doesn\u2019t change whether the companies can be freed from government control. And the political ramifications are altogether unclear. At a housing forum last month, Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) brushed away the idea that Fannie and Freddie should be returned to their former ownership simply after paying as much in dividends as they had borrowed. \u201cI was a venture capitalist for a lot longer than I\u2019ve been a politician. If I had put $180 billion into Fannie and Freddie back in 2009, I\u2019d expect more than a one-to-one return on that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo once I got a 30-to-one return\u2026talk to me about Fannie and Freddie making money.\u201d\n\nStill, the event is significant given that few expected it would happen this soon. What changed? Here are nine reasons the companies are paying the Treasury more money:\n\n1. The government altered the terms of its support of the companies last year. It scrapped the 10% dividend, which in some quarters had forced the companies to borrow money to pay the dividend, and instead required all profits to be sent to the Treasury as dividends. In quarters where the companies run a loss, they don\u2019t owe anything. While this hasn\u2019t changed the firms\u2019 profitability, it has sharply increased the amount of money the companies send to the government. It also prevents Fannie and Freddie from rebuilding capital. (Shareholders have filed lawsuits challenging the arrangement; Treasury and FHFA say they\u2019ve acted appropriately.)\n\nThe companies have sent $146 billion to the Treasury in dividends, with $91 billion in payments being made this year. If the old terms had been in place, the companies would have sent around $14 billion to the Treasury this year. The Treasury, meanwhile, has invested $188 billion in the companies.\n\n2. Fewer homeowners are defaulting. Fewer than 2.6% of loans backed by the companies were 90 days or more past due at the end of September. While this is still very high historically, it is down sharply from peaks of 5.5% and 4.1% for Fannie and Freddie, respectively, in early 2010. Fewer delinquencies mean fewer foreclosures, reducing the amount of money the companies have to set aside to cover loan losses.\n\n3. Home prices are up sharply over the past year. The companies estimates around loan losses are heavily sensitive to home prices because that determines how much the companies lose when they sell homes through foreclosure. Losses on foreclosures are down sharply as prices have risen. During the second quarter, Fannie lost around 25 cents for every $1 in debt that went through foreclosure, down from 35 cents one year earlier. The upshot is that the companies are foreclosing on fewer properties than a year ago, and they are losing less money when they do.\n\n4. Exposure to loans from the worst years of the housing bust is declining. Loans made in 2006 and 2007, which have been by far the worst performers, are either moving through foreclosure or refinancing, thanks to a program the companies launched two years ago that made it easier for underwater borrowers to refinance their mortgages. The dollar volume of loans from these two years has fallen by 46% through June from two years earlier, according to an analysis by Jim Vogel at FTN Financial. Home-price gains have also reduced the number of borrowers who are underwater and at risk of foreclosure.\n\n5. The companies are guaranteeing much better quality mortgages, and they\u2019re charging significantly more for those guarantees. Fannie and Freddie don\u2019t make loans but instead buy them from banks and other lenders, packaging them together and selling them off as securities to investors. They charge \u201cguarantee fees\u201d to lenders when they buy those loans, and those fees have more than doubled over the past three years. Meanwhile, the companies have tightened up lending standards, and banks have been even more cautious to guard against the risk they\u2019ll have to buy back loans that have underwriting mistakes.\n\n6. Fannie and Freddie have won some big legal settlements. The firms\u2019 regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has settled five of 18 lawsuits filed on the firms\u2019 behalf in 2011. Two of those settlements\u2014with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co for $4 billion and UBS for $885 million\u2014have been made public. Others could follow. Also, the companies have recouped billions of dollars by forcing banks to buy back defaulted mortgages that ran afoul of underwriting guidelines.\n\n7. Some of the eye-popping profits have been driven by the same accounting rules that required the companies to take eye-popping write-downs five years ago. Fannie, for example, reported a $58.7 billion profit in the first quarter, due mostly to a one-time gain of $50.6 billion from reclaiming certain tax benefits that had been written down during the bust. Freddie has around $28 billion in so-called deferred tax assets that it hasn\u2019t yet claimed, but the company has said it could recapture some of those benefits as soon as the third quarter. \u201cMuch of the current \u2018profit\u2019 is the reversal of earlier\u201d loss reserves, meaning \u201cthe original losses that caused great outrage weren\u2019t necessarily that big to begin with,\u201d wrote Mr. Vogel earlier this year.\n\n8. The firms have very little competition right now. Outside of other federal agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration, there are few investors willing to invest in mortgages or mortgage-backed securities right now.\n\n9. The companies have as close to an explicit government guarantee as they can get. Because the Treasury has made clear that it will ensure the companies have enough resources to pay bondholders, Fannie and Freddie have been able to borrow cheaply in the capital markets to fund portfolios of mortgages that, while shrinking, are still large.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A few years ago, the conventional wisdom in Washington said that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac wouldn\u2019t ever be able make taxpayers whole for the 2008 bailouts of the mortgage-finance giants.
