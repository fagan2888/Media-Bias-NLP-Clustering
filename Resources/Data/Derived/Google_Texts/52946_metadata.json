Economic woes could also be in store as a knock-on effect of the looming recession in Russia, where around 3 million Uzbeks live and work.\n\nKarimov faces three purely nominal rivals in Sunday\u2019s vote. In the previous election in 2007, he won 91 percent of the vote.\n\nSince gaining independence in 1991, Uzbekistan has pursued a policy of economic self-reliance and sought to balance its diplomatic relations with the West and Russia, playing them against one another.\n\nThe United States installed a military base in the country after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It was forced to abandon that facility in 2005 as relations between the countries soured following a violent government crackdown on rioters in the Ferghana Valley city of Andijan that is believed to have left hundreds dead.\n\nAlmost all Western media have been barred from reporting inside the country since that time. Independent journalists and activists face sustained harassment.\n\nAt campaign rallies ahead of the elections, Karimov said Uzbekistan would never again host a foreign military base. In a calculated snub to Russia, however, he also ruled out membership of economic blocs led by Moscow.\n\nIn recent years, Uzbekistan has also attracted strong interest from China. Beijing has pledged tens of billions of dollars in loans and investment to Central Asian nations as part of an ambitious series of energy and transportation projects.\n\nSecurity is a perennial feature of official rhetoric in Uzbekistan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Uzbekistan to vote to extend veteran leader\u2019s rule", "title": "Uzbekistan to vote to extend veteran leader\u2019s rule", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Uzbekistan to vote to extend veteran leader\u2019s rule", "title": "Uzbekistan to vote to extend veteran leader\u2019s rule", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/uzbekistan_to_vote_to_extend_veteran_leaders_rule/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/uzbekistan-presidential-election.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Uzbekistan to vote to extend veteran leader\u2019s rule", "title": "Uzbekistan to vote to extend veteran leader\u2019s rule", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/uzbekistan-presidential-election.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9e4\"", "article_summary": "At campaign rallies ahead of the elections, Karimov said Uzbekistan would never again host a foreign military base.\nIslam Karimov, 77, has led the double-landlocked former Soviet republic of 30 million people uninterruptedly since the late 1980s, and ruthlessly quashed all opposition to his rule.\nIn a calculated snub to Russia, however, he also ruled out membership of economic blocs led by Moscow.\nIn the previous election in 2007, he won 91 percent of the vote.\nEconomic woes could also be in store as a knock-on effect of the looming recession in Russia, where around 3 million Uzbeks live and work."}
