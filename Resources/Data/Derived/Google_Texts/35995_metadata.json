As a real estate broker and founder of Change Maryland, Hogan said he was motivated to run because of Maryland\u2019s economy.\n\nOne of Hogan\u2019s most detailed plans involves getting rid of what he said is waste and fraud in the government\u2019s budget. Hogan said the federal government and Office of Legislative Services have done 300 audits of the Maryland budget and found ways to cut waste in almost every agency. He said he would like to initiate an independent audit of every agency if he took office.\n\n\u201cWe believe there\u2019s at least $2 billion out of a $40 billion budget that should be eliminated without touching a single program, without hurting any of the essential services,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nHogan\u2019s website consistently refers to his plan to cut $1.75 billion. The Baltimore Sun conducted an independent review of three of the audits to which the Hogan campaign refers, showing the campaign incorrectly called at least $800 million \u201cwaste.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hogan\u2019s campaign, there is still much room for improving efficiency. With the extra funds, Hogan said he would want to provide some tax relief to middle class families and improve the economy, which he believes is driving families and businesses out of Maryland.\n\nHogan also said the Maryland health exchange was a waste of money under Brown\u2019s watch, calling it the \u201cbiggest boondoggle in state history,\u201d and saying Maryland should have proceeded as Virginia did. Brown was in charge of the health exchange board but said he worked to fix the problems and rearrange leadership when the rollout was unsuccessful. It is now being rebuilt from Connecticut\u2019s model to open on Nov. 15.\n\n\u201cVirginia said \u2018you know what, if you want to take advantage of the Affordable Care Act, the federal site is now working\u2019 \u2013 at first they had some glitches with that but they fixed it \u2013 so (Virginia) said \u2018you can use the federal system, or we have great private sector exchanges in Virginia that you can use,\u2019\u201d Hogan said.\n\nHogan said aside from the economy, his other two main priorities are education and the environment.\n\nHe said Maryland has some of the best schools in the nation, particularly in Montgomery County, but the state still has one of the widest achievement gaps.\n\nHe would look to charter schools and giving families school choice, which he said has been successful in other states. Montgomery County does not have any charter schools currently in operation.\n\nTo improve the environment, Hogan said he wants to focus on cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay, which has been collecting sediment and other pollution. He said much of the sediment comes from New York and Pennsylvania and so should not fall on Maryland taxpayers. He also plans to enlist the federal government\u2019s help in cleaning up the portions it controls and said Exelon has a role to play because it owns the Conowingo Dam.\n\nHogan said he also wants to focus on renewable energy and innovation, but not to the extent that it burdens businesses.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage sustainability wherever we can in the public and private sector but we also have to balance out so that we\u2019re not having additional costs and burdens pushed on these businesses and individuals who are already struggling and about to leave,\u201d Hogan said.\n\nHogan said the Purple Line \u2013 a 16-mile light rail that would run from New Carrollton to Bethesda \u2013 should be put on hold for similar reasons. He said while he supports continuing to fund the engineering and planning phases, he wants to prioritize fixing roads and avoid raising taxes to fund the construction.\n\n\u201cThat station is a perfect example of mismanagement and waste of tax money and how cost overruns and mistakes have really cost the taxpayers dearly,\u201d he said of the Silver Spring Transit Center, which will house the Purple Line but has run into engineering mishaps. \u201cWe simply have to be very cautious.\u201d\n\nAlthough Hogan\u2019s platform emphasizes economic issues, many of Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown\u2019s campaign ads attack his views on social issues, such as abortion and birth control. Hogan said the ads are not true and he does not plan to change anything regarding reproductive rights when in office.\n\n\u201cI have my own personal opinion about abortion but I would never impose my views on anybody else ...The voters of Maryland decided this issue 22 years ago,\u201d Hogan said. \u201c(Brown) has a commercial that says I want to take away a woman\u2019s right to choose even in the case of rape and incest, and I want to take away birth control \u2026 I\u2019ve never felt that way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Larry Hogan, the Republican candidate for governor, has focused his platform heavily on the economy and plans to cut inefficiencies, lower taxes and create jobs.
