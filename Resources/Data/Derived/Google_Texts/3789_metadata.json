We\u2019re still going to Canada.\n\nPfizer, which had run aground (for now) in its attempt to buy AstraZeneca, came out with yet a new and different target for its inversionary tactics, Actavis. That scoop, by Manuel Baigorri, David Welch and Matthew Campbell, really threw into relief what a muddle this has all become, because just two days ago it was Actavis that was said to have been sniffing around Allergan, which, as we know, is also the target of Valeant.\n\nMedtronic and Covidien, AbbVie and Shire, Horizon Pharma and Vidara Therapeutics, Mylan and Abbot Labs\u2019s generics division -- think any of these deals are going to pull up short even with the new rules?\n\nNot likely, especially when Dave Camp, the House\u2019s chief tax-code writer, starts lobbing grenades from what appears to be a parallel universe, and Bill Clinton undercuts the administration\u2019s attempted stance at a moral argument behind its opposition to this tax dodge.\n\nSpeaking at his Clinton Global Initiative yesterday, the former president deftly -- though not really -- took a pass when asked whether he endorsed the administration\u2019s view of inversions as unpatriotic. Instead he homed in on the arguments of those -- like Camp -- who say it makes more sense to tear the whole house down than to fix the broken window pane that\u2019s letting the heat out. The tax law -- his tax law -- needs to be scrapped, Clinton said.\n\nBut he didn\u2019t break much ground. Nor did Camp, who left us in awe of comments that are a staple of the Republican playbook now -- accuse your political opponents of the very thing for which you yourself are most culpable.\n\n\u201cUntil the White House gets serious about tax reform, we are going to keep losing good companies and jobs to countries that have or are actively reforming their tax laws,\u201d he said. \u201cI fear this administration is only interested in doing the bare minimum -\u2013 just enough to say they care.\u201d\n\nProbably safe to say the Republican Party is pro-business, right? (Those at the Ex-Im Bank, please refrain from answering.) So, why would they ever really want to change the tax laws? It\u2019s in the Republicans\u2019 interests not to, in fact, at least for a while. Inaction on this issue reaps the benefit of an indebted business community, which only reinforces the ties that bind.\n\nAnd if the party in power in the House does ever take up rewriting the law, perhaps in 2015, after they win control of the Senate -- what might they extract from Democrats and the rest of the nation with tax reform as the bargaining chip? With both halls of Congress in their control and companies behind them with checkbooks, they could act with political impunity, leaving companies free to shamble off to sunny Ireland or Guernsey all they want.\n\nBesides, who cares what Bill says. Mrs. Clinton?\n\n***\n\nNew-home sales at 10 a.m. EDT is the day\u2019s main U.S. economic indicator.\n\nCoincidentally, KB Home is due to report earnings before the bell, as are Paychex Inc. and Vail Resorts.\n\nA short time ago, the Ifo Institute said German business confidence fell to a 17-month low of 104.7 in September from 106.3 in August.

That town, about 30 times larger than Bloomingburg, could then take steps to block the development.\n\nBloomingburgers say it\u2019s basically the best option to save the way of life that drew them to the village in the first place. Lamm and his defenders say yeah, right; it\u2019s about the Jews.\n\nHow would this go down if these were blacks instead of Jews? Better yet, how did it go down in lower Manhattan around the turn of the 20th century when immigrants basically colonized sections of the city for their own kind -- the Chinese in Chinatown, the Jews on Rivington Street, Little Italy, Brighton Beach, etc.? Presumably these kinds of concerns arose then as well.\n\nBut what would the great city of New York have become without those neighborhoods? The Catskills aren\u2019t Manhattan, of course. Is it about the Mayberry way of life, or something else?\n\nAs Klopott\u2019s story unfolds we are party to some of the same thinly veiled justifications we always hear, assertions that could just as easily work if applied in reverse:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious it would be a voter bloc and they\u2019d have all the power in electing the next mayor,\u201d one resident told Klopott.\n\nThat\u2019s how it works, yes. It\u2019s how it worked for whoever got to Bloomingburg first, too.\n\n***\n\nWhen budgets shrink, the first things to go are those often thought of as discretionary luxuries, such as spending on arts and culture. But is culture a luxury in a place like Greece, where part of the roadmap to human antiquity is to be found, even when Greece is still just barely keeping its head above water after six years of recession?\n\nThe recent discovery by archeologists of a tomb thousands of years old in the ancient city of Amphipolis, guarded by the statues of two women, has captivated the imagination of Greeks and resurrected the debate as austerity-fatigue grows more palpable, Maria Petrakis reports.\n\nThe question of who occupies the tomb is beside the point.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s inside,\u201d culture ministry Secretary-General Lina Mendoni tells Petrakis. It\u2019s the monument itself and what it means to Greeks that matters.\n\nThe ministry\u2019s budget has been halved since 2010, leaving Mendoni and Greek authorities confronting what to them is a distasteful proposition: taking corporate money.\n\nPetrakis finds it\u2019s something Italy has done with some success, and with the find at Amphipolis, it\u2019s something the Greeks might have to learn from the Italians.\n\n***\n\nFrankly the numbers in this story are depressing.\n\nClea Benson and Alexis Leondis, writing today\u2019s Mortgages column, break down just how small a percentage of U.S. mortgage holders is represented by blacks and Hispanics.\n\nBlacks account for about 13 percent of the U.S. population and held 4.8 percent of mortgages in 2013. Hispanics account for about 17 percent of the population and held about 7.3 percent.\n\nWhite people? They held more than 70 percent.\n\nViewing the ashes of the Great Recession, the minorities have decided to stay away from the loans, even though the FHA and FHFA are trying to make things better for those whose mortgages sour.\n\nThis has resurrected calls for \u201ctargeted programs to help get people of color into the system,\u201d according to one housing finance and policy activist Benson and Leondis spoke with.\n\nDoes that sound like affirmative action for mortgages to you, too?\n\n***\n\nHere\u2019s a lede you don\u2019t read every day, courtesy of Dara Doyle:\n\n\u201cSept. 24 (Bloomberg) -- In Dublin, a 31-year-old bicycle rickshaw driver is in the cross hairs of the Venezuelan government for black market currency trading.\u201d\n\nOK, you\u2019ve got our interest.\n\nTurns out not everyone moves to Ireland for a lower corporate tax rate. As Doyle shows, it\u2019s become a campus of black-market currency trading. Venezuelan students traveling to study in Irish schools have fewer restrictions on currency, but they become a side door to capital flight when they\u2019re more industrious than studious.\n\nIt\u2019s not just students, of course. We meet the rickshaw driver, a former TV producer back home in South America, who\u2019s taking advantage of a market for euros that pays about 97 bolivars, more than 10 times the official rate.\n\nThe Irish government is even taking steps to crack down on the abuses, Doyle writes, which is a little funny. Venezuelans using Ireland as a venue to get better terms on their currency is wrong, but U.S. companies arriving with carpetbags to get better terms on their taxes is OK.\n\n***\n\nWe had trouble comprehending Father when he explained, after moving to a new house during our childhood, that he didn\u2019t need a raincoat because his train to work every day dropped him off underneath his office building. Spatial relations were still a little abstract for a 6-year-old.\n\nWhen we got a little older we took the trip with him to the bank\u2019s office tower one Saturday morning (in a tie) and, upon emerging from the underground train station into the concourse, we got it. The warren sprawled out under the center of the city, and you could have lunch or dinner, get your hair cut, buy almost anything and cover several city blocks sheltered from the elements.\n\nMuch later we got a look at Toronto\u2019s underground retail labyrinth and saw how it\u2019s really done.\n\nWhy did it stop where it did?, we wondered with a dawning sense of futurism. Why not keep it going, and create an entire underground city? The crew from the Cities desk finds many others who asked the same question.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "C.
