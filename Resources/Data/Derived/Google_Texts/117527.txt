After months of campaigning and prognosticating, the 2014 Oscars are finally here. Stars on hand tonight include Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett, Lupita Nyong’o, and the rock band U2. The winners in some major categories are too tough to predict. In one of the tightest races in recent history, the Best Picture category is a three-way heat between Steve McQueen’s “12 Years a Slave,” Alfonso Cuaron’s “Gravity” and David O. Russell’s “American Hustle.”

Speakeasy has reporters on the red carpet, inside the Dolby Theatre, backstage at the Oscars, and in living rooms all over the world watching. Follow along as we live-blog the winners, presenters and performers, and let us know your thoughts on the show in the comments.
