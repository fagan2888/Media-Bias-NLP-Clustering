But it\u2019s easy to find a consensus that an excess of spin is ruining politics. Spin \u2014 the deliberate crafting of words and images for political effect \u2014 is everywhere, from the scripted laugh lines that candidates trot out in debates, to the artful circumlocutions of press secretaries, to the slick ads and viral videos that flicker across our screens. Don\u2019t get spun, even about spin. Some of the conventional wisdom about the practice is false or exaggerated. Unpacking these five common misperceptions might help us to see more clearly the role that spin plays in our politics, for good and for ill \u2014 and to think of it as something that should be neither feared nor lamented, but rather appreciated and understood.\n\n1. Spin is new to our times.\n\nIt\u2019s common to suppose that in the recent past, politics was a more straightforward business. We imagine some idyllic, prelapsarian politics free of today\u2019s crafted talk and deceptive rhetoric. One of the fuller statements of this notion is the 2006 book \u201cPolitics Lost: How American Democracy Was Trivialized by People Who Think You\u2019re Stupid,\u201d by Joe Klein. It opens with a vignette of Robert Kennedy delivering his spontaneous, heartfelt paean to Martin Luther King Jr. on the night of King\u2019s assassination; Klein describes this as \u201cthe last moments before American political life was overwhelmed by marketing professionals, consultants, and pollsters.\u201d\n\nThis is little more than nostalgia. We do encounter spin everywhere, because there are a lot more media outlets today, many featuring politicians and their supporters pleading their cases. But politics has always involved spin. Ancient Greek orators practiced rhetoric to craft arguments, sometimes deceptively, that aroused emotions and persuaded the populace. European monarchs put great care into how their portraits were painted or what images would appear on coins or crests.\n\nAmerican politicians, too, have always availed themselves of what was once called publicity or propaganda. Theodore Roosevelt was the first modern master, devising all kinds of methods to get the news written the way he wanted (such as cultivating the Washington press corps and traveling around the country to push legislation). Woodrow Wilson created the first wartime propaganda agency, Calvin Coolidge staged photo-ops, Herbert Hoover produced an elaborate campaign film, Dwight Eisenhower employed a White House TV coach \u2014 every president for the past century has used sophisticated forms of spin.\n\n2. Political consultants are geniuses with immense power over our elections.\n\nAdvisers who rise to prominence with a successful presidential candidate invariably earn the \u201cgenius\u201d moniker and are assumed to harbor esoteric secrets about winning elections. The Economist called David Axelrod \u201cthe rumpled campaign genius who steered Barack Obama\u2019s rise from state senator to president\u201d; CBS News called James Carville \u201cthe fiery political genius who knew where President George H.W. Bush was vulnerable\u201d; Karl Rove\u2019s biography was titled \u201cBoy Genius.\u201d In Hollywood, from \u201cThe Candidate\u201d to \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the shadowy consultant predictably plays a key role.\n\nFrom the start, the public relations experts who counseled politicians claimed unique insight into the human mind. In the 1920s, Edward Bernays, dubbed the father of spin \u2014 partly because of his p.r. on his own behalf \u2014 extolled the knowledge and skills shared by \u201cinvisible governors\u201d who secretly shaped public preferences, which magazine profiles called \u201cThe Science of Ballyhoo.\u201d Later, the first full-time political consultants, Californians Clem Whitaker and Leone Baxter, were deemed to have perfected a fool-proof \u201cpush-button technique.\u201d\n\nBut Bernays gave lots of pedestrian advice; Whitaker and Baxter mostly took on clients who were already shoo-ins; and Rove, Axelrod and Carville have all run losing campaigns. Consultants help with technical aspects such as meeting filing deadlines and budgeting ad buys. When honing a message, though, they\u2019re relying on art, not science (losing campaigns have top-drawer advisers, too). In a 1986 debunking of consultants\u2019 prowess, the New Republic quoted one guru\u2019s secret: \u201cYou get on the back of a good horse and hold on.\u201d This election cycle, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio spent millions on experienced pros, to little apparent effect. The sharpest Hollywood depiction of the business may be not the ruthless operators of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d but the bumbling hacks of \u201cVeep.\u201d\n\n3. Polls routinely tell politicians what positions to adopt.\n\nWe always hear that politicians are unprincipled weather vanes, slavishly following polls. Harry Truman put it best: \u201cI wonder how far Moses would have gone if he\u2019d taken a poll in Egypt? What would Jesus Christ have preached if he\u2019d taken a poll in Israel? . . . It isn\u2019t polls or public opinion of the moment that counts. It is right and wrong and leadership.\u201d Truman\u2019s complaint is as common today as 50 years ago. \u201cNo one tells me what to say,\u201d Donald Trump boasted last August, implying that he alone shunned pollsters.\n\nIt\u2019s true that candidates might play down or change positions if polling suggests it would help their prospects. But mostly, politicians use information from polls to figure out how to explain positions they already hold. In \u201cPoliticians Don\u2019t Pander,\u201d a recent classic of political science, Robert Shapiro and Lawrence Jacobs show how the Clinton administration polled on health-care reform only after the plan was finished to determine how to pitch it to the public. George W. Bush pursued privatizing Social Security even though it was unpopular because he believed in it. His White House polled to find the most attractive phrases (such as \u201cretirement security,\u201d \u201cchoice\u201d and \u201csavings\u201d) with which to sell it.\n\n4. Political spin dupes the public.\n\nWe sometimes assume \u2014 or fear \u2014 that slick rhetoric and clever image-making will fool us into backing candidates or policies that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise support. This idea, too, is age-old. In 1957, Vance Packard wrote in \u201cThe Hidden Persuaders,\u201d his advertising industry expos\u00e9, that a new breed of men was entering politics \u201cto engineer our consent to their projects or to engineer our enthusiasm for their candidates.\u201d A decade later, in \u201cThe Selling of the President,\u201d Joe McGinniss used Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign to portray modern media politics as a big con, in which shrewd managers regularly mislead the public. That critique has never gone away. Whether it was George W. Bush on invading Iraq or Barack Obama on his health-care plan, critics have alleged that presidents and other politicians have hoodwinked a pliable public.\n\nPoliticians, of course, sometimes stretch the truth. But that doesn\u2019t mean we all credulously buy their claims. In an open society like ours, counterspin comes from other quarters. However we judged Bush\u2019s arguments for the war, prominent voices in Congress argued against them. If Obama used the bully pulpit to press for the Affordable Care Act, Republicans had plenty of outlets, from Fox News to talk radio, to lobby against it.\n\nSocial science research shows that the public has a great capacity to resist spin. Scholars now recognize the phenomena of \u201cselective exposure,\u201d the tendency to seek out agreeable news; \u201cselective perception,\u201d placing trust in agreeable information while blocking out disagreeable information; and \u201cmotivated reasoning,\u201d using logic to reach desired conclusions. We may worry that politicians will convince us of falsehoods, but the reality today is closer to the opposite: We\u2019re so cocooned in our own ideological bubbles that it\u2019s hard to convince anyone of anything.\n\n5. What we really want is a candidate who doesn\u2019t spin.\n\nThe pervasiveness of spin makes it easy to crave a politician who doesn\u2019t hurry to huddle with an army of pollsters, speechwriters and image-makers before appearing in public. Many pundits this year use this theory to explain Trump and Bernie Sanders. \u201cEach in his own way, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are proving that authenticity can win the day,\u201d David Atkins writes in the Washington Monthly. Columnist Michael Medved agrees: \u201cWhatever their faults in ideology or substance, both Sanders and Trump seem genuine and sincere.\u201d The disavowal of spin was also deemed responsible for the popularity of Obama and John McCain, among others.\n\nWe may think we want a candidate who throws caution to the wind and speaks the plain truth. Whether we really want that is another matter.\n\nCandidates who flout the conventions and rituals of politics may seem refreshing, but when they go too far, they strike us as foolish and alienate supporters. In 2006, McCain had to walk back his condemnation of Jerry Falwell and other leaders of the Christian right as \u201cagents of intolerance\u201d in order to regain favor on the right, compromising his reputation for straight talk. Obama was hailed for refusing to throw his minister Jeremiah Wright under the bus after Wright\u2019s sermons proved inflammatory \u2014 but soon after, when Wright kept making provocative remarks, Obama disowned him.\n\nWhen we look closely, we see that completely \u201cauthentic\u201d politicians don\u2019t really exist. Displays of candor and spontaneity are frequently the product of planning and practice. In 1948, Truman drew raves for his speech at the Democratic convention, which he delivered in an extemporaneous style instead of from a script. Truman had been rehearsing in a studio with the Democrats\u2019 broadcast coach, Leonard Reinsch. Four years later, Eisenhower won plaudits for a speech in which he declared that his \u201cprepared remarks are thrown out the window.\u201d That stunt was a gimmick, and his busy hive of speechwriters continued to furnish him remarks thereafter.\n\nDespite the appearance of untutored directness, Trump and Sanders also put thought and calculation into their public images, each employing consultants and talking points. Candidates carefully craft their words and images. It\u2019s simply the nature of politics.\n\nTwitter: @RepublicOfSpin\n\nFive myths is a weekly feature challenging everything you think you know.
