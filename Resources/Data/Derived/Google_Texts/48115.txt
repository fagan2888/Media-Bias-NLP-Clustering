Saturday was the 12th annual Earth Day Bay County celebration at McKenzie park in downtown Panama City.

Dozens of vendors filled the park showing off local artwork and teaching visitors about environmentally friendly activities in the area.

The Friends of St. Andrew Bay was the host sponsor of the event.

Henry Lawrence, one of the event organizers explained, "The best part about it is that it brings the environmental community together to network with each other some folks only see each other in one or two outdoor events like this every year and reconnect or find out what's going on in the community as far as environmental issues."

The official Earth Day holiday is April 22nd.
