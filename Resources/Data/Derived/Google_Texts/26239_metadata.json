(Photo: Courtesy of Dan Epright )\n\nA Smyrna couple was away from their house, meeting with potential buyers for it, when it caught fire Saturday morning.\n\nThe fire, which was contained in less than 10 minutes by five units of the Smyrna Fire Department, may have started in the dryer that was left running. The call came in at 9:15 a.m. Saturday.\n\nJustin and Tiffany Granstaff and their two children have lived in the house at 300 Whitney Drive in Smyrna in the Bent Tree community. No one was home at the time.\n\n\u201cWe thank God for that,\u201d said Justin Granstaff.\n\nThe house was saved, but is unlivable right now. There\u2019s fire damage in the kitchen and utility room and smoke damage throughout the house, Smyrna Fire Chief Bill Culbertson said.\n\n\u201cWe will get the house fixed,\u201d said Justin Granstaff. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve had multiple people say we can stay with them.\u201d\n\nOnce repaired, the Granstaffs still plan to sell the home, which was built in 1991.\n\nReach Vicky Travis at 615-881-7216 and on Twitter @VTravis1.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2014/07/12/fire-damages-smyrna-home-meeting-sell/12569657/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Contained in 10 minutes, fire may have started in dryer.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Contained in 10 minutes, fire may have started in dryer.", "title": "Fire damages Smyrna home during meeting to sell it", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2014/07/12/fire-damages-smyrna-home-meeting-sell/12569657/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Contained in 10 minutes, fire may have started in dryer.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/be21424f06bb27370eabd32a2323e0f163c62c7f/c=500-0-3500-3000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/12/smyrnafire.jpg", "title": "Fire damages Smyrna home during meeting to sell it", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ace930c6c1a7394671306a4e328abc729a823edc/c=875-0-3125-3000/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/12/smyrnafire.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e4cb66f1a24f6bf2efd43e5557bd96714846aab0/c=500-0-3500-3000/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/12/smyrnafire.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1c778539e8f8f1440e3e1cb2c276b4f6d3bbe3f3/c=0-0-4000-3000/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/12/smyrnafire.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33955dee37fffaa8b1e70de8c34e0704ccda54c5/c=0-375-4000-2625&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/12/smyrnafire.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-12T12:04:24-05:00", "shorthed": "Fire damages Smyrna home", "articleid": 12569657, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c34d0b39c48b4797298012cb1b17d126a717f7d5/c=0-375-4000-2625/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/12/smyrnafire.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/55dac66eb1b748753bc51d753cc60b21b30254c8/c=1156-0-2844-3000/local/-/media/Nashville/2014/07/12/smyrnafire.jpg"}, "author": "Vicky Travis", "title": "Fire damages Smyrna home during meeting to sell it", "pageclass": "article", "gci-asset-type": "story"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b41\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s fire damage in the kitchen and utility room and smoke damage throughout the house, Smyrna Fire Chief Bill Culbertson said.\n(Photo: Courtesy of Dan Epright )A Smyrna couple was away from their house, meeting with potential buyers for it, when it caught fire Saturday morning.\nSmyrna Fire Department contains a house fire in less than 10 minutes Saturday morning.\nJustin and Tiffany Granstaff and their two children have lived in the house at 300 Whitney Drive in Smyrna in the Bent Tree community.\n\u201cWe thank God for that,\u201d said Justin Granstaff."}
