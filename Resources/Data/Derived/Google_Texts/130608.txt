Hillary Clinton is way more out of touch than we even realized.

During a small gathering of women in Lorton, Virginia, Clinton was confronted by a small business owner who said her health insurance costs under Obamacare have left her paying $500 more a month for coverage, which now keeps her from providing insurance to her employees.

“I have seen our health insurance for my own family, go up $500 dollars a month in the last two years,” said the small business owner to Clinton. “We’re just fighting to keep benefits for ourselves. The thought of being able to provide benefits to your employees is almost secondary.”

“So, I guess my question to you is not only are you looking out for people that can’t afford health care,” she said. “I’m someone that can afford it, but it’s taking a big chunk out of the money I bring home for myself.”

Clinton responded in disbelief, wondering how the small business owner’s health insurance costs had possibly increased.

“What you’re saying is one of the real worries that we’re facing with the cost of health insurance because the costs are going up in a lot of markets — not all, but many markets,” Clinton said. “Right now, like with so many of these programs, there’s just a cut off instead of what I would like to see a kind of gradual diminishment.”

“But I mean that’s my point — It’s like what could have possibly raised your costs,” a bewildered Clinton asked. “And that’s what I don’t understand. We’ve got to pick that apart to really make sure we understand it.”
