Well \u2026 yes, but the point of last night\u2019s special issue wasn\u2019t that Trump is flawed, an argument that\u2019s been made by various NR authors over the past seven months without jeopardizing their debate role. The point of the issue was that the magazine\u2019s now convinced that Trump is so deeply flawed that nominating him would destroy movement conservatism. It\u2019s as overt an anti-endorsement as an ideological publication can give. How do you moderate a debate fairly when you\u2019ve just screamed from the rooftop that one of the guys onstage undermines everything you stand for? It\u2019d be like asking me to moderate a debate on \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d where one of the participants thinks it\u2019s the greatest show ever. Punches will be thrown. A forum like that is compromised. And NR, to its credit, didn\u2019t put up a fuss about it. They knew going in that declaring their partiality against Trump would cost them.\n\nI don\u2019t begrudge Jeb the chance here to polish his new brand as the most loudly anti-Trump candidate in the field. I don\u2019t fault him either for a knee-jerk defense of NR. In a fight between Buckleyites and Trumpers, a Bush is practically duty-bound to side with the former, especially when they happen to be right on the merits. What grates is what Bush tweeted last night after the issue dropped:\n\nWelcome to the fight, all. Trump is not a conservative. pic.twitter.com/Fri8reAEx1 \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) January 22, 2016\n\nI made this point yesterday but let me make it again. From his ill-advised decision to run in a populist climate to his arrogant attempt to scare the rest of the field out of running with gaudy donor-class fundraising support to his pitiful haplessness in defending himself against Trump to his catastrophic attempt to blow up the only center-righty who can conceivably win the nomination at this point, Jeb Bush has done more to enable Trumpmania than any Republican politician in America. As Phil Kerpen pointed out, his supporters in Congress spent the hours before NR\u2019s issue was published yesterday loudly signaling in the media that if they\u2019re forced to choose between Trump and the conservative Ted Cruz, it\u2019s Trump in a heartbeat. Even now, with Jeb running all-out as America\u2019s number-one Trump-hater \u2014 while his Super PAC focuses entirely on Marco Rubio \u2014 Team Jeb is hoping that Trump is wildly successful in the first few states. They\u2019ll happily accept him winning Iowa and New Hampshire so long as Jeb finishes second in the latter. That\u2019s the only way Bush\u2019s horrible campaign stands even a small chance of winning the nomination at this point, as the de facto \u201cAnybody But Trump\u201d choice in a two-man race amid panic on the right at Trump as a potential nominee. Any other candidate, with the possible exception of Cruz, would run Jeb off the field head-to-head. And given how well-organized Cruz is, how bad Bush is on the stump, and how much disgust there is among the electorate at establishmentarians, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Cruz ended up running him off the field too.\n\nIncidentally, if Jeb makes it out of New Hampshire, you may start seeing Dubya pop up on the trail for him in South Carolina. How\u2019d you like that as your final choice, tea partiers \u2014 Trump or the Bush dynasty?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Huh.", "title": "Jeb Bush: The RNC shouldn\u2019t have kicked National Review out of that debate for attacking Trump", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/01/22/jeb-bush-the-rnc-shouldnt-have-kicked-national-review-out-of-that-debate-for-attacking-trump/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-22T18:21:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T19:20:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "debate, Jeb Bush, National Review, rnc, symposium, trump,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush: The RNC shouldn\u2019t have kicked National Review out of that debate for attacking Trumpposted at 1:21 pm on January 22, 2016 by AllahpunditThey\u2019re just telling the truth, he says, in pointing out Trump\u2019s many, many flaws.\npic.twitter.com/Fri8reAEx1 \u2014 Jeb Bush (@JebBush) January 22, 2016I made this point yesterday but let me make it again.\nThe point of the issue was that the magazine\u2019s now convinced that Trump is so deeply flawed that nominating him would destroy movement conservatism.\nHow\u2019d you like that as your final choice, tea partiers \u2014 Trump or the Bush dynasty?\nEven now, with Jeb running all-out as America\u2019s number-one Trump-hater \u2014 while his Super PAC focuses entirely on Marco Rubio \u2014 Team Jeb is hoping that Trump is wildly successful in the first few states."}
