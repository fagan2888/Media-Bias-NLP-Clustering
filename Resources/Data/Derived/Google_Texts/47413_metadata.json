St. Georges Ave. It appears the store was entered and an attempt was made to force open the cash register, police said.\n\nDuring a review of the store's surveillance video footage, detectives observed three men enter the business after a rock was thrown through the glass door between 9 and 9:30 p.m. Nov. 16.\n\nFollowing a brief investigation, two of the three suspects were identified and arrested. Police said Phillip Ruddy, 27, of Roselle Park, and Joshua Mogere, 28, a local resident, were charged with burglary. They are both being held at the Union County Jail in Elizabeth on $75,000 bail each.\n\nThe third person is still being sought, police said.\n\nAnyone with information about the burglary is asked to call Detective Matt Damatta at 908-474-8538 or email crimetips@lpdnj.org.\n\nStaff Writer Suzanne Russell: 732-565-7335; srussell@mycentraljersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1tgFLdz", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Two men have been arrested and a third is being sought in connection with a burglary at a Polish deli on West St. Georges Avenue.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Two men have been arrested and a third is being sought in connection with a burglary at a Polish deli on West St. Georges Avenue.", "title": "Two arrests made in Linden deli burglary", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/union-county/2014/11/25/linden-burglary-deli-arrests/70088512/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two men have been arrested and a third is being sought in connection with a burglary at a Polish deli on West St. Georges Avenue.", "title": "Two men accused of Linden deli burglary", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ff3a78a612bab06c072866d806cb75ee3ba94a86/c=0-43-238-281&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Bridgewater/2014/11/25/B9315259611Z.1_20141125124511_000+GU1981I2M.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Linden, deli burglary, Joshua Mogere, Phillip Ruddy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1de\"", "article_summary": "Phillip Ruddy (Photo: Photo courtesy Linden Police Department)Two men have been arrested and a third is being sought in connection with a burglary at a Polish deli on West St. Georges Avenue.\nPolice said Phillip Ruddy, 27, of Roselle Park, and Joshua Mogere, 28, a local resident, were charged with burglary.\nIn the early morning hours of Nov. 17, police responded to a report of a broken glass window at Biedronka Polish Deli, 1025 W.
