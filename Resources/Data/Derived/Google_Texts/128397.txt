Four people were arrested after an officer-involved shooting in Ada on Friday.

Police say it happened in the Wal-Mart parking lot, located at 1419 N. Country Club Rd. An employee told police, thieves have been stealing beer from the store. The employee recognized one of the suspects, who had stolen beer from the day before, and called police.

An Ada police officer happened to be in the parking lot, and she approached the suspect as he left the store. Police identified the suspect as 26-year-old Cordell Tebee.

Police say Tebee ran from the officer, jumped inside a truck, and yelled at the female driver to take off. The driver did not, so Tebee pushed her out of the truck and got behind the wheel.

Sources tell News 9, Tebee tried to run over the officer, and she fired at him. An off-duty Roff reserve officer was also nearby and fired one shot at the getaway car.

Officers chased after Tebee until one of the truckâ€™s tires went flat from being struck by a bullet. Tebee then ran from the vehicle but was quickly apprehended three blocks away from the store.

Tebee was arrested for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and felony eluding. Three other suspects were also arrested and booked into jail.

Police found stolen steaks inside the car, as well as stolen beer in the Wal-Mart parking lot.

The names of the other three suspects and the officers involved have not been released.

Although no one was injured, the Ada Police Department has requested the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation to investigate the incident.
