Lynn Jenkins to reform portions of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder the divisive 2010 health care reform law, health savings accounts may be used to pay for drugs \u201conly if such medicine or drug is a prescribed drug,\u201d exempting over-the-counter drugs.\n\nH.R. 1270, which was passed by a voice vote in the House Ways and Means Committee, would remove that sentence, along with similar restrictions on flexible spending accounts.\n\n\u201cFrom the creation of these accounts until the passage of the Affordable Care Act, tens of millions of consumers had been free to use their HSA (health savings) or FSA (flexible spending) accounts to help defray their health care costs,\u201d Jenkins, a Republican, told the 39-member Ways and Means Committee. \u201cIncluded in the qualified expenses were OTC medications, such as allergy or cold medicine, antibiotic ointment, or pain relievers.\u201d\n\nAllowing for the purchase of over-the-counter medications will place more control in the hands of individuals and less in the hands of the federal government and insurance companies, Jenkins argued.\n\n\u201cNot every time you get sick you should be forced to go to the doctor,\u201d the congresswoman said. \u201cYou should be able to treat yourself and purchase the medicine you need because we all know that not all sicknesses require a doctor\u2019s visit.\u201d\n\nH.R. 1270 was introduced by Jenkins on March 4. It has 37 co-sponsors \u2014 33 Republicans and four Democrats \u2014 including Jenkins\u2019 Kansas colleague, Rep. Mike Pompeo of Wichita, a Republican.\n\n\u201cIt is now my hope this bipartisan legislation is quickly brought to the House floor for a vote,\u201d Jenkins said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "A U.S. House committee on Thursday passed legislation sponsored by Rep.
