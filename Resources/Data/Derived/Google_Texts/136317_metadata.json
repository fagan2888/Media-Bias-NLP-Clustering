Below are what experts think next year will hold for financial matters close to home: Raises, rent, gas, food and health.\n\nMaybe.\n\nWage growth has been perhaps the job market\u2019s biggest weakness since the recession ended. Pay increases have been both slow and uneven, highly dependent on your field of employment. And for many, it has not been enough to keep pace with the cost of living.\n\nIn November, average hourly earnings climbed 2.3 percent from a year earlier, according to the government\u2019s most recent report. But that is only about two-thirds the roughly 3.5 percent typically seen in a strong economy.\n\nMany economists are optimistic Americans\u2019 pay will start growing faster soon because hiring has been good and layoffs have been low. But that\u2019s been the case for a while, and wages haven\u2019t taken off yet.\n\nJoseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, is not expecting major gains ahead. He notes that measures that include a broader mix of compensation beyond hourly wages show there\u2019s even less growth in pay than it seems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced things are going to grow as much as I would like them to,\u201d he said.\n\nWill my rent go up?\n\nYes, most likely.\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough few years for U.S. renters because demand has outpaced supply, causing prices to rise.\n\nRents increased 4.5 percent in October, 5.3 percent in September and 6.2 percent in August, according to real-estate-data firm Zillow. The median rental payment nationwide was $1,382 in October, roughly 30 percent of the median U.S. family income and high enough for the government to consider it financially burdensome. Over the past decade, that number of renters spending over this threshold on rent has jumped from 14.8 million to 21.3 million, or 49 percent of all renters.\n\nThere are more rent increases anticipated ahead.\n\n\u201cRents are expected to rise in virtually all major cities in 2016,\u201d said Hessam Nadji, senior executive vice president with commercial real-estate-services firm Marcus & Millichap.\n\nSome small consolation: While rents will still rise, the pace of rent growth will slow modestly from the exceptional levels set in 2015 as new construction creates more housing competition, Nadji says.\n\nWill gas prices stay low?\n\nYes, most likely.\n\nOil prices have plummeted over the last year, a result of high global supplies and weaker demand than expected. U.S. drivers are paying less than $2 a gallon on average for the first time since the Great Recession.\n\nSeasonal factors and volatile oil prices will push prices up and down throughout the year, but overall prices are expected to remain low compared with recent years.\n\nThe Energy Department forecasts an average of $2.37 a gallon next year, which would be the lowest annual average since 2009.\n\nTom Kloza, head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service, said drivers should expect lower lows and higher highs at the pump in the year ahead, but he doesn\u2019t expect the price of a gallon of gasoline to go over $3 at any time in 2016.\n\n\u201cNationally we are looking at a year that is very similar to the year we are ending,\u201d Kloza said.\n\nWill the price of food go up?\n\nNew year, same dish.\n\nFood prices should rise at a rate near the historical average, according to the USDA\u2019s forecasts.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service (ERS) anticipates the price for food will be up 2 to 3 percent for 2016, same as 2015 and in line with the 20-year historical average of 2.6 percent. That includes food people consume at home and out at restaurants.\n\nAnnemarie Kuhns, an economist at the ERS, said that certain food prices were off this year due to unusual events, such as the bird flu that led to the death of millions of birds and sent egg prices up roughly 15 percent. Looking ahead, she and fellow economists anticipate these prices may level off in 2016.\n\nWill my health insurance cost more?\n\nProbably.\n\nPeople buying their own coverage through the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act should see premiums go up faster in 2016 than in previous years, said Cynthia Cox, associate director of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAccording to Kaiser research, if you do not shop around and let your plan passively renew, the premiums for the lowest silver level plan \u2014 the most popular on the exchange \u2014 will increase 15 percent on average next year. If you are willing to switch, premium increases are expected to be zero to 1 percent. This is because the exchange is set up to encourage shopping around.\n\nThese increases apply only to people receiving subsidies to help pay for the insurance. For those who do not, the increase is expected to be 6 percent.\n\nCox added that shoppers should also update any personal information \u2014 such as changes to your family size or income \u2014 which can affect what they pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important to go back online and shop every year,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThis is still an evolving market \u2014 there are new insurers coming in and other insurers leaving. The only way to find (the best price) is to go online or navigate through a broker.\u201d\n\nEmployer-sponsored plans premiums increased about 4 percent this year. And while Kaiser does not forecast employer-sponsored plan price changes, it does not anticipate any unusual hikes in health-care costs that tend to push up insurance prices.\n\nHowever, employees may end up paying more out of pocket for deductibles, co-payments and other expenses they are responsible for, depending on their employer\u2019s plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many economists are optimistic Americans\u2019 pay will start growing faster soon because hiring has been good and layoffs have been low.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "Many economists are optimistic Americans\u2019 pay will start growing faster soon because hiring has been good and layoffs have been low.", "title": "What 2016 will do to your checkbook: rent, food, gas, raises", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/business/what-2016-will-do-to-your-checkbook-rent-food-gas-raises-2/", "image": {"width": 1560, "identifier": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/b1d50fce-aa9a-11e5-950e-a7ffd3b90f12-1560x1046.jpg", "height": 1046}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@seattletimes", "description": "Many economists are optimistic Americans\u2019 pay will start growing faster soon because hiring has been good and layoffs have been low.", "card": "http://static.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/b1d50fce-aa9a-11e5-950e-a7ffd3b90f12-780x523.jpg", "title": "What 2016 will do to your checkbook: rent, food, gas, raises"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Business", "published_time": "2016-01-02 08:00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-02 16:34:55"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Business, Local Business, Markets"}, "article_summary": "Below are what experts think next year will hold for financial matters close to home: Raises, rent, gas, food and health.\nPay increases have been both slow and uneven, highly dependent on your field of employment.\nFood prices should rise at a rate near the historical average, according to the USDA\u2019s forecasts.\nThere are more rent increases anticipated ahead.\nAnd while Kaiser does not forecast employer-sponsored plan price changes, it does not anticipate any unusual hikes in health-care costs that tend to push up insurance prices."}
