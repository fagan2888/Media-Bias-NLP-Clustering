He was in Sacramento. His father was an assistant for Detroit.\n\nHe lost. The next day, he was fired.\n\n\u201cI just hope I don\u2019t get fired like last time,\u201d Malone said, grinning.\n\nOf course, there is no chance of that. Malone is, and will remain, the Nuggets\u2019 head coach. And the bond between father and son will remain strong as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to see my father,\u201d Malone said. \u201cObviously, we get caught up in the game and the job, and the competition, but at the end of the day, he\u2019s meant so much to me and done so much for me and my family. Anytime you get a chance to see him, say hello, spend some time with him, it\u2019s always welcome.\u201d\n\nMalone\u2019s father, Brendan, continues to be a Pistons assistant. Assistant coaches rotate scouting reports for opposing teams. It just so happened Brendan\u2019s turn came around to put together the report on the Nuggets.\n\nBecause the two have been on opposite benches many times before, Michael Malone brushed off any sentimentality to Saturday night\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cFor both of us, it\u2019s so old hat now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to see him, but when that jump ball goes up, I\u2019m trying to win, he\u2019s trying to win. And all of the other stuff goes out the window. But obviously, I wouldn\u2019t be in this situation without everything my father has done for me.\u201d\n\nEasing Nurkic in. Nuggets center Jusuf Nurkic is on a minutes restriction, about 15 per night \u2014 if, as Malone points out, he wants to play him even that long. Nurkic has some work to do, mainly in conditioning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my prerogative to play him or not play him,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe will get Nurk out there. We know that once he is back, gets in shape, he can help this team in a lot of different ways.\u201d Christopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets Michael Malone takes on dad against Detroit", "title": "Nuggets Michael Malone takes on dad against Detroit", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/23/nuggets-michael-malone-takes-on-dad-against-detroit/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__Michael-Malonep1-2.jpg", "height": 437}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160123__Michael-Malonep1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T20:10:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T02:04:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9905\"", "article_summary": "Malone vs. dad not the 1st timeThe last time Michael Malone, as a head coach, coached against his father was on Dec. 13, 2014.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to see him, but when that jump ball goes up, I\u2019m trying to win, he\u2019s trying to win.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to see my father,\u201d Malone said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my prerogative to play him or not play him,\u201d Malone said.\nBecause the two have been on opposite benches many times before, Michael Malone brushed off any sentimentality to Saturday night\u2019s game."}
