The Sonoma Police department issued a press release at 11:56 a.m. on Friday, April 1, detailing the arrest early the previous morning of Sonoma Index-Tribune editor Jason Walsh on charges of public intoxication. Mr. Walsh will address the incident in his Tuesday editorial.

The report, released by police midday on Friday, April 1, and signed by Chief of Police Bret Sackett, reads as follows:

On Thursday, 3-31-16, at approximately 3:15 am, the Sonoma Police Department was dispatched to the 7-11 Store on W. Napa Street regarding an intoxicated subject that was stumbling down the street and appeared to be injured.



Upon arrival, the deputies located the subject walking in the roadway on W. Napa Street near 1st Street West. The subject exhibited objective symptoms of intoxication including an unsteady gait, red and watery eyes, slurred speech, and poor dexterity. The subject also had a strong odor of alcohol on his breath.



The deputy noticed several injuries to the subject’s face and head, which were consistent with falling on the pavement. The subject stated the injuries were not a result of an assault.



The deputies summoned the assistance of the medical personnel, but the subject refused treatment. Due to his level of intoxication, the subject was obviously unable to care for his own safety and was subsequently arrested for public intoxication.



The deputy took the subject to the hospital for treatment prior to booking him into the county jail for public intoxication.



The subject was identified as Jason L. Walsh, 44 years old, from Novato. The case has been referred to the City Prosecutor’s Office for filing.
