An international ministry says it has been quite a year across Africa, most infamously when the Muslim terrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 270 girls, most of them Christians.

"More than 220 or those are still unaccounted for [and] many are suspected unfortunately of having even been sold as child brides and to lifetimes of sexual and domestic servitude," Cameron Thomas with International Christian Concern tells OneNewsNow.

Boko Haram also declared an Islamic caliphate after attacking and decimating a Christian town in Nigeria's northeast where the terrorist group is based.

The leader of Boko Haram has pledged his allegiance to the leader of ISIS or Islamic State.

Meanwhile, the persecution of Christians continued this year in Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Kenya, a country that Thomas says one would least expect to see persecution of Christians.

"We've actually seen a number of major attacks against Christian communities resulting in hundreds of deaths of Christians," he reports.

Still, there have been stories of triumph in Africa, including the imprisonment and release of Meriam Ibrahim. She is a Christian wife and mother who was sentenced to death for her faith became her father, who abandoned the family, was Muslim.

Ibrahim spoke at the Value Voters Summit in September in Washington, D.C., where she received the first-ever "Cost of Discipleship Award" for her courage. She is living in the U.S.
