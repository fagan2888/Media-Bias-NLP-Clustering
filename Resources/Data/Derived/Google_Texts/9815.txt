Medtronic Continues Acquisition Spree with Aircraft Medical Purchase

The buyer is purchasing the McGrath owner on the heels of adding Twelve and RF Surgical

Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) is acquiring privately-held medical device company Aircraft Medical for $110 million in cash.

Aircraft, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, makes video laryngoscopes that are used by anesthesiologists and other medical professionals to put tubes in patients. Aircraft’s McGrath devices are designed to give doctors a better view of a patient’s vocal cords so they can more accurately place breathing tubes into the trachea. A laryngoscope is an instrument that examines the larynx.

“Aircraft Medical offerings complement our portfolio, helping us further our commitment to reducing incidents and potential complications from respiratory compromise globally,” says Steve Blazejewski, the president of Medtronic’s patient monitoring and recovery business.

Medtronic has been active in deal making recently. Earlier in 2015, the company announced plans to buy Twelve Inc., which makes products to replace heart valves, and is also adding surgical item detector RF Surgical Systems Inc.

Other recent medical device deals include Conmed Corp.’s (Nasdaq: CNMD) pending acquisition of SurgiQuest Inc. and 3M Co.'s (NYSE: MMM) completing its acquisition of Polypore International Inc.’s (NYSE: PPO) separations media business.
