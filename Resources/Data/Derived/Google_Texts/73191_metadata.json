Following UNITE HERE\u2019s endorsement, the Nevada State Education Association and five party activists filed a lawsuit seeking (unsuccessfully) to shut down \u201cat large\u201d caucus sites the state Democratic Party planned to place at casinos so that people working that weekend could participate. The plaintiffs said those sites would violate the Constitution\u2019s promise of equal protection; UNITE HERE and the Obama campaign said eliminating them would disenfranchise workers. Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t weigh in on the lawsuit, but her husband fiercely defended it. Days before the caucus, UNITE HERE blasted her in a radio ad. \u201cHillary Clinton does not respect our people,\u201d the union charged in Spanish. \u201cHillary Clinton should not let her friends attack the right of our people to vote on Saturday. It\u2019s unforgivable.\u201d\n\nAsked if that\u2019s how her union views Clinton now, Cancela told Bloomberg, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think anything from 2008 could be applicable to today.\u201d As for that \u201cunforgivable\u201d comment, she says, \u201cI think the caucus brought out a lot of emotion\u2026 I don\u2019t think members have forgotten that, but I also think members know that this election is a new page, and they\u2019re ready to learn where Senator Clinton is at today, and feel her out, without holding any grudges about what happened in 2008.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cstarting point\u201d for that assessment, says Cancela, is where she stands on repealing Obamacare\u2019s controversial excise tax, a 40 percent tax on expensive health care plans that\u2019s meant to slow the growth in health care spending while raising revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s the most important issue we\u2019re looking at right now, and there\u2019s an opportunity for real action and not carefully-worded promises.\u201d The Culinary, as the union is known, wants candidates to back a House bill introduced in April by Connecticut Democrat Joe Courtney\u2014with support from the AFL-CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2014which would scrap the tax before it takes effect in 2018. When Clinton and her further-left rivals Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders address the Nevada AFL-CIO (each will deliver a speech, closed to media, without taking questions), Cancela wants to hear it discussed. \u201cIt seems to me like it would be foolish to not address it with this crowd,\u201d she says.\n\nThe excise tax is a long-time sticking point for organized labor, which pushed hard for President Obama\u2019s election and for passage of the Affordable Care Act. Like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Keystone pipeline\u2014two other issues where unions are trying to pin Clinton down\u2014it\u2019s divisive among Democrats.\n\n\u201cAfter decades of fighting for it, we\u2019re finally moving towards a more rational, efficient health care system,\u201d Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Biden and current senior fellow at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote last month in a Washington Post essay defending the tax, which he said would help control costs, and keep the bill from increasing the deficit, all while initially hitting few employees. \u201cLet\u2019s not screw that up.\u201d\n\nThat plea didn\u2019t persuade UNITE HERE president D. Taylor. \u201cShifting costs to families that already can\u2019t pay their bills is not the same thing as holding down costs, and certainly doesn\u2019t control them responsibly,\u201d Taylor, who helmed the Culinary during the 2008 caucus, wrote in a rejoinder at the Huffington Post.\n\nSo far, the Democratic field is echoing unions\u2019 concerns, but not embracing any specific solution. In a questionnaire submitted to the American Federation of Teachers before winning its endorsement, Clinton said she was \u201cexamining\u201d the tax, and that, \u201cAs currently structured, I worry that it may create an incentive to substantially lower the value of the benefits package and shift more and more costs to consumers.\u201d\n\nIn a Monday e-mail, Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson told Bloomberg that the Democratic front-runner \u201ccontinues to seek ways to strengthen and improve the Affordable Care Act, including examining concerns that many workers have with the so-called \u2018Cadillac\u2019 tax.\u201d He said she \u201csupports the intention of trying to get health care costs under control\u201d but also \u201cbelieves we shouldn\u2019t put cost containment on the backs of consumers and workers.\u201d\n\nIn an answer a questionnaire for the Laborers International Union of North America, Sanders cited his proposal during the ACA debate to use a surtax on millionaires instead of a \"Cadillac tax,\" and said he's working on a solution in the Senate. \u201cThe challenge will be narrowly crafting legislation that provides relief to union members, while not giving another tax break to high-earning corporate executives,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn an AFL-CIO questionnaire submitted July 2, O\u2019Malley said it was necessary to \u201cconsider necessary changes\u201d because the tax \u201cmay affect far more people than expected and make it more difficult for individuals to get important, comprehensive medical coverage.\"\n\nClinton, who\u2019s been endorsed by two national unions so far, is expected to land several more over the next few months, though the AFL-CIO itself could hold off until the primary is effectively over. Cancela predicts that the fortunes of Representative Courtney\u2019s bill will affect when her union decides to endorse. (As in 2008, a formal endorsement would originate with the national union, but as representative of about a fifth of UNITE HERE\u2019s members, the home local of its current president, and a top player in an early caucus state, the Culinary has substantial sway.) UNITE HERE affiliates have sometimes frustrated allies by backing front-runners, like Chicago\u2019s Rahm Emanuel, against more liberal challengers.\n\nFor now, says Cancela, there\u2019s \u201ca lack of urgency\u201d from Culinary members about getting behind a candidate. \u201cThere\u2019s so much time before election day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Josh Eidelson", "description": "Memories of the bitter 2008 Democratic primary haven't completely faded.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAXHdw7Vltu4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "Memories of the bitter 2008 Democratic primary haven't completely faded.", "title": "Hillary Clinton's Nevada Union Foes Eye\u00a0Repeal of Obamacare 'Cadillac Tax'", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-18/hillary-clinton-s-nevada-union-foes-eye-repeal-of-obamacare-cadillac-tax-", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAXHdw7Vltu4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Memories of the bitter 2008 Democratic primary haven't completely faded.", "title": "Hillary Clinton's Nevada Union Foes Eye\u00a0Repeal of Obamacare 'Cadillac Tax'", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-18/hillary-clinton-s-nevada-union-foes-eye-repeal-of-obamacare-cadillac-tax-", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iAXHdw7Vltu4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "Memories of the bitter 2008 Democratic primary haven't completely faded."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Hillary Clinton's Nevada Union Foes Eye\u00a0Repeal of Obamacare 'Cadillac Tax'", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NT9T0K6KLVRD01", "parsely-author": "Josh Eidelson", "date": "2015-08-18T09:00:20.901Z", "keywords": "Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Labor Relations", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Labor Relations", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-18T09:00:20.901Z", "parsely-tags": "Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton,Labor Relations,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-08-18/hillary-clinton-s-nevada-union-foes-eye-repeal-of-obamacare-cadillac-tax-"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe don\u2019t look backwards, and I don\u2019t suspect the Clinton camp does either.\u201d Yvanna Cancela, Culinary Workers Union Local 226Hillary Clinton Tries to Woo AFL-CIOThings quickly got hostile.\nDays before the caucus, UNITE HERE blasted her in a radio ad.\n\u201cHillary Clinton does not respect our people,\u201d the union charged in Spanish.\n\u201cThe challenge will be narrowly crafting legislation that provides relief to union members, while not giving another tax break to high-earning corporate executives,\u201d he wrote.\nCancela predicts that the fortunes of Representative Courtney\u2019s bill will affect when her union decides to endorse."}
