Not impressed with the lack of female representation, a woman named Sophie Azran started an online petition to get Katniss Everdeen on the all male list that includes Iron Man, Clark Kent aka Superman, Bilbo Baggins, John Cale and Thor.\n\n\u201cYoung women already have too few female heroes represented in film and television,\u201d Azran writes. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly shown by the entertainment industry that men are brave, powerful, or successful, while women are often given supporting roles and weak characters.\u201d\n\nOf the 18,500 signatures, many people are commenting on why Katniss should be the hero, and Azran told The Hollywood Reporter that these comments mean a lot to her.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re only going to have one heroic category, then Katniss should absolutely be included. I\u2019d also be down with a \u2018Best Heroine\u2019 category as well. Either of these are valid options,\u201d says petition signer Danielle St. John from Texas.\n\nAmanda Hayes from Ohio doesn\u2019t understand how anyone from this world could fail to see Katniss as the hero.\n\nNicole Kline from Mississippi agrees with Hayes. \u201cHero\u2019s can be girls just as much as they can be guys. Katniss Everdeen is the Mockingjay, and she is a Hero. She leads the revolution and she deserves to be on this list with all these other fictional heroes.\u201d\n\nTausha Ostrander from Colorado wrote, \u201cWomen and girls need to see that they have the power to be leaders. The media must step up to the task by showing that women can be heroes too! We are just as capable as men, and recognition of that fact is essential!\u201d\n\nJust as long as it\u2019s not Miley. According to Deborah Bateman from Alabama, she would rather her daughters have a role model like Katniss over Miley any day.\n\nBeing only 1,500 signatures away from the current goal of 20,000, the petition is making waves. Signatures are not only coming in from all over the United States, but from all over the world. People from places such as the United Kingdom, Mexico, Europe, Afghanistan, Israel, South Africa and Thailand all want to see Katniss represented as the hero.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Hunger Games character, Katniss Everdeen, is a heroine to many all over the world, and people are joining forces by the thousands to voice this opinion.", "title": "Thousands sign petition for MTV to add Katniss Everdeen to 'Best...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/11/Katniss-Everdeen-the-Hunger-Games-600x337.jpg", "height": 337}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/03/16/thousands-sign-petition-for-mtv-to-add-katniss-everdeen-to-best-hero-award-category/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "mtv-movie-awards-nominees", "published_time": "2014-03-16T13:39:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-19T07:51:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ace\"", "article_summary": "Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Hunger Games character, Katniss Everdeen, is a heroine to many all over the world, and people are joining forces by the thousands to voice this opinion.\nKatniss Everdeen is the Mockingjay, and she is a Hero.\nEarlier this month, MTV announced their MTV Movie Awards nominees, including their nominees for \u201cBest Hero\u201d \u2014 and not one of the contenders is female.\nAmanda Hayes from Ohio doesn\u2019t understand how anyone from this world could fail to see Katniss as the hero.\nPeople from places such as the United Kingdom, Mexico, Europe, Afghanistan, Israel, South Africa and Thailand all want to see Katniss represented as the hero."}
