Four days later, Pontius, then 26, showed up at Studebaker Automotive Sales, 3625 E. Washington Blvd., Fort Wayne.\n\nPontius aimed to buy a stylish 1963 Avanti before it was too late.\n\n\u201cI was afraid I\u2019d never get the chance when I got out of school. They\u2019d all be gone,\u201d said Pontius, who was finishing his engineering studies at Indiana Tech.\n\nPontius paid $4,041 for his Avanti, setting up payments of $75 per month for three years.\n\n\u201cI was scared to death\u201d by the size of his commitment, Pontius told The Star this week.\n\nBut Pontius\u2019 investment paid off, because he still owns that Avanti. He has driven the sporty car 120,000 miles, mostly to call on Borg-Warner customers in the mid-1970s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still fun to drive,\u201d Pontius said. \u201cPeople that aren\u2019t even interested in cars turn their heads to look at it.\u201d\n\nIn 1964, he was visiting Cincinnati when people poured out of a barbershop \u2014 \u201ceven the guy in the chair\u201d \u2014 to admire his car, he said. \u201cThey were just swooning over it and thought it was the new Mustang,\u201d Pontius said, remembering his irritation at the mistaken identity.\n\nOn Labor Day weekend of 1965, Avanti owners gathered in Auburn at the same time as the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Club reunion, feeling a kinship with the ACD Club\u2019s owners of trend-setting, orphaned, Indiana-built cars. Pontius took a photo of six Avantis, including his, lined up on West 9th Street, where the ACD owners traditionally assemble.\n\nPontius moved to Auburn during his days as an engineer for the former Borg-Warner plant on the city\u2019s south side. He once considered taking a job for two South Bend men who were building replica Avantis. One of them convinced Pontius to go into business for himself instead, so Pontius opened the NAPA Auto Parts store in Auburn, which marked its 40th anniversary this year.\n\nPontius grew up with a family tradition of driving cars from small, independent makers. His grand-\n\nfather ran a small Kaiser-Frazier dealership.\n\n\u201cMy dad and I owned Studebakers,\u201d he said. Before buying his Avanti, Lee Pontius had driven a 1953 Studebaker hardtop. His\n\nfather drove four or five stylish Studebaker Hawks in the 1950s.\n\nThe Pontius family also has a long history of driving Hudsons. Today, Lee and his son, John, own 10 Hudsons, predominantly from the 1940s. \u201cThe independents were innovators,\u201d Lee Pontius said.\n\nStudebaker introduced the Avanti in 1962 in a last-ditch attempt to save the struggling company, in the much same way Auburn Automobile Co.\u2019s death throes produced the timeless 1936 Cord.\n\nThe Avanti featured radical styling and enough power to set 29 land-speed records. The company built fewer than 6,000 before the end came.\n\nThe Avanti \u201cwas different-looking than anything else,\u201d Pontius said. Its fiberglass body was supplied by the same Ohio company that made the first Corvette bodies in 1953.\n\nPontius\u2019 1963 Avanti came with a turquoise paint job.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even like the color,\u201d he said. He chose his car from four on the sales lot because \u201cit had the least options and cost the least of any of them.\u201d\n\nFinally, in the late 1980s, Pontius painted his Avanti black to suit his taste.
