The Boulder resident has twice had his home burn to the ground, and while his house on Flagstaff Mountain was safe last week, he and his partner were trapped for several days when part of their road washed out.\n\nThe sense of loss can be overwhelming when a natural disaster ruins your home and possessions, says Rosenthal, a licensed marriage and family therapist who also writes a syndicated advice column carried in The Denver Post.\n\n\u201cI come at this from two different angles,\u201d Rosenthal said in a phone interview. \u201cThe first is from my personal experience and the other is that I\u2019m a professional.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone in a family is going to feel bad when encountering such a situation, the adults have to be strong and offer reassurance to their kids, he said.\n\n\u201cLet children talk about their fear, their anxiety, their feelings of helplessness, their sadness and their sense of how unfair all this is,\u201d he said. Such emotions are normal and children may need an adult or parent to validate what they are feeling.\n\n\u201cChildren also need to know that things are going to be OK, that you will survive this tragedy and you\u2019re going to recover,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cThey may not have the sense that there is life after this, so you need to give them comfort, warmth and understanding.\u201d\n\nKids that don\u2019t get such reassurance \u201cmight feel helpless and hopeless and are likely to become anxious and depressed.\u201d\n\nFor children who are old enough, being able to help with clean-up or repair is therapeutic. \u201cThere\u2019s healing energy in doing something constructive, whether it\u2019s cleaning out a basement or carrying things to the front lawn,\u201d the therapist said.\n\nOffering comfort to children can be hard to do when parents might feel panicked themselves. In the Colorado floods, people are losing not only their homes in many cases, but their livelihoods as businesses and farms are washed away.\n\n\u201cYou can easily get to a place where you are pessimistic and hopeless,\u201d Rosenthal said. \u201cAnxiety, fatigue and sadness take over. You might also complain a lot and prone to saying or doing things that are insensitive, angry or uncaring.\u201d\n\nTry your hardest not to wallow in it or take it out on family members or your spouse, the therapist advised.\n\n\u201cRecovering from loss requires that people believe in themselves, have a strong will to recover and have good coping skills. They need to find some over-arching purpose and reason to live. Because it\u2019s only that attitude that will help you recover.\u201d\n\nPeople also need to be able to ask for help. \u201cAccept resources and don\u2019t let your pride be your enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s humility and comfort in accepting that offer.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also important for those who have lost homes and jobs to accept that things may never be the same. \u201cUse whatever resources are available to you as quickly and with as much optimism as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might not be able to build the same log cabin on the same river, but you can start again somewhere else.\u201d\n\nGood advice, but some people can never get over such an event, he acknowledged. \u201cThe trauma will define their life.\u201d\n\nRosenthal said he made a conscious decision after both the fires he experienced to believe in himself and his ability to move on. \u201cI kept telling myself that I would not let this event destroy my life.\u201d\n\nSuzanne S.
