Brad Davis is accused of first-degree murder for beating his stepfather and strangling him with underwear.

Brad Lee Davis said nothing as he was lead into the courthouse for his preliminary hearing on Thursday.



Davis is facing a first-degree murder charge and is accused of killing his stepfather, Denver St. Clair, by beating him and giving him an "atomic wedgie," which officials say strangled him. Court papers show Davis admitted to pulling Denver St. Clair's underwear over the his back and head -- allowing the elastic band to wrap around St. Clair's neck.

Prosecutors introduced the medical examiner's report stating blunt-force trauma and asphyxiation were St. Clair's cause of death.

The first witness to take the stand was James Allen Howell, a longtime family friend. Howell said he hung out at St. Clair's house growing up. Howell said Davis and St. Clair always seemed to get along with each other.

Howell testified he got a text from Davis on December 21, 2013, the night of the homicide, saying Davis was going to "f$&!" Denver up." Howell said he texted Davis not to do it because it was "not worth it".

Howell testified the next call he received was Davis saying "help me, help me, help me."

Howell said when he arrived at the house located at 4 Shadow Lake Drive near McLoud, he found St. Clair on the ground in a pool of blood and Davis yelling, "help me" over and over again.

He testified Davis even bowed up to him but did not fight him. Howell said that is when he went outside and flagged down a passing police officer.

Howell testified that days later, Davis and him were splitting wood together, and said Davis told him St. Clair started the fight with him.

During cross-examination, Howell testified Davis told him he never meant for the death to happen.

Davis will appear in court again later this summer.
