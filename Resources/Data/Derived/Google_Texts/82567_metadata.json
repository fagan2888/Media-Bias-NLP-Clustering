But the current failure of Blue Shield and Sutter Health to come to terms on a new contract may be harder to resolve. That\u2019s because the main issues appear to be about much more than money.\n\nTo the average patient, a request to arbitrate disputes doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal. But this is different.\n\nWhile the negotiations grind on, more than 250,000 people in individual and family plans are waiting to see what happens. The contract between Blue Shield and Sutter terminated on Dec. 31.\n\nTo be sure, money is a factor. Sutter says that Blue Shield is \u201cdemanding reductions in what they pay our organization \u2026 that would have a devastating impact,\u201d said Bill Gleeson, a spokesman for Sutter. He says Sutter has asked for \u201cless than a 1 percent increase.\u201d\n\nBut Blue Shield claims Sutter is pushing the insurer to accept \u201cnew and unprecedented contractual provisions,\u201d says Steven Shivinsky, spokesman for Blue Shield.\n\nThe most significant new contractual provision is a requirement to arbitrate disputes.\n\nNow, to any average patient, a request to arbitrate disputes probably doesn\u2019t sound like a big deal. I know I\u2019ve signed plenty of documents with various doctors over the years waiving my right to go to court and agreeing to arbitrate areas of disagreement.\n\nBut this is different.\n\nBlue Shield\u2019s Shivinsky says that generally arbitration between insurers and providers goes something like this: A provider and insurer disagree on how much reimbursement there should be for, say, an operation. They can\u2019t agree, they go to arbitration. That happens all the time, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s appropriate, it\u2019s inexpensive, it\u2019s fast, and it resolves these issues quickly.\u201d\n\nBut Sutter\u2019s Gleeson says its arbitration requirement applies to all business practices, including any questions of anti-competitive business practices.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where the two sides differ. Dramatically.\n\nBlue Shield insists that any antitrust disputes should be resolved in public, in open court. Gleeson called the issue \u201ca red herring.\u201d As part of the current negotiations, Sutter wants to extend that arbitration requirement to all the self-funded plans that Blue Shield manages. (Many large employers pay health claims out of their own pockets and hire insurance companies \u2014 like Blue Shield \u2014 to administer the benefit.)\n\nBlue Shield says that would be asking its customers to waive their legal rights. \u201cWe\u2019d be telling our self-funded customers, you cannot sue Sutter for anti-competitive business practices in open court,\u201d Shivinsky said. These self-funded clients would be likely to drop Blue Shield and head for other insurers that haven\u2019t signed such a contract.\n\nSutter is already facing an antitrust lawsuit from the UFCW & Employers Benefit Trust, (UEBT) a self-funded trust which provides health care for 100,000 grocery workers at Safeway, Save Mart and other grocery stores. The suit charges Sutter with anti-competitive practices, including an \u201call or none\u201d hospital requirement and limits on sharing cost information with patients.\n\nSutter has already petitioned to have the case moved to arbitration. It lost the motion and is appealing that decision. Gleeson denies that Sutter has such an \u201call or none\u201d strategy and says it does share cost information with patients. \u201cWe absolutely expect to win the lawsuit on its merits,\u201d Gleeson said.\n\nIn a statement, UEBT said, \u201cWe applaud Blue Shield for standing firm against Sutter\u2019s attempts to impose new contract terms that would require private arbitration of anti-trust and unfair competition claims.\u201d\n\nConcerns About Sutter\u2019s Market Power\n\nSutter has long been criticized not only by insurers but also by employers and economists for accumulating market power and then increasing prices. Sutter has been on a years-long hospital buying spree in Northern California, resulting in higher rates in the region, economists say. Case in point: According to an FTC study, increases in rates at Oakland\u2019s Summit Medical Center ranged from 29 percent to 72 percent after it was bought by Sutter.\n\nGlenn Melnick, a health economist at USC, called Sutter the \u201cposter child for developing a model to accumulate and protect their market power.\u201d He says this market power has created a \u201cprice umbrella\u201d in Northern California, where competitors just have to be a \u201clittle bit cheaper than Sutter.\u201d\n\nEven adjusted for Northern California\u2019s higher cost of living, Melnick said a commercially-paid hospital day in a Northern California hospital averages 36 percent more than a day in a Southern California hospital \u2014 about $1,800 more for each hospital day.\n\n\u201cIn Southern California, there\u2019s no dominant [hospital] system,\u201d he said, \u201cand we don\u2019t have as many medium-sized systems,\u201d leading to more price competition in Southern California.\n\nBlue Shield Rate Hikes\n\nBlue Shield has been chastised for its own rate hikes. Last January, California\u2019s insurance commissioner called a nearly 10 percent rate hike on grandfathered plans \u201cexcessive and unreasonable.\u201d At that time, total increases over two years came to an average 32 percent.\n\nBoth sides say they want to come to an agreement. In the meantime, many policyholders have received letters saying the two sides have agreed to a \u201ctransition period\u201d lasting until either April or June, depending on the policy.\n\nBut Palo Alto insurance broker Chris Acker isn\u2019t so sure people really have that much time. Open enrollment for health insurance closes Feb. 15. \u201cThe plan wasn\u2019t canceled,\u201d he said. \u201cThe provider just canceled the contract.\u201d\n\nIt does not seem that people would be able to claim a special enrollment period and sign up for new insurance. when the transition period ends.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Blue Shield/Sutter contract ended Dec. 31.
