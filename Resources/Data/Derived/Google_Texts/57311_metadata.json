If you don\u2019t have health insurance you won\u2019t go to jail, but you could be hit with a fine or what is being called a \u201cpenalty\u201d.\n\nHere are the minimum penalties for 2014:\n\nAdults without insurance $95\n\nChildren without insurance $47.50 per child\n\nFamilies with multiple kids $285\n\nPeople without health insurance coverage will pay either the minimum amounts above OR 1% of household income, whichever is greater. That\u2019s the key thing to remember.\n\nFor example the minimum penalty for a single adult is $95. But if that person has an income is $30,000. 1% of that is $300. You pay whichever is greater. In this case $300.\n\nHere\u2019s another example. If a family of four isn\u2019t insured, the minimum penalty they\u2019ll pay is $285. But say the household income is $45,000, well 1% of that is $450. Again, they\u2019ll pay the higher of the two, $450, not $285.\n\nEach year these penalties increase.\n\nSo in 2015 the minimum penalty will be $325 per adult, $162.50 per child and up to $975 for a family OR 2% of the household income, whichever is greater.\n\nIn 2016 the minimum penalty will be $695 per adult, $347.50 per child, or $2,085 for a family OR 2.5% of the household income, whichever is greater.\n\nAfter 2016 the penalty amounts will be increased annually by the cost of living.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how the government will get you to pay out these penalties, well they\u2019ll take it out of any tax refund that your owed beginning in 2015.\n\nBy the way, income is defined as total income in excess of the filing threshold ($10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a family in 2013).\n\nThe penalty will be also be pro-rated by the number of months without coverage and there is no penalty if you have a single gap in coverage that\u2019s less than 3 months in a year. Finally, the penalty can also not be more than the average premium charged nationally for Bronze coverage in a marketplace.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act, often referred to as Obamacare, requires that beginning in 2014 Americans have health insurance.
