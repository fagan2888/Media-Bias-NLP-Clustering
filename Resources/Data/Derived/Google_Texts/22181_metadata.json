She\u2019s had five surgeries to remove the tumor, but still has years of check-ups and treatments in her future. And now, Pratt says she feels \u201cembarrassed and terrible,\u201d but not because of her condition.\n\nThe young California resident spoke with TheBlaze\u2019s Liz Klimas last week, explaining how her medical costs have skyrocketed under Obamacare, and added more Monday in a web-only exclusive with Glenn Beck.\n\n\u201cHave you tried to sign up for the exchange?\u201d Beck asked.\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d Pratt replied. \u201c[It's] impossible. The website is terrible, and when I called \u2026 It just kicked me off \u2026 I couldn\u2019t leave my name, a phone number, nothing.\u201d\n\nPratt said she tried calling before New Year\u2019s, and has called \u201cfour or five times\u201d since, but has never spoken to anybody from Covered California.\n\nIn addition to being \u201c[scared] to death\u201d that her neurosurgeon will join the many other medical professionals who are leaving the industry, Pratt said she feels \u201cembarrassed and terrible that no one is listening\u201d to her story. Many who crusaded for Obamacare and promised that it would lower costs are remarkably silent when it comes to her situation, it seems.\n\n\u201c[I'm] embarrassed for my country, my community, that no one wants to take up my defense,\u201d she said simply. \u201cJust very sad.\u201d\n\nAnd though TheBlaze has picked up her story, Pratt said she even encountered some hateful commenters there.\n\n\u201cThey all decided, well this girl \u2026 she\u2019s 28 from California, she had to have voted for Barack Obama. Not the case,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cIt crushed me thinking that people viewed me in this way, when that is never how I have lived my life.\u201d\n\nWatch the complete web exclusive, below:\n\n\u2013\n\nOther Must-Read Stories:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "28-year-old Amanda Pratt has survived a brain tumor the size of her fist.
