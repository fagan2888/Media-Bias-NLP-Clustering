More payers have been targeting value-based care reimbursement and cost transparency in order to achieve the Triple Aim \u2013 improved patient satisfaction, quality health outcomes, and decreased medical costs.\n\nDr. Rita Numerof, PhD, Author, Co-founder and President of Numerof & Associates, offered her expertise in an interview about the ongoing trends in the health insurance market, the focus on value-based care reimbursement, and what to expect for the future of the health payer.\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: How can health insurers and providers work together to stabilize rising healthcare costs while improving patient outcomes?\n\nDr. Rita Numerof: \u201cIt\u2019s important to look at this challenge in context because history would suggest that payers and providers working together don\u2019t have real good odds. There\u2019s been massive distrust and the distrust has been earned on both sides -- in part driven by the business model that we have in the whole sector of healthcare. The providers and payers are just a piece of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first issue is that insurers over a long period of time have, quite frankly, perfected the art of saying \u2018no\u2019 in 27 different ways. They\u2019ve said that to consumers, to patients, and to providers including primary care physicians, specialty physicians, or hospital institutions. Historically, there\u2019s been an antagonistic relationship between commercial payers and the provider community.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of that is well-earned because of some egregious things on the provider side as well. It\u2019s not about one at fault and the other is totally without blame. I think both parties need to step back and take a look at the dance they\u2019ve done together, why, and begin to pave the way forward for a different dance.\u201d\n\n\u201cProviders have been guilty of up charging and cost-shifting to commercial payers. That is publicly known. It\u2019s been known for quite some time in part because the payment from Medicare and Medicaid has not been as rich as it has been on the commercial side. Somebody else has paid \u2013 somebody else being employers. The consumers haven\u2019t had much line of sight to this until relatively recently.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to acknowledge the lack of trust that has historically characterized this relationship. The idea of a fundamentally different way of coming together is really challenging and is at the heart of what we need to have going forward.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are very meaningful ways in which these two parties can collaborate. There are opportunities for them to look differently at how payment is derived and what gets paid for. There has to be transparency and trust. It means those parties need to change their business models. Obviously, that\u2019s not a small feat.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: In what ways would cost transparency benefit consumers and patients? Could it bring more competition to the healthcare market?\n\nDr. Rita Numerof: \u201cCost transparency is really critical in terms of a market-based model, which is at the core of bringing value to healthcare. If you think about every other sphere of our lives, we understand the business services we\u2019re buying, we understand the price points, and we understand the guarantees.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutside of healthcare there are third parties that evaluate how these services are likely to perform. Historically, we really haven\u2019t had that in healthcare. There\u2019s been regulation and oversight, but we\u2019ve known for years that hospitals, for example, are unsafe.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you think about the appropriate outcry when we had problems with brake failures among Toyota vehicles. A number of people were killed as a result. It wasn\u2019t even clear if it was because of the brakes themselves or some user error attributed to this. In healthcare, we\u2019ve known that almost 100,000 people die each year because of medical error.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet, there hasn\u2019t been that outcry. So transparency, not just from a cost standpoint, but from a meaningful outcomes perspective, is essential to changing the whole dynamic of the industry. We are a far cry from that, but I see green shoots moving in a direction of meaningful transparency related to safety and outcomes that matter to consumers. I think that payers have a role to play in that in terms of making available cost and safety issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe measures that are published have to be legitimate measures with data that people can stand behind. Today, we are not where we need to be, but I see a path forward. If we keep working towards increased transparency and the media remains focused on this, we are going to increase the likelihood that we\u2019re going to get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, there is a belief that healthcare services and outcomes are basically equal around the country. The only thing, then, that matters is the cost. I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s true. We also know that the cost, if we\u2019re looking at the charge master for delivery, is a spurious charge. Nobody pays the charge master charge and we need to get to real value. Some of those dynamics need to take place as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there will be more competition. Whenever you have more real transparency, more people in the game, there will be real competition. People are hungry for that kind of information. They want more choice. They want choice in the products they buy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, the way the Affordable Care Act was established, there is very little choice other than looking at some services and copays. The basic offerings are mostly the same. I think that going forward, there will be some changes in the legislation. I think that will also enhance competition.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What steps can payers and providers take to successfully implement value-based care reimbursement models such as bundled payments?\n\nDr. Rita Numerof: \u201cThere are some very specific things that providers must do to move down the path to value. And there\u2019s an interesting component here that most provider organizations don\u2019t realize: the competencies that are needed to move into a bundled price scenario for payment are the same competencies that, ironically, are needed to be successful in a fee-for-service environment today.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me walk you through what those components are. There are five elements that I believe are essential to being able to function effectively in a bundled payment, value-based arena where transparency will be the norm going forward. The first of these is to define clearly the services that are included in the bundle, whatever that bundle may be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it going to be within the in-patient setting? Is it going to be across the continuum? I believe that the further out you go, the more value is going to be generated. I believe that hospitals were never meant to be destinations of choice, even though we\u2019re still going to need them. They need to operate safely and efficiently, but it\u2019s not a place that people choose or want to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe more we can deliver care outside of the hospital setting effectively, the more we\u2019re going to lower cost, improve satisfaction, and get more value. Defining those services across the continuum, engaging employed physicians as well as independent physicians, and having an evidence-based approach to delivering that set of clinical services is absolutely critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of science that has not been hardwired into how healthcare systems practice. There still has been an orientation to using idiosyncratic approaches reflecting people\u2019s training. It doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m advocating for cookie-cutter medicine because I\u2019m not. But there is a base of science that we know increases the likelihood of getting good results versus not good results with certain kinds of conditions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin that, there is going to be variation based on a particular patient\u2019s situation and that needs to be handled independently. I think that\u2019s doable. There needs to be a way of managing compliance. Defining the services, which is the first of five elements, is not an easy task.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of elements that need to be built into this and most providers are not set up to think like this. You have to think about panels of patients with a certain kind of condition. Oftentimes, particularly if we\u2019re getting into more complex chronic conditions, individuals have many of them and we\u2019re getting some of those complex, chronic conditions earlier in our life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis means that there are likely to be more complications and more expense down the road. Getting a handle on this now is really important.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe second area is figuring out what the fixed price is for a set of services that you\u2019ve defined. That has to do with projecting out what you think the costs are likely to be, assuming you\u2019re able to get predictive care paths. You need to model out what those likely scenarios are. You need to understand your historical costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, most finance systems in healthcare delivery are not set up to do this. They\u2019ve been set up to do payment on a CPT code basis at the micro level. Rolling it up to the macro level is very challenging. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important, as we think about moving to value-based care, we do it in a defined way, focused on a particular service area that would be highly relevant to that particular institution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe third piece of this is that you have to identify outcomes that really matter. They have to be at a high-enough level so that we\u2019re not measuring everything that\u2019s possible but measuring outcomes. Do we have diabetics under control? If we\u2019re looking at bundling in mental health, do we have mental health issues under control?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are specific outcomes that are relevant to the clinical area that we\u2019re going after in the bundle. The satisfaction of the patient is going to be really important in outcomes. We\u2019re going to have to look at quality outcomes. Those three things are very essential building blocks in the bundle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fourth element is you have to be able to manage variation in cost and quality to make this work. It means that clinicians and finance people have to learn different languages and develop different skills to be able to talk together in ways that historically they haven\u2019t been able to. It\u2019s not just the payer here \u2013 it\u2019s within the delivery system that this needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, there needs to be negotiation with payers and providers. Part of the reason that the trust has been so low is that payers understand legitimately that most providers don\u2019t have the discipline to do what I just laid out. That\u2019s part of the reason they\u2019re very concerned about getting into joint products and joint collaborations. I think going forward, that\u2019s essential.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fifth building block is provider organizations need to have a compelling economic and clinical value argument that explains why consumers, why employers, and why payers should want to come to their institution for this set of services because they can stand behind their outcomes and guarantee the price and even warrantee the services.\u201d\n\nHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What advice would you give to health payers looking to work with an accountable care organization?\n\nDr. Rita Numerof: \u201cThe first thing is that they need to understand the kinds of changes they need to make themselves in their business model because it\u2019s not a situation where they can blame providers or others for the situation that we\u2019re in today. They are also responsible for contributing to the conditions that we\u2019re all wanting to change. To the extent that they\u2019re willing to do that and they understand that they need to have skin in the game, have more transparency and trust, and be willing to look at how they define data and negotiate with a different outcome in mind, we\u2019re in a position to really have a legitimate seat at the table and to begin a conversation where the outcomes can be extraordinarily positive for all of us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More payers have been targeting value-based care reimbursement and cost transparency in order to achieve the Triple Aim.", "author": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/5-elements-essential-for-value-based-care-reimbursement", "site_name": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "image": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_20_7320986658.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "5 Elements Essential for Value-based Care Reimbursement"}, "twitter": {"description": "More payers have been targeting value-based care reimbursement and cost transparency in order to achieve the Triple Aim.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_20_7320986658.jpg"}, "title": "5 Elements Essential for Value-based Care Reimbursement", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "I think that will also enhance competition.\u201dHealthPayerIntelligence.com: What steps can payers and providers take to successfully implement value-based care reimbursement models such as bundled payments?\nMore payers have been targeting value-based care reimbursement and cost transparency in order to achieve the Triple Aim \u2013 improved patient satisfaction, quality health outcomes, and decreased medical costs.\nThey\u2019ve said that to consumers, to patients, and to providers including primary care physicians, specialty physicians, or hospital institutions.\nThere are five elements that I believe are essential to being able to function effectively in a bundled payment, value-based arena where transparency will be the norm going forward.\nI believe that hospitals were never meant to be destinations of choice, even though we\u2019re still going to need them."}
