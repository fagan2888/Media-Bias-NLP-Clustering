More than 10 candidates could be onstage, depending on ties in polling.\n\nBut the group of New Hampshire Republicans says the criteria are \u201cunnecessarily narrow\u201d for the first debate and risk leaving out \u201cpotentially viable candidates based on unreliable national polling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny metric used to select the top ten candidates based on public polling this early in the nominating process would make it impossible to ensure fairness. Indeed, the margin between the tenth candidate and those that don\u2019t qualify will almost certainly be statistically insignificant,\u201d the letter states.\n\nThe letter is signed by some prominent Republicans in the state, including James and Chris Sununu, Andy Sanborn, Charlie Arlinghaus, Rich Ashooh, Fergus Cullen, Marilinda Garcia, Dan Innis, Ovid Lamontagne, Doug Scamman and Stella Scamman.\n\nEver since criteria for the debates were announced, there has been concern that candidates such as Donald Trump, who polls well due to name recognition, would beat out other, perhaps more serious candidates, such as Carly Fiorina, for a spot on the debate stage. As a result, candidates might be spending more time trying to gin up publicity and name ID across the country in order to boost their poll numbers, instead of speaking to early-state voters directly in New Hampshire and Iowa.\n\n\u201cThe first televised debate of the 2016 election cycle should place all candidates on even footing and allow each to make their case directly to the voters and your viewers,\u201d the letter states. \u201cAnything less would prematurely suppress the candidate field, and arbitrarily elevate candidates who benefit from preliminary notoriety and fundraising.\u201d\n\nThe group suggests a new format that would include two panels that appear back-to-back, taking the top six candidates in public polls and randomly splitting them into the two panels, with the remaining candidates randomly split evenly among the other spots.\n\nThis setup is somewhat similar to how CNN is setting up its primary debate on Sept. 16. It will feature two panels, one with the top 10 candidates according to public polling, and another with the remaining candidates who meet a minimum threshold of 1 percent in public polling.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Fox News and the RNC for comment and will update here accordingly.\n\nRead the full letter here.\n\nUPDATE (3:15p.m.):\n\nRNC spokesperson Sean Spicer sends a statement via email:\n\n\"We are very pleased that both CNN and Fox will give all candidates over one percent significant exposure.\"\n\nUPDATE (4:30p.m.):\n\nStephen Duprey, chairman of the RNC 2016 Debates Committee, who also happens to hail from the Granite state, emails to explain the RNC's thinking behind the criteria, and why CNN and Fox News chose not to incorporate early state polling:\n\n\"Our various media partners were all receptive to our suggestions as to how to determine who got into the debates and what the criteria should be. However, those same media partners made it clear that they, as the holders of the FCC licenses, got to make the decision on criteria,\u201d Duprey said. \u201cFurther, there are legitimate concerns that if the RNC set the criteria that would create an illegal campaign contribution to those who our criteria allowed in to a debate.\u201d\n\nDuprey said the committee has worked to improve the debates from previous cycles and that the various media partners were all receptive to their suggestions. The RNC suggested that media partners use early state polling results and current office holders as part of their criteria for entry, Duprey said, but that Fox and CNN chose not to. Other media partners who haven\u2019t set out their criteria yet may choose to incorporate early state polling. That being said, Duprey did note that Fox and CNN have their criteria out earlier than ever before in primary history.\n\n\"There is no perfect set of criteria. The criteria used in these first two debates will likely be different from that used in others We anticipate there will be further refinements and adjustments as this process moves forward,\" Duprey said. \u201cCriteria and formats will continue to evolve and adjust.\u201d\n\nHadas Gold is a reporter at Politico.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>A group of prominent New Hampshire Republicans want Fox and the RNC to change their debate criteria.&nbsp;</p>", "title": "New Hampshire Republicans ask Fox, RNC to change debate criteria", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/06/nh-republicans-ask-fox-rnc-to-change-debate-criteria-208568.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/hadas.gold"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "<p>A group of prominent New Hampshire Republicans want Fox and the RNC to change their debate criteria.&nbsp;</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That being said, Duprey did note that Fox and CNN have their criteria out earlier than ever before in primary history.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Fox News and the RNC for comment and will update here accordingly.\nOn Media Blog Archives Select Date\u2026 December, 2015 November, 2015 October, 2015 September, 2015 August, 2015 July, 2015 June, 2015 May, 2015 April, 2015 March, 2015 February, 2015 January, 2015New Hampshire Republicans ask Fox, RNC to change debate criteriaA group of prominent New Hampshire Republicans has written an open letter to Fox News and the Republican National Committee, urging them to reconsider the criteria for the Republican primary debates on the network.\n):RNC spokesperson Sean Spicer sends a statement via email:\"We are very pleased that both CNN and Fox will give all candidates over one percent significant exposure.\"\nOther media partners who haven\u2019t set out their criteria yet may choose to incorporate early state polling."}
