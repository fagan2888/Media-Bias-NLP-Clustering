Rick Snyder will head into the general election with Lt. Gov. Brian Calley at his side.\n\nCalley bested tea party organizer Wes Nakagiri on Saturday at the Michigan Republican Party\u2019s statewide nominating convention in Novi, winning support from nearly two of every three voting delegates, according to an unofficial tally.\n\nResults were not made public because Nakagiri moved to make Calley\u2019s nomination unanimous once the outcome was clear.\n\nThe battle had been brewing for months, but Calley\u2019s team entered the convention with confidence after putting together a massive project to recruit precinct delegates.\n\nThe question wasn't whether he would win, they said, it was by how much.\n\n\"I think the margin was very important,\" former GOP Chair Saul Anuzis said as the results came in. \"I think the fact it looks like he\u2019s going to break 60 percent is a significant message that the party is united and believes there ought to be a Snyder-Calley team, which I think is good for the ticket and good for Republicans.\"\n\nRon Weiser, a longtime player in the Republican Party and major fundraiser, narrowly succeeded in his quest for nomination to the University of Michigan Board of Regents after being hit with nasty and anonymous attacks in recent weeks. He\u2019ll join Dr. Rob Steele on the ticket this fall.\n\nNakagiri and his tea party supporters set their sights on Calley due to frustration with the administration over Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act and the governor's support for Common Core education standards, among other issues.\n\nBut Snyder, opening up the convention, called Calley \u201ca strong conservative voice\u201d and the best lieutenant governor in the country.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t always see eye to eye, but he speaks up,\u201d Snyder told delegates. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody I rely on his wisdom, his judgement, and we work as a team. He\u2019s so important his office is next to mine, not several floors down like the history of lieutenant governors in the state.\u201d\n\nDonna Nakagiri, who spoke in support of her husband, said he was \u201ca leader who can galvanize conservatives\u201d turned off by the Snyder administration.\n\n\u201cIf the base doesn\u2019t turn out in November, then we\u2019ll get Mark Schauer, and nobody wants that,\u201d she said, referencing the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. \u201cWe need conservatives to be energized, to stuff lit bags, to knock on those doors and to get out the vote in November.\u201d\n\nCommon Core was a common theme at the Republican convention, with various state board and university regent candidates knocking the national education standards despite Snyder's public support.\n\nWest Michigan U.S. Rep. Justin Amash, who backed Calley\u2019s nomination, called him a strong conservative voice who \u201cwill push back against policies not delegated to the federal government under the constitution, like Common Core.\u201d\n\nSnyder, speaking with reporters later in the convention, reiterated his support for Common Core but would not discuss Calley's position, saying that \"we don\u2019t talk about our differences publicly.\"\n\nWeiser pulled out the big guns in his bid to win over the tea party crowd. After bringing U.S. Sen Ted Cruz to town earlier this month, he hosted a pre-convention party on Friday night in Novi with Fox News contributor Allen West, and his convention video featured an audio endorsement from Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nStill, Weiser topped former regent Dan Horning by less than 200 votes, according to an unofficial tally. Former GOP treasurer Carl Meyers finished fourth.\n\nWeiser has worked as a finance chair for the National Republican Committee, and some supporters suggested this week that his nomination could benefit the rest of the ticket, including U.S. Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land of Grandville, who will face Democratic U.S. Rep. Gary Peters this fall.\n\nLand, a former Michigan Secretary of State who did not face opposition in the primary, turned her focus to the general election during an address to convention delegates, repeating her vow to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare\u201d while knocking Peters for criticizing her position on women\u2019s issues. Land has said she supports equal pay for women but would not have voted for the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n\n\u201cWhenever liberal men tell me what women should care about, I get suspicious,\u201d she said.\n\nMaria Carl of Macomb won a party nomination for the state Board of Education despite accusations of anti-Semitism. Former state Rep. Leon Drolet passed out pamphlets highlighting newspaper coverage of the party\u2019s 1992 convention, when Carl reportedly said she would not vote for a Republican National Committeewoman who was Jewish.\n\nJon Williams of Jackson will also appear on the ballot as a Republican candidate for the State Board of Education.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Bill Schuette and Secretary of State Ruth Johnson, who did not face any convention challengers, were unanimously renominated, as were Supreme Court Justices David Viviano and Brian Zahra.\n\nKent County Circuit Court Judge James Robert Redford will join them on the non-partisan portion of the ballot as a candidate for the Supreme Court.\n\nMelanie Foster of East Lansing and Jeff Sakwa of West Bloomfield, who ran for the same posts in 2012, won nominations for the Michigan State University Board of Trustees. Satish Jasti of West Bloomfield and Michael Busuito of Troy will also get a second shot at the Wayne State Board.\n\nDespite some grumbling, many Republicans were talking unity by the time the convention was over. Nakagiri urged support for the ticket, and Snyder even indicated that he would drop by Nakagiri's post-convention party.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been all this talk about division and tea party versus establishment, but it\u2019s all being settled right here,\u201d said political consultant Jake Davison of Advantage Associates. \u201cNobody\u2019s walking out of this place saying I\u2019m not going to vote for Snyder, or for the ticket. This is it, we\u2019re settling our differences in house.\u201d\n\nJonathan Oosting is a Capitol reporter for MLive Media Group.
