Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward said a “rat’s nest of concealment and lies” is at the heart of many Obama administration scandals and miscues, including the disastrous Obamacare website rollout.

“They need to review the this secret world and its power in their government because you run into this rats nest of concealment and lies time and time again then and now,” Woodward said of the White House during his appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday. “You get to a point where it’s what do you worry about? Secret governments.”

As for Obamacare, Woodward said “it clearly isn’t working” and it connects to the idea that America possesses an “incredibly powerful government that gets on automatic pilot and you have people with inexperience who don’t know about nuts and bolts questions. People who don’t go in and say, ‘Well, now is this going to work? Let’s test it.’

“We were talking earlier about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. That was run by Leon Panetta, who was CIA director, who knew to make sure you checked all of the boxes, and they literally had a place…a compound that they reconstructed and…they practiced. And we didn’t even practice Obamacare.”
