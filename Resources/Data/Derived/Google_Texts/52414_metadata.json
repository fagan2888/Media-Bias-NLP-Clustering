Yesterday President Obama touted the economic growth the nation has witnessed during his tenure in office, and assailed Republicans for not having \u201cthe courage to lay out theirs.\u201d Although the President has a point, Republicans have laid out their \u201cideas to create more jobs and grow more wages,\u201d but because they know their ideas will not, have not, and cannot do either, they only reveal their true ideas to their corporate and wealthy supporters. Americans are not the smartest people on the planet, but they are aware that Republicans\u2019 failed economic policies do not create jobs and increase wages because they just experienced a Great Recession founded on Republican failed policies.\n\nThe President duly noted that after laying out his ideas for more jobs and better wages, Republicans took a stand for the rich and blocked policies that would help the middle class and lift the poor out of poverty such as \u201craising the minimum wage, enacting fair pay, refinancing student loans, or extending unemployment insurance for the unemployed.\u201d He also explained Republicans have sort-of backed off the fear mongering about the out-of-control deficits they created during the Bush years, and relaxed the fright-fest related to the Affordable Care Act. The point of the President\u2019s speech was that the midterm elections should be \u201ca referendum on two starkly different visions\u201d for the economy, and he could have pointed out that there has been some very good economic reports in spite of Republican obstruction.\n\nFirst, economic growth in the second quarter of 2014 was at its highest level since 2006; two full years before Republicans created the Great Recession. The promising report was in spite of Republican claims that the only way to grow the economy is more tax cuts for the rich and eliminate banking, workplace, and environmental regulations. It is precisely the same thing they claim will create more jobs, so it was curious the President was silent that for the first time in 14 years, economists reported that \u201cinitial jobless claims can\u2019t go much lower,\u201d and that \u201cjob creation is occurring at the strongest pace since the recession ended.\u201d All this in spite of a tax increase on the richest Americans and regulations holding firmly in place.\n\nThe president said Republicans should \u201chave the courage to lay out\u201d their ideas for creating job growth, and assailed their ridiculous trickle-down economics platform. He said, \u201cIf there were any credibility to the argument that says when those at the top do well, eventually everyone else will do well, it would have borne itself out by now.\u201d The President is absolutely correct about tax cuts for the rich and corporations never producing prosperity for anyone other than corporations and the wealthy, but he is wrong that Republicans have not laid out their \u201cideas for creating job growth.\u201d In fact, just last week House Speaker John Boehner presented Republicans\u2019 five-point plan to create jobs and grow wages during a speech at the American Enterprise Institute that, although a plan, is precisely what the President criticized and not one Boehner is willing to present to the voters.\n\nBoehner 5-point GOP \u201cplan to create jobs, boost wages, and bring good-paying jobs home\u201d includes in part eliminating corporate taxes to stop inversions, and then \u201cget workers off the sidelines by building a culture of hard work and responsibility around them.\u201d First on Boehner\u2019s list is drastically slashing taxes for corporations and the rich (trickle-down economics) he said will create a job bonanza and increase wages. Boehner said the GOP plan was crucial to \u201cresetting the foundation of our economy for the next two or three generations, provide a stream of good-paying jobs, and provide more security straight through retirement.\u201d When Boehner said \u201cresetting the foundation of our economy,\u201d he meant revisiting the Bush-era tax cuts and deregulation that were partly responsible for increasing the deficit, the Great Recession, and more profits for the rich.\n\nHis second point was \u201cto rein in the regulatory system.\u201d He particularly noted the Dodd-Frank banking reform and said that if America stopped regulating banks and Wall Street, there would be a jobs boom and Americans\u2019 wages would increase. It is more of the Bush-era deregulatory frenzy that created the Great Recession President Obama warned was not sustainable. The President said \u201cto have an economy where growth was based on inflated prices and bubbles that burst, and the casino mentality on Wall Street where the recklessness of a few\u201d would threaten us all is not defensible. \u201cThat was not a formula for sustained growth.\u201d Except that it was a brilliant formula for Wall Street that has grown by leaps and bounds as well as taken the lion\u2019s share of the recovery which is why Republicans are anxious to \u201crein in banking regulations.\u201d\n\nBoehner\u2019s third point was \u201creforming our legal system\u201d and cutting awards for corporate malfeasance. According to Republican ideology, it is unfair for corporations, large and small, to pay damages to victims that Boehner claimed just drives up prices to the consumer and kills potential and existing jobs. He said he is all for \u201ctaking care of people who have been injured,\u201d but within \u201creasonable limits on damages and compensation\u201d because the current system is too costly for big business and their bottom line.\n\nThe fourth point of the Republican plan was once and for all solving \u201cour spending problem\u201d on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid entitlements. Of course, Social Security is self-funded and does not, and cannot, take any money from the government, but Republicans want to cut benefits, raise the retirement age, and hand the Trust over to Wall Street for administration and disbursements. Boehner failed to reveal how making drastic cuts to, or privatizing, Social Security would create a job explosion or increase working Americans\u2019 wages, but he did note that since Americans are living till they are 80, the retirement age must be increased and benefits must be cut. It makes no sense as part of a job creation and wage increase economic plan, but no more than the fifth point in a plan meant to increase the wealth of corporations.\n\nIt is unbelievable really, but Boehner said enacting a comprehensive privatized school initiative across the whole of America was an integral aspect of the plan to create new jobs, boost wages, bring jobs home, stop inversions, and build a culture of hard work into Americans \u201cstanding on the sidelines.\u201d Apparently, Boehner thinks that giving parents an opportunity to find \u201cthe better (read more costly and underperforming) schools they need and deserve\u201d is part of helping them get ahead and \u201cnot just get by.\u201d Interestingly, Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus reiterated Boehner\u2019s \u201cprivatize America\u2019s schools\u201d plan and said it was economically prudent and a civil rights issue parents are desperate to see implemented.\n\nMaybe President Obama saying Republicans should \u201chave the courage to lay out their ideas for creating jobs and growing wages\u201d was to bait them into telling the people their intent is returning to Bush-era economics and more recessions. It is worth noting that Republicans have laid out their economic agenda, but they have been very careful to reveal their plans primarily to their wealthy donors and corporate think tanks, but not the public. Remember, Mitch McConnell told the Koch brothers\u2019 billionaire cabal that if Republicans gain control of the Senate they will \u201cgo after all of the federal government,\u201d including Social Security. Paul Ryan admitted Republicans can hardly stop Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food stamps without a Republican Senate, but they are not campaigning on those issues for obvious reasons; they would never get elected.\n\nIt appears it is up to President Obama to expose the Republican job creation and wage growth agenda and show the stark contrast between his successful policies that lifted America out of the Republican recession the GOP will return to with a vengeance if they control Congress. The President was right to imply Republicans are cowards for concealing their plans that will not create jobs or grow wages, and now he has to take the next step and reveal why their cowardice prevents them from telling the people their only plan is creating more wealth for the rich and corporations at the expense of the poor and middle class.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is difficult to believe that any American might think, even for a nano-second, that Republicans serve anyone other than the rich and corporations, and it is why they are hesitant to lay out their true agenda heading into the midterm elections.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "It is difficult to believe that any American might think, even for a nano-second, that Republicans serve anyone other than the rich and corporations, and it is why they are hesitant to lay out their true agenda heading into the midterm elections.", "title": "Natural Born Job Killers: Why Republicans Are Afraid to Reveal Their Job Creation Ideas", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/10/03/republicans-afraid-reveal-job-creation-ideas.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Republican-plan.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-03T16:58:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Commentary,Featured News,American enterprise Institute,Banking,Bush tax cuts,House Speaker,John Boehner,medicare,mitch mcconnell,Presidency of Barack Obama,Republican Party,trickle down economics,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-10-03T15:03:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T16:58:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "American enterprise Institute, Banking, Bush tax cuts, House Speaker, John Boehner, medicare, mitch mcconnell, Presidency of Barack Obama, Republican Party, trickle down economics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd352a\"", "article_summary": "The president said Republicans should \u201chave the courage to lay out\u201d their ideas for creating job growth, and assailed their ridiculous trickle-down economics platform.\nThe fourth point of the Republican plan was once and for all solving \u201cour spending problem\u201d on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid entitlements.\nIt makes no sense as part of a job creation and wage increase economic plan, but no more than the fifth point in a plan meant to increase the wealth of corporations.\nAmericans are not the smartest people on the planet, but they are aware that Republicans\u2019 failed economic policies do not create jobs and increase wages because they just experienced a Great Recession founded on Republican failed policies.\nFirst, economic growth in the second quarter of 2014 was at its highest level since 2006; two full years before Republicans created the Great Recession."}
