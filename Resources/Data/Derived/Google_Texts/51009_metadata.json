To increase detection of cognitive impairment and promote earlier diagnosis of dementia in the Medicare population, the workgroup endorses that primary care provider\u2019s use the AWV.\n\nThis annual visit between the physician and patient visit is an opportunity to kickstart \u2014 that is, to initiate and continue \u2014 a conversation with beneficiaries and their families about memory-related signs and symptoms that might develop in older adulthood.\n\nStep two is to assess the patient if he or she is symptomatic.\n\nThe workgroup endorses use of a cognitive impairment detection tool from a menu of tools having the following properties:\n\nit can be administered in five minutes or less;\n\nit is widely available free of charge; it is designed to assess age-related cognitive impairment;\n\nit assesses at least memory and one other cognitive domain;\n\nit is validated in primary care or community-based samples in the U.S.;\n\nit is easily administered by medical staff members who are not physicians;\n\nand it is relatively free from educational, language, and/or cultural bias.\n\nStep three is to evaluate with full diagnostic workup if cognitive impairment is detected. The workgroup recommends that all Medicare beneficiaries who exceed threshold scores for cognitive impairment based on the cognitive assessment tools used in step two undergo a full diagnostic evaluation.\n\nNumerous published clinical practice guidelines are available to primary care providers and specialists to help them arrive at a differential diagnosis.\n\nStep four involves referral to community resources and clinical trials, depending on the diagnosis. The workgroup recommends that all Medicare beneficiaries who are determined to have a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or related dementia be referred to all appropriate and available community services to learn more about the disease process and how to prepare for the future with a dementia diagnosis.\n\n\u201cThe workgroup views this suggested four-step process as a framework for communicating with a wide variety of stakeholders about the critical importance of incorporating cognitive impairment detection into everyday clinical practice with older adults,\u201d Fortinsky said.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to building on this report by helping to plan additional activities intended to disseminate and implement the report\u2019s recommendations in communities throughout the country.\u201d\n\nSource: The Gerontological Society/EurekAlert\n\nWoman visiting the doctor photo available from Shutterstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report from The Gerontological Society provides guidance to physicians when they perform annual wellness visits (AWV) on Medicare beneficiaries.
