The El Paso County Sheriff’s Office is warning the public to be aware of a phone scam making the rounds.

The suspect is identifying themselves as an El Paso County Sheriff deputy and informing the victim that they have an active warrant for their arrest that needs to be addressed with a money card sent to the sheriff’s office.

“The sheriff’s office would like to remind citizens we will never call anyone to clear up a warrant,” the release said. “A warrant can only be cleared by turning yourself in at the Criminal Justice Center after showing proper identification.”

Any phone calls of this nature should be reported to the sheriff’s office at 719-390-5555.
