Four people were killed Friday night when a driver apparently lost control of a car and plunged into a creek in the Astoria section of Queens, police officials said.

The passengers, Jada Monique Butts, 19; Crystal Gravely, 19; Jaleel Furtado, 21; and Darius Fletcher, 21, were killed. The driver, identified as a 20-year-old man, survived the wreck, police said. The victims were from the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens, officials said Saturday.

Police said the incident occurred around 10:30 p.m. Friday, when the driver of a 2009 Honda Accord was heading westbound on 19th Avenue near 37th Street. A law-enforcement official said that while the driver was attempting to make a U-turn, the car began to slide, mounted the curb and left the roadway. The vehicle careened down a bank and into a portion of the East River known as the Steinway Creek.

The official said the car overturned into the creek and filled with water.

The driver, whose name was not released, escaped the vehicle and was taken to Elmhurst Hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. The official said he took a blood-alcohol test, and alcohol was not found in his system.

Ms. Butts, Ms. Gravely and one of the men in the crash were taken to Elmhurst General Hospital, where they were pronounced dead, police said. The other victim was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. The driver is listed in stable condition at Elmhurst General Hospital, authorities said.
