Clinton was also provided with a list of House Democrats who voted against a first draft of the legislation and the only House Republican who had voted yes -- then Rep. Anh \"Joseph\" Cao, R-New Orleans.\n\nCao said he was voting to reflect the views and needs of his New Orleans constituents, though he voted against the final version of the bill drafted with Senate Democrats, complaining it didn't do enough to ensure government funding couldn't be used for abortions.\n\nClinton, who left the State Department in 2013 and is seeking the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, had helped draft legislation to expand health insurance access for her husband, President Bill Clinton. But the legislation never got a vote. She also campaigned to improve access to health insurance in the Democratic presidential primary of 2008, when she lost her party's nomination to Barack Obama, who went on to win the presidency and made Clinton his secretary of state.\n\nIn another email, from August 2009, Clinton says that Landrieu had \"asked her to attend a dinner about foster care. Also, she mentioned an event at the White house about adoption and foster care.\"\n\n\"Have you heard anything about this? Can you call Landrieu's office to follow up,\" Clinton writes an aide.\n\nIn August 2011, an email was sent to Clinton about a trip Landrieu was taking to Guatemala about a recent court decision in the Central American nation blocking most international adoptions, leaving parents who had already met with children they were ready to adopt unable to move forward.\n\nLandrieu has long been an advocate for adoption and help for foster children.\n\nAn email to Landrieu's office from Clinton aide Alison Dilworth, said the State Department is committed to helping parents awaiting adoptions in Guatemala, but concerned about alleged scandals with international adoption. She said the State Department is \"particularly concerned about any allegations regarding stolen children and inner-country adoptions.\"\n\nThe only mention of Sen. David Vitter, R-La, found in the released emails, was from longtime confidant Sydney Blumenthal about good sales of a book written by his son, Max Blumenthal, \"Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement That Shattered the Party.\" The book, as an attached book review notes, accuses some conservative Republicans, including Vitter, of bad personal behavior.\n\nIn response, Clinton emails back that Blumenthal should be proud of his son. \"I just finished the book and it's great. Congrats to all!\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bill Clinton, Mary Landrieu, 2016 presidential race, bobby jindal, br-homepage, br-politics, congress, david vitter, hillary clinton, homepage, mary landrieu, news, politics", "title": "Hillary Clinton emails touch on Mary Landrieu, David Vitter and Anh 'Joseph' Cao", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Hillary Clinton emails touch on Mary Landrieu, David Vitter and Anh \\u0027Joseph\\u0027 Cao\", \"link\": \"http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/09/hillary_clinton_emails_that_to.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/hillary-rodham-clinton-005e011e5b7c6279.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17030956\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-09-24T22:01:48Z\", \"author\": \"Bruce Alpert, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune\", \"tags\": [\"2016 presidential race\",\"bobby jindal\",\"br-homepage\",\"br-politics\",\"congress\",\"david vitter\",\"hillary clinton\",\"homepage\",\"mary landrieu\",\"news\",\"politics\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/politics/photo/hillary-rodham-clinton-005e011e5b7c6279.jpg", "creator": "@AlpertDC", "description": "WASHINGTON -- In 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was updated via email on prospects for congressional approval of the Affordable Care Act, with emphasis on three undecided Senate Democrats, including Mary Landrieu of Louisiana.
