The secrets of its life force are the topics at hand-that and some guesswork about how the upsurge in financial leverage , private and public alike, may bear on the value of the dollar and on the course of monetary affairs. Skipping down to the bottom line, we judge that the government\u2019s money is a short sale.\n\nDiminishing returns is the essential problem of the debt: Past a certain level of encumbrance, a marginal dollar of borrowing loses its punch. There\u2019s a moral dimension to the problem as well. There would be less debt if people were more angelic. Non-angels, the taxpayers underpay, the bureaucrats over-remit and everyone averts his gaze from the looming titanic cost of future medical entitlements. Topping it all is 21st-century monetary policy, which fosters the credit formation that leads to the debt dead end. The debt dead end may, in fact, be upon us now. A monetary dead end could follow.\n\nAs to sin, Americans surrender, in full and on time, 83% of what they owe, according to the IRS\u2014or they did between the years 2001 and 2006, the latest period for which America\u2019s most popular federal agency has sifted data. In 2006, the IRS reckons, American filers, both individuals and corporations, paid $450 billion less than they owed. They underreported $376 billion, underpaid $46 billion and kept mum about (\u201cnonfiled\u201d) $28 billion. Recoveries, through late payments or enforcement actions, reduced that gross deficiency to a net \u201ctax gap\u201d of $385 billion.\n\nThis was in 2006, when federal tax receipts footed to $2.31 trillion. Ten years later, the U.S. tax take is expected to reach $3.12 trillion. Proportionally, the 2006 gross tax gap would translate to $607.7 billion, and the net tax gap to $520 billion. To be on the conservative side, let us fix the 2016 net tax gap at $500 billion.\n\nThen there\u2019s squandermania. According to the Government Accountability Office, the federal monolith \u201cmisdirected\u201d $124.7 billion in fiscal 2014, up from $105.8 billion in fiscal 2013. Medicare, Medicaid and earned-income tax credits accounted for 75% of the misspent funds\u2014i.e., of those wasted payments to which government bureaus confessed. \u201c[F]or fiscal year 2014,\u201d the GAO relates, \u201ctwo federal agencies did not report improper payment estimates for four risk-susceptible programs and five programs with improper payment estimates greater than $1 billion were noncompliant with federal requirements for three consecutive years.\u201d It seems fair to conclude that more than $125 will go missing in fiscal 2016.\n\nAdd the misdirected $125 billion to the unpaid $500 billion, and you arrive at a sum of money that far exceeds the projected fiscal 2016 deficit of $534 billion.\n\nWhich brings us to intergenerational self-deception. The fiscal outlook would remain troubled even if the taxpayers paid in full and the bureaucrats stopped wiring income-tax refunds to phishers from Nigeria. Not even a step-up in the current trudging pace of economic growth would put right the long-term fiscal imbalance. So-called non-discretionary spending, chiefly on Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, is the beating heart of the public debt. It puts even the well-advertised problems of Social Security in the shade.\n\nFiscal balance is the 3D approach to public-finance accounting. It compares the net present value of what the government expects to spend versus the net present value of what the government expects to take in. It\u2019s a measure of today\u2019s debt plus the present value of the debt that will pile up if federal policies remain the same. To come up with an estimate of balance or-as is relevant today, imbalance-you make lots of assumptions about life in America over the next 75 years. Critical, especially, is the interest rate at which you discount future streams of outlay and intake. Jeffrey Miron has performed these fascinating calculations over the span from 1965 to 2014.\n\nThe director of economic studies at the Cato Institute and the director of undergraduate studies in the Harvard University economics department, Miron has projected that, over the next 75 years, the government will take in $152.5 trillion and pay out $252.7 trillion \u2014each discounted by an assumed 3.22% average real rate of interest. Add the gross federal debt outstanding in 2014, and\u2014voila!\u2014he has his figure: a fiscal imbalance on the order of $120 trillion. Compare and contrast today\u2019s net debt of $13.9 trillion, GDP of $18.2 trillion, gross debt of $19.2 trillion and household net worth of $86.8 trillion. Compare and contrast, too, the estimated present value of 75 years\u2019 worth of American GDP. Miron ventures that $120 trillion represents something more than 5% of that gargantuan concept.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing so exotic about the idea of fiscal balance. In calculating the familiar-looking projection of debt relative to GDP, the Congressional Budget Office uses assumed rates of growth in spending and revenue, which it also discounts by an assumed rate of interest. It\u2019s fiscal-balance calculus by another name, as Miron notes.\n\nNor is the fiscal-balance idea very new. Laurence J. Kotlikoff , now a chaired professor of economics at Boston University, has been writing about it at least since 1986, when he shocked the then deficit-obsessed American intelligentsia with the contention that the federal deficit is a semantic construct, not an economic one. This is so, said he, because the size of the deficit is a function of the labels which the government arbitrarily attaches to such everyday concepts as receipts and outlays. Thus, the receipts called \u201ctaxes\u201d lower the deficit, whereas receipts called \u201cborrowing\u201d raise it. The dollars are the same; only the classification is different.\n\nJames Grant \u2013 Federal Debt\n\nBe that as it may, Miron observes that the deficit and the debt tell nothing about the fiscal future. Each is backward-looking. \u201cThe debt,\u201d he points out, \u201c. . . takes no account of what current policy implies for future expenditures or revenue. Any surplus reduces the debt, and any deficit increases the debt, regardless of whether that deficit or surplus consists of high expenditure and high revenues or low expenditure and low revenues. Similarly, whether a given ratio of debt to output is problematic depends on an economy\u2019s growth prospects.\u201d\n\nStep back in time to 2007, Miron beckons. In that year before the flood, European ratios of debt to GDP varied widely, even among the soon-to-be crisis-ridden", "article_metadata": {"description": "April 15 comes and goes but the federal debt stays and grows.
