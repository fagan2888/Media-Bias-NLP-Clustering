It involves mentioning his Democratic opponent, Senator Kay Hagan, in the same breath as President Obama, and doing so as often as possible.\n\n\u201cThis president and Senator Hagan failed the people of this country, and in particular North Carolina,\u201d Mr. Tillis said Wednesday at a rally with Mitt Romney, the former presidential candidate.\n\nBut in a year defined more by what voters do not like than what they do, in North Carolina politics, Democrats can be just as motivated as Republicans. So while Republicans bang away at Mr. Obama, Ms. Hagan and her supporters have been equally relentless in raising the specter of Mr. Tillis, the State House speaker, and the conservative agenda the legislature has enacted since he and his fellow Republicans gained control of both chambers in 2010.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe strategy was evident a week before Election Day at a cozy coffee shop in Asheville. Before introducing Ms. Hagan to a crowd of supporters, Anna Stearns, treasurer of the Young Democrats of North Carolina, blamed Mr. Tillis and his colleagues for shortchanging public schools, passing a bill that restricts ballot access, cutting funding to Planned Parenthood and opposing expansion of Medicaid benefits to 500,000 North Carolinians under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMr. Tillis, she said, had led \u201cone of the most destructive legislative sessions in history.\u201d\n\nThe liberal outrage over North Carolina\u2019s lurch to the right has kept the race between Ms. Hagan and Mr. Tillis \u2014 one of the crucial contests that could determine control of the Senate \u2014 close to a dead heat, with Ms. Hagan perhaps clinging to a small lead in polls.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe two campaigns and allied outside groups have dumped nearly $102 million into the race, making it the most expensive in the nation, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Much of that has gone into attack ads that paint Mr. Tillis as the leader of a right-wing fringe, and Ms. Hagan as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the president\u2019s policies.\n\nPhoto\n\nAt the coffee shop, Edna\u2019s of Asheville, the negative feelings toward Mr. Tillis seemed like a natural resource begging to be tapped. Many voters who had shown up for the early-morning rally were nonnative North Carolinians gravely concerned about the Republican Party\u2019s new sway in their adopted state. (Gov. Pat McCrory, who took office last year, is also a Republican.)\n\n\u201cThis is not the state I moved to five years ago,\u201d said Marilynne Herbert, 70, who relocated from the New York City area.\n\nIn two brief stump speeches on Tuesday, Ms. Hagan berated Mr. Tillis. In Asheville, she criticized him for opposing Medicaid expansion during his Republican primary campaign, only to say in recent days that it might be a good idea.\n\n\u201cHe is flip-flopping on that issue right now because he knows it\u2019s the right thing to do, and he knows North Carolina\u2019s going to get there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is using people\u2019s lives as a political football, and that is wrong, wrong, wrong.\u201d\n\nThe next day in Raleigh, a few hundred Republicans gathered at a cavernous sheet metal plant for the rally with Mr. Romney.\n\nSome voters said they were turned off by the tone of the campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s so much negativity that I almost think that what they stand for gets lost,\u201d said Helen Clary, 45.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut speakers also gave full-throated support to the conservative turn at the State Capitol.\n\n\u201cSomebody asked me the other day, \u2018What are y\u2019all going to do if you get control of the Senate?\u2019 \u201d said Richard Hudson, a freshman United States representative from Concord, a Charlotte suburb. \u201cI said, \u2018We\u2019re going to do exactly what the North Carolina legislature did when they got control.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTom Murry, a Republican state representative, argued that his party was responsible for a \u201cCarolina comeback,\u201d saving the state from recession-era malaise with pro-business policies that helped bring the unemployment rate down from 10.5 percent in November 2010 to just under 7 percent today.\n\nMr. Romney said, \u201cA vote for the opponent of Thom Tillis would be a vote for President Obama\u2019s policies.\u201d He added, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see President Obama\u2019s policies furthered any more in this country than they have been.\u201d\n\nMr. Tillis was last to take the mike. He said Ms. Hagan had struggled in recent debates to give examples of the work she was proud of. It was a problem that he promised not to have.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of my record as speaker of the House,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to be proud of my record as U.S. senator.\u201d",
