VictoryLand casino is trying to break the attorney general's winning streak in a series of cases involving gambling machines seized in raids.

A four-day trial ended Friday involving the legality of 1,600 gambling machines the attorney general seized from VictoryLand in Macon County last year. Circuit Judge William Shashy will rule in a few weeks.

The outcome will determine whether VictoryLand owner Milton McGregor can reopen what was once Alabama's largest casino or whether the attorney general can destroy the machines.

Assistant Attorney General Sonny Reagan says they've won court cases allowing the destruction of gambling machines in Houston, Jefferson and Lowndes counties.

McGregor criticized the attorney general's case as week and predicted a good outcome for his side.
