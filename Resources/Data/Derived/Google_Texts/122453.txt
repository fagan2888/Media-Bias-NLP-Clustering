Fashion month is in full swing and you know what that means -- amazing clothes, cool parties and insane Instagram feeds.

And this week, we decided to focus on the latter. Though we are obsessively refreshing our accounts to make sure we don't miss any major runway moments or street style action, it is impossible to take it all in. And we figure that you probably feel the same way.
