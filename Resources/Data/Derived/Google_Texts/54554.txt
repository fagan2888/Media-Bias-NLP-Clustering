Proposed changes to how Medicare reimburses health care providers for prescription drugs would lower reimbursements for drugs that cost more than $480 per day, meaning physicians who treat cancers and other diseases would see greater reductions, an analysis released today from Avalere Health finds.

Specialists who use higher cost drugs, such as ophthalmologists, oncologists, and rheumatologists, would experience reduced payments, while physicians who tend to prescribe lower-cost drugs would be paid more, the report says. Additionally, seven of the 10 drugs that would constitute the largest reductions are used to treat cancers, it finds.

“We have found that $480 is the tipping point for how Part B drug reimbursement would change under this new rule,” Adam Borden, vice president at Avalere, said in a statement. “Physicians who prescribe drugs that cost more would receive lower Medicare payments.”

While a majority of the 10 most-affected drugs treat cancer, Avalere finds ophthalmologists would be most affected by the change, though oncologists and rheumatologists would also receive lower Medicare reimbursements.

In many cases, physicians don’t have the option to prescribe a less expensive alternative, said Fauzea Hussain, senior vice president at Avalere.

“The proposed Part B payment changes would redistribute funding from some specialists who use newer, more expensive drugs to care for their patients,” she said in a statement. “In many cases, there are no lower-cost, clinically meaningful alternatives available for these conditions.”
