Here is the full transcript of his remarks, as provided by Federal News Service (www.fednews.com).\n\nRemarks by President Barack Obama at the Wall Street Journal\u2019s CEO Council Annual Meeting\n\nLocation: Four Seasons Hotel, Washington, D.C\n\nTime: 3:28 p.m. EST, Date: Tuesday, November 19, 2013\n\nANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States. (Applause.)\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you so much. Everybody please have a seat. Thank you.\n\nWell, it is wonderful to be here. And I always look forward to an opportunity to speak to some of our top businesses across the country who are hiring people, investing in America, making the economy run. And many of you, I\u2019ve had a chance to interact with before. As you know, oftentimes when I do something like this, I want to spend more time answering questions and having a conversation than giving any formal remarks.\n\nLet me just provide a little bit of an introduction. Obviously, over the last couple of months, most of the oxygen in this town has been consumed with two things: one, the government shutdown and the possibility of default that was ultimately resolved; and the second has been the rollout of the Affordable Care Act and the fact that my website\u2019s not working the way it\u2019s supposed to.\n\nAnd it\u2019s entirely legitimate that those have been issues of great concern. The impact of the shutdown and the threat of default, I think, not only did some significant damage to the economy at a time when we didn\u2019t need self-inflicted wounds, but it also spoke to some of the larger problems we\u2019ve seen here in Washington and the sense of dysfunction and the seeming incapacity of both parties in Congress to work together to advance an agenda that\u2019s going to help us grow.\n\nWith respect to the Affordable Care Act, I think people are legitimately concerned because we have a major problem with health care in this country, 41 million people without health insurance, a lot of people underinsured.\n\nAnd once again, how we fix a health care system that\u2019s been broken for too many people for too long, I think, ends up speaking to how much confidence we have in government and whether we still have the capacity collectively to bring about changes that are going to be good for our economy, good for our businesses, good for the American people.\n\nI do want to say, though, that, beyond the headlines, we have made real progress in the economy. And sometimes that hasn\u2019t gotten enough attention. Some of the tough decisions that we made early on have paid off, decisions that helped us not only recover from a crisis but begin to lay a stronger foundation for future growth.\n\nWe refocused on manufacturing and exports, and today our businesses sell more goods and services made in America than ever before around the world. After a decade of shedding jobs, our manufacturing sector\u2019s now added about half a million new jobs, and it\u2019s led by an American auto industry that has come roaring back after decades of decline.\n\nWe decided to reverse our dependence on foreign oil, and today we generate more renewable energy than ever before and more natural gas than anybody in the world. And for the first time in nearly 20 years, America now produces more of our own oil than we buy from other countries.\n\nWhen I took office, we invested a fraction of what other countries did in wireless infrastructure, and today it\u2019s up nearly 50 percent, helping companies unleash jobs, innovation and a booming (app ?) economy that\u2019s created more than 500,000 jobs. When I took office, only 5 percent of the world\u2019s smartphones ran on American operating systems; today more than 80 percent do.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just in the high-tech economy that we\u2019re seeing progress. For example, American farmers are on pace to have one of their best years in decades, and they have consistently been able to export more, make more profits and help restore rural economies than when we came into office.\n\nAnd yes, we decided to take on a broken health care system. And even though the rollout of the new health care system. And even though the rollout of the new health care marketplace has been rough, to say the least, about half a million Americans are now poised to gain health care coverage beginning January 1st. That\u2019s after only a month of signup.\n\nWe also have seen health care costs growing at the slowest rate in 50 years. Employer-based health costs are growing at about one- third of the rate of a decade ago, and that has an impact on your bottom line.\n\nAnd after years of trillion-dollar deficits, we reined in spending, wound down two wars and began to change a tax code that I believe was too skewed towards the wealthiest among us at the expense of the middle class. And since office \u2014 since I took office, we have now cut our deficits by more than half.\n\nAdd it all up, and businesses like yours have created 7.8 million new jobs over the past 44 months. We\u2019ve gone farther and recovered faster than most other advanced nations.\n\nAnd so in a lot of ways, America is poised for a breakout. We are in a good position to compete around the world in the 21st century. The question is are we going to realize that potential? And that means that we\u2019ve still got some more work to do.\n\nOur stock markets and corporate profits are soaring, but we\u2019ve got to make sure that this remains a country where everyone who works hard can get ahead. And that means we\u2019ve still got to address long- term unemployment. We still have to address stagnant wages and stagnant incomes.\n\nAnd frankly, we\u2019ve got to stop governing by crisis here in this town, because if it weren\u2019t for Washington\u2019s dysfunction, I think all of us agree, we\u2019d be a lot further along.\n\nThe shutdown and the threat of default harmed our jobs market; they cost our economy about $5 billion dollars and economists predict it will slow our GDP growth this quarter. And it didn\u2019t need to happen. It was self-inflicted. We should not be injuring ourselves every few months; we should be investing in ourselves. And in a sensible world, that starts with a budget that cuts what we don\u2019t need, closes wasteful loopholes and helps us afford to invest in the things that we know will help businesses like yours and the economy as a whole: education, infrastructure, basic research and development.\n\nWe would have a grand bargain for middle-class jobs that combines tax reform with a financing mechanism that lets us create jobs, rebuilding infrastructure that your businesses depend on, but we haven\u2019t gotten as much take-up from the other side as we\u2019d like to see so far.\n\nWe have the opportunity for bipartisan authority to negotiate the best trade deals possible, so businesses and workers can take advantage of new markets that are opening up around the world. We haven\u2019t seen the kind of take-up from the other side that we\u2019d like to see so far.\n\nWe\u2019ve got the opportunity to fix a broken immigration system that strengthens our economy and our national security. The good news here is the Senate has already passed a bipartisan bill that economists say would grow our economy by $1.4 trillion and shrink our deficits by nearly a trillion dollars over the next two decades. You wouldn\u2019t turn down a deal that good and Congress shouldn\u2019t either, so I\u2019m hoping that Speaker Boehner and the House representatives can still work with us to get that done.\n\nAnd we need to be going all out to prepare our kids and our workers for the demands of a 21st-century economy. I\u2019ve proposed giving every child an early start at success by making high-quality preschool available to every four-year-old in America.\n\nWe know that you get more bang for the buck when it comes to early childhood education than just about anything else, and you\u2019ve got great examples around the country, oftentimes in red states that are doing just that, and we need to make that same investment.\n\nWe\u2019re working to bring down the costs of a college degree so more young people can get a higher education, and one thing that I\u2019m very excited about \u2014 and this has been a good example of a public-private partnership is the idea of redesigning our high schools to make sure that more young people get hands-on training and develop the skills that they need, particularly in math, science and engineering that businesses are looking for.\n\nAnd, in fact, today, we\u2019re announcing a competitive grant program that will encourage more high schools to partner with colleges and local businesses to better prepare our kids for college or a career. And in December, I\u2019ll be bringing together college presidents and other leaders to figure out ways to help more low-income students attend and succeed in college.\n\nSo just to sum up, my basic message is this: We know what the challenges are. We know what the solutions are. Some of them are tough, but what\u2019s holding us back is not a lack of good policy ideas or even what used to be considered good bipartisan policy ideas. We just have to break through the stubborn cycle of crisis politics and start working together.\n\nMore obstruction, more brinksmanship won\u2019t help anybody. It doesn\u2019t help folks politically. My understanding is, nobody in this town is doing particularly well at the moment when it comes to the opinions of the American people. But it certainly doesn\u2019t help anybody economically. On many of the issues, I think you and I would agree, and I want you to know that I\u2019m rooting for your success, and I look forward to making sure that we are able, in the remaining three years that I\u2019m president, to work together to not only improve the business climate, but also improve the prospects for Americans all across the country who have been treading water, feel like they\u2019re losing ground, are anxious about the future and their children\u2019s futures, but I think are still hopeful and still possess that fundamental American optimism.\n\nIf they see leadership working across the board on their behalf, then I\u2019m confident that we can make enormous progress.\n\nSo with that, why don\u2019t we get Jerry (sp) up here, and I\u2019ll start answering his questions. I hope he has some input. (Laughter.) If he starts asking me about what happened to the Kansas City Chiefs \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 the \u2014 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll have a good answer for that one. (Applause.)\n\nWSJ WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF GERALD F. SEIB: Well, thank you, Mr. President. Let me start by thanking you officially for joining us today. I think you probably see a lot of familiar faces out there, most friendly, most of them. And I would also note that you\u2019re getting here a little late. Congressman Paul Ryan is coming later. He\u2019s going to get here a little early. So if you guys overlap a little bit, maybe we can just get some problems solved right here. What do you \u2014 (laughter) \u2013\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s do it.\n\nSEIB: It\u2019s your chance. We have talked amongst ourselves. I\u2019ve tried to sort of take the sense of the room, and so I\u2019m going to try to reflect some of the conversations that have been going on here in the questions that I\u2019m going to ask you.\n\nYou\u2019ll not be stunned that I\u2019m going to ask you about health care first. You indicated there and you\u2019ve indicated publicly quite clearly that the rollout has been difficult. What do you think you\u2019ve learned from this experience about the government\u2019s ability to do this sort of thing, about the law itself or about your own administration?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, there are a couple of things. Number one is that this has been a big problem for a very long time, and so it was always going to be challenging not just to pass a law but also to implement it.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why, despite a century of talking about it, nobody had been able to successfully try to deal with some of the underlying problems in the health care system.\n\nThe good news is that many of the elements of the Affordable Care Act are already in place and are working exactly the way they\u2019re supposed to. So making sure that consumers who have, you know, employer-based health insurance are getting a better deal and better protected from some of the fine print that left them in the lurch when they actually got sick; that\u2019s in place. Making sure that young people under the age of 26 can stay on their parents\u2019 plan; that\u2019s helped 3 million children already. That\u2019s making a difference.\n\nHelping seniors to get better prescription drug prices; that\u2019s already helped millions of seniors and billions of dollars in savings. Rebates for people who see insurance companies who are not spending enough on actual care, more on administrative costs or profits, they\u2019re getting rebates. They may not know it\u2019s the Affordable Care Act that\u2019s giving them rebates, but it\u2019s happening.\n\nSo there were a number of things that were already in place over the last three years that got implemented effectively.\n\nThe other thing that hasn\u2019t been talked about a lot is cost. There was a lot of skepticism when we passed the Affordable Care Act that we were going to be giving a lot of people care but we weren\u2019t doing anything about the underlying costs. And in fact, over the last three years we have seen health care costs grow at the slowest pace in 50 years. And that affects the bottom lines of everybody here.\n\nAnd there are a lot of smart delivery system reforms that slowly across the system are being implemented, and they\u2019re making a big difference. And that\u2019s saving us money. That\u2019s why, by the way, some of the projections that \u2014 in terms of what the Affordable Care Act would do to deficits have actually proved even better than we had originally expected.\n\nWhat I have learned though with respect to setting up these marketplaces \u2014 which are essentially mechanisms where people who are currently in the individual market or don\u2019t have health insurance at all can join together, shop and insurance companies will compete for their business \u2014 setting those things up is very challenging just mechanically.\n\nThe good news is that choice and competition has actually worked and insurers came in with bids that were even lower than people expected \u2014 about 16 percent lower than had originally been projected. The challenge has been just making sure that consumers are actually able to get on a website, see those choices and shop. And I think that we probably underestimated the complexities of building out a website that needed to work the way it should.\n\nThere is a larger problem that I probably \u2014 I speak personally but also as the administration \u2014 could have identified earlier. And that is the way the federal government does procurement and does IT is just generally not very efficient. In fact, there\u2019s probably no bigger gap between the private sector and the public sector than IT.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve see that in, for example, the VA and the Department of Defense trying to deal with electronic medical records for our service men as they move into civilian life. Most of that stuff\u2019s still done on paper. we\u2019ve spent billions of dollars \u2014 I\u2019m not saying we as in my administration. I mean we\u2019ve now had about a decade of experimentation, spent billions of dollars and it\u2019s still not working the way it should.\n\nSo what we probably needed to do on the front end was to blow up how we procure for IT, especially on a system this complicated. We did not do that successfully. Now, we are getting it fixed, but it would have been better to do it on the front end, rather than the back end.\n\nAnd the last point I\u2019ll make is that \u2014 you know, in terms of expectation-setting, there\u2019s no doubt that in an environment in which we had to fight tooth and nail to get this passed, it ended up being passed on a \u2014 on a partisan basis \u2014 not for lack of trying, because I met with an awful lot of Republicans trying to get them to go along, but because there was just ideological resistance to the idea of dealing with the uninsured and people with pre-existing systems \u2014 yeah, there was \u2014 there was a price to that. And it was that what was already going to be hard was operating within a very difficult political environment and we should have anticipated that that would create a rockier rollout than if Democrats and Republicans were both invested in success.\n\nOne of the problems we\u2019ve had is one side of Capitol Hill is invested in failure and \u2014 and that makes, I think, the \u2014 the kind of iterative process of fixing glitches as they come up and finetuning the law more challenging.\n\nBut I\u2019m optimistic that we can get it fixed.\n\nSEIB: Well, that\u2019s the question I was going to ask next. Is it possible you\u2019ve lost enough time here and enough potential customers in the exchanges that you\u2019re not going to reach the critical mass of sign-ups that you need to make the marketplace work? Is that a danger that you have to worry about right now?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something that we have to pay attention to. But keep in mind that this model of marketplaces was based on what was done in Massachusetts.\n\nAnd the experience of Massachusetts was that in the first month 153 or (1)63 people signed up out of an ultimate 36,000. I mean, it was \u2014 it was less than 1 percent signed up in that first month, partly because buying insurance is a complicated process for a lot of people. When they have more choices, it means that they\u2019re going to take more time.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019ve lost some time, but the website\u2019s getting better each week. By the end of this month it will be functioning for the majority of people who are using it. They\u2019ll be able to shop, see what their choices are. The prices are good. The prices are not changing during the open enrollment period that goes out until March. And so I think that we\u2019re going to have time to catch up.\n\nWhat\u2019s also been expressed as a concern is the mix of people that sign up. So we might end up, you know, having millions of people sign up, they\u2019re happy with their new coverage, but we\u2019ve got more people who are older, more likely to get sick than younger and healthier. We\u2019ve got to monitor that carefully. We always anticipated, though, that younger folks would be the last folks in just because, you know, it\u2019s been a while since you and I were young \u2013\n\nSEIB: (Laughs.)\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: \u2013 but as I recall, you don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to get sick, you know, at \u2014 at \u2014 at that time.\n\nSo, look, I am confident that the model that we built, which works off of the existing private insurance system, is one that will succeed. We are going to have to, A, fix the website so everybody feels confident about that. We\u2019re going to have to, obviously, re- market and rebrand, and that will be challenging in this political environment. But keep in mind in \u2014 in the first month we also had had 12 million people visit the site.\n\nThe demand is there. There are 41 million people who have \u2014 don\u2019t have health insurance. The folks in the individual market \u2014 many of them are going to get a much better deal in the marketplaces. And so we\u2019ve just got to keep on improving the customer experience and make sure that we\u2019re fending off efforts not to fix the problem, because if somebody wants to help us fix it, I\u2019m all game, but fending off efforts to completely undermine it.\n\nSEIB: Let me turn to the economy, the broader economy, probably the predominant concern of people in this room. We seem to be stuck in an economic growth pattern of OK but not great growth. Your friend Larry Summers was here earlier today and said essentially the problem, or one of the problems, is that the system can\u2019t do two things at once. It can\u2019t cut deficits and spur growth; it needs to do one or the other; right now it needs to spur growth, should not worry so much about deficits. Do you agree? And if you do agree, how do you make that happen?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, actually, Larry and I and most of my economic team, in fact, all my economic team, have consistently maintained that there is a way to reconcile the concerns about debt and deficits with the concerns about growth.\n\nWhat we know is, is that our \u2014 our fiscal problems are not short-term deficits. Our discretionary budget, that portion of the federal budget that isn\u2019t defense or Social Security or Medicare or Medicaid, the entitlement programs, is at its smallest level in my lifetime, probably since Dwight Eisenhower. We are not lavishly spending on a whole bunch of social programs out there. And in many ways, a lot of these programs have become more efficient and pretty effective.\n\nDefense \u2014 we spent a lot from 2001 to 2011, but generally, we are stabilizing, and the Pentagon, working with me, have come up with plans that allow us to meet our security needs while still bringing down some of the costs of defense, particularly after having ended the war in Iraq and on the brink of ending the war in Afghanistan.\n\nSo when we talk about our deficit and debt problems, it is almost entirely health care costs. You eliminate the delta \u2014 the difference between what we spend on health care and what every other country \u2014 advanced, industrialized nation spends on health care, and that\u2019s our long-term debt. And if we\u2019re able to bend the cost curve, we help solve the problem.\n\nNow, one way to do that is just to make health care cheaper overall. That\u2019s, I think, the best way to do it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing through some of the measures in the Affordable Care Act. There are some other provisions that we could take that would maintain our commitment to seniors, Medicare, Social Security, the disabled, Medicaid whilst still reducing very modestly the costs of those programs.\n\nIf we do those things, that solves our real fiscal problem, and we could take some of that money \u2014 a very modest portion on the front end \u2014 and invest in infrastructure that puts people back to work, improve our research and development. So the idea would be, do some things in the short term that focus on growth, do some things in the long term that deal with the long-term debt; that\u2019s what my budget reflects, that\u2019s what a multiple series of negotiations with John Boehner, you know, talked about \u2014 the so-called grand bargain. We couldn\u2019t quite get there in the end, mainly because Republicans had a great deal of difficulty with the idea of putting in more revenue to balance out some of the changes that were made on entitlements.\n\nSEIB: I would guess a lot of people in this room would say that another way to make some of those things happen would be to fix the corporate tax code, that everybody agrees is a mess. You got some companies that pay way too much compared to their international competitors, some companies don\u2019t pay at all. It\u2019s not a good system, it\u2019s not an efficient system, everybody agrees, but it doesn\u2019t ever seem to change.\n\nCan you make it change? And can you do something about repatriation of U.S. assets overseas?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, here\u2019s the good news, is that both my administration and Republicans have talked about corporate tax reform. And Paul Ryan, who\u2019s going to be coming after me, has said he\u2019s interested in corporate tax reform. And we\u2019ve reached out to him and we\u2019ve said, let\u2019s get to work. We put forward a very specific set of proposals that would lower the corporate tax rate, broaden the base, close some loopholes.\n\nAnd in terms of international companies and competitiveness, what we\u2019ve said is, rather than a whole bunch of tangled laws that incentivize folks to keep money overseas, let\u2019s have a modest but clear global minimum tax, get rid of some of the huge fluctuations that people experience, it will save companies money, make them more competitive, and in terms of transitioning to that system, actually allow some people to bring back money and, in a one-time way, help us finance infrastructure and some other projects that need to get done.\n\nI don\u2019t expect Republicans to adopt exactly the proposal that we\u2019ve put forward, but there\u2019s not that much separation between what Democrats are talking about \u2014 I know Chairman Max Baucus put out something today, chairman of the Finance Committee \u2014 what Dave Camp over in the House has talked about.\n\nThis should be bridgeable.\n\nThe one thing I would caution is \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this to the Business Roundtable and other corporate leaders whom I\u2019ve talked to \u2014 people like the idea of corporate tax reform in theory; in practice, if you want to make the corporate tax reform deficit-neutral, then you actually have to close some loopholes. And people like the idea of a simpler tax system until it\u2019s their particular loophole that\u2019s about to get closed.\n\nAnd what we can\u2019t afford to do is to keep all the loopholes that are currently in place and lower the corporate tax rate. We would then blow another hole in the deficit that would have to be filled. And what I\u2019m not willing to do is to have higher rates on the middle class in order to pay for that.\n\nSEIB: Some of the CEOs here had a working group earlier today, the mission of which was to address the question of how do you stay competitive. Interestingly, at least to me, their first priority \u2014 first priority was this: immigration reform. The U.S. needs immigration reform to retain talented workers educated in the U.S. and attract talent to the U.S. Immigration reform could provide an instant jolt to the U.S. economy, which we need. I know you agree with that statement, but it\u2019s hard to see that happening right now. You\u2019ve got the Senate off on one track. It\u2019s passed a comprehensive bill the House won\u2019t even agree to take up. Democrats want to do comprehensive reform; Republicans want to do step-by-step reform. It\u2019s a poisonous political atmosphere. Can you make it happen?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: I am actually optimistic that we\u2019re going to get this done. I\u2019m a \u2014 but I am a congenital optimist. I would have to be; I\u2019m named Barack Obama; I ran for president. So the \u2014 (laughter) \u2013\n\nSEIB: And won.\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: And won twice.\n\n(Laughter.)\n\nSo look, keep in mind, first of all, that what the CEOs here said is absolutely right. This is a boost to our economy. Everywhere I go, I meet with entrepreneurs and CEOs who say, I\u2019ve got, you know, these terrific folks; they\u2019ve just graduated from Caltech or MIT or Stanford; they\u2019re ready to do business here; some of them have these amazing new ideas that we think we can commercialize, but they\u2019re being dragged back to their home countries, not because they want to go but because the immigration system doesn\u2019t work.\n\nThe good news is that the Senate bill was a bipartisan bill. And we know what the component parts of this are. We\u2019ve got to have strong border security. We\u2019ve got to have better enforcement of existing laws. We\u2019ve got to make sure that we have a legal immigration system that doesn\u2019t cause people to sit in the queue for five years, 10 years, 15 years, in some cases 20 years. We should want to immediately say to young people who we\u2019ve helped to educate in this country, you want to stay? We want you here.\n\nAnd we do have to deal with about 11 million folks who are in this country, most of them just seeking opportunity. They did break the law by coming here or overstaying their visa. And they\u2019ve got to earn their way out of the shadows, pay a fine, learn English, get to the back of the line, pay their back taxes, but giving them a mechanisms whereby they can get right by our society. And that\u2019s reflected in the Senate bill.\n\nNow, I actually think that there are a number of House Republicans, including Paul Ryan, I think, if you ask him about it, who agree with that.\n\nThey\u2019re suspicious of comprehensive bills, but you know what? If they want to chop that thing up into five pieces, as long as all five pieces get done, I don\u2019t care what it looks like, as long as it\u2019s actually delivering on those core values that we talk about.\n\nSEIB: Democrats have been pretty suspicious that all five pieces, once it\u2019s done \u2013\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s the problem. I mean, the key is \u2014 you know, what we don\u2019t want to do is simply carve out one piece of it \u2014 let\u2019s say, agricultural jobs, which are important, but is easier, frankly, or the high-skilled jobs that many in your audience here would immediately want to do \u2014 but leave behind some of the tougher stuff that still needs to get done. We \u2014 we\u2019re not going to have a situation in which 11 million people are still living in the shadows and potentially getting deported on an ongoing basis.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to have to do it all. In my conversations with Republicans, I actually think the divide is not that wide. So what we just have to do is find a pathway where Republicans in the House in particular feel comfortable enough about process that they can go ahead and meet us.\n\nThis, by the way, Gerry (sp), I think is a good example of something that\u2019s been striking me about our politics for a while. When you go to other countries, the political divisions are so much more stark and wider; here in America, the difference between Democrats and Republicans \u2014 we\u2019re fighting inside the 40-yard line, maybe \u2013\n\nSEIB: You fooled most people on that in the last few months, I\u2019d say.\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: No, but \u2014 but \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 well, no, no, the \u2014 I \u2014 I would \u2014 I would distinguish between the \u2014 the rhetoric and the tactics, versus the ideological differences.\n\nI mean, in most countries, you\u2019ve got \u2014 you know, people call me a socialist sometimes, but, no, you\u2019ve got to me real socialists. You\u2019ll have a sense of what a \u2014 what a socialist is. (Laughter.) You know, the \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m talking about lowering the corporate tax rate. My health care reform is based on the private marketplace. Stock market\u2019s looking pretty good last time I checked, and, you know, it is true that I\u2019m concerned about growing inequality in our system, but nobody questions the efficacy of market economies in terms of producing wealth and innovation and keeping us competitive.\n\nOn the flip side, you know, most Republicans \u2014 even the Tea Party \u2014 one of my favorite signs during the campaign was folks hoisting a sign \u2014 governments, keep your hands off my Medicare. Think about that. (Laughter.) I mean, the \u2014 you know, ideologically, they did not like the idea of the federal government, and yet they felt very protective about the basic social safety net that had been structured.\n\nSo my simple point is this. If we can get beyond the tactical advantages that parties perceive in painting folks as extreme and trying to keep an eye always on the next election, and for awhile at least, just focus on governing, then there is probably 70 percent overlap on a whole range of issues. A lot of Republicans want to get infrastructure done just like I do.\n\nA lot of them believe in basic research, just like I do. A lot of them want to reform entitlements to make sure that they\u2019re affordable for the next generation; so do I. A lot of them say they want to reform our tax system; so do I. There are going to be differences on the details. And those details matter and I\u2019ll fight very hard for them, but we shouldn\u2019t think that somehow the reason we\u2019ve got these problems is because our policy differences are so great.\n\nSEIB: Well, the details are obviously important enough to shut down the government just a couple weeks ago. And everybody knows we\u2019re headed back toward showdowns again: January, budget; February, debt ceiling. Jack Lew was here earlier, your Treasury secretary, and said he thought maybe the system crossed the threshold in October and has realized it doesn\u2019t want to go back and do that again.\n\nAre you confident it\u2019s not going to go back and do that again? And by the way, the OECD, the organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, suggested today that the U.S. just get rid of the debt ceiling entirely. Would you be in favor of that?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: I think that the way our system is set up is like a loaded gun. And once people thought we can get leverage on policy disputes by threatening default, that was an extraordinarily dangerous precedent. And that\u2019s a principle that I had to adhere to, not just for me but for the next president, that you\u2019re not going to be able to threaten the entire U.S. or world economy simply because you disagree with me about a health care bill.\n\nI\u2019d like to believe that the Republicans recognize that was not a good strategy, and we\u2019re probably better off with a system in which that threat is not there on a perpetual basis. I do not foresee what we saw in October being repeated in January.\n\nBut, you know, the broader point is one that I think all of us have to take to heart.\n\nWe have to be able to disagree on policy issues without resorting to the kinds of extreme tactics that end up hurting all of us. And that\u2019s been my main disagreement with a lot of my Republican friends.\n\nAnd frankly, the American people agree with that. They don\u2019t expect us to march in lockstep. There\u2019s a reason why we\u2019ve got two parties in this country. They do expect that we are constantly thinking about how are we making sure they can find a job that pays well, that their kids can go to college and afford it, that we are growing and competitive, that, you know, we are dealing with our fiscal position in a sensible way. And \u2014 and if we keep them in mind consistently, then I think we\u2019re going to be successful.\n\nYou know, one thing that \u2014 you\u2019ve got some international CEOs here, and I think they\u2019ll confirm this. When I travel, what\u2019s striking to me is people around the world think we\u2019ve got a really good hand. You just take the example of energy. They say America is poised to change our geopolitics entirely because of the advances we\u2019ve made in oil production, natural gas production. It means manufacturing here is much more attractive than it used to be. That\u2019s a huge competitive advantage.\n\nWe\u2019ve got the most productive workers, just about, in the world. And we \u2014 our workers have become more and more productive, and a lot of companies look at that and say, we wish we had workers who were able to operate the way these folks do.\n\nOur university systems, our research, you know, infrastructure \u2014 all those things are the envy of the world.\n\nAnd one of the great things about America is \u2014 sometimes, we get worried that we\u2019re losing traction and the sky is falling. And back in the \u201980s, Japan was about to take over and then China and obviously, before that, the Soviet Union, and we usually come out OK because we change and we adapt. I just want everybody to remember that we\u2019re in a very strong position to compete, as long as our political system functions. It doesn\u2019t have to be outstanding \u2014 this is sort of like Winston Churchill, two cheers for democracy \u2014 and you know, it \u2014 it \u2014 it\u2019s always going to be messy, but it\u2019s got to function better than it has.\n\nSEIB: I\u2019m in the red zone here on the clock here, but let me \u2014 I do want to ask about \u2014 a question about international affairs. You\u2019ve mentioned the world and the U.S. position in it. There\u2019s the possibility this week of an agreement with Iran, a preliminary linear agreement, in which they would free some of their nuclear activities in return for some relief on sanctions.\n\nYour Israeli friends have been arguing, along with some of your \u2014 some of your friends, as well as your foes, in Congress, that if you give the Iranian regime any relief on sanctions, the sanctions regime will fall apart, countries that don\u2019t want to be there in the first place will head for the exits; it will all come apart. And that\u2019s the danger of what you\u2019re negotiating right now. I know you talked to some senators about this very topic today. Is there going to be a deal? And why can you ease sanctions without having them fall apart?\n\nPRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, just by way of background, when I came into office, we had a trade embargo, the U.S. had done some things unilaterally, we did not have a strong, enforceable international mechanism to really put the squeeze on Iran around its nuclear program, despite the fact that it violated a range of U.N. and nonproliferation treaty requirements.\n\nSo we built, we constructed with the help of Congress, the strongest sanctions regime ever.\n\nAnd it has put a bite on the Iranian economy. They have seen a 5 percent contraction last year in their economy; it\u2019s projected to be another contraction this year, and in part, because the sanctions have been so effective, we were able to get Iran to seriously come to the table and look at, how are they going to give assurance to the international community that they are, in fact, not pursuing a nuclear weapons program.\n\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to close a deal this week or next week. We had been very firm with the Iranians even on the interim deal about what we expect. And, you know, some of the reporting out there has been somewhat inaccurate, understandably, because the P-5 plus one \u2014 the members of the \u2014 permanent members of the Security Council in addition to \u2014 and Germany as well \u2014 have kept the negotiations fairly tight.\n\nBut the essence of the deal would be that they would halt advances on their nuclear program. They would roll back some elements that get them closer to what we call breakout capacity, where they can run for a weapon before the international community has a chance to react, that they would subject themselves to more vigorous inspections even than the ones that are currently there \u2014 in some cases, daily inspections.\n\nIn return, what we would do would be to open up the spigot a little bit for a very modest amount of relief that is entirely subject to reinstatement if, in fact, they violated any part of this early agreement. And it would purchase a period of time \u2014 let\u2019s say six months, during which we could see if they could get to the end state of a position where we, the Israelis, the international community could say with confidence, Iran\u2019s not pursuing a nuclear weapon.\n\nNow, part of the reason I have confidence that the sanctions don\u2019t fall apart is because we\u2019re not doing anything around the most powerful sanctions. The oil sanctions, the banking sanctions, the financial services sanctions, those are the ones that have really taken a big chunk out of the Iranian economy. So oil production and oil sales out of Iran have dropped by more than half since these sanctions were put in place. They\u2019ve got over a hundred billion dollars of oil revenue that is sitting outside of their country. The rial, their currency, has dropped precipitously.\n\nAnd all those sanctions and the architecture for them don\u2019t go anywhere. Essentially what we do is we allow them to access a small portion of these assets that are frozen. Keep in mind, though, that because the oil and banking sanctions stay in place, they will actually still be losing money even during this six-month period relative to the amount of oil sales they had back in 2011.\n\nSo what we are \u2014 what we are suggesting, both to the Israelis, to members of Congress here, to the international community, but also to the Iranians, is let\u2019s look, let\u2019s test the proposition that over the next six months we can resolve this in a diplomatic fashion while maintaining the essential sanctions architecture, and as president of the United States, me maintaining all options to prevent them from getting nuclear weapons.\n\nI think that is a \u2014 a test that is worth conducting. And my hope and expectation is not that we\u2019re going to solve all of this just this week in this interim phase, but rather that we\u2019re purchasing ourselves some time to see how serious the Iranian regime might be in re- entering membership in \u2014 in the world community and taking the \u2014 the yoke of these sanctions off \u2014 off the backs of their economy.\n\nSEIB: (Off mic.)
