Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, along with others, is reportedly wooing prospects for a third-party conservative candidate to keep presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump from entering the White House in 2016. Pat Buchanan, who ran as a third-party candidate in the 2000 presidential election, told the FOX Business Network’s Neil Cavuto a third-party candidate on the ballot would hand the election to Hillary Clinton.

“I don’t understand why he [Mitt Romney] in an enterprise, the certain result of which would be to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton the President of The United States and give her three maybe four appointments to the Supreme Court and make ObamaCare forever,” said Buchanan.

Among those who were reportedly recruited but turned down the offer are former Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban.

“One of two people is going to be the next President of the United States – It’s Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump and a third-party conservative would guarantee it’s Hillary Clinton.”

He also said it would be difficult for a third-party candidate to win enough states to send the election to the House of Representatives.

“Ross Perot got 19% of the vote in 1992; He didn’t carry a single state, not a single electoral vote” he said.
