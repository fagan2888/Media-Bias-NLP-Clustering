Joseph N. DiStefano writes about Philadelphia-area enterprise, and the people and money that make it go.

Noble.MD, a four-year-old Philadelphia firm whose Theo healthcare iPad app (corected) is developing "digital health intervention" tools, including digitial applications, to better track patients through the Obamacare reimbursement process at "several hospital systems," says it has raised $1.45 million in expansion capital from Safeguard Scientifics of Wayne, BioAdvance of Radnor, and individual "angel" investors.

In a statement, founder Todd Johnson said the money will help "launch two new products: one which facilitates the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit, and another which enhances hip and knee surgeries for providers operating under the Complete Joint Replacement payment bundle."

He called Theo "a consumer-friendly product" that used "patient-reported population health databases," run through Affordable Care Act-mandated data profiles, to help identify likely expenses and boost "revenue for doctors."

"Noble.MD has a team who understands healthcare, from integrating invisibly into workflow, to increasing revenue, to impact on patient health outcomes. These guys get it," said Shahram Hejazi, Venture Partner at BioAdvance, in a statement.
