The body of a hiker in Yellowstone National Park reported missing on Friday morning was found later that day partially consumed and covered, and preliminary results of an investigation point to a grizzly bear attack.

The victim’s name has been withheld pending notification of family, but he was described by the National Park Service as a Montana man who had lived and worked in Yellowstone for five seasons as an employee of Medcor, which runs three urgent care clinics in the park.

He was reported missing when he failed to show up for work Friday morning.

The exact cause of death remains undetermined, but investigators noted apparent defensive wounds on the man’s forearms. A park ranger found the body of the experienced hiker in an off-trail area he was known to frequent, about a half-mile from the Elephant Back Loop Trail near Lake Village on Friday afternoon.

Partial tracks at the scene led investigators to believe an adult female grizzly and at least one cub were involved in the attack. Heavy rains in the area on Friday evening hindered further recovery of bear DNA evidence by rangers and wildlife biologists.

The area including the Elephant Back Loop Trail has been closed until further notice.

Wildlife biologists have set traps in the area and, if they capture and identify a bear involved in the attack, the animal will be euthanized.

“We may not be able to conclusively determine the circumstances of this bear attack, but we will not risk public safety,” said Yellowstone National Park Superintendent Dan Wenk in a prepared statement. “We are deeply saddened by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the family and friends of the victim as they work to cope with the loss of someone who loved Yellowstone so very much.”
