The intention was to create clear, high expectations for the knowledge students must learn to ensure they are college or career ready.\n\nBut a growing number are questioning whether the new standards will achieve that goal.\n\nIt\u2019s a debate unfolding across the country, and a new chapter could be written in South Carolina when lawmakers return to Columbia in January. Here is a primer:\n\nWhat are the Common Core State Standards?\n\nThe Common Core State Standards are a new set of standards that define what students must learn in grades K-12 in English language arts and math.\n\nFor example, one of the first-grade English language arts standards calls for students to be able to identify words and phrases in stories or poems that suggest feelings or appeal to the senses.\n\nSchools still have the ability to decide the method and curriculum they would use to teach that standard.\n\nWhy are they controversial?\n\nThe standards have been criticized for both what they represent as well as what they contain.\n\nFrom a philosophical standpoint, many Republicans are concerned that the standards will infringe on states\u2019 rights. U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., has said, \u201cWe need to move past the notion that the federal government knows best when it comes to the unique needs of our students and communities.\u201d\n\nOthers are opposed to the content of the standards for a range of reasons. Some have argued that the new standards aren\u2019t rigorous or developmentally appropriate, and that they try to instill federally determined attitudes and mindsets about political and religious beliefs.\n\nSome have said that the new standards put too much emphasis on informational text and neglect classic literature. Still others have said they eliminate the study of cursive writing, thus failing to give students the skills needed to read, among other things, historical documents such as the U.S. Constitution.\n\nWhy is the controversy happening now?\n\nEducators aside, most people don\u2019t understand what \u201cstandards\u201d are, so that\u2019s likely one of the reasons some opponents didn\u2019t take notice when Common Core emerged in 2010. Since then, a growing number of conservatives have been speaking out against them.\n\nFrom a political perspective, Republicans have been lashing out at the Democratic administration for its implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Common Core has been another rallying point for them. While Republicans have been louder and more vocal in their opposition, some Democrats also are fighting the national standards but for different reasons. Some, for example, don\u2019t think the new standards-aligned tests will assess student achievement better than states\u2019 pervious tests\n\nMost teachers have been supportive of the new standards. The National Education Association, which has 3 million members, and the American Federation of Teachers, which has about 1.5 million members, have both endorsed Common Core.\n\nWhat role did the federal government have in the development of Common Core?\n\nPresident Barack Obama and U.S. Secretary Arne Duncan have endorsed and encouraged states to adopt the standards by using grants and waivers, but the U.S. Department of Education played no role in developing the standards. Those grants and waivers were why some states adopted Common Core, and some feel as if states were coerced into doing so.\n\nWho came up with Common Core?\n\nThey were developed by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers in partnership with teachers, school administrators, parents and experts from across the country. The standards were benchmarked against those in the world\u2019s top performing countries. The goal was to ensure students are better prepared for two- or four-year college programs or for the workforce.\n\nWhich states adopted Common Core?\n\nStates independently decided whether to adopt the Common Core State Standards. A total of 46 states and the District of Columbia are putting these standards into practice \u2014 every state but Texas, Virginia, Alaska and Nebraska. Minnesota only adopted the reading standards. Although some states, including South Carolina, have proposed legislation to prevent Common Core from taking effect in their schools, no state has dropped implementation yet.\n\nWhy did South Carolina adopt Common Core?\n\nThe state Education Oversight Committee and the state Board of Education signed off on the state\u2019s adoption of the standards. Some wanted the state to use the standards because they said it would enable South Carolina to compare its students\u2019 results with other states, which has been virtually impossible. It also gave the state a better shot at securing some federal money.\n\nWhere does South Carolina\u2019s debate stand?\n\nState Sen. Larry Grooms, R-Bonneau, has introduced a bill to block Common Core\u2019s implementation here, but that legislation has not moved so far. Grooms has said its chances seem to be improving.\n\nState Superintendent of Education Mick Zais, a Republican, has said he doesn\u2019t support the standards, which were approved here before he took office in 2011.\n\nThis month, Zais wrote a letter criticizing the standards for forcing all S.C. students on a path toward a four-year college, \u201cwhen we know that 70 percent of our high school students will not attend a four-year college. I believe we ought to be preparing our students for life, not for some elusive goal chosen by other people.\u201d\n\nWhen is Common Core going to be used in South Carolina classrooms?\n\nBarring any successful legislative effort, the standards will be fully implemented and tested during the 2014-15 school year. This school year is a bridge year, meaning school districts statewide are using the standards in classroom lessons.\n\nHow will the standards change what South Carolina students learn?\n\nThe state compared the content in the new standards with its current standards and found them very similar \u2014 a 97 percent match. While the content is similar, a major difference is Common Core\u2019s emphasis on rigor and applying knowledge learned. Supporters say the Common Core will require students to think and reason more deeply, but opponents disagree.\n\nWill the standards change how students are tested?\n\nYes. The state Board of Education agreed to adopt new tests for the 2014-15 school year that are being developed by the SMARTER Balanced Assessment Consortium, a collection of educators, researchers, policymakers and community groups from states nationwide. The new reading and math exams will replace what students know now as the Palmetto Assessment of State Standards, and the new tests could serve as replacements for exit exams and end-of-course tests, if the General Assembly approves that change.\n\nWhat kind of results can the state expect to see as a result of Common Core?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say. Students\u2019 scores in New York and Kentucky have dropped on tests aligned to the Common Core standards. Supporters say those are a more accurate assessment of the degree to which students are being prepared, but opponents say that\u2019s just another reason why there shouldn\u2019t be national standards.\n\nSource: The Post and Courier, S.C.
