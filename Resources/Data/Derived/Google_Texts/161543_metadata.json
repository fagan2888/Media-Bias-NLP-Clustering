Health care inflation , greater cost-sharing, and means testing for wealthier Medicare beneficiaries going forward have conspired to put retiree health care costs on a path to exceed Social Security benefits for many Americans.\n\nData cited from Credit Suisse says health care comprised 33 percent of all household expenditure for people over 60, while data from Merrill Lynch shows that the majority of affluent Americans, who tend to be well-versed investors, claim health care as their top financial concern in retirement.\n\nStill, there is room for greater awareness. Baby boomers are often surprised to learn that Medicare only covers approximately 51 percent of total health care expenses, according to the paper. But it\u2019s the rise in Medicare premiums that yields the most startling responses.\n\n\n\nThe paper takes a hypothetical couple, aged 55 and living in Massachusetts, that expects to retire in 10 years at age 65. Assuming they buy into Medicare Parts B, D, and Medigap coverage, the couple will see premiums double to $22,981 a year in 2034, when they are 75, and to a remarkable $46,568 in 2044, when they are 85.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nick Thornton", "description": "Even well-prepared boomers may still be shocked by how much their health care will cost in their later years.", "og": {"url": "http://www.benefitspro.com/2014/06/10/advisors-urged-to-help-clients-brace-for-staggerin", "image": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/06/10/medicaid-pills_png_800x1000_q100.png", "type": "website", "description": "Even well-prepared boomers may still be shocked by how much their health care will cost in their later years.", "title": "Advisors urged to help clients brace for staggering health costs"}, "twitter": {"description": "Even well-prepared boomers may still be shocked by how much their health care will cost in their later years.", "title": "Advisors urged to help clients brace for staggering health costs", "image": {"src": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/06/10/medicaid-pillspng800x1000q100-crop-120x120.png"}, "creator": "@Benefits_Pro", "site": "@Benefits_Pro", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-10", "sailthru.tags": "benefitspro, article, 53977b5f160ba03d7189ec2f, News, Strategies,Investment Instruments,Trends", "keywords": "Strategies, Trends, Investment Instruments, healthcare costs, Merrill Lynch, Heritage Foundation, Credit Suisse, Ron Mastrogiovanni, HealthView Services", "sniply-options": "block", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/06/10/medicaid-pills_png_800x1000_q100.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health care inflation , greater cost-sharing, and means testing for wealthier Medicare beneficiaries going forward have conspired to put retiree health care costs on a path to exceed Social Security benefits for many Americans.\nData cited from Credit Suisse says health care comprised 33 percent of all household expenditure for people over 60, while data from Merrill Lynch shows that the majority of affluent Americans, who tend to be well-versed investors, claim health care as their top financial concern in retirement.\nWell-prepared baby boomers, cognizant of projected rising costs of health care in retirement, may still be shocked by how much their wellness will cost in their later years.\nBaby boomers are often surprised to learn that Medicare only covers approximately 51 percent of total health care expenses, according to the paper.\nBut it\u2019s the rise in Medicare premiums that yields the most startling responses."}
