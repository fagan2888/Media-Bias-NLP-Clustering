He tells Morning eHealth that data flow in Missouri is still siloed and the new regulator would expedite the exchange of patient records. He points to Kansas as a good example of a state doing things right and says linking the two states, which share Kansas City, has been extremely difficult.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 But it\u2019s not so simple, says Angie Bass, chief operating officer of the Missouri Health Connection. The precise powers of the new state-wide commission aren\u2019t yet clear and that\u2019s scary Bass said. In addition, it could interfere with federal standards. \u201cWe feel like there isn\u2019t a problem to be solved and this is an overreach of government,\u201d Bass told us.\n\nAnother wrinkle \u2014 The Missouri Health Connection\u2019s members believe the legislation is backed by EHR vendor giant Cerner. Cerner, whose role in the legislation is unclear, says its clients believe the proposed legislation is intended to address existing barriers to health information exchange at the local level. Cerner competitor Epic, which is used by seven major Missouri hospitals, has asked state lawmakers to \u201cavoid unnecessary government regulation that will slow this progress and ultimately harm Missouri patients and providers.\u201d The bill hasn\u2019t cleared committees in either the House or the Senate, and sponsors didn\u2019t return requests for comment.

As we\u2019ve told you before, the so-called I-STOP mandate intends to cut down on prescription drug abuse. But are doctors ready to comply? New data from Surescripts shows the number of Empire State doctors enabled to e-prescribe controlled substances has increased 28 percent since March 1. Now, just under half of the nearly 100,000 active prescribers in the state are set up, up from a third a month ago. Fewer than two percent could e-prescribe controlled substances a year ago, Surescripts says. More from Surescripts: http://bit.ly/1RqFDUZ\n\nRelated: The president of the Medical Society of the State of New York asks that low-prescribing doctors be exempt from the law. http://bit.ly/1RySztY\n\neHealth tweet of the day: @kevinmd: Meaningful use creates meaningless strife http://buff.ly/1T6JICd\n\nWelcome to Monday morning eHealth where it\u2019s hard to believe but opening day of Major League Baseball is only a week away.

But, he warns, it\u2019s very early in the process. Lieu is also interested in a bill that requires hospitals to notify patients when they\u2019ve been a victim of ransomware attacks, a recent area of activity for hospitals. Remember, House Oversight IT subcommittee chair Will Hurd told me last week that lawmakers were still considering where to turn to next after its fact-finding work of late. Also, the 21st Century Cures Act (H.R. 6) has provisions to tackle data blocking as does the Senate\u2019s Improving Health IT Act (S. 2511), so it\u2019s unclear what more Lieu could do.

The American Hospital Association gave its thoughts. Some highlights: CMS should require qualified entities to publicly list the Medicare claims data they receive and the data they intend to combine with it; CMS should also release Medicaid and CHIP data, not just Medicare; Make private health plans provide data; CMS also underestimates the impact the rule will have on providers\u2019\u2019 time.

The regulations should more clearly allow clinicians to use their medical judgement to decide whether to treat a patient via telemedicine in their first encounter. \u201cWhen a physician uses telemedicine they are simply augmenting the sound clinical training and education that they have received to perform a clinical encounter,\u201d the ATA wrote. The telemedicine group also urges the DC government to address telemedicine rules for pharmacists. In some states, they haven\u2019t filled prescriptions given after encounters through the technology.

The bill sailed through the Senate Commerce Committee in November on a voice vote, and following a favorable score from the Congressional Budget Office last week (saving $18 million over a decade) could do the same in the full Senate after lawmakers return from recess next week. Rep. Leonard Lance has a companion bill (H.R. 4111) in the House.\n\nHOW ABOUT SOME PRECISION MEDICINE SECURITY?: The White House\u2019s draft data security policies for the Precision Medicine Initiative may be problematic for smaller organizations because it won\u2019t scale for them, ACT | The App Association wrote Friday. For example, smaller firms may have trouble gaining third-party review of their security plans as the draft policy framework suggests. Furthermore, the White House doesn\u2019t incorporate NIST\u2019s cybersecurity framework into its plans. Their comments, which were due Friday, are here: http://bit.ly/1SpwqP1\n\nTEXAS STILL TWO-STEPPING ON TELEHEALTH: Telemedicine isn\u2019t dead in Texas despite the popular sentiment that it is, the head of government affairs at direct-to-consumer firm American Well writes in The Health Care Blog. The Texas Medical Board, facing the never-ending legal game with Teladoc, is inching toward a resolution on the technology, Kofi Jones explains. \u201cThe board itself has evolved as well\u2026They now allow behavioral health providers to establish a treatment relationship through telehealth regardless of the patient location. The board, in partnership with its telemedicine stakeholder group is creating a new call-coverage model to allow telemedicine providers to leverage after-hour and specialty care that was sorely lacking. In 2016, they will meet again and ask, \u2018What is the next step in telehealth expansion?\u2019\u201d her full column: http://bit.ly/1XT8vZE\n\nICYMI \u2014 OHIO SUPREME COURT TAKES BROAD VIEW OF RECORD: No matter where a patient\u2019s medical history data are stored, if a hospital maintains it, it\u2019s a medical record, the Ohio Supreme Court decided last week. The court made its decision due to a 2012 medical-records request case asking for a dead patient\u2019s entire record. The plaintiff believed the hospital had been less than forthcoming in failing to disclose its nursing records and monitoring strip data, and the court agreed. In what must seem like a cruel irony for the digitally enthusiastic, the case hinged on the literal physical location of the record \u2013the hospital\u2019s records department \u2013 rather than, say, the modern software we\u2019re hoping all hospitals use these days. On the other hand, data liberationists are, we\u2019re sure, quite pleased.\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE CLICKING:\n\nNew York Times editorial board calls for federal protections from employers use of health data in hiring: http://nyti.ms/1UQSPrK\n\nThe journal Nature shows the promise of mobile health apps: http://bit.ly/1REo2rD\n\nGoogle trademarks two health-related images: http://bit.ly/1WOK7Io\n\nShould health care work like Priceline?: http://bit.ly/1ZBnklh\n\nArizona eyes a bill to force doctors to check a prescription drug monitoring program before prescribing opioids: http://bit.ly/1SbLm0B\n\nTips, comments, suggestions?
