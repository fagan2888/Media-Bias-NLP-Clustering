The exchange plans cover individuals who aren\u2019t covered by employer-based policies.\n\nFlorida Blue offers many plans. The 40 percent of its individual policyholders who chose \u201cnarrow network\u201d plans called BlueSelect that limit coverage to fewer doctors and hospitals will see rates rise by an average of 13 percent.\n\nCritics of the health law have predicted big rate hikes in the second year of the online marketplaces. Florida Blue CEO Patrick Geraghty noted that premiums in the individual market have been going up for years. \u201cIn the individual market, this type of average rate increase is typical,\u201d he told Kaiser Health News. \u201cIt\u2019s is not aberrant.\u201d\n\nNext year will mark the fourth consecutive year Florida Blue has increased premiums by at least 11 percent on average for people under 65 who buy coverage on their own. Florida Blue increased rates an average of 16.5 percent in 2014, 16 percent in 2013 and 11.5 percent in 2012, the company said.\n\nFlorida Blue signed up 339,000 customers through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal marketplace this year\u2014 about 34 percent of the nearly 1 million who enrolled in the state, the company said. Florida does not operate its own exchange.\n\nNationally, 2015 rates that have been made public have varied sharply, with some insurers increasing rates, some reducing them and others keeping them stable.\n\nAvalere, a consulting firm, found in June that average premiums for a 40-year-old, non-smoker would increase by about 8 percent next year, based on an analysis of \u201csilver\u201d plan rates in nine states. Changes ranged from a 1.4 percent average decrease in Oregon to a 16 percent average increase in Indiana.\n\nCalifornia officials said Thursday that more than 1.2 million consumers in the state-run insurance exchange can expect modest price increases of 4.2 percent on average next year. The Covered California marketplace is an \u201cactive purchaser\u201d under the health law, which means it negotiated the rates with Anthem Blue Cross, Kaiser Permanente and other major insurers. The rates are also subject to review by California regulators.\n\nAbout a dozen carriers will be competing in the individual health insurance market next year in Florida. Two have disclosed their rates. Humana is increasing prices an average of 14.1 percent for its HMO, while its preferred provider organizations (PPO) plan will increase 2.2 percent on average. Molina has set an 11.6 percent average rate decrease for all its plans.\n\nSeveral factors related to the health law are driving up rates for next year, Geraghty said, including a paucity of younger and healthy enrollees and a greater-than-expected surge of people seeking expensive health services. The law prohibits insurers from rejecting people with health problems or charging them higher premiums. That meant that many unhealthy people who had not been able to get coverage before were able to obtain policies in 2014.\n\nInsurers\u2019 premiums vary by a consumer\u2019s age, the plan they selected and where they live. The monthly premium is only one part of costs, which also include co-pays and deductibles.\n\nFlorida Blue monthly premiums this year for a 40-year-old living in Palm Beach County and buying a silver plan range from $303 to $404, according to data on healthcare.gov. That\u2019s before subsidies, which bring down the cost for low and middle-income buyers, are included.\n\nGeraghty said he\u2019s unsure if the latest round of price increases will lead people to drop coverage. \u201cIt depends on how much value they place in what they are receiving,\u201d he said.\n\nNearly 90 percent of Floridians who bought coverage on the exchange get a federal subsidy to lower their share of the premium.\n\n\u201cNo one can claim in good conscience that a 10 percent rate increase or more would signal the advent of something new and unprecedented,\u201d said Greg Mellowe, policy director of consumer group Florida CHAIN. \u201cFor years, this was standard practice in Florida.\u201d\n\nThe Republican-dominated Florida legislature last year suspended the state\u2019s power to review health insurers\u2019 rates to make sure they were actuarially sound. It left that job to federal officials who run the online insurance exchange that Florida uses. The federal government, though, has no authority to force insurers to lower insurance rates.\n\nOpen enrollment to buy 2015 plans runs from Nov. 15 through Feb. 15.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
