ISIL is out there now, active in a lot of different areas, and so while this investigation is pending -- and cause we have this group claiming responsibility -- we believe it's significant to do these things on an interim basis and to tell the public that we've done this,\" Johnson told Starr.\n\n\"We want the public to know that our aviation security officials are very much focused on this,\" he added. \"We're continually evaluating whether more or less is necessary.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the head of Egypt's investigation said a noise was heard in the final second of the cockpit voice recording on Metrojet Flight 9268 as it ascended on autopilot before apparently breaking up about 23 minutes after takeoff. All 224 people aboard were killed.\n\nWhile U.S. and UK officials have said there may have been a bomb aboard the jet, the chief of the investigation said authorities have not reached any conclusion as to what brought down the flight.\n\n\"All the scenarios are out on the table,\" Ayman al-Muqaddam told reporters. \"We don't know what happened exactly.\"\n\nSigns pointing to ISIS as the culprit, a U.S. official said, came from monitoring the terrorist group's internal messages. Those messages are separate from public ISIS claims of responsibility, the official said.\n\nCopyright 2015 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All rights reserved.
