Exchange officials, insurance brokers and enrollment assisters will be out in full force this weekend for one last sign-up push.\n\nThe Ramirez Group and Nevada Health Link have scheduled a free \u201cGet Healthy. Get Covered\u201d enrollment fair Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. inside Cox Pavilion on the UNLV campus, at 4505 S. Maryland Parkway.\n\nThe groups said they expect the fair to draw thousands of consumers looking to enroll. Attendees will be able to talk one-on-one with assisters and insurance brokers about income-based plans available through the exchange. There also will be a health fair with free medical screenings, educational information, wellness products and prize giveaways.\n\nConsumers also can enroll through insurance brokers and enrollment assisters listed on Nevada Health Link\u2019s website. Visit nevadahealthlink.com/GetHelp to search by ZIP code for a professional.\n\nHelp also is available at Nevada Health Link\u2019s enrollment store in The Boulevard, 3528 S. Maryland Parkway. The store is near Macy\u2019s and Bath &Body Works. Hours are from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday, and from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sunday. Insurance brokers and exchange officials will be on-site.\n\nTo enroll, consumers should have a Nevada driver\u2019s license or identification card with a picture; a permanent resident or alien registration card, if applicable; Social Security cards for all members of the household; proof of Nevada residence, such as a utility bill; an estimate of 2015 income; and copies of current health insurance information.\n\nFrom the Nov. 15 start of the sign-up period through Feb. 6, 59,623 Nevadans had signed up for coverage through the exchange, according to the federal Health and Human Services Deparment. That included 40,961 consumers in the Las Vegas Valley.\n\nThe exchange enrolled 36,000 customers during the first session, from October 2013 though last May.\n\nHealth and Human Services said 90 percent of Nevadans who have bought through the exchange have received a premium tax credit that averaged $248 per person per month as of Feb. 9. The credits cut monthly premiums by an average of 67 percent.\n\nBut consumers don\u2019t automatically receive the subsidy just for buying through the marketplace. To qualify, buyers must meet income requirements: They can\u2019t make more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level income. That\u2019s $47,000 for singles and $97,000 for a household of four.\n\nNevadans who earn 138 percent or less of the federal poverty wage \u2014 about $16,000 for a single and $33,500 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program.\n\nTo determine whether you qualify for Medicaid or a tax credit to buy a private plan, visit nevadahealthlink.com.\n\nConsumers enrolling in Medicaid or an off-exchange plan can enroll year-round, though waiting periods may apply.\n\nContact Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
