Approximately 60 percent of the comments on the Affordable Care Act’s Facebook page are from fewer than 100 unique profiles, according to a Washington Times analysis.

According to the Washington Times, which conducted the analysis with an outside data analytics firm, about 60 percent of the 226,838 comments were generated by less than 100 users between September 2012 to early last month.

One individual in particular, Cindi Huynh, posted an average of 59 times per day — but only during work hours, the Washington Times reported.

Huynh, who has at least four different Facebook profiles, told the Washington Times that she isn’t paid for her posts, but volunteers with the California Democratic Party and sees them as a way of contributing to the advancement of the Affordable Care Act.

Other prolific posters, however, did not make themselves available to the Washington Times for comment. The newspaper reported that at least three of the commenters disappeared or deactivated their profiles when the Washington Times announced their investigation.

Multiple individuals had commented thousands of times, the Washington Times found in their investigation.

The Obamacare page has more than 771,000 likes and is operated by Obama’s campaign arm, Organizing for Action. The group declined to comment to the newspaper about their findings.
