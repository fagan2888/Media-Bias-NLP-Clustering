According to the Academy, not only does this policy not reduce head lice cases, but it can also create a bad stigma for the otherwise commonplace annoyance.\n\nOn Monday, the American Academy of Pediatrics released new guidelines on dealing with head lice and announced that children with lice infestations should not be banned from going to school. As reported by HNGN, the academy found the policy discriminating because current treatments allow for children to attend school during the day and receive lice treatment when they return home.\n\nResearch has shown that \u201cno-nit\u201d policies, where students are not permitted to attend school during a head lice infestation, may do far more harm than good. These policies have been found to increase the risk of incorrect diagnosis of head lice and the number of days children are not in school. They also put a social stigma on head lice and may even hinder the child\u2019s academic performance. \u201cNo-nit\u201d policies were found not successful in reducing the number of head lice cases because most cases of head lice are caught from close family members or friends, not classmates.\n\nHead lice are tiny wingless parasites that affect only humans. They live off blood sucked from their host\u2019s scalp and can spread by coming in close physical contact with an infected individual or sharing personal items or home furnishing. An estimated six to 12 million U.S. children will get head lice every year.\n\nLice do not spread any disease and are not an indication of filth or poor personal hygiene. They are just annoying and uncomfortable.\n\nFact From Fiction\n\nHead lice are only spread from contact with either infested humans or items of infested humans. Animals cannot become infested with head lice and therefore cannot spread them. Head lice can also infest any type of hair, no matter how long it is, how clean it is, or what texture it is.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, certain races are more prone to head lice infestations than others. In the United States, black people are far less likely than those of other races to become infested with head lice. This is because head lice have adapted to grasping the shape and width of certain types of hair and have trouble gaining footing in black hair.\n\nThe CDC reports that young girls are more likely than boys to have head lice infestations, but this is most likely due to more frequent head-to-head contact and has nothing to do with the length of the actual hair.\n\nThe new guidelines also include recommendations for how parents should treat head lice infestations. According to the revisions, parents should only seek a doctor for a prescription head lice medication if an over-the-counter drug has failed to clear up the infestation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "head lice, pediatrics,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The American Academy of Pediatrics announced on Monday that children should no longer be banned from attending school if they have lice.", "title": "Having Head Lice Is No Longer An Excuse To Miss School", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/head-lice-myths-debunked-kids-head-lice-can-still-attend-school-and-lice-dont-care-331330", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/29/lice-childs-head.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American Academy of Pediatrics announced on Monday that children should no longer be banned from attending school if they have lice.", "title": "Having Head Lice Is No Longer An Excuse To Miss School", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/head-lice-myths-debunked-kids-head-lice-can-still-attend-school-and-lice-dont-care-331330", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/29/lice-childs-head.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/29/lice-childs-head.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-29T17:52:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T17:52:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The American Academy of Pediatrics announced on Monday that children should no longer be banned from attending school if they have lice."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb66\"", "article_summary": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, certain races are more prone to head lice infestations than others.\n\u201cNo-nit\u201d policies were found not successful in reducing the number of head lice cases because most cases of head lice are caught from close family members or friends, not classmates.\nThe new guidelines also include recommendations for how parents should treat head lice infestations.\nHead lice can also infest any type of hair, no matter how long it is, how clean it is, or what texture it is.\nThis is because head lice have adapted to grasping the shape and width of certain types of hair and have trouble gaining footing in black hair."}
