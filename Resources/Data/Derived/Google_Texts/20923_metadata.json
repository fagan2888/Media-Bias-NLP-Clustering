They advocate for legislation limiting undisclosed and big donor money, restoring the Voting Rights Act, and ending gerrymandering that\u2019s insulated and protected corrupt legislators.\n\nThis is hugely important because so many of the things we hear about in the news are really either important aspects of democracy, or they\u2019re in the news because democracy is breaking down.\n\nHere\u2019s a few from just the past week:\n\nThe problem is that most of these issues are never discussed as breakdowns of democracy. Instead, they are all too often discussed as normal or the way things should be.\n\nBusinesses like TurboTax are just doing what businesses do by lobbying the government to keep taxes complex so they can sell more software\u2014even when there\u2019s really no reason the government couldn\u2019t just mail you your completed taxes and ask you to sign off on them. After all, they already have most people\u2019s information.\n\nPeople don\u2019t buy what you do, they buy why you do it\n\nSimon Sinek explains the success of corporate special interest groups in one key sentence:\n\nPeople don\u2019t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.\n\nI\u2019d recommend watching his whole TED talk:\n\nx YouTube Video\n\nHow does what Sinek talks about relate to how to make change happen?\n\nCorporate special interest groups have been successful because they start with the why and move toward the how and the what (they start with ideas and move toward policy). It looks like this:\n\nWe want you to be more free. To do this, we need to shrink government. The way to do this is to cut taxes and subsequently government programs.\n\nIn order to do this, they\u2019ve had to redefine \u201cfreedom\u201d as solely consumer choice and less government. I completely disagree with their definition of freedom. But they are going about it the right way. We are going about it the wrong way.\n\nHere was our health care story:\n\nLet\u2019s look at which policy will work best for health care. What about single payer? Ok, we can\u2019t pass that. What about the public option? Ok, we can\u2019t pass that either, let\u2019s pass the Affordable Care Act and mandate that everyone have insurance. Why? Why are we doing this? Well, the previous thing we were doing wasn\u2019t working.\n\nThis, of course, is true. Unfortunately, the opposition was able to come up with and distribute a more compelling story about how Obama was taking away everyone\u2019s \u201cfreedom.\u201d Do you see now why health care reform might be unpopular?\n\nWe lost on the \u201cwhy.\u201d Their narrative about \u201cwhy\u201d was better marketed.\n\nPeople don\u2019t buy what you do, they buy why you do it.\n\nA better idea: Democracy\n\nAsk most people in America how our country works and who it works for. Invariably, people will tell you that it doesn\u2019t work for them.\n\nI like to draw this picture:\n\nThe status quo in the United Stated.\n\nI then ask them if this is about right: \u201cThis is what I hear you saying.\u201d Most people agree. Then I lay out what democracy looks like. This isn\u2019t rocket science. But it helps to have a conceptual picture so that people understand the \u201cwhy>\u201d\n\nDemocracy.\n\nThe \u201cwhy\u201d is that these things, both government and corporations, should benefit people.\n\nIn this vision of how things work, the vision of our founders, corporations were only chartered for the public good. In other words, they were chartered to serve people.\n\nWe placed strict rules on corporations for 100 years after the Revolutionary War because we fought the war as much against the British East India Company monopoly as we did the British. That tea that was dumped in the harbor, it wasn\u2019t just any tea. It was monopoly tea.\n\nSome of the limits we established in our fledgling representative democracy were:\n\nCharters were granted for a limited time and would expire if not periodically renewed.\n\nCorporations could only engage in activities necessary to fulfill their charter.\n\nCorporations were often terminated if they exceeded their charter or caused public harm.\n\nCorporations could not make political or charitable contributions nor spend money to influence law-making.\n\nOwners and managers were responsible for criminal acts committed on the job.\n\nThis is how democracy is supposed to work. Within this context, all of the following and more make sense:\n\nRepealing Citizens United\n\nA fair and non-partisan election process\n\nGetting money out of politics\n\nThe Fairness Doctrine\n\nVoting rights\n\nPublic financing of elections\n\nPublic education\n\nCorporate regulations\n\nWithin the context of democracy, almost everything on the big ideas site \u201cmakes sense.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate how the logic of this frame works toward a more and more democratic society, here are some of the policy options for elections within the democracy frame:\n\nIn a democracy, gerrymandered districts don\u2019t make sense.\n\nWhat makes sense within this frame is more democracy, less corporate rule. In other words, once you start getting people thinking within the idea that our government and our corporations should benefit people, it makes sense to move toward greater democracy.\n\nThe democracy frame also makes the idea of smaller government look, well, silly.\n\nMaking government smaller or even getting rid of government doesn\u2019t change the fundamental problem. The problem is that things in our country are no longer working for people.\n\nWithin a democracy, solutions need to satisfy the requirement that they benefit\u2014you guessed it\u2014people.\n\nThe problem is that government is corrupt. It is owned by corporate special interest groups. Who really cares how big or small it is if it\u2019s not working for people?\n\nDemocracy needs a marketing plan\n\nThe idea of democracy isn\u2019t new.\n\nThe problem is that corporate ideas like \u201csmall government\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u2122\u201d have hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing muscle behind them. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce alone spends more than $100 million a year on promoting and marketing their version of government (one that works for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) simply so they can pass legislation that benefits them and it won\u2019t be seen as corrupt.\n\nCorporate special interest groups have been teaching and promoting smaller government for 40 years because it makes all of the policy changes they want possible: Privatization, cheaper labor, tax handouts for the wealthy, cutting earned benefits, money in politics, etc.\n\nWe have to start with the better idea\u2014democracy\u2014and win on this idea in order to get better policies. Or, as Simon Sinek would say, we should start with the why and move outward to the how and the what.\n\nIf we had first won with a better story of democracy, health care reform wouldn\u2019t have been so unpopular. This is why it\u2019s so great to see Democracy Spring make the news.\n\nHealth care reform would have seemed like common sense.\n\nIf democracy makes sense, we could do things like eliminate tax preparation (and subsequent profits to all the tax preparation companies). Unions make sense within a democracy. If democracy takes hold again, we could bring back the Voting Rights Act, we could get money out of politics, and we could end tax havens for the rich.\n\nWhat we can do to help is to talk about democracy and why it\u2019s so important as much as possible.
