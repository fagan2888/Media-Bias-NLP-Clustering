The cheapest plan they found on their state insurance exchange was a so-called bronze plan charging a $1,275 monthly premium with deductibles totaling $12,700. It covers only providers in Pennsylvania, so the couple, who live near Delaware, won\u2019t be able to see doctors they\u2019ve used for more than a decade.\n\nSEE ALSO: House GOP: Only six signed up on Obamacare site on Day 1\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re buying insurance that we will never use and can\u2019t possibly ever benefit from. We\u2019re basically passing on a benefit to other people who are not otherwise able to buy basic insurance,\u201d said Griffin, who is retired from running an information technology company.\n\nThe Griffins are among millions of people nationwide who buy individual insurance policies and are receiving notices that those policies are being discontinued because they don\u2019t meet the higher benefit requirements of the new law.\n\nThey can buy different policies directly from insurers for 2014 or sign up for plans on state insurance exchanges. While lower-income people could see lower costs because of government subsidies, many in the middle class may get rude awakenings when they access the websites and realize they\u2019ll have to pay significantly more.\n\nThose not eligible for subsidies generally receive more comprehensive coverage than they had under their soon-to-be-canceled policies, but they\u2019ll have to pay a lot more.\n\nBecause of the higher cost, the Griffins are considering paying the federal penalty \u2014 about $100 or 1 percent of income next year \u2014 rather than buying health insurance. They say they are healthy and don\u2019t typically run up large health care costs. Dean Griffin said that will be cheaper because it\u2019s unlikely they will get past the nearly $13,000 deductible for the coverage to kick in.\n\nIndividual health insurance policies are being canceled because the Affordable Care Act requires plans to cover certain benefits, such as maternity care, hospital visits and mental illness. The law also caps annual out-of-pocket costs consumers will pay each year.\n\nIn the past, consumers could get relatively inexpensive, bare-bones coverage, but those plans will no longer be available. Many consumers are frustrated by what they call forced upgrades as they\u2019re pushed into plans with coverage options they don\u2019t necessarily want.\n\nKen Davis, who manages a fast food restaurant in Austin, Texas, is recovering from sticker shock after the small-business policy offered by his employer was canceled for the same reasons individual policies are being discontinued.\n\nHis company pays about $100 monthly for his basic health plan. He said he\u2019ll now have to pay $600 monthly for a mid-tier silver plan on the state exchange. The family policy also covers his 8-year-old son. Even though the federal government is contributing a $500 subsidy, he said the $600 he\u2019s left to pay is too high. He\u2019s considering the penalty.\n\n\u201cI feel like they\u2019re forcing me to do something that I don\u2019t want to do or need to do,\u201d Davis, 40, said.\n\nOwners of canceled policies have a few options. They can stay in the same plan for the same price for one more year if they have one of the few plans that were grandfathered in. They can buy a similar plan with upgraded benefits that meets the new standards \u2014 likely at a significant cost increase. Or, if they make less than $45,960 for a single adult or $94,200 for a family of four, they may qualify for subsidies.\n\nJust because a policy doesn\u2019t comply with the law doesn\u2019t mean consumers will get cancellation letters. They may get notices saying existing policies are being amended with new benefits and will come with higher premiums. Some states, including Virginia and Kentucky, required insurers to cancel old policies and start from scratch instead of beefing up existing ones.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many individual plans are being canceled \u2014 no one agency keeps track. But it\u2019s likely in the millions. Insurance industry experts estimate that about 14 million people, or 5 percent of the total market for health care coverage, buy individual policies. Most people get coverage through jobs and aren\u2019t affected.\n\nMany states require insurers to give consumers 90 days\u2019 notice before canceling plans. That means another round of cancellation letters will go out in March and again in May.\n\nExperts haven\u2019t been able to predict how many will pay more or less under the new, upgraded plans. An older policyholder with a pre-existing condition may find that premiums go down, and some will qualify for subsidies.\n\nIn California, about 900,000 people are expected to lose existing plans, but about a third will be eligible for subsidies through the state exchange, said Anne Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the exchange, called Covered California. Most canceled plans provided bare-bones coverage, she said.\n\n\u201cThey basically had plans that had gaping holes in the coverage. They would be surprised when they get to the emergency room or the doctor\u2019s office, some of them didn\u2019t have drug coverage or preventive care,\u201d Gonzalez said.\n\nAbout 330,000 Floridians received cancellation notices from the state\u2019s largest insurer, Florida Blue. About 30,000 have plans that were grandfathered in. Florida insurance officials said they\u2019re not tracking the number of canceled policies related to the new law.\n\nNational numbers are similar: 130,000 cancellations in Kentucky, 140,000 in Minnesota and as many as 400,000 in Georgia, according to officials in those states.\n\nCigna has sent thousands of cancellation letters to U.S. policyholders but stressed that 99 percent have the option of renewing their 2013 policy for one more year, company spokesman Joe Mondy said.\n\nCancellation letters are being sent only to individuals and families who purchase their own insurance. However, most policyholders in the individual market will receive some notice that their coverage will change, said Dan Mendelson, president of the market analysis firm Avalere Health.\n\nThe cancellations run counter to one of President Barack Obama\u2019s promises about his health care overhaul: \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan.\u201d\n\nPhilip Johnson, 47, of Boise, Idaho, was shocked when his cancellation notice arrived last month. The gift-shop owner said he\u2019d spent years arranging doctors covered by his insurer for him, his wife and their two college-age students.\n\nAfter browsing the state exchange, he said he thinks he\u2019ll end up paying lower premiums but higher deductibles. He said the website didn\u2019t answer many of his questions, such as which doctors take which plans.\n\n\u201cI was furious because I spent a lot of time and picked a plan that all my doctors accepted,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cNow I don\u2019t know what doctors are going to take what. No one mentioned that for the last three years when they talked about how this was going to work.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Associated Press writers Christina A.
