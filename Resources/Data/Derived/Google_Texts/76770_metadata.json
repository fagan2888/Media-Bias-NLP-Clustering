Marco Rubio\u2019s own constituents\u2014two displaced Disney workers\u2014publicly denounced Rubio for prioritizing the interests of his big business donors over the interests of his own constituents. The two endorsed GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for President.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDena Moore and Leo Perrero were two Disney workers who were informed that they were going to be laid off during the holiday season of 2014. They\u2014along with scores of their colleagues\u2014were told that before they were let go, they\u2019d be forced to train their low-skilled foreign replacements brought in on H-1B visas. Earlier this week, Perrero testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the humiliation he was forced to endure by training his foreign replacement. While Donald Trump has called on Disney to hire back all of these workers and has pledged to end H-1B job theft as President, Sen. Marco Rubio has pushed to expand the controversial H-1B program\u2014he has introduced two bills that would dramatically boost the issuances of H-1Bs. As recently as last year, Rubio introduced a bill\u2014endorsed by Disney\u2019s CEO Bob Iger via his immigration lobbying firm\u2014that would triple the issuances of H-1Bs. Disney is one of Sen. Rubio\u2019s top financial backers\u2014having donated more that $2 million according to Open Secrets.\n\n\u201cWhat a great disappointment Marco Rubio is,\u201d Rubio constituent and displaced Disney worker Dena Moore told the crowd. \u201cBacked by Disney and other companies to push through legislation that have brought H-1B visas to us and he has sabotaged Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubio\u2019s staff said in 2013 explaining the [guest worker expansions in Gang of Eight] bill \u2018American workers can\u2019t cut it.\u2019 Shame on you Marco Rubio,\u201d Moore declared.\n\nThe Disney workers were introduced at the rally by their attorney who is representing them in their discrimination lawsuit against Disney, Sara Blackwell. In her introductory remarks Blackwell explained, \u201cThe thing about Trump that\u2019s different than anybody else is that he can\u2019t be bought. We have a chance to stop this problem in America. It\u2019s got to be by a president and politician where they won\u2019t be bought by Disney\u2019s Bob Iger or by Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, by all these billionaires who benefit from firing our American workers. \u201c\n\n\u201cAmericans are losing our jobs to foreigners and politicians are supporting and/or promoting this behavior,\u201d Moore explained. \u201cIf we want to achieve the American dream\u2014or even, more importantly, keep what is ours: the American dream that we have already struggled to create, the American dream that others have sacrificed for us, now is the time to link arms with a champion. I believe Mr. Trump is for Americans first and foremost. He shares our vision, our dreams, and will fight for our futures. I know most of you are already standing, but here\u2019s my mantra: stand up for Americans, stand up with a champion, stand up with Trump.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Displaced Disney Workers: Shame on You Marco Rubio; We Stand With Trump", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Displaced Disney Workers: Shame on You Marco Rubio; We Stand With Trump", "title": "Displaced Disney Workers: Shame on You Marco Rubio; We Stand With Trump - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/rubio-trump-AP-640x480.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-02-28T14:41:27-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2016/02/28/displaced-disney-workers-shame-on-you-marco-rubio-we-stand-with-trump/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Displaced Disney Workers: Shame on You Marco Rubio; We Stand With Trump", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/rubio-trump-AP-640x480.jpg", "title": "Displaced Disney Workers: Shame on You Marco Rubio; We Stand With Trump - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Disney, Donald Trump, H-1B Visas replacing American workers, Marco Rubio,2016 Presidential Race, Immigration,trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-02-28T14:33:05-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-02-28T14:41:27-07:00", "tag": "Marco Rubio", "categories": "Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat a great disappointment Marco Rubio is,\u201d Rubio constituent and displaced Disney worker Dena Moore told the crowd.\nThe Disney workers were introduced at the rally by their attorney who is representing them in their discrimination lawsuit against Disney, Sara Blackwell.\nI know most of you are already standing, but here\u2019s my mantra: stand up for Americans, stand up with a champion, stand up with Trump.\u201d\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDena Moore and Leo Perrero were two Disney workers who were informed that they were going to be laid off during the holiday season of 2014.\nIt\u2019s got to be by a president and politician where they won\u2019t be bought by Disney\u2019s Bob Iger or by Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, by all these billionaires who benefit from firing our American workers."}
