(NASDAQ:ATHN), a leading provider of network-enabled services and mobile applications for health care providers nationwide, today released its annual PayerView\u00ae Report\u2122, a data-driven review of the performance of payers on athenaNet\u00ae, athenahealth\u2019s nationwide cloud-based network. The Report delivers insight into the provider-payer relationship and provides a powerful guide for providers as their payer mix shifts to accommodate newly insured patients and enter into risk-based payments.1\n\nThis year\u2019s findings, which are based on payers\u2019 performance on a series of athenahealth selected administrative, transactional, and financial metrics, reveal shifts amongst the Report\u2019s historically high-performing payers. National commercial payer Cigna ranks as #1 in 2016 for the first time, leading the pack amongst a diverse top ten list which includes several payer types. In a year marked by the continued implementation of health care reform and the accelerating adoption of alternative payment models, some payers struggled to maintain consistent performance while others\u2014particularly several Blues and Medicare Part B payers\u2014maintained performance levels from years past and even improved slightly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe accelerating shift to alternative payment models, coupled with the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, has created both challenges and opportunities for payers,\u201d said David Tassoni, SVP for Operations, athenahealth. \u201cNow, more than ever, payers need to learn from each other and to work with providers and partners to embrace opportunities for transparency and communication. athenahealth is committed to facilitating this collaboration and transparency through the insights gained from our network, and we plan to implement this knowledge as we work to coach performance for our own payer partners.\u201d\n\nThe 2016 rankings include 29 percent more payers than 2015, which makes PayerView a strong indicator of payer performance nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled with the number one ranking because it demonstrates that the steps we\u2019ve taken over the past several years to improve the health care provider experience are succeeding,\u201d said Julie Vayer, Cigna's Vice President, Total Health & Network Operations. \u201cHowever, we recognize that our work is not finished; it is ongoing. We are focused on continuous improvement through collaboration with athenahealth and other organizations that will help us earn the trust of health care providers every day.\u201d\n\nTo see the full 2016 PayerView Report, please visit www.athenahealth.com/PayerView.\n\nAn infographic accompanying this release is available at: http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/5d1f52a8-535d-4a36-8571-75dba9f7206f\n\nRead more about today\u2019s PayerView release, and see how the network\u2019s largest payers ranked this year, by visiting the athenahealth CloudView Blog at www.athenahealth.com/blog.\n\n1The rankings and data provided are based solely on actual claims activity captured quarterly in the athenaNet\u00ae system from a limited set of physicians and payers.
