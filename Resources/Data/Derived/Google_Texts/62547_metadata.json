A team of University of Michigan researchers studied Census Bureau employment data for 2014 - the first full year of the law\u2019s implementation - and found no evidence of a higher rate of retirement, or a shift to part-time work, for Americans age 55 to 64.\n\n\u201cWe looked for it. In fact we really looked hard for it,\u201d said Helen Levy, a research associate professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Social Research. \u201cThis just hasn\u2019t been the labor supply Armageddon some were predicting.\u201d\n\nStill, the ACA has had an enormous, positive impact on older Americans.\n\nAt the end of the ACA\u2019s first full year, the share of Americans ages 50 to 64 without health insurance had fallen by nearly a third, to just 8 percent, according to research by the Urban Institute and AARP. The uninsured rate was even lower in the 27 states that chose to expand Medicaid eligibility - just 5.5 percent at the end of last year.\n\nIt is too early to document improved health, but Levy and other experts think the higher coverage rates will mean healthier seniors in the years ahead.\n\n\u201cFor these folks, health insurance really matters,\u201d Levy said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who tend to get sick, and they have a nest egg to protect. It really is a matter of life and death.\u201d\n\nLevy thinks uncertainty about the ACA may have kept some older workers on the job who otherwise would have exited.\n\nIn part, she credits the lengthy, failed battles by Republicans to repeal the law in Congress or upend it in the courts. Another factor, she thinks, was the messy launch of the federal health exchange website, Healthcare.gov, and the ensuing bad publicity.\n\n\u201cIf I am an older worker and working primarily for the health insurance, that means I\u2019m a cautious, careful person - perhaps someone with a serious health problem or a spouse with a problem,\" says Levy.\n\nShe adds that if people were in that situation on January 1, 2014, they would not retire so fast. They would want to make sure this new insurance will be there for all the years needed until they get to Medicare.\n\nWith the initial kinks worked out of the system and legal challenges foiled, workers may well head for the exits in the years ahead. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to know,\u201d says Linda Blumberg, senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a co-author of the 2013 forecast.\n\nIndeed, entrepreneurship in this age group is becoming more commonplace. People age 55-65 accounted for 26 percent of all startups last year, up from 15 percent in 1996, according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity.\n\nInterest in encore careers rose by 17 percent from 2011 to 2014, according to a national survey conducted by Encore.org.\n\n(The writer is a Reuters columnist.
