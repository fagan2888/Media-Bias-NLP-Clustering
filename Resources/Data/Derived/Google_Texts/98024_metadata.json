The seniors were two of 15 who walked out of Folsom Field for the last time Saturday night, a mere spattering of the 36,005 left clapping for them in the cold.\n\nThe seniors left with bowl hopes dashed once again, the faces rubbed in the turf by another vastly superior Pac-12 opponent. This time, 23rd-ranked Southern California jumped to a 37-7 lead before settling on a 47-29 win.\n\nIn the big picture, Colorado (4-7, 1-7 Pac-12) stretched its school record to eight straight losing seasons. In the now, the picture the seniors will take with them through this last week of their careers, they will never play in a bowl game.\n\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d said Orms who earned the award from fans for his playing through three years of injuries, including a stinger Saturday. \u201cThat\u2019s college football right there. That was something that was a big goal of mine. I thought I\u2019d be going every year and to not go to one kills me inside.\u201d\n\nFor Webb, his career covered three head coaches, which almost matches the Buffs\u2019 four Pac-12 wins since joining the league two years ago. But if coach Mike MacIntyre wants to build a foundation in this first year, these seniors are his first bricks.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say my career was empty at all,\u201d Webb said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough four or five years. I\u2019ve learned a lot. I met a lot of great men. I participated at the highest level of college football.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ve had a lot of great wins here at Colorado. And there will be some great wins to come at Colorado, and I plan on coming back for some of those.\u201d\n\nWhen MacIntyre sits down at season\u2019s end next weekend and sees the depths his program must climb to contend, he won\u2019t have to look at the lack of size or lack of speed. He\u2019ll just have to look at one figure: 50-18.\n\nThat\u2019s the average score that Colorado has lost its seven league games.\n\nUSC (9-3, 6-2) is a prime example of the K2-sized challenges in the Pac-12. Fueled by four- and five-star recruits throughout the lineup, and jacked up by their love for interim coach Ed Orgeron, the Trojans systematically steamrolled the outmanned Buffs.\n\nSophomore Cody Kessler continued his steady rise in Trojan lore, hitting 19-of-28 for 184 yards and two touchdowns. Javorius Allen, one of a stableful of capable tailbacks, had 145 yards and three scores.\n\nBut defensively, USC looked like it channeled Pete Carroll \u2018s national championship years. In building a 23-0 halftime lead, USC held Colorado to 73 total yards. Sefo Liufau was only 4-of-15 for 43 yards in those two quarters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best defense we\u2019ve played all year,\u201d Liufau said. \u201cThey rarely brought blitzes but they got a lot of pressure on us.\u201d\n\nPaul Richardson, about the lone Buff who gives opponents the shakes, didn\u2019t get a reception against USC\u2019s double teams until the Buffs were down 37-7 in the third quarter.\n\nIt was the second coldest game in USC history \u2014 29 degrees at kickoff \u2013 but to the Trojans it seemed like another day at Manhattan Beach. They forced five straight punts to start the game. Then end Leonard Williams walloped Liufau on a sack and fellow end George Uko recovered the fumble at the Buff 20.\n\nFour plays later, Allen slid in from the 1 for a 16-0 lead. Safety Dion Bailey then made a terrific sideline interception of Liufau, setting up Kessler\u2019s 20-yard TD pass to Nelson Agholor for a relatively safe 23-0 lead.\n\nTrojans freezing in the cold? USC may just be getting warmed up.\n\n\u201cI thought it was rather pleasant tonight compared to what we had heard it was going to be like,\u201d Orgeron said.\n\nThe Buffs scored three TDs against the Trojan reserves in the fourth quarter to close to 40-29 with 3:19 left but USC recovered a particularly dangerous onside kick to all but end it.\n\nNow the Buffs only have the battle of the South Division basement Saturday at Utah (4-7, 1-7) left. But to sophomore receiver Nelson Spruce, the Buffs have left more.\n\n\u201cThis year we made incredible strides,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we are really on the verge of being able to compete in every game. It\u2019s not looking like that on the scoreboard but we taking strides in the right direction.\u201d\n\nJohn Henderson: jhenderson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnhendersondp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No quit in Buffs, but also no bowl", "title": "No quit in Buffs, but also no bowl", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/23/no-quit-in-buffs-but-also-no-bowl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131123__colorado-uscp1.jpg", "height": 508}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131123__colorado-uscp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-23T23:20:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T12:35:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13c5\"", "article_summary": "The seniors left with bowl hopes dashed once again, the faces rubbed in the turf by another vastly superior Pac-12 opponent.\nNow the Buffs only have the battle of the South Division basement Saturday at Utah (4-7, 1-7) left.\nBut to sophomore receiver Nelson Spruce, the Buffs have left more.\nIn the big picture, Colorado (4-7, 1-7 Pac-12) stretched its school record to eight straight losing seasons.\nIn the now, the picture the seniors will take with them through this last week of their careers, they will never play in a bowl game."}
