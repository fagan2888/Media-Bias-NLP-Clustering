Could the U.S. devise a strategic plan to keep the country safe from any all of these possibilities by providing the manpower and technology to ward off our enemies?\n\nAlmost 20 years ago, Congress began requiring the Pentagon to provide lawmakers with an objective, fact-based assessment every four years of the global threats facing the U.S.\n\nThat\u2019s no longer the case. While the reports keep coming in, they\u2019ve since lost any credibility - at least from the party not occupying the White House.\n\nRelated: Intelligence Chair Fears Putin Has New Target: Armenia\n\nThe document, known as the Quadrennial Defense Review, is designed to assess security threats and U.S. response capabilities as many as 20 years down the line. The 2014 QDR was submitted to Congress last month, and Republicans such as House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon were quick to reject it, calling it a budget-driven report devoid of any significant analysis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that these reports have grown less compliant with the law and strayed further from the intent of Congress,\u201d McKeon said yesterday at a hearing to discuss the review\u2019s findings. \u201cThe QDR is meant to be a useful tool for Congress to understand the longer-term strategic challenges and opportunities facing the department. It\u2019s meant to inform a thoughtful debate on our defense strategy and the resources needed to fulfill it.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s working to include a provision in an annual defense-policy bill to require the Pentagon to rewrite the document first mandated by Congress in 1996.\n\n\u201cMounting criticism over the years that the report was kind of a politicized document that couldn\u2019t help but reflect the policy agenda of the administration that was creating it,\u201d said Dakota Wood, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. And with this one \u201ccritics have said: You guys either don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing or you\u2019re not being honest and forthcoming with these official documents that are coming out.\u201d\n\nRelated: Lifelong Pensions for Vets Could Be Whacked Under Pentagon Proposal\n\nWhat\u2019s clear in this year\u2019s QDR is that the military\u2019s assessment of itself is through the lens of persistent spending cuts, forcing it to reevaluate its resources and capabilities.\n\nChristopher J. Griffin, executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative in Washington, said that while both Democratic and Republican administrations have used the QDR to defend at length their budget request, this year\u2019s review is particularly egregious.\n\n\u201cThe big problem with this QDR is that it\u2019s transparently budget-driven,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt reflects these very deep cuts that have been made to Defense Department spending and isn\u2019t based on any strategic planning. The divorce between the QDR and strategic reality is more transparent this year than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe report was released at the same time as the administration\u2019s fiscal 2015 budget request to Congress.\n\nRelated: With Latest Victory, Assad Has Won the War in Syria\n\nSome lawmakers question the value of a review that\u2019s also expected to look 20 years into the future.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to predicting future national security threats and where we\u2019ll have to go to war, we do not have a very good record,\u201d said Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. \u201cThe reason for that is: The world is unpredictable.\u201d\n\nThe report\u2019s one paragraph devoted to Russia says that its \u201cmulti-dimensional defense modernization and actions that violate the sovereignty of its neighbors present risks. We will engage Russia to increase transparency and reduce the risk of military miscalculation.\u201d\n\nStill, military experts note that the 88-page review did provide a frank outlook, albeit in the last three pages, from Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nRelated: Scramjet: DOD\u2019s New Screaming Fast Hypersonic Weapon\n\n\u201cMost of our platforms and equipment will be older, and our advantages in some domains will have eroded,\u201d Dempsey wrote. \u201cOur loss of depth across the force could reduce our ability to intimidate opponents from escalating conflict. Nations and non-state actors who have become accustomed to our presence could begin to act differently, often in harmful ways.\u201d\n\nAs for the QDR itself, the long-term outlook isn\u2019t much better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the QDR will ever turn around,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cYou have a five-sided building that will always defend its budget \u2013 that\u2019s just what it does.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Over the past two decades, a four-year review from the Pentagon of global threats and U.S. capabilities has devolved from a fact-based report to a politically-motivated document.", "title": "The Pentagon\u2019s Strategists Have Closed Up Shop", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/04/Pentagon-s-Strategists-Have-Closed-Shop", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_US_Soldiers_Afghanistan_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/04/Pentagon-s-Strategists-Have-Closed-Shop", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_US_Soldiers_Afghanistan_article.jpg", "creator": "@timothyrhoman", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Over the past two decades, a four-year review from the Pentagon of global threats and U.S. capabilities has devolved from a fact-based report to a politically-motivated document.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca036\"", "article_summary": "While the reports keep coming in, they\u2019ve since lost any credibility - at least from the party not occupying the White House.\n\u201cThe QDR is meant to be a useful tool for Congress to understand the longer-term strategic challenges and opportunities facing the department.\n\u201cYou have a five-sided building that will always defend its budget \u2013 that\u2019s just what it does.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\u201cIt reflects these very deep cuts that have been made to Defense Department spending and isn\u2019t based on any strategic planning.\nRelated: Intelligence Chair Fears Putin Has New Target: ArmeniaThe document, known as the Quadrennial Defense Review, is designed to assess security threats and U.S. response capabilities as many as 20 years down the line."}
