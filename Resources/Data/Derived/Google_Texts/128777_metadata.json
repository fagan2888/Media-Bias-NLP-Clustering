It\u2019s called vibrio vulnificus.\n\nSo far, seven people have died from Vibrio this year, including one death each in Brevard and Lake counties. Florida so far has tied the 2014 deaths with six months left in the year.\n\nIf that sounds scary, keep in mind, Florida will typically see anywhere from six to 15 deaths per year from vibrio. For a bit of scale, Florida will usually have as many boating deaths in the month of July as vibrio deaths in the entire year.\n\n\u201cThis is not the end of the world, this isn\u2019t, like, one of the harbingers,\u201d said Dr. Consuelo Beck-Sague, a public health professor at Florida International University. \u201cBut at the same time something that\u2019s preventable and that can occasionally be fatal should not be taken in a casual way.\u201d\n\nVibrio is found in warm, salty waters. So ocean beaches are a possibility, but the bacteria particularly likes brackish water, where salt and freshwater combine. The gulf coast is also a hot zone, but every single county in Florida has reported a case in the last two years.\n\nSo, to refresh: Don\u2019t swim with an open cut. Don\u2019t eat raw shellfish. And especially don\u2019t do those things if you\u2019re elderly, a child or have a less-than-stellar immune system.\n\nVibrio responds well to antibiotics, if caught soon enough. So if you have a painful rash that spreads quickly, seriously: Go see a doctor.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
