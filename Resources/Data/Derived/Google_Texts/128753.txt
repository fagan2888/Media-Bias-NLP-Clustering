Since July, the anti-choice group Center For Medical Progress (CMP) released a series of highly edited smear videos which they claimed was evidence of Planned Parenthood officials illegally selling fetal tissue and using illegal abortion methods. None of the CMP's claims of illegal activity by Planned Parenthood have borne out: investigations conducted in twelve states and by the U.S. Department Of Health and Human Services found no wrongdoing on the part of the organization. CMP's founder David Daleiden and his associate were indicted by a Houston grand jury in January for tampering with a governmental record in their campaign against Planned Parenthood.

On March 28, The New York Times editorial board explained that "Since last July, 23 states have tried various ways of cutting money" for Planned Parenthood, and "So far 11 have succeeded," inflicting "substantial and immediate" harm "on the poorest and most vulnerable women."

The result, they explained "is reduced access to essential health care for millions of American women":
