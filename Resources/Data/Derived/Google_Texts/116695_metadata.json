Just think of all the people out there waiting for Science Fiction detective novels on heterosexual privilege who don't read Spanish? There may even be dozens of them.\n\nThe National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) spent $12,500 to translate a Spanish novel on \u201chomophobia,\u201d which \u201cexamines heterosexual privilege and queer resilience.\u201d El gato de si mismo, or The Cat Himself, is a 2005 novel by Uriel Quesada, the director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Loyola University, New Orleans. The NEA issued the grant because of the book\u2019s subject matter. \u201cOne of the few Spanish-language novels that addresses homophobia, Quesada\u2019s book examines heterosexual privilege and queer resilience in 21st-century Latin America through allusions to literary history and Hispanic Catholic culture,\u201d the federal agency said in a description for the grant. El gato de si mismo received Costa Rica\u2019s National Literary Award in 2006.\u201d A Google translation of the book\u2019s Amazon description said the novel is like a \u201cscience fiction detective story,\u201d that journeys \u201cinto schizophrenia\u201d and \u201crepressed\u201d discourse.\n\nIf Quesada teaches at Loyola, isn't he fluent in English? Couldn't the cat himself translate his own terrible novel without charging us 12 large for the privilege of inflicting it on his students?\n\nI'm sure we need a schizophrenic repressed journey into what terrible people the normals are, but do we also have to be forced to pay for it as if this thing is ObamaCare?\n\nWe could have bought cats for that money. Lots of actual cats. Maybe enough cats to help Quesada cope with whatever issues he has.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "Wasn't that generous of you?", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "Wasn't that generous of you?", "title": "You Paid $12,500 to Translate Spanish Science Fiction Detective Novel on Heterosexual Privilege", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/252251/you-paid-12500-translate-spanish-science-fiction-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:41:48-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/252251/you-paid-12500-translate-spanish-science-fiction-daniel-greenfield", "description": "Wasn't that generous of you?", "card": "summary", "title": "You Paid $12,500 to Translate Spanish Science Fiction Detective Novel on Heterosexual Privilege"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-28T04:07:42-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:41:48-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d8f\"", "article_summary": "Just think of all the people out there waiting for Science Fiction detective novels on heterosexual privilege who don't read Spanish?\nCouldn't the cat himself translate his own terrible novel without charging us 12 large for the privilege of inflicting it on his students?\n\u201cOne of the few Spanish-language novels that addresses homophobia, Quesada\u2019s book examines heterosexual privilege and queer resilience in 21st-century Latin America through allusions to literary history and Hispanic Catholic culture,\u201d the federal agency said in a description for the grant.\nMaybe enough cats to help Quesada cope with whatever issues he has.\nThe National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) spent $12,500 to translate a Spanish novel on \u201chomophobia,\u201d which \u201cexamines heterosexual privilege and queer resilience.\u201d El gato de si mismo, or The Cat Himself, is a 2005 novel by Uriel Quesada, the director of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at Loyola University, New Orleans."}
