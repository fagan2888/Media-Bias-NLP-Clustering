Two men have been arrested and a third is being sought in connection with a burglary at a Polish deli on West St. Georges Avenue.

In the early morning hours of Nov. 17, police responded to a report of a broken glass window at Biedronka Polish Deli, 1025 W. St. Georges Ave. It appears the store was entered and an attempt was made to force open the cash register, police said.

During a review of the store's surveillance video footage, detectives observed three men enter the business after a rock was thrown through the glass door between 9 and 9:30 p.m. Nov. 16.

Following a brief investigation, two of the three suspects were identified and arrested. Police said Phillip Ruddy, 27, of Roselle Park, and Joshua Mogere, 28, a local resident, were charged with burglary. They are both being held at the Union County Jail in Elizabeth on $75,000 bail each.

The third person is still being sought, police said.

Anyone with information about the burglary is asked to call Detective Matt Damatta at 908-474-8538 or email crimetips@lpdnj.org.
