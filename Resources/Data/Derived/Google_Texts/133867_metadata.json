According to a new study to be presented at the American Society for Hypertension\u2019s annual scientific meeting in New York City, these people should be hitting a sweet spot between five and eight hours of sleep each night. Any more or less than that and they\u2019re at a higher risk of stroke.\n\nResearchers from New York\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital analyzed nine years of data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey, which included information on almost 204,000 people. They found that people who got more than eight hours of sleep or less than five hours of sleep were at a respective 14 percent and 11 percent higher risk of stroke, when compared to so-called \u201chealthy\u201d sleepers who got seven to eight hours of sleep. Their risk of stroke was only five percent higher. Meanwhile, those who got between five and six hours of sleep, called \u201cshort sleepers,\u201d were at a six percent higher risk of stroke.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised, especially with the individuals reporting insufficient sleep, because most studies\u2026 have [only] shown a modest increase in the chances of suffering a stroke among those with short sleep duration,\u201d said study author Dr. Oluwaseun Akinseye, a resident in internal medicine, according to HealthDay.\n\nThough the research hasn\u2019t been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and it wasn\u2019t designed to prove a cause-and-effect relationship, other research has suggested links between sleep duration and blood pressure and stroke. According to Mayo Clinic, irregular sleeping patterns throw off the body\u2019s ability to regulate the stress hormone cortisol. Getting insufficient amounts may lead to an increase in cortisol levels, the researchers said, while getting too much could lead to the release of inflammatory chemicals.\n\nThe researchers would get closer to a cause-and-effect result if their future studies included more objective measures of sleep quality \u2014 the current one involved self-reports of sleep, which often aren\u2019t completely accurate. \u201cThere are monitors that measure not only sleep duration but quality,\u201d Dr. Amy Tai, a clinical assistant professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine, told HealthDay. \u201cI think studies using a more objective measurement of sleep, such as remote or recordable devices, would be helpful in truly capturing objective data because self-reporting has its limitations.\u201d\n\nSource: Akinseye O, et al.
