Per the DOCHS policy, no one is turned away because of inability to pay. After a patient is cared for, a financial adviser will work with that patient if he or she is uninsured.\n\nDCHS, in a press release, did not indicate if it will seek a single buyer for all 22 of its hospitals, or if it will attempt to sell them piecemeal to multiple parties as they receive interest. The charity also did not say if it has been contacted by any potential buyers.\n\nThe organization did not identify the specific circumstances that forced it to seek a buyer, but indicated this week\u2019s announcement has been months in consideration. During that time, DCHS leadership \u201ccarefully reviewed its options to preserve its hospitals and access to care,\u201d the press release said. An effort by DCHS to merge with Ascension Health Alliance, which started in 2011, failed recently.\n\n\u201cAfter careful consideration, our Board, management team and advisors have determined that the sale of our hospitals is the most sound and responsible business decision,\u201d said Robert Issai, President and Chief Executive Officer of DCHS. \u201cLike other health systems across the country, we recognize that the way health care is provided today \u2013 where it is offered, how it is paid for, how it is measured \u2013 is changing dramatically, and we believe that new ownership is in the best interest of the communities we serve.\u201d\n\nDCHS has owned the Gilroy hospital, and the DePaul Health Center in Morgan Hill, since 2011. The DePaul Center, which houses numerous specialty physicians\u2019 offices and an Urgent Care Center that opened in 2010, is also for sale.\n\nSLRH serves South County and northern San Benito County, and has 96 licensed beds, according to DCHS. It employs 554 people, including more than 200 physicians. Its emergency room served 26,000 patients in 2012, making it one of the busiest emergency rooms in northern California.\n\nSLRH board member Allen Hayes referred questions and requests for comment to DCHS\u2019 corporate offices. But he noted \u201cit\u2019s no secret\u201d that the local hospital has been operating in the red.\n\nFor the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2012, SLRH posted a net income loss of about $4.3 million, according to financial disclosure reports submitted to the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. The previous year, the hospital posted a loss of about $1.9 million, and about $690,000 in 2010.\n\nDespite these financial hardships, SLRH has continued to expand its variety of services in recent years. The DePaul Urgent Care Center opened in 2010, and private physicians have almost completely filled the remaining offices at the Morgan Hill campus. The DePaul medical facility is the former site of SLRH, which moved to Gilroy in 1999.\n\nPlus, the Gilroy site established a stroke center in 2011. On top of that, SLRH\u2019s main campus offers a full array of medical services and state-of-the-art facilities including CT scans and MRIs, a breast cancer center, oncology, pediatrics, orthopedics, OB/GYN and more.\n\nA key aspect of DCHS\u2019 mission is to serve the poor, and SLRH has participated in a number of community partnerships, health fairs, and other programs to serve South County\u2019s low-income population.\n\nThis has been important for the County, which runs the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center and provides medical services for local residents, according to County Director of Health and Hospital Systems Rene Santiago. The County has had a long-lasting \u201ccollaborative partnership\u201d with SLRH, particularly for services such as OB/GYN and pediatric coverage.\n\n\u201cPart of their mission (is) they have served the sick and very poor,\u201d Santiago said. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about any potential ownership changes that could have a potential reduction of services.\u201d\n\nCounty health services reach about 250,000 residents annually, Santiago said.\n\nThe County has purchased health facilities, but only in response to persistent community urging.\n\n\u201cThis county has stepped in, in prior situations where a...for-profit has purchased what we would consider community assets, and (was) determined to take certain actions that would have a negative impact on the residents of this community,\u201d Santiago said.\n\nHe added that the County has communicated with DCHS about the intent to sell its health system, and will \u201cmonitor the situation closely to see what transpires.\u201d\n\nNationwide, the healthcare industry has been a subject of intense scrutiny, with the recent implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and decades of continuous rising costs as well as changing delivery methods and business practices.\n\nThe California Attorney General\u2019s office lists the sale or pending sale of seven nonprofit hospitals since January 2013, though it\u2019s unclear if these sales were prompted by the same trends that have affected DCHS.\n\n\u201cThe whole healthcare industry is going through a dramatic change now, in terms of the way they\u2019re paid, and in the way they\u2019re trying to deliver care,\u201d said Joe Mueller, longtime Morgan Hill resident and board member of the Morgan Hill Community Health Foundation.\n\nThat foundation formed shortly after SLRH moved out of Morgan Hill in 1999, to develop strategies to expand medical services in South County and make sure they stay. The foundation was instrumental in the establishment of the DePaul Urgent Care Center in 2010.\n\n\u201cHealthcare has always been a challenge,\u201d Mueller added. \u201cSouth County is one of the most difficult challenges. We\u2019re on that verge of a very well-served area, to an area that is more difficult to serve due to location and distance\u201d from more well-heeled areas to the north.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Gilroy Dispatch", "description": "The \u201crealities of modern healthcare\u201d have forced South County\u2019s largest healthcare facility to its knees, as the nonprofit organization that runs Saint Louise Regional Hospital this week announced its intent to sell their entire health system, according to the parent organization\u2019s spokespeople.", "title": "For sale: Health care system", "url": "http://www.gilroydispatch.com/news/community/for-sale-health-care-system/article_12fa5dca-7cb4-11e3-ade7-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gilroydispatch.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/93/e93eb919-ca2f-562d-a455-2cf66d7e6181/4fe9eedc14e64.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C328", "height": 328}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gilroydispatch", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "The \u201crealities of modern healthcare\u201d have forced South County\u2019s largest healthcare facility to its knees, as the nonprofit organization that runs Saint Louise Regional Hospital this week announced its intent to sell their entire health system, according to the parent organization\u2019s spokespeople.", "fb": {"app_id": 220511694665155}, "keywords": "saint louise regional hospital,for sale,hospital,health care,santa clara county,dchs,daughters of charity health system,community", "news_keywords": "saint louise regional hospital,for sale,hospital,health care,santa clara county,dchs,daughters of charity health system,community"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16ff\"", "article_summary": "The DePaul Center, which houses numerous specialty physicians\u2019 offices and an Urgent Care Center that opened in 2010, is also for sale.\nThe foundation was instrumental in the establishment of the DePaul Urgent Care Center in 2010.\nThe DePaul Urgent Care Center opened in 2010, and private physicians have almost completely filled the remaining offices at the Morgan Hill campus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned about any potential ownership changes that could have a potential reduction of services.\u201dCounty health services reach about 250,000 residents annually, Santiago said.\n\u201cSouth County is one of the most difficult challenges."}
