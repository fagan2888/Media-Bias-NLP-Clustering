They passed a resolution that directs city administrator Steve Powers and city attorney Stephen Postema to gather information to help the city council determine whether to purchase the 16.7-acre Edwards Brothers Malloy property on South State Street.\n\nThe direction came after the city council met in a closed session for about half an hour. Councilmembers emerged to craft and then pass the resolution. It gives direction to explore options to make the purchase financially feasible. That means finding a way to finance a $12.8 million deal. The sale of the Edwards Brothers property on South State Street is currently pending to the University of Michigan for $12.8 million, in an agreement that was announced in a Nov. 27, 2013 press release. The business \u2013 a fourth-generation Ann Arbor publishing and printing firm \u2013 had signaled its intent to put the property on the market in late July.\n\nThe topic of the possible land acquisition ties in to an upcoming Jan. 13 city council work session about economic development.\n\nAt the start of the Jan. 6 meeting, the council got an update from three key staff members about the city\u2019s response to the snowstorm that had hit the entire Midwest over the weekend.\n\nFrom public services area administrator Craig Hupy they heard an update on snowplowing, which was continuing during the meeting. From police chief John Seto, they heard an update on the police department\u2019s support for relocating residents of a housing complex after a water pipe burst. And from Mary Jo Callan, Washtenaw County\u2019s director of the office of community and economic development, they heard an update on efforts to address the needs of the homeless population during the freezing weather.\n\nConcern for how the homeless were faring was the topic of eight out of nine speakers who signed up for public commentary reserved time.\n\nIn its regular business agenda, the council dispatched two items leftover from its last meeting of 2013. One of those items was the official termination of a four-year-old memorandum of understanding with the University of Michigan for construction of the Fuller Road Station project. That item was voted through with little controversy, although mayor John Hieftje compared it to digging someone up who died a couple of years ago and re-burying them.\n\nFuller Road Station was a planned joint city/University of Michigan parking structure, bus depot and possible train station located at the city\u2019s Fuller Park near the UM medical campus. The council had approved the MOU on Fuller Road Station at its Nov. 5, 2009 meeting on a unanimous vote. However, a withdrawal of UM from the project, which took place under terms of the MOU, was announced on Feb. 10, 2012.\n\nThe other item delayed from last year was a resolution assigning a specific cost to the removal of on-street metered parking spaces, in connection with future developments: $45,000 per space. That amount was based on the cost of constructing a new parking space in a structure. After the policy was amended during the Jan. 6 meeting, it included a requirement that lost revenue also be compensated, based on projections of revenue for the space for the next 10 years. An average parking meter in the system generates $2,000 in annual income.\n\nApart from those previously delayed items, the rest of the council\u2019s agenda was mainly filled with future development.\n\nAccounting for two of the council\u2019s Jan. 6 voting items was Traverwood Apartments \u2013 a First Martin development on the city\u2019s north side. The site is located on the west side of Traverwood Drive, north of Plymouth Road. The council gave final approval of some rezoning necessary for the complex of 16 two-story buildings. And on a separate vote, the council gave site plan approval and a wetland use permit associated with the apartment complex.\n\nThe council also approved the upward expansion of the Montgomery Ward building on South Fourth Avenue in downtown Ann Arbor. The estimated $3.8 million project will expand the existing 17,273-square-foot building \u2013 a former Montgomery Ward\u2019s department store \u2013 to 38,373 square feet, with housing on the second through fifth floors.\n\nAnd finally, the council approved the site plan and development agreement for two restaurants at Briarwood Mall. The restaurants \u2013 one at 6,470 square feet, the other at 7,068 square feet \u2013 will be constructed on the east side of the Macy\u2019s building. The restaurants would be operated by two chains: P.F. Chang\u2019s and Bravo! Cucina Italiana.\n\nAs part of the consent agenda, the council approved agreements with Sprint for placing antennas at four facilities: the Plymouth Road water tower, the Manchester Road water tower, the Ann-Ashley parking structure, and the water treatment plant on Sunset Road. The contracts are being revised upwards to $45,000 a year at each location, with 4% annual escalators.\n\nThe council also approved appointments to the Ann Arbor Summer Festival board of directors.\n\nMembers of a pedestrian safety task force, established late last year, were also nominated at the meeting. A confirmation vote will come at the council\u2019s meeting on Jan. 21. Related at least indirectly to that, city administrator Steve Powers has provided the council with the first part of his response to the council\u2019s direction in connection with the city\u2019s updated non-motorized transportation plan.\n\nEdwards Brothers Property\n\nBy way of background, the sale of the Edwards Brothers Malloy on South State Street is currently pending to the University of Michigan for $12.8 million, in a deal that was announced in a Nov. 27, 2013 press release.\n\nThe business \u2013 a fourth-generation Ann Arbor publishing and printing firm \u2013 had signaled its intent to put the property on the market in late July.\n\nBut a right of first refusal on the property is held by the city of Ann Arbor as a condition of a tax abatement granted by the city council almost three years ago, on Jan. 18, 2011. Purchase by the university would remove the property from the tax rolls. Washtenaw County records show the taxable value of the property at just over $3 million.\n\nAccording to the tax abatement agreement, the event triggering the city\u2019s 60-day right-of-first-refusal window is a formal notification to the city by Edwards Brothers.\n\nEdwards Brothers Property: Council Deliberations\n\nAt the end of the meeting, the council voted to go into a closed session for discussion of land acquisition and written attorney-client communication. Those are both allowable exceptions to Michigan\u2019s Open Meetings Act.\n\nWhen councilmembers emerged from the closed session after about a half hour, they voted to go back into open session, and then immediately recessed the meeting so that the verbiage of the resolution could be crafted. [.pdf of amended Edwards Brothers resolution on Jan. 6, 2014]\n\nThe resolution directed Ann Arbor city administrator Steve Powers and city attorney Stephen Postema to gather information to help the city council determine whether to purchase the 16.7-acre property on South State Street. The resolution provides direction to explore options to make the purchase financially feasible. That means finding a way to finance a $12.8 million deal.\n\nSome brief back-and-forth resulted in the addition of a deadline for assembling the information: Jan. 30, 2014. Last year there had been some disagreement about when the clock had started ticking on the 60-business-day window for the city to exercise its right of first refusal. In response to an emailed query after the meeting, city administrator Steve Powers stated:\n\nThe City is operating on a timeline to provide notice to Edwards Brothers prior to February 25, 2014. This calculation is made from Nov. 27th, 2013.\n\nOn returning from recess about 15 minutes later, the council reopened the agenda to add the resolution on the Edwards Brothers property.\n\nMayor John Hieftje recited a standard explanation of the city\u2019s interest in preserving the city\u2019s tax base. He called the acquisition of the old Pfizer property and the property along South Division where the Blimpy Burger\u2019s previously stood part of a pattern that the University of Michigan has displayed.\n\nJane Lumm (Ward 2) said she was glad additional information was being gathered so the council could decide whether to exercise its right of first refusal. She said it would be invaluable to have that information so that the council can make its decision. Staff would be looking at the zoning questions, she said, which will help to inform the council\u2019s decision. The site, at 16.7 acres, is the largest remaining such parcel in the city, she said.\n\nChristopher Taylor (Ward 3) echoed Hieftje and Lumm. The University of Michigan\u2019s acquisition of property is a long-term challenge the city faces, he said.\n\nOutcome: The council unanimously approved the resolution directing the city administrator and city attorney to gather information on exercising the city\u2019s right of first refusal on the Edwards Brothers property.\n\nSnowstorm\n\nAt the start of the meeting, much of the city administrator\u2019s communications and the public commentary dealt with the snowstorm that began Jan. 4, which ultimately dropped 10.4 inches of snow on the city and subsequently pushed temperatures to -14 F.\n\nSnowstorm: City\u2019s Response\n\nCity administrator Steve Powers introduced Craig Hupy, public services area administrator, to give an update on the city\u2019s snow removal response during and after the recent snowstorm.\n\nThe official tally for snowfall was 10.4 inches. Hupy described how the city had been using 12-hour shifts since New Year\u2019s Eve, and was starting its seventh day of continuous plowing. Hupy said the colder weather was starting to affect the equipment and they were experiencing some breakdowns. He also described how the ridge that the plows were leaving behind on their first pass as the temperatures dropped was pretty stiff, which meant that sometimes motorists who tried to drive through it were getting hung up on that ridge. And that delayed the ability of the plows to make a second pass, he said.\n\nTwenty-four snowplows were working on the local streets right then, and four plows were working major streets to keep drifts back, he said. Hupy also gave a summary of the mileage driven by the city\u2019s snowplows.\n\nBased on data provided to The Chronicle before the meeting, from midnight Sunday through around 1 p.m. Monday, Ann Arbor city snowplows logged 7,641 vehicle miles. Eleven of the city\u2019s fleet logged at least 300 miles during that period. Top mileage for any plow, logged by vehicle number 4551, was 483.9 miles. [.jpg of snowplow mileage chart]\n\nNext to be introduced was Mary Jo Callan, Washtenaw County\u2019s director of the office of community and economic development. Her email message to councilmembers from earlier in the day had by that time been attached to the council\u2019s online agenda. [Callan's Jan. 6, 2014 email] She gave the council a status update. That included reading aloud a portion of her written update:\n\nAll community shelters are open, including: the Delonis Center, IHN/Alpha House, Salvation Army\u2019s Staples Center, and Ozone House. Housing Access is also open, and able to connect those in need with shelter options.\n\nCallan said the Delonis Center had opened its daytime warming center, and 25 people were using it. The warming center has a capacity of 200, she said. No one had been turned out into the cold up to that point, she said. The restriction on intoxication in order to gain admittance to the warming center had been loosened, she noted. If someone arrives who is intoxicated to the point of being dangerous or severely disruptive to other guests, they are provided transportation to the Home of New Vision\u2019s Engagement Center.\n\nCallan continued by describing how known campsites had been visited by PORT (the county\u2019s project outreach team). The soundness of tent structures was assessed. Various materials were distributed, she said. The work by PORT had begun on Friday before the storm in anticipation of the storm, she said, and that outreach had continued. Callan reported that 15 people had been put into hotels, extended at least until Friday, Jan. 10.\n\nCallan described a number of warm places, not necessarily warming centers, that were accessible in the urban core area from Ann Arbor to Ypsilanti and in between. As examples, Callan listed off the Delonis Center, Ann Arbor city hall, all Ann Arbor District Library locations, the Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority, Homeward Bound, University of Michigan Medical Center, and IHN Alpha House.\n\nCallan then read aloud a statement from St. Joe\u2019s, which has space for 30 people. St. Joe\u2019s is looking to coordinate with the county and city on this. The county\u2019s community support and treatment services (CSTS) and Alpha House are coordinating to staff that possible St. Joe\u2019s facility, she said, if a decision is made to use it. That decision would be made later that night, she added.\n\nMayor John Hieftje got clarification from Callan on the situation with the daytime warming center at Delonis \u2013 a capacity of 200, with about 25 people making use of it.\n\nJack Eaton (Ward 4) asked a question about how much money this is costing all the organizations. He wanted information about how much it is costing so that the city could understand what it might do to help.\n\nResponding to a question from Margie Teall (Ward 4), Callan thanked the council for its recent support of affordable housing. She mentioned the plan that the Ann Arbor housing commission (AAHC) has for Miller Manor to convert it to a front-desk staffed facility. She said the world had changed a lot since the 2007 needs assessment was done. So she\u2019d be providing fresh information soon about what the current needs actually are.\n\nChuck Warpehoski (Ward 5) said he was glad that the Delonis Center had loosened its restriction on intoxication. He inquired about those people who have been prohibited from accessing the Delonis Center due to behavioral problems. Callan said that the 15 people that PORT has responded to were in that category.\n\nSumi Kailasapathy (Ward 1) said that the collection of organizations that have stepped forward seemed ad hoc. She wanted to know if it could be better publicized and systematized. Yes, said Callan. There is a plan in place, but it could be better. In some cases, she said, staff for some facilities couldn\u2019t get into work due to the snow.\n\nPolice chief John Seto was then invited to the podium to report out. He said there had been no staff shortages, and the AAPD is \u201cresponse capable.\u201d He said that the department had not seen increased calls for service. On Saturday, Jan. 4, there had been a water pipe rupture at a large student apartment complex, he said, and the city\u2019s emergency manager Rick Norman had worked with the University of Michigan\u2019s office of the dean of students to place students from that building in temporary housing.\n\nCity\u2019s Response to Snowstorm: Public Commentary\n\nDuring public commentary on a different topic at the start of the meeting, saying that she wanted to start on a positive note, Kathy Griswold reported that her street had been plowed early Monday morning and that when she drove around town, she observed the streets were well-plowed, even the mid-block crosswalks.\n\nTracy Williams introduced himself as a homeless resident. People are in trouble, he said, and although we can keep talking, we need to be doing. He suggested 721 N. Main as a possible warming shelter. The city\u2019s plan to demolish the building and turn it into a park would prevent that, he noted. Williams said that instead of turning it into a park, the city should turn it into a cemetery \u2013 because that way, the city\u2019s homeless might finally find a place to rest there.\n\nRyan Sample commended the Delonis Center for operating beyond its capacity. He urged the city to open the doors to the 721 N. Main building for use as a warming center.\n\nTate Williams said that the existing social services network is overtasked and underfunded. It leaves many people unable to receive the help they need to survive, he said. He asked for the city to provide a way for citizens to help in an organized way \u2013 including opening their homes to the homeless.\n\nSheri Wander told the council she lives on White Street. She apologized if her remarks came off as emotional. She\u2019d spent the last several days delivering propane tanks to those who are living in tents. She said she was \u201cin awe\u201d of PORT as they raced around to put some people in hotel rooms. She was proud of what the city had done, but it shouldn\u2019t be done at the last minute, she said. She hears over and over that the city has the infrastructure and the capacity to take care of people. But she didn\u2019t think there\u2019s enough sanctioned capacity to take care of people. \u201cI know the city can do better,\u201d she said. Wander wanted the city to look at 721 N. Main, even though that facility isn\u2019t perfect, she said. She quoted G.K. Chesterton: \u201cAnything worth doing is worth doing badly.\u201d\n\nGreg Pratt thanked all the previous speakers by name. He also thanked Mary Jo Callan. He appreciated all the support. But he offered an alternative pledge of allegiance: \u201cI pledge allegiance to the people of the city of Ann Arbor and to the principle for which we all stand: warming centers open at 45 F degrees, with room for people who blow above .10.\u201d The phrase \u201cfor which we all stand\u201d was a cue for the rest of the audience in attendance advocating for the homeless community to stand up, which they did. Pratt concluded his remarks by raising his fist: \u201cPower to the people!\u201d\n\nOdile Hugonot-Haber read aloud Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which includes the right to housing. She said that city officials seemed to want to say that everything is just fine. She allowed that what the city had done was good, but called for more to be done. The timer ending her speaking time then went off prematurely, and her remarks concluded after about a minute and a half, instead of three minutes.\n\nAlan Haber thanked Odile for reading aloud from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Ann Arbor should adopt warmth as a fundamental human right, he said. Warmth is not just temperature, he noted. Statistics might show that everyone is taken care of, he said, but from what he\u2019s heard and seen, that\u2019s not so. The city needs a space that is managed by those who use it, he said. All of us should be more contributory. The homeless \u201cthem,\u201d he said, are seen as a problem. But they have creativity and skills. He called on the council to consider 721 N. Main as an option.\n\nCity Response to Snowstorm: Council Coda\n\nJack Eaton (Ward 4) noted that when Camp Take Notice was dispersed, the city had interfered with an attempt to create a self-governed community to deal with homelessness in the way that Haber described. Eaton ventured that the city might lease a city building to a group. His remarks drew applause.\n\nHow Much Is a Parking Space Worth?\n\nThe council considered a resolution that defines a policy setting the amount that a developer would need to pay, if a project causes an on-street metered parking space to be removed from the system.\n\nThe proposed amount in the original resolution was $45,000 per space. The money to be paid would be passed through to the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority. The payment goes to the Ann Arbor DDA because the DDA manages the public parking system under a contract with the city.\n\nThe resolution had been postponed for the second time at the council\u2019s Dec. 16, 2013 meeting, and that\u2019s why it appeared on the Jan. 6 agenda. The rationale for originally postponing the item on Dec. 2 \u2013 offered by Christopher Taylor (Ward 3), who sponsored the resolution \u2013 was that because it amounts to a fee, a public hearing should be held on the matter before the council voted.\n\nAfter the public hearing held at the council\u2019s Dec. 16 meeting, the council\u2019s deliberations focused on the question of the accounting procedures to be used by the DDA in tracking any money that might be paid under the policy.\n\nGiven that the rationale for the policy is that the money would be put toward the cost of constructing new parking spaces, councilmembers wanted to know how the money would be reserved for that purpose.\n\nIn this matter, the council was acting on a four-year-old recommendation approved by the Ann Arbor DDA in 2009:\n\nThus it is recommended that when developments lead to the removal of on-street parking meter spaces, a cost of $45,000/parking meter space (with annual CPI increases) be assessed and provided to the DDA to set aside in a special fund that will be used to construct future parking spaces or other means to meet the goals above. [.pdf of meeting minutes with complete text of March 4, 2009 DDA resolution]\n\nThe contract under which the DDA manages the public parking system for the city was revised to restructure the financial arrangement (which now pays the city 17% of the gross revenues), but also included a clause meant to prompt the city to act on the on-street space cost recommendation. From the May 2011 parking agreement:\n\nThe City shall work collaboratively with the DDA to develop and present for adoption by City Council a City policy regarding the permanent removal of on-street metered parking spaces. The purpose of this policy will be to identify whether a community benefit to the elimination of one or more metered parking spaces specific area(s) of the City exists, and the basis for such a determination. If no community benefit can be identified, it is understood and agreed by the parties that a replacement cost allocation methodology will need to be adopted concurrent with the approval of the City policy; which shall be used to make improvements to the public parking or transportation system.\n\nSubject to administrative approval by the city, the DDA has sole authority to determine the addition or removal of meters, loading zones, or other curbside parking uses.\n\nThe $45,000 figure is based on an average construction cost to build a new parking space in a structure, either above ground or below ground \u2013 as estimated in 2009. [For more background, see: \"Column: Ann Arbor's Monroe (Street) Doctrine.\"]\n\nTaylor, the resolution\u2019s sponsor, participated in meetings during the fall of 2013 of a joint council and DDA board committee that negotiated a resolution to the question about how the DDA\u2019s TIF (tax increment finance) revenue is regulated. In that context, Taylor had argued adamantly that any cap on the DDA\u2019s TIF should be escalated by a construction industry CPI, or roughly 5%. Taylor\u2019s reasoning was that the DDA\u2019s mission is to undertake capital projects and therefore should have revenue that escalates in accordance with increases in the costs to undertake capital projects.\n\nBased on Taylor\u2019s reasoning on the TIF question, and the explicit 2009 recommendation by the DDA to increase the estimated $45,000 figure in that year by an inflationary index, the recommended amount now, four years later, would be closer to $55,000, assuming a 5% figure for construction cost inflation. The city\u2019s contribution in lieu (CIL) parking program allows a developer (as one option) to satisfy an on-site parking space requirement by paying $55,000. (The other option is to enter into a 15-year agreement to purchase monthly parking permits at a 20% premium.)\n\nThe actual cost of building an underground space in the recently completed (2012) underground Library Lane parking structure could be calculated by taking the actual costs and dividing by 738 \u2013 the number of spaces in the structure. Based on a recent memo from executive director Susan Pollay to city administrator Steve Powers, about 30% or $15 million of the cost of the project was spent on items \u201cunneeded by the parking structure.\u201d That included elements like oversized foundations to support future development, an extra-large transformer, a new alley between Library Lane and S. Fifth Avenue, new water mains, easements for a fire hydrant and pedestrian improvements.\n\nThe actual amount spent on the Library Lane structure, according to DDA records produced under a Freedom of Information Act request from The Chronicle, was $54,855,780.07, or about $1.5 million under the project\u2019s $56.4 million budget. Adjusting for those elements not needed for the parking structure yields a per-space cost of about $52,000. [(54,855,780.07*.70)/738] [.pdf of Nov. 22, 2013 memo from Pollay to Powers][.pdf of budget versus actual expenses for the 738-space Library Lane structure]\n\nBy way of additional background, the Ann Arbor DDA\u2019s most recent financial records show that last year, on-street parking spaces generated $2,000 in gross revenue per space or $1,347 in net income per space annually. The contract with the city under which the DDA operates the public parking system stipulates that the city receives 17% of the gross parking revenues. So the city\u2019s revenue associated with an on-street parking space corresponds to $340 annually.\n\nBased on information provided to the council by the DDA, the majority of on-street spaces that have been removed from the system since 2006 can be attributed to University of Michigan projects.\n\nHow Much Is a Parking Structure Worth: Council Deliberations\n\nChristopher Taylor (Ward 3) described the resolution, noting that it creates a policy that the contract between the city and the DDA describes.\n\nSally Petersen (Ward 2) wanted to amend the resolution. She said that the true cost of a metered parking space should include the net present value estimate for the revenue associated with a parking space. She\u2019d chosen a 10-year projection provided by the staff. She and Taylor had had some back-and-forth on the amendment, she reported. Her amendment ensured that the city would get 17% of the revenue from that portion of the payment that compensates for lost revenue.\n\nSumi Kailasapathy (Ward 1) wanted to amend the resolution so that the money that goes to the DDA is recorded as restricted funds for capital projects in the parking system.\n\nTaylor responded, saying that they were both excellent ideas, which he was happy to support. The changes were considered \u201cfriendly.\u201d [At its Dec. 18, 2013 meeting, the DDA operations committee discussed the matter and concluded that the money paid under the meter-removal policy would be shown as a restricted amount in the DDA\u2019s parking maintenance fund.]\n\nTaylor also offered an amendment of his own: swapping out the phrase \u201con the parcels\u201d for \u201cin the right of way.\u201d That amendment was accepted as \u201cfriendly\u201d as well.\n\nJane Lumm (Ward 2) said the changes were an improvement. She thanked staff. She supported the resolution. Lumm reviewed how many meters had been removed in the past. She thought it was important to adopt a requirement for reimbursement for lost revenue, because the amounts that accumulate can be substantial.\n\nBy way of more detailed background, the policy applies in part only if the DDA were to determine that the removal of a parking space is not a community benefit, but rather is localized to a particular development. Subsequent council deliberations focused on a part of the policy that provides for a review of the decision by the city administrator: \u201cThe City Administrator shall review the DDA\u2019s determination of whether space removal would constitute a community benefit, and is authorized to reverse such determination if, in the City Administrator\u2019s reasonable discretion, the DDA has incorrectly evaluated the existence of \u2018community benefit.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the Jan. 6 meeting, Jack Eaton (Ward 4) raised the question about the authorization of the city administrator to review the DDA decision. Given that the city administrator now sits on the DDA board, Eaton wanted to substitute \u201ccity council\u201d as the party responsible for the review.\n\nMargie Teall (Ward 4) said she understood the conflict that was being pointed out. But she didn\u2019t think the council should review the decision. She felt it could be handled within the administration. Stephen Kunselman (Ward 3) said he didn\u2019t have a problem with the city administrator having the authority to override the DDA as a whole.\n\nCity administrator Steve Powers stated that he felt he could balance the responsibility, noting that his ultimate accountability is to the city council.\n\nEaton noted that he was not questioning the ability of Powers to balance the decision, but thought it was bad public policy to have someone sitting on a board who then reviews the decisions of that same board.\n\nMayor John Hieftje responded by saying that the DDA statute requires conflict in some ways. Petersen noted that the DDA has not drafted a policy for evaluating public benefit.\n\nKailasapathy characterized the issue as one of checks and balances, and not the integrity of Powers. We\u2019re human beings and we\u2019re fallible, she said. Having the same person implementing the policy and reviewing it isn\u2019t good policy, she said.\n\nKunselman indicated agreement that it might not be good policy, but noted that government is messy. If the city council should review the decision, as Eaton was suggesting, he wondered if the council shouldn\u2019t just take back the whole parking system. He didn\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to avoid the kind of conflict that Eaton had identified. The language is fine the way it is, Kunselman said.\n\nLumm said she appreciated Kunselman\u2019s remarks. Having someone else besides Powers in the administration review the decision would still mean that person would be reporting to Powers, she noted. And to drag the city council into it, she said, wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. She ventured that the council might want to weigh in on the drafting of the public benefit policy.\n\nEaton said it\u2019s purely a process question, and it\u2019s not a desire for the city council to take over that role \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t know who else would take that role.\n\nPetersen said that it\u2019d been a good discussion and it showed that the council needs training on what is and isn\u2019t a conflict of interest. [Petersen was alluding to a resolution that she'd put forward, which the council passed at its Nov. 18, 2013 meeting, calling for the development of an ethics education program.] She compared it to having a separate person collect the money and count the money. She was willing to let the issue go forward with the city administrator being the reviewer.\n\nOutcome on Eaton\u2019s amendment: Only Kailasapathy and Eaton vote for the amendment, so it failed.\n\nOutcome on main resolution: The council voted unanimously to approve the policy, as amended, for charging a fee of $45,000 for removal of an on-street parking space, plus payment of 10-years worth of projected revenues generated by the space.\n\nKilling Fuller Road Station MOU\n\nThe council considered a resolution that terminates a four-year-old memorandum of understanding between the city of Ann Arbor and the University of Michigan on Fuller Road Station.\n\nFuller Road Station was a planned joint city/UM parking structure, bus depot and possible train station located at the city\u2019s Fuller Park near the UM medical campus. The council had approved the MOU on the Fuller Road Station project at its Nov. 5, 2009 meeting on a unanimous vote. [.pdf of Nov. 5, 2009 MOU text as approved by the city council] However, a withdrawal of UM from the project, which took place under terms of the MOU, was announced on Feb. 10, 2012. So it\u2019s been clear for nearly two years that the MOU was a dead letter.\n\nThe item had been postponed from the council\u2019s Dec. 16, 2013 meeting. Stephen Kunselman (Ward 3) sponsored that Dec. 16 resolution. The idea to terminate the MOU has its origins in election campaign rhetoric. He had stated at a June 8, 2013 Democratic primary candidate forum that he intended to bring forth such a resolution to \u201ckill\u201d the Fuller Road Station project. From The Chronicle\u2019s report of that forum:\n\nKunselman also stated that he would be proposing that the city council rescind its memorandum of understanding with the University of Michigan to build a parking structure as part of the Fuller Road Station project. Although UM has withdrawn from participation in that project under the MOU, Kunselman said he wanted to \u201ckill it.\u201d That way, he said, the conversation could turn away from using the designated parkland at the Fuller Road Station site as a new train station, and could instead be focused on the site across the tracks from the existing Amtrak station.\n\nThe city continues to pursue the possibility of a newly built or reconstructed train station, but not necessarily with the University of Michigan\u2019s participation, and without a pre-determined preferred alternative for the site of a new station. At its Oct. 21, 2013 meeting, the council approved a contract with URS Corp. Inc. to carry out an environmental review of a project called the Ann Arbor Station. That review should yield the determination of a locally-preferred alternative for a site.\n\nAt the Dec. 16 meeting, Kunselman led off deliberations by saying he wanted to postpone the resolution. He indicated that he thought he\u2019d managed to add the item to the agenda on the Friday before the Monday meeting, but it turned out he had not done so. In light of the council\u2019s discussion at their Dec. 9 budget planning session \u2013 when councilmembers had said they\u2019d strive to avoid adding resolutions at the last minute \u2013 Kunselman said he wanted it postponed.\n\nOn Dec. 16, mayor John Hieftje and Sabra Briere (Ward 1) both indicated they\u2019d vote for the resolution \u2013 but also said they didn\u2019t think the resolution was necessary. They indicated they were willing to vote for the resolution without postponing. Kunselman nevertheless wanted to postpone it, because it was added late to the agenda. That\u2019s why it appeared on the Jan. 6 agenda.\n\nKilling Fuller Road MOU: Public Commentary\n\nDuring public commentary at the start of the meeting, Kathy Griswold said she supported the termination of the Fuller Road Station memorandum of understanding. She called on the council to pay attention to process.\n\nRoad Station MOU: Council Deliberations\n\nAt the Jan. 6 meeting, Kunselman introduced the resolution. He called it wrapping up loose ends on a document that doesn\u2019t have an expiration date. Hieftje said it\u2019s like digging someone up who died a couple of years ago and re-burying them, but he was not opposed to that.\n\nOutcome: The council voted to terminate the Fuller Road Station MOU.\n\nTraverwood Apartments\n\nThe council considered two questions related to a First Martin Corp. project, which would construct a residential complex on the city\u2019s north side. The project \u2013 located on the west side of Traverwood Drive, north of Plymouth Road \u2013 is called Traverwood Apartments.\n\nThe project, estimated to cost $30 million, would include 16 two-story buildings for a total of 216 one- and two-bedroom units \u2013 or 280 total bedrooms. Eight of the buildings would each have 15 units and 11 single-car garages. An additional eight buildings would each have 12 units and 8 single-car garages.\n\nTwo separate items were on the council\u2019s agenda \u2013 one for the rezoning required for the project, and the other for the site plan and wetland use permit.\n\nAt the council\u2019s Dec. 2, 2013 meeting, the initial approval of the required rezoning was given. Also approved at that meeting was a donation of 2.2 acres, just north of the project site \u2013 by Bill Martin, founder of First Martin Corp., to the city. The donated acreage is next to the Stapp Nature Area and the Leslie Park golf course.\n\nThe city\u2019s planning commission recommended approval of the site plan and the required rezoning at its Nov. 6, 2013 meeting. The site is made up of two parcels: a nearly 16-acre lot that\u2019s zoned R4D (multi-family residential), and an adjacent 3.88-acre lot to the south that\u2019s currently zoned ORL (office, research and light industrial). It\u2019s the smaller lot that needed to be rezoned R4D.\n\nTraverwood Apartments: Public Hearing\n\nDuring the public hearing on the rezoning aspect of the proposal, Mike Martin of First Martin told the council that the project team was in attendance and available to answer questions.\n\nThomas Partridge gave general commentary critical of the rezoning proposal. He wanted the proposal postponed until there is a requirement in every such proposal that ensures the turnaround of egregious past discrimination.\n\nDuring the public hearing on the Traverwood Apartments site plan, Partridge followed up on his earlier remarks, by saying that it amounts to egregious discrimination to not take up the question of whether a site was used for the Underground Railroad, before approving the site plan.\n\nPeggy Rabhi posed questions about the wetland use permit. She said it looked like the project will preserve the \u201clake\u201d and the largest pond on the south end of the property. The south pond is home to frogs, newts and salamanders, she said. Those species pass the winter not in the pond, but rather adjacent to the pond, she said. She hoped that First Martin would be willing to work with the city\u2019s natural area preservation staff on this issue.\n\nStacie Printon told the council she\u2019s a park steward for the park adjacent to the property. She expressed some concerns and made some suggestions. The southwest portion of the plan abuts Leslie Park golf course and Leslie Woods, so she had concerns about the impact on those woods. There will be some cutting into the slopes, she said. There are three trees worthy of preservation, numbered 2582, 2583, and 2584. Buildings #5 and #6 come very close to the corner, she said. She suggested combining the buildings into a single L-shaped building that might eliminate the need for a retaining wall.\n\nTraverwood Apartments: Council Deliberations\n\nJane Lumm (Ward 2) led things off, saying that she\u2019d seen the development team having a conversation with those who spoke during the public hearing.\n\nShe asked for some response to the concerns described during the public commentary. Earl Ophoff of Midwestern Consulting responded by offering a description of the retaining walls \u2013 which are tiered so that the impact on the critical root zones of nearby trees is minimized.\n\nThe location of the building that had been mentioned was predicated on the 22-foot deep sanitary sewer, he said, which had public easement associated with it. So it couldn\u2019t be moved or twisted as had been suggested. The entire hedgerow along the south and the west had been preserved, he noted.\n\nOphoff described how the timing of the construction was key to various considerations. One was the interest in protecting the Indiana bat habitat at the north end of the site where there are shagbark hickories. To the extent that trees needed to be removed, he said, they wanted to do that when any bats that might live there during the warmer months were not there. So that tree removal needed to begin as soon as possible, now during the winter months, he explained.\n\nOphoff then described how the newts and salamanders will be finishing their mating in the spring around March and May before the project starts work. Right now they\u2019re hibernating in the sedimentation basin in the mud.\n\nJack Eaton (Ward 4) asked about a pipe to be installed in connection with the wetland. Wetland #2 has three parts, Ophoff explained \u2013 a natural pond, a ditch, and a detention basin. The ditch will be enclosed in a pipe, so that driveway connections can be established. That 1,800 square feet is mitigated with about 2,700 square feet. Eaton was concerned that the pipe was undersized \u2013 because it could only handle a 10-year storm. Ophoff said that such pipes are not generally designed to accommodate a 100-year rain. If there were a 100-year rain, there would be standing water in a lot of places, he said.\n\nResponding to Eaton\u2019s concern, Ophoff noted that the ditch is not a creek, and normally there\u2019s no water flow there.\n\nOutcome: The council voted to approve the site plan and wetland use permit for the Traverwood Apartments project. In a separate vote, taken before the site plan and wetland use permit vote, the council approved without discussion the required rezoning.\n\nMontgomery Ward Building\n\nThe council considered the site plan for a four-story addition to the existing two-story building at 210-216 S. Fourth Ave., between East Liberty and East Washington in downtown Ann Arbor. The plan calls for creating 32 new housing units, including four studios, 14 one-bedroom, and 14 two-bedroom units. Planning commissioners recommended approval of the project\u2019s site plan at their Nov. 19, 2013 meeting.\n\nThe estimated $3.8 million project would expand the existing 17,273-square-foot building \u2013 a former Montgomery Ward\u2019s department store \u2013 to 38,373 square feet, with housing on the second through fifth floors. The ground floor would remain commercial space. Current tenants include Salon Vertigo and Bandito\u2019s Mexican Restaurant. The top floor will include a stair/elevator lobby, restroom, wet bar, and access to several roof decks. Part of the fifth-floor roof will be covered in vegetation as a green roof.\n\nBecause the building is located in a historic district, it required a certificate of appropriateness from the city\u2019s historic district commission. The HDC granted that certificate at its Sept. 12, 2013 meeting.\n\nThe site is zoned D1, which allows for the highest level of density. According to a staff memo, eight footing drain disconnects will be required.\n\nAccording to a report from the July 10, 2013 citizen participation meeting, the units will be marketed to \u201canyone who wants to live downtown.\u201d If approvals are received, construction is expected to begin next summer. The project\u2019s architect is Brad Moore.\n\nMoore is also the architect for an expansion project on the adjacent property \u2013 a three-floor addition to the Running Fit building at East Liberty and South Fourth, which will create six residential units. That project received a recommendation of approval from planning commissioners at their Oct. 15, 2013 meeting and was subsequently approved by the city council on Dec. 2, 2013.\n\nDuring the public hearing, architect Brad Moore described the project as next to the Running Fit building, which the council had recently approved. He described the basic highlights of the project. Also during the public hearing Thomas Partridge said the attempt to rehabilitate the property is admirable. But he\u2019d not heard the two words he thought were essential: \u201cAffordable housing.\u201d\n\nOutcome: The council voted without discussion to approve the site plan for the old Montgomery Ward building.\n\nBriarwood Mall Restaurant Expansions\n\nThe council considered the site plan for construction of two freestanding restaurants at Briarwood Mall.\n\nThe proposal calls for building two new restaurants \u2013 one at 6,470 square feet, the other at 7,068 square feet \u2013 on the east side of the Macy\u2019s building at Briarwood Mall, 700 Briarwood Circle. The restaurants would be two chains: P.F. Chang\u2019s and Bravo! Cucina Italiana.\n\nThe parking lot north and east of the new restaurants would be reconfigured, reducing the total amount of parking by 188 spaces. The estimated cost of the project is $1,577,094. The site is located in Ward 4.\n\nAnn Arbor planning commissioners recommended approval of the site plan and development agreement in action at their Nov. 19, 2013 meeting. The project was originally considered at the commission\u2019s Oct. 15, 2013 meeting, but postponed because of outstanding issues.\n\nOriginally, the planning staff had indicated that the project would require rezoning a portion of the parking lot from P (parking) to C2B (business service. However, according to a memo accompanying the commission\u2019s Nov. 19 meeting packet, planning staff subsequently determined that because the original 1973 Briarwood Mall zoning anticipated the expansion of Hudson\u2019s (now Macy\u2019s ) to the east, no rezoning was needed.\n\nDuring the council\u2019s Jan. 6 public hearing on the Briarwood Mall site plan, Thomas Partridge told the council he was a recent candidate for the city council as well as for the Michigan state house and senate. He\u2019d attended meetings of several different public bodies over the last decade. He reiterated his standard call for a requirement that all site plans include provisions for access to public transportation and affordable housing.\n\nOutcome: The council voted without discussion to approve the Briarwood Mall restaurant expansion site plan.\n\nCellular Antenna Licensing\n\nAs a part of its consent agenda, the council considered two items involving cellular phone antennas mounted on city facilities. By council rule, contracts for less than $100,000 can be placed on the consent agenda.\n\nOne of the consent agenda items related to the specific contracts with Sprint for placing antennas at four facilities: the Plymouth Road water tower, the Manchester Road water tower, the Ann-Ashley parking structure, and the water treatment plant on Sunset Road. The contracts are being revised upwards to $45,000 a year at each location with 4% annual escalators. The previous agreements ranged from $25,920 to $39,283, according to the staff memo accompanying the resolution.\n\nTotal revenue to the city for cell antennas budgeted for FY 2014 is $520,000, all of which goes towards debt service on the Justice Center.\n\nThe staff memo also indicated that Sprint has been given initial administrative approval to undertake replacement of some of its equipment related to its 4G deployment.\n\nThe other consent agenda item related to cellular phone antennas made it unnecessary in the future for items like the agreements with Sprint to come before the city council for approval. Instead, the city administrator was given the power to approve licensing agreements with cellular service providers \u2013 even though they exceed the $25,000 threshold for council approval set forth in a city-charter required ordinance.\n\nOutcome: The council approved the consent agenda, including the cellular antenna items.\n\nAnn Arbor Summer Festival Board\n\nThe council considered a resolution appointing directors to the board of the nonprofit Ann Arbor Summer Festival. It reflected a certain amount of bureaucratic housecleaning, as all of the appointments were retroactive, some of them dramatically so:\n\nOct. 1, 2011 to Sept. 30, 2014 Paul Cousins (trustee, Dexter Village)\n\nOct. 1, 2011 to Sept. 30, 2014 Erica Fitzgerald (attorney with Barris, Sott, Denn & Driker)\n\nOct. 1, 2011 to Sept. 30, 2014 Linda Girard (CEO, Pure Visibility)\n\nOct. 1, 2011 to Sept. 30, 2014 Kimberly Scott (attorney with Miller Canfield)\n\nOct. 1, 2011 to Sept. 30, 2014 Ellie Serras (community relations director, Main Street BIZ)\n\nOct. 1, 2011 to Sept. 30, 2014 Christie Wong Barrett (manufacturing council at U.S. Department of Commerce)\n\nOct. 1, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2015 Tim Freeth (head of industry, Google)\n\nOct. 1, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2015 Jerold Lax (attorney with Pear Sperling Eggan and Daniels)\n\nOct. 1, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2015 Kenneth Magee (former head of University of Michigan public safety)\n\nOct. 1, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2015 Kevin McDonald (city of Ann Arbor, assistant city attorney)\n\nOct. 1, 2013 to Sept. 30, 2016 Tom Crawford (city of Ann Arbor, chief financial officer)\n\nOct. 1, 2013 to Sept. 30, 2016 Mary Kerr (president, Ann Arbor Area Convention & Visitors Bureau)\n\nOct. 1, 2013 to Sept. 30, 2016 Dug Song (CEO of Duo Security, tech entrepreneur)\n\nMost of these members, however, do not appear to meet the membership criteria listed out in the description available on the city\u2019s online Legistar system, which reads:\n\nMembership/Committee Composition: Representatives from each of the following: Ann Arbor Street Art Fair, South University Merchants Association, State Street Area Art Fair, State Street Area Association, Michigan Guild of Artists and Artisans, Main Street Area Association, Washtenaw Non-Profits, Ann Arbor Transportation Authority, Ann Arbor Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, Ann Arbor City Council (2-1 each caucus), City and County Government Departments (4 votes total): Ann Arbor Building Dept., Ann Arbor Police Dept., Ann Arbor Fire Dept., Ann Arbor Solid Waste Dept., Ann Arbor Transportation Division, Ann Arbor Attorney\u2019s Office, Washtenaw County Health Dept., U of M (2 votes total): Community Relations, Public Safety, Michigan Union, Plant Operations, Parking Services.\n\nMayor John Hieftje, who sponsored the resolution, did not respond before the council meeting to an emailed Chronicle query about the issue, but spoke to The Chronicle after the meeting. He said it wasn\u2019t clear from what document the Legistar description originated, but that it would be removed from the online description.\n\nSome confusion surrounding these appointments is reflected in one of the resolved clauses of the resolution, which reads:\n\nRESOLVED, That the Mayor and City Council request that the Ann Arbor Summer Festival, Inc., clarify the designation process in their Bylaws and implement an annual designation process by August 1, 2014.\n\nThe Ann Arbor Summer Festival runs for about three weeks each year and includes indoor ticketed performances and free outdoor events at the Top of the Park. Revenues come from ticket sales, sponsorships and donations.\n\nHieftje told the council that the resolution had been prompted by a bylaws review of the Ann Arbor Summer Festival board. He then praised the Summer Festival for its work.\n\nOutcome: The council voted to approve the board appointments to the Ann Arbor Summer Festival.\n\nNominations to Pedestrian Safety Task Force\n\nNominations were made at the Jan. 6 meeting for the nine members of the pedestrian safety task force, which was established by the council at its Nov. 18, 2013 meeting. The nominations are: Vivienne Armentrout, Neal Elyakin, Linda Diane Feldt, Jim Rees, Anthony Pinnell, Sarah Pressprich Gryniewicz, Kenneth Clark, Scott Campbell, and Owen Jansson. The council will vote on their confirmations at its Jan. 21 meeting.\n\nRelated to that, the first part of the non-motorized transportation plan implementation strategy that the city administrator was directed by the city council to develop had also been released by the time of the Jan. 6 meeting. This was the part of the council\u2019s direction that dealt with improvement of traffic enforcement at and around crosswalks. [.pdf of crosswalk traffic enforcement plan implementation strategy]\n\nHighlights of that strategy include targeted enforcement that was to take place on Jan. 9 and Jan. 10 using council-authorized police overtime pay for that purpose. The police department has also developed an on\u00adline tool for reporting traffic complaints and concerns.\n\nCommunications and Comment\n\nEvery city council agenda contains multiple slots for city councilmembers and the city administrator to give updates or make announcements about important issues that are coming before the city council. And every meeting typically includes public commentary on subjects not necessarily on the agenda.\n\nComm/Comm: New Year\u2019s Events\n\nAt the end of the meeting, during council communications time, Margie Teall (Ward 4) thanked police chief John Seto and the staff for their work on the New Year\u2019s Eve celebration activities on Main Street, called The Puck Drops Here. She hoped it would be repeated.\n\nComm/Comm: Dream Nite Club\n\nCity attorney Stephen Postema reported to the council that the Michigan Court of Appeals had upheld the city\u2019s position in the revoking the Dream Nite Club\u2019s liquor license. Postema thanked the police department for its role in that.\n\nComm/Comm: Thomas Partridge\n\nDuring public commentary at the start of the meeting, Thomas Partridge called on the council to protect the most vulnerable. He criticized various \u201cright wing proposals.\u201d He wanted provisions in all site plan approvals requiring accessibility for public transportation and affordable housing.\n\nPartridge also addressed the council at the conclusion of the meeting during public commentary general time. He allowed that people might question why he attends council meetings calling on the council to abide by the law and the constitution. He called for reform and a turnaround of the council. He called again, as he has before, for the resignation of mayor John Hieftje and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder. He alleged that he\u2019s had property stolen and has been subject to threats of intimidation. Huge amounts of snow have been piled up around buildings that house handicapped people, he claimed.\n\nPresent: Jane Lumm, Margie Teall, Sumi Kailasapathy, Sally Petersen, Stephen Kunselman, Marcia Higgins Jack Eaton, John Hieftje, Christopher Taylor, Chuck Warpehoski.\n\nAbsent: Sabra Briere, Mike Anglin.\n\nNext council meeting: Jan. 21, 2014 at 7 p.m. in the council chambers at city hall, located at 301 E. Huron.
