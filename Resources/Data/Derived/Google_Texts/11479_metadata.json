It has allowed men and women from all over the world to submit to outrageous aesthetic standards dreamed up by Hollywood executives. Now, it has finally helped a 33-year-old man achieve his lifelong goal of looking exactly like Canadian pop wiz and embattled teen icon Justin Bieber.\n\nMeet Toby Sheldon \u2013\u2013 a Los Angeles, Calif. singer-songwriter who recently made headlines after blowing almost $100,000 on cosmetic procedures. In what could very well be one of the most severe midlife crises of all time, the relatively unknown artist has spent his life savings on multiple surgeries, Aquamid injections, and hair transplants in an effort to look just like his hero, Justin Bieber. Over the past five years, Sheldon has gradually transformed himself into an uncanny approximation of the 19-year-old star.\n\nIn an interview with the British tabloid Closer, the high-octane Belieber told reporters that he couldn\u2019t be happier with the results. \u201cI always had similar traits to Justin, like my bone structure and eye shape,\u201d he explained. \u201cI just wanted to enhance certain features to look more like him.\u201d\n\nThe metamorphosis began with a hair transplant and a series of Botox injections back in 2008. Sheldon\u2019s goal was to achieve the smooth and \u201cplumped-up\u201d skin of the then 14-year-old artiste. He later switched to Aquamid \u2013\u2013 an illegal, longer-lasting filler that he imports from Brazil.\n\nAs with most cases of extensive cosmetic surgery, Sheldon\u2019s aesthetic endeavors escalated very quickly. He drew first blood in 2012, when he underwent a controversial procedure known as \u201csmile surgery.\u201d A few months later, he had additional surgery on his eyelids. For Sheldon, the right smile was the most important part of the transformation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Justin\u2019s smile that gives him his youthful look,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo I had my upper lip lifted and my bottom lip plumped out.\u201d\n\nWhile Sheldon loves his new appearance, he acknowledges that it has come at a price \u2013\u2013 physically as well as financially. \u201cMy smile surgery took more than a month to recover from,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAfter my eyelid surgery, I couldn\u2019t open my eyes for a week.\u201d\n\nThat said, Sheldon believes his investment has paid off, as people now shower him with compliments on a daily basis. Speaking to Gawker, he said that some friends even call him \u201cToby Bieber.\u201d What more could a 33-year-old man ask for?\n\n[Photo via Imgur]", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "toby sheldon justin bieber, justin bieber plastic surgery, smile surgery, man surgery justin bieber", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Toby Sheldon has undergone multiple cosmetic procedures to look like Canadian pop star Justin Bieber.", "title": "33-Year-Old Man Spends $100,000 To Look Like Justin Bieber", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/toby-sheldon-33-year-old-la-songwriter-spends-100000-plastic-surgery-look-justin-bieber-260419", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/justin-bieber.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Toby Sheldon has undergone multiple cosmetic procedures to look like Canadian pop star Justin Bieber.", "title": "33-Year-Old Man Spends $100,000 To Look Like Justin Bieber", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/toby-sheldon-33-year-old-la-songwriter-spends-100000-plastic-surgery-look-justin-bieber-260419", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/justin-bieber.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/justin-bieber.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-10-20T20:27:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T20:32:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Toby Sheldon has undergone multiple cosmetic procedures to look like Canadian pop star Justin Bieber."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8588\"", "article_summary": "Meet Toby Sheldon \u2013\u2013 a Los Angeles, Calif. singer-songwriter who recently made headlines after blowing almost $100,000 on cosmetic procedures.\nIn an interview with the British tabloid Closer, the high-octane Belieber told reporters that he couldn\u2019t be happier with the results.\nHe drew first blood in 2012, when he underwent a controversial procedure known as \u201csmile surgery.\u201d A few months later, he had additional surgery on his eyelids.\nAs with most cases of extensive cosmetic surgery, Sheldon\u2019s aesthetic endeavors escalated very quickly.\n\u201cMy smile surgery took more than a month to recover from,\u201d he told reporters."}
