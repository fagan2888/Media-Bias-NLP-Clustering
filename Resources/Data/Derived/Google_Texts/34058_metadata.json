Kristoferb, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nTest results from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) show that in 2012, 12 percent of commercial airplanes in the United States \u2014 that\u2019s about one in every 10 planes \u2014 tested positive for coliform bacteria, which is usually an indicator of other sickness-inducing bacteria like E. coli.\n\nOr, in other words: \u201cThere\u2019s poop in the water if there\u2019s E. coli in the water, and that\u2019s not a good thing,\" Brenda Wiles, a lab manager certified to test drinking water aboard aircraft, told NBC 5.\n\nThe results were made public after Dallas\u2019 NBC 5 requested reports from the EPA through a Freedom of Information Act Request. Coliform, though not necessarily harmful on its own, normally indicates the presence of E. coli, which can cause abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea if ingested. The EPA put a major initiative in place to reduce the amount of bacteria in plane water after 15 percent of planes tested positive for coliform in 2004. But nine years later, it seems the problem persists.\n\n\u201cI would say that\u2019s still a high percentage,\u201d said Bill Honker, deputy director of the Water Quality Protection Division, EPA Region 6, in Dallas. \u201cI think there is more that needs to be done. So we\u2019re expecting to see further improvement by all the airlines in the country.\u201d\n\nA representative from the airline advocacy group, Airlines for America (AFA), told the Huffington Post that the results are not as bad as they seem because airlines are aware of the problem and making every effort to ensure that the drinking water is safe on planes.\n\n\"In very rare cases a water sample test will suggest that the water does not meet drinking water guidelines,\" the representative said. \"In those instances, the airlines follow up by implementing a rigorous disinfection process and resample the aircraft\u2019s water to ensure that water quality criteria are being met.\"\n\nWhile passengers may decide to opt for a bottled water instead of drinking tap on their next flight, Honker echoes the AFA\u2019s sentiments, saying the industry knows the problem and is paying close attention to address it.\n\n\u201cI can assure you the industry is getting the message,\u201d said Honker.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "airplane drinking water, epa", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Test results from the EPA show that one in 10 US airplanes tested positive for coliform bacteria in drinking water.", "title": "Airplane Drinking Water Is \u2018Frequently Contaminated\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/airplane-drinking-water-frequently-contaminated-epa-finds-coliform-bacteria-12-plane-tap-259358", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/09/800px-aircanadaboeing767-300erwithcf6-80engines.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Test results from the EPA show that one in 10 US airplanes tested positive for coliform bacteria in drinking water.", "title": "Airplane Drinking Water Is \u2018Frequently Contaminated\u2019", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/airplane-drinking-water-frequently-contaminated-epa-finds-coliform-bacteria-12-plane-tap-259358", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/09/800px-aircanadaboeing767-300erwithcf6-80engines.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/09/800px-aircanadaboeing767-300erwithcf6-80engines.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-10-09T12:52:34-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-09T12:52:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Test results from the EPA show that one in 10 US airplanes tested positive for coliform bacteria in drinking water."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6bd\"", "article_summary": "\"In very rare cases a water sample test will suggest that the water does not meet drinking water guidelines,\" the representative said.\nTest results from the EPA show that one in 10 US airplanes tested positive for coliform bacteria in drinking water.\nOr, in other words: \u201cThere\u2019s poop in the water if there\u2019s E. coli in the water, and that\u2019s not a good thing,\" Brenda Wiles, a lab manager certified to test drinking water aboard aircraft, told NBC 5.\n\"In those instances, the airlines follow up by implementing a rigorous disinfection process and resample the aircraft\u2019s water to ensure that water quality criteria are being met.\"\nThe EPA put a major initiative in place to reduce the amount of bacteria in plane water after 15 percent of planes tested positive for coliform in 2004."}
