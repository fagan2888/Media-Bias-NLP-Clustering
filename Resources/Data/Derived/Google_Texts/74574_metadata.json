Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) continued to voice her discontent with Obamacare on Thursday, entering the realm of personal struggles.\n\nHours after President Barack Obama issued a mea culpa for the White House's fumbling of the Affordable Care Act's rollout, Bachmann told CNN's \"The Situation Room\" that she had lost her insurance and would be forced to enter Washington D.C.'s exchange.\n\nWhen asked by host Wolf Blitzer if she planned to enroll, Bachmann dismissed the glitchy website.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Bachmann said, adding that she would wait until the technical issues were fixed. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna waste an hour on that thing.\u201d\n\nBachmann's comments arrived one day after she hammered at how the Obamacare struggles are harming Democrats' 2014 election efforts. That element of backlash was also addressed by Obama on Thursday, when he said there was no doubt the ACA rollout failure has \"put a burden on Democrats, whether they're running or not, because they stood up and supported this.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why they are all running, screaming looking for any corner that they can go to where they can say, \u2018Gee, not me, not me.\u2019 When actually it\u2019s their fault,\u201d Bachmann said Wednesday.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Waves Of Michele Bachmann Waves Of Michele Bachmann\n\n1 of 15 Rep.
