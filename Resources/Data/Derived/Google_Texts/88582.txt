One person is in critical condition and two others are in custody following an officer-involved shooting Saturday night in Park Hill, police officials said.

Just after 7 p.m., officers spotted a Black Audi that was involved in an armed carjacking at 5 a.m. in Aurora. During the officersâ€™ contact with the suspects, at 28th Avenue and Fairfax street, shots were fired, said Doug Schepman, a Denver Police Department spokesman.

One suspect was hit and two others fled on foot and were later apprehended in the neighborhood, he said. The suspect who was shot was taken to the hospital and was in critical but stable condition, he said.

Schepman said he could not say whether the suspects fired first and whether the suspects were armed. Citing an active, ongoing investigation, Schepman said additional details were unavailable.

Per standard Denver Police protocol, the officer involved in the shooting will be put on administrative leave, police officials said.

Aurora Police Department officials confirmed that a carjacking occurred on Saturday morning but did not immediately have information on the suspect or suspects involved, said Diana Cooley, a department spokeswoman. It appeared that no one was injured during the carjacking, she said.
