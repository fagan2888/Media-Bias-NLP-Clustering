Medical device company executives say the federal medical device excise tax has negatively affected their companies through job reductions, reduced research and development spending, and increased tax compliance burdens, according to a Massachusetts Medical Device Industry Council survey released Thursday.

Twenty-three respondents said their company had reduced employment by up to 25 percent as a result of the medical device excise tax, which was implemented in 2013 as part of the Affordable Care Act to raise $38 billion over the next 10 years. The 2.3 percent tax is imposed directly on medical device manufacturers, producers, and importers.

Accounting firm Grant Thornton conducted the survey electronically in August and September; 24 of MassMEDIC’s 197 primary member companies participated.

About 71 percent of survey participants said they had slowed or halted overall US job creation because of the medical tax.

This survey comes as Congressional leaders and the White House tried Thursday to compromise on tax and spending bills.

“The medical device tax is slowing the growth of one the region’s most innovative industry sectors,” Tom Sommer, MassMEDIC president, said in a statement. “Congressional action to repeal or delay the tax would accelerate further development of innovative health care solutions and job growth.”
