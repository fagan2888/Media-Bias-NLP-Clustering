However, Rite Aid\u2018s (NYSE: RAD) revenues remained flat and it devised a turnaround plan to set a new course. While the topline was stressed during this period, higher interest costs due to an over-leveraged capital structure and higher costs (due to inefficient operations) kept earnings down. This was a challenging period for the pharmacy retail industry altogether primarily because of lower reimbursement rates which led to lower profit margins.\n\nIn 2013, Rite Aid\u2019s revenues plateaued as the number of its stores remained fairly stable. However, its strategic initiatives started paying off and the company returned to profitability which drove the company\u2019s stock price up from $1.30 at the start of 2013 to a $7.50 at present.\n\nOur price estimate of $6.27 for Rite Aid is at about a 15% discount to the current market price. We believe that the current Trefis estimate fairly represents the growth potential that Rite Aid holds.\n\nView our detailed analysis for Rite Aid\n\nManagement Confident Of Turnaround Amidst Favorable External Conditions\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau projects a 60% increase in the number of Americans age 65 and older between the years 2000 and 2020, who fill almost thrice as many prescriptions as those filled by the younger group (younger than 65 years of age). Considering that prescription drugs constitutes about 70% of Rite Aid\u2019s revenues, the future holds immense potential for growth in this segment. Additionally, ObamaCare is further driving the demand for affordable, high-quality health care and is estimated to bring another 30 million people under health insurance coverage.\n\nAn Impending Patent Cliff And Increase in Availability of Generics Bodes Well For Pharmacy Retailers\n\nFrom 2015 through 2018, a total of $78 billion [ ] is expected to be exposed to generic competition. While this significantly impacts drug manufacturers\u2019 sales negatively, it is going to be all smiles for drug retailers. Even though branded drugs contribute a significant portion to a drug retailer\u2019s topline, generics have historically provided higher margins. With higher availability of generics, they will form a higher proportion of the topline and will provide some support to the company\u2019s margins, which have been under pressure due to rising generic costs. During the recently concluded JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, Rite Aid CEO John Standley noted [ ] that there are \u201ca few question marks in terms of how a couple of drugs may play out,\u201d possibly referring to the delay in FDA approval for the manufacture of generic copies of AstraZeneca\u2019s heartburn drug Nexium and Roche Holding\u2019s antiviral Valcyte. Inspite of such occurences, we are confident the that the generic boom would still remain intact and is going to help Rite Aid generate higher profitability.\n\nMore Efficient Distribution Process To Support Margins\n\nConversion to a new drug distribution and purchasing process with McKesson Corporation (MCK), the largest distributor of pharmaceutical and medical supplies in the U.S., is providing Rite Aid with purchasing efficiencies and direct-to-store delivery for all its pharmacy products. Early in Q3\u201915, all its stores and four pharmacy distribution centers were converted to this new distribution process and the benefits have started to be reflected in the income statement in the form of higher gross profits, arising from increased pharmacy revenue and the purchasing savings made. With time, we expect further optimization in their distribution process will push costs further down. This in turn helps Rite Aid reduce working capital requirements due to lower pharmacy and distribution center inventories.\n\nSource: [ ]\n\nReimbursement Rate Pressure To Continue\n\nRite Aid anticipates negative pharmacy sales impact of approximately 208 basis points in FY15 [ ] from new generic introductions and continued reimbursement rate pressure. While Obamacare is expected to benefit the pharmacy industry by bringing in millions of patients under coverage, it also means that a larger proportion of patients will be covered by government insurance plans rather than private insurers. As reimbursement rates provided by government insurance are less-friendly relative to that provided by private insurers, there will be added pressure on the reimbursement rates. Even though Rite Aid expects the reimbursement rate pressure to continue to pose a challenge in the future, we believe that the cost savings from the new distribution and purchasing process with McKesson will help ease pressure off the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nOverall, we believe Rite Aid is well poised to turn its operations around amidst favorable conditions for the industry. While the challenges it is facing such as reimbursement pressure or generic inflation are short-term in nature, it has strategies in place to secure its long-term growth. The firm believes that with so many factors in their favor, they are well placed to overcome the headwinds of reimbursement pressure and continue to register strong growth.\n\nView Interactive Institutional Research (Powered by Trefis):\n\nGlobal Large Cap | U.S. Mid & Small Cap | European Large & Mid Cap\n\nMore Trefis Research", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "10-15, 3, 3, 4, 4, pierr johnson, pro, retail &amp; household products, rite aid, rad, cvs, wba", "og": {"url": "http://www.trefis.com/stock/rad/articles/275556/rite-aid-poised-for-long-term-growth-but-short-term-concerns-remain/2015-01-23", "site_name": "Trefis", "description": "Between 2009 \u00a0and 2012, market leaders such as CVS Health (NYSE:CVS)\u00a0and Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA) were able to achieve a revenue growth (CAGR) of 6% and 2% respectively.", "title": "Rite Aid Poised For Long-term Growth But Short-term Concerns Remain. -- Trefis"}, "date": "2015-01-23", "description": "Between 2009 \u00a0and 2012, market leaders such as CVS Health (NYSE:CVS)\u00a0and Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA) were able to achieve a revenue growth (CAGR) of 6% and 2% respectively.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda50c\"", "article_summary": "We believe that the current Trefis estimate fairly represents the growth potential that Rite Aid holds.\nOverall, we believe Rite Aid is well poised to turn its operations around amidst favorable conditions for the industry.\nOur price estimate of $6.27 for Rite Aid is at about a 15% discount to the current market price.\nThis in turn helps Rite Aid reduce working capital requirements due to lower pharmacy and distribution center inventories.\nWhile the challenges it is facing such as reimbursement pressure or generic inflation are short-term in nature, it has strategies in place to secure its long-term growth."}
