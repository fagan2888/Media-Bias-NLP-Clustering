Some argue that it was forged over 115 years ago, half a world away in the Philippine Islands.\n\nThe story begins in the mid-1870s, when a technological renaissance catapulted America into its first information revolution. Thomas Edison\u2019s quadruplex telegraph and Philo Remington\u2019s typewriter allowed data to be recorded accurately and transmitted quickly. Inventions such as the electrical tabulating machine and the Dewey Decimal System could count, catalog and retrieve huge amounts of information efficiently. Photography was becoming widely accessible, thanks to George Eastman\u2019s roll film, and biometric criminal identification systems such as fingerprinting were adopted from Europe. Our ability to manage, store and transmit data grew by leaps and bounds.\n\nWhen the U.S. occupied the Philippines in 1898, these inventions became the building blocks for a full-scale surveillance state that was used to suppress Filipino resistance.\n\nAccording to historian Alfred McCoy, who has written extensively on this topic, Capt. Ralph Van Deman \u2013 dubbed \u201cthe father of U.S. military intelligence\u201d \u2013 masterminded a security apparatus that compiled \u201cphenomenally detailed information on thousands of Filipino leaders, including their physical appearance, personal finances, landed property, political loyalties, and kinship networks.\u201d The system ended up indexing 70 percent of Manila\u2019s entire population.\n\nThis total information control coupled with laws such as the Sedition Act, which severely punished anyone who engaged in \u201csubversive\u201d political activity, allowed the governor-general of the islands, William Howard Taft, to manipulate and blackmail anyone at will.\n\nYears later, the colonial policing used in the Philippines was refined and adapted to be used domestically in the U.S. The first example, McCoy notes, was shortly after America entered World War I.\n\nAt the time, rapidly growing labor strikes and radical groups were fueling a public hysteria of immigrants and leftists. This was the first Red Scare. The 1917 Espionage Act and 1918 Sedition Act punished political \u201csubversion.\u201d Postmaster General Alfred S. Burleson banned virtually the entire anti-war and socialist press. Van Deman\u2019s military intelligence division collaborated with groups such as the American Protective League to collect more than a million pages of surveillance reports on German Americans in 14 months. By 1920, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer and a young J. Edgar Hoover had arrested more than 10,000 people in mass raids around the country. Scandal erupted when the public learned that most of the arrested were not foreign immigrants, but U.S. citizens. In the end, public outrage forced Uncle Sam to curb domestic surveillance, and the State Department\u2019s cryptography unit was abolished.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our modern-day surveillance state dates back to the 1870s, when a new technology launched an information revolution VIDEO", "title": "The secret (and sinister) history of American surveillance", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Our modern-day surveillance state dates back to the 1870s, when a new technology launched an information revolution VIDEO", "title": "The secret (and sinister) history of American surveillance", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/24/the_secret_history_of_american_surveillance_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/nsa-surveillance.jpeg-620x412.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Our modern-day surveillance state dates back to the 1870s, when a new technology launched an information revolution VIDEO", "title": "The secret (and sinister) history of American surveillance", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/nsa-surveillance.jpeg-620x412.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ariane Wu", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Cybersecurity, NSA, reveal news, Surveillance, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9cf9\"", "article_summary": "But few remember the origins of our modern surveillance state.\nWhen the U.S. occupied the Philippines in 1898, these inventions became the building blocks for a full-scale surveillance state that was used to suppress Filipino resistance.\nIn the end, public outrage forced Uncle Sam to curb domestic surveillance, and the State Department\u2019s cryptography unit was abolished.\nThe 1917 Espionage Act and 1918 Sedition Act punished political \u201csubversion.\u201d Postmaster General Alfred S.
