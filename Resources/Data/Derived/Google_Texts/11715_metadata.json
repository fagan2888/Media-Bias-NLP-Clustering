In fact, using the law\u2019s definitions, part-time work isn\u2019t increasing at all as a share of employment, at least not yet.\n\nNearly 8 million American were working part-time in September because they couldn\u2019t find full-time work. Overall, 27 million people \u2014 nearly a fifth of all employees \u2014 are working part-time, well above historical norms.\n\nMany critics of the Obama administration have pointed the finger for the prevalence of part-time jobs at the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law better known to some as \u201cObamacare.\u201d The law\u2019s so-called \u201cemployer mandate\u201d requires most midsize and larger companies to offer health insurance to their full-time employees. That, critics argue, provides companies with an incentive to hire part-timers instead.\n\nThe Obama administration earlier this year said it would delay the requirement until 2015 to give companies more time to comply. But some employers have said they are nonetheless cutting back on full-time hiring. Indeed, part-time employment rose early this year, while full-time employment growth stalled.\n\nBut a closer look at the data provides little evidence for the notion that the health law is driving a shift to part-time work, although it could as the mandate deadline approaches.\n\nFirst of all, over a longer time frame, part-time work has actually been falling as a share of employment in recent years. Before the recession, about 17% of employed Americans worked 35 hours or less, the standard Labor Department definition of \u201cpart time.\u201d During the recession, that figure rose, briefly hitting 20%. It\u2019s been trending down since then, but only slowly, hitting 19% in September.\n\nThe uptick in part-time employment earlier this year now looks like a statistical blip: Part-time employment fell in late 2012, then rebounded in early 2013, and has now fallen for two consecutive months. But even if the upward trend resumes, it\u2019s doubtful that the health law is to blame.\n\nIn its statistics, the Labor Department considers anyone who usually works less than 35 hours per week to be \u201cpart-time.\u201d The health law, however, is stricter: It counts anyone who works at least 30 hours a week as a full-time employee. That means that someone who works 34 hours a week would show up in Labor data as a part-time worker, but would still qualify as a full-time worker under Obamacare, and therefore would be subject to the employer mandate.\n\nIf the health law were driving employers to cut employees\u2019 hours, the most vulnerable workers would likely be those working just above the 30-hour cutoff. That means the data would show a decline in those working 30 to 34 hours and an increase in those working less than 30 hours.\n\nThat isn\u2019t what\u2019s happening. The share of part-timers who say they usually work between 30 and 34 hours at their main job has been roughly flat over the past three years, at about 28%. (September data aren\u2019t yet available.) If anything, it\u2019s actually risen in the past year, though the change has been minor. The share working just under 30 hours has indeed risen somewhat, but the share working under 25 hours has fallen\u2014suggesting that employers are giving part-timers more hours, rather than cutting full-timers\u2019 hours back.\n\nPut another way: If the Labor Department used the same definition of \u201cpart-time\u201d as the health law, its data would show no increase in part-time work over the past year.\n\nOther data tell a similar story. Average weekly hours\u2014a measure that comes from companies, rather than workers themselves\u2014have been flat for the past year, and are near their highest level since the recession. Restaurants, one of the sectors most often cited as likely to shift to part-timers, haven\u2019t cut workers\u2019 hours over the past year.\n\nNone of this, of course, means that employers won\u2019t cut workers\u2019 hours in the future. The employer mandate doesn\u2019t take effect until 2015, meaning companies have plenty of time to adjust their hiring practices. But there\u2019s little evidence they\u2019ve done so yet.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Don\u2019t blame the health law for high levels of part-time employment.
