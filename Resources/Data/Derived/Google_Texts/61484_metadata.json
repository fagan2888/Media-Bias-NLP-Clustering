And while some industry leaders think the power shift may help loosen the gridlock that has plagued the 113th Congress, and perhaps lead to a renewed focus on energy legislation and other issues beneficial to the HVAC industry, others are less optimistic.\n\nPower Shift\n\nOn Nov. 4, American voters elected a wave of Republican candidates who will take control of the U.S. Senate and increase their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in January 2015. (Photo courtesy of Ed Schipul)\n\nIn January 2015, control of the Senate will change hands with Republicans set to hold 53 seats compared to Democrats\u2019 44. Two seats are held by independents while another, in Louisiana, will be decided by a Dec. 6 runoff election.\n\n\u201cRepublicans now have the largest majority in the House since the Great Depression,\u201d said Charlie McCrudden, senior vice president of government relations for ACCA.\n\nWith the election of several moderate Republicans, McCrudden anticipates less tension among House Republicans during the next session. \u201cThe tea party Republicans who went against Speaker John Boehner are now offset by some of the more moderate Republicans, who will likely line up with the speaker more frequently.\u201d\n\nJon Melchi, director of government affairs for Heating, Air-conditioning, and Refrigeration Distributors International (HARDI) said the election will also affect House committees, which \u201cwill have a slightly more Republican flair\u201d in 2015.\n\n\u201cChairmanship of several committees of interest to the HVACR industry is changing hands, such as the House Committees on Ways and Means, Oversight, and Small Business, and the Senate Committees, which will flip to GOP control,\u201d Melchi said. \u201cThose are going to have an impact. But, as far as the legislation that comes from the House, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll see a big difference.\u201d\n\nGuido Zucconi, assistant vice president of congressional affairs for Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI), anticipates many changes in Senate committee leadership and membership.\n\n\u201cAHRI has worked well with past chairmen as well as the incoming heads of pertinent committees,\u201d Zucconi said. \u201cWe expect to continue to work on a bipartisan basis, especially in the Senate, where the minority party remains an integral part of the legislative process.\u201d\n\nIndustry Regulation\n\nWhen it comes to HVACR industry regulation, industry leaders are not expecting federal regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to slow down anytime soon.\n\n\u201cAHRI is concerned with the pace and scope of regulations affecting the HVACR and water heating industry,\u201d Zucconi said. \u201cWe have looked to Congress for improved oversight of regulatory agencies, but, to date, have been unsuccessful. While we are hopeful that Congress, in general, will become a more effective legislative body, we understand the complexities of Senate procedures and the veto power of the president. While a difficult political environment will continue, especially with the presidential campaign looming, we are hopeful new leadership will vigorously exercise its role of oversight over federal agencies.\u201d\n\nMelchi agreed, stating he anticipates increased coordination between the House and Senate on some of these oversight investigations in the next Congress. \u201cThis is the time within the presidency where you\u2019re going to see a lot of legacy-leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cThe House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is getting a new chairman this fall, so you\u2019re going to see more coordination and more publicity. But, anybody who is anticipating a slowdown in the speed of regulatory action is going to be disappointed. There\u2019s been nothing that indicates regulatory action will slow down.\u201d\n\nThe only option Congress may have to slow down current regulatory efforts by the DOE, EPA, and other regulatory bodies is to tighten their budgets.\n\nMark Menzer, director of public affairs at Danfoss, said Congress always has \u201cthe power of the purse\u201d to control regulatory bodies, to some extent.\n\n\u201cThey promised not to shut the government down again, but they always have the power of funding these agencies,\u201d Menzer said. \u201cThey can hold oversight hearings, and they can defund the agencies to a point where it becomes difficult for them to work at the pace they did before. That\u2019s not a constructive way of dealing with things, however, and what we\u2019d like is for the DOE to just be more transparent and make their analyses clear and open.\n\n\u201cDOE has been successful in conducting negotiated rulemakings, and it\u2019s not clear why they decide to do them on some regulations, but not others. I\u2019d say, certainly, our priorities are looking for more sensible energy-efficiency regulation including what\u2019s going on now with DOE trying to promulgate so many efficiency standards in a limited time. They do have a huge number of standards they want to get out in the last two years of the Obama administration, so they\u2019re rushing to regulate, and the industry has responded with litigation.\u201d\n\nIndustry leaders will also be monitoring upcoming standards and rules being developed by the EPA and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), McCrudden said. \u201cWe know the EPA power plant emission standard regulation is out there. It\u2019s going to take a while, but that\u2019s on the horizon.\u201d\n\nACCA is also keeping tabs on an upcoming OSHA rule that could directly affect HVAC contractors.\n\n\u201cThere are rules about working in a confined space, and there are measures you have to take, and OSHA has been working on a confined space rule specifically for the construction industries,\u201d McCrudden explained. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m concerned about is a determination that crawlspaces and attics will be defined as \u2018confined spaces.\u2019 If they\u2019re all placed under that definition for the purposes of this new rule, you\u2019d have to have an extra person with you if you\u2019re working in a crawlspace or an attic, as well as all the equipment necessary to pull them out if they were to become incapacitated, so it could potentially be very expensive to contractors. That\u2019s a rule that OSHA has been working on for 10 years now.\u201d\n\nLame-Duck Session\n\nBefore the end of the year, there are several major issues that have to be addressed.\n\n\u201cFunding for the federal government runs out on Dec. 11, so the Democrats may push an omnibus continuing resolution (CR) to finish the rest of the fiscal year. But, the Republicans may want to do a short-term CR to avoid a shutdown and come back in January, when they have control of the House and Senate,\u201d McCrudden said.\n\nThe renewal of dozens of tax provisions that either expired at the end of 2013 or will expire at the end of this month \u2014 including the 25C credit for installing high-efficiency HVAC equipment \u2014 could also appear on the lame-duck agenda. \u201cThere is a move by some to get these tax extenders done and off the table before the next Congress,\u201d Melchi said.\n\nHowever, the politically charged tax issues may be more complicated than that, which could extend a potential resolution into 2015.\n\n\u201cThere is talk that House Republicans would prefer to deal with expiring tax provisions in January, when Republicans control both Houses of Congress, rather than accept a deal from Democrats prior to that shift,\u201d Zucconi said. \u201cSenate Democrats want to renew the provisions for two years with minimal changes, and House Republicans want to permanently renew a select few provisions. It may come down to which credits Democrats are willing to accept and whether both parties can come to an agreement on whether the provisions should be paid for.\n\n\u201cIf they wait for the next Congress to address the more than 50 tax provisions that expired at the end of 2013, the government could be forced to delay the upcoming 2015 tax filing season, delay tax refunds, and force taxpayers to file twice,\u201d Zucconi continued. \u201cThis scenario may motivate this lame-duck Congress to pass a one- or two-year extension of many credits while permanently extending popular and essential parts of the tax code.\u201d\n\nThere is also potential for serious gridlock during the lame-duck session.\n\n\u201cIf the president exercises his executive authority during the lame-duck session, it\u2019s going to change the tenor of that session,\u201d McCrudden explained. \u201cShould the president come out with his rumored proposal on stopping deportation of undocumented individuals before the end of the year, then that is going to make this lame-duck session really interesting. If that happens, all bets are off on how Congress and the White House work together.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are in a position of strength in the next Congress,\u201d McCrudden explained. \u201cThey can play hardball against the Democrats, who want to move while they\u2019re still in control of the Senate, and elect not to do anything. For Republicans, things are going to get better in January, and they\u2019re going to be more strongly positioned.\u201d\n\nLegislative Issues\n\nOn the legislative side, industry leaders will be tracking several issues, including energy efficiency, tax reform, tax extenders, and the Affordable Care Act, among others.\n\n\u201cThere are attempts to get the Shaheen-Portman bill passed between now and the end of the year \u2026 or it could come back in the 114th Congress,\u201d said McCrudden. \u201cSenator Rob Portman, R-Ohio, is a potential presidential or vice presidential candidate in 2016, so he may take a lower profile on things like the energy debate, but not necessarily on his own energy bill.\u201d\n\nMenzer expressed cautious optimism for the Shaheen-Portman bill in the next session of Congress. \u201cHopefully, with the new chairman [of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources], Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who is certainly committed to meaningful energy policy, something can be resurrected from the ashes of the last Shaheen-Portman bill and passed. I think Congress does want to come up with an energy bill, so we\u2019ll be looking at that.\u201d\n\nZucconi said the Shaheen-Portman bill \u201ccontinues to enjoy industry consensus and bipartisan support,\u201d though it has experienced numerous political roadblocks in the Senate. \u201cThere are a number of provisions within the bill that make its path even more difficult in the House, whether considered in the 113th Congress or the upcoming 114th. It remains to be seen if this issue will be a priority for the next Congress. However, energy efficiency, reducing regulations, and agency oversight remain top priorities for AHRI and its members. We look forward to working with Senators Shaheen and Portman, and their respective party leaders, to achieve our goals through thoughtful, smart, and effective legislation.\u201d\n\nHARDI also still supports the Shaheen-Portman bill, though, \u201cin an effort to make the Shaheen-Portman bill more palatable to a wider audience, many of the provisions of the bill that generated excitement in its earlier state have had to be removed or altered,\u201d Melchi said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good bill, but it\u2019s a bill that doesn\u2019t, on a wide scale, make any significant changes or alterations.\u201d\n\nKateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, said in a statement she is very optimistic about the prospects for enactment of meaningful energy-efficiency policies at the national level and believes there is a chance the Shaheen-Portman bill may pass before the end of the year. \u201cEnergy efficiency is the one place in the national energy policy landscape where we can set politics aside and really get something done for our nation\u2019s economy, energy security, and the environment,\u201d she said.\n\nIndustry leaders are also going to be closely watching what happens with several tax provisions that directly impact the HVACR industry.\n\n\u201cThere are about 60 tax incentives that help small businesses, big businesses, and individuals that expired last year, or will expire at the end of this year, and they need to address those,\u201d McCrudden said. \u201cSome of those are significant. There\u2019s the 25C tax credit for homeowners who purchase and install high-efficiency HVAC equipment, and there\u2019s 179D, a tax deduction for making qualified energy-saving improvements to a commercial building that expired at the end of last year and was never reauthorized. It needs to be done.\u201d\n\nMenzer also mentioned 179D and said the current 39-year depreciation schedule for HVAC equipment is impractical for commercial building owners.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to keep the stock of equipment in commercial buildings refreshed and efficient, it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Menzer said. \u201cWe see so many old, inefficient systems being repaired when they really need to be replaced. We will be looking to work with Congress.\u201d\n\nTax reform, in general, is also going to be an issue during the 114th Congress, McCrudden said.\n\n\u201cLowering the tax rates on corporations and fixing the inequity for pass-through entities, like S corporations, partnerships, and LLCs that pay their business taxes on a 1040, while their C corporation counterparts have a lower tax rate \u2014 that would be a big help to smaller businesses.\u201d\n\nFinally, the Affordable Care Act will likely come under scrutiny again in the new Congress, which could impact many small HVAC business owners.\n\n\u201cUp to this date, the president has been reluctant to accept any legislation to tweak the Affordable Care Act, instead offering executive actions like the employer mandate for providing employee health care. It will be interesting to see if they\u2019ll sign into law some of these changes, and I think there will be some bipartisan support to do so.\u201d\n\nLooking Ahead to 2016\n\nAny pressing issues that are not resolved in the lame-duck session will dominate the first part of 2015. Additionally, the debt ceiling expires in March, and other time-sensitive issues are bound to demand Congress\u2019s attention.\n\nMeanwhile, industry leaders are waiting to see just how well the new Congress gets along and how it interacts with the White House before making any real predictions about industry-related legislation. But, with less than two years until the next presidential election, it\u2019s hard to predict what Congress may or may not be able to accomplish.\n\n\u201cThere is probably a 10-month window to really be productive in this next session \u2014 to keep them focused on the task at hand and doing what they don\u2019t like to do, like taking controversial votes in election years,\u201d Melchi said. \u201cAfter that, Republicans may say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to compromise because we think we can get a better deal with our guy in office,\u2019 or Democrats will say, \u2018Why would we compromise when we\u2019ll take Senate majority and the presidency next year?\u2019 There\u2019s an awful lot of Republicans who will be up for re-election in 2016 who will be from states where Obama won in 2012, so they\u2019re going to want to show they can work well across the aisle.\u201d\n\nMenzer agreed the 2016 elections will create an interesting atmosphere in the 114th Congress.\n\n\u201cThere are 34 senators up for re-election, 24 of them Republican, in 2016,\u201d Menzer said. \u201cMany of them are spending the next two years trying to be promoted to the presidency, so the dynamic is really interesting there.\u201d\n\nYet, despite the signs pointing to another potentially gridlocked Congress, history has shown the legislative and executive branches still manage to work together to pass important legislation.\n\n\u201cReagan had a Democrat-controlled Congress in 1987-1988, Clinton had an all-Republican Congress in 1999-2000, and George W. Bush had a Democrat-controlled Congress in 2007-2008,\u201d McCrudden said. \u201cThings got done during those times.\u201d\n\nMelchi said it is up to party leaders to work together, and the pressure is on.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have said, \u2018put us in charge and we\u2019ll get things done,\u2019 so, now, they have to show us they can do that, and the president is going to have to decide whether he wants to work with them or veto everything,\u201d Melchi said. \u201cThe GOP is going to have to prove they can work together, and so is the president.\u201d\n\nZucconi said the Nov. 4 election results sent a powerful message.\n\n\u201cAHRI sincerely hopes this administration will view this congressional power shift with an eye on President Obama\u2019s legacy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe election results were a message from voters that they want a change to the obstructionist ways of the past two years. The 114th Congress is an opportunity for Congress and the White House to meet each other halfway and actually govern the country. Governing through executive orders and aggressive regulations is not how the Founding Fathers intended the government to work. AHRI hopes the two branches will finally begin to perform their duties and govern in a smart, effective, and consensus manner.\u201d\n\nPublication date: 12/1/2014\n\nWant more HVAC industry news and information?
