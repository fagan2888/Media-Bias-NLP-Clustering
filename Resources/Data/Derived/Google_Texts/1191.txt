CFCC art students paint a mural that will hang in the biology department.

WILMINGTON, NC (WWAY) — CFCC’s new performing arts center held an “Artsplosion” event Saturday to conclude its opening week.

The event featured over twenty artistic organizations, including the nationally acclaimed Squonk Opera. Guests got a chance to tour the facility, hear musical performances and create their own works of art.

CFCC art students displayed their skills in the center’s brand new studios where they have space to do anything from painting murals to molding clay structures.

“We’re showcasing some of the best and brightest from our community,” said Shane Fernando, the center’s director.

Beth Crookham who produced the day-long event said it was beneficial for both the public and Wilmington’s artists.

“For those who came to just enjoy, they found out things going on in the county they didn’t know about before, and for the artists who were involved hopefully it helped re-invigorate or encourage them to keep going and pushing forward,” said Crookham.

The stage’s curtain was raised officially for the first time.
