After all, the poor fellow didn\u2019t do anything wrong \u2014 not really. He just wanted to participate fully in our national life, in our democratic process. He didn\u2019t want to hide \u2014 he was forced to take cover by our draconian, inhumane campaign-finance laws.\n\nMr. D\u2019Souza\u2019s real crime, the only offense that really matters in Washington these days, is being an Obama critic. Oh, they say he borrowed a couple of people\u2019s names, but his real mistake was doing it in the Wendy Long Senate campaign. For Obama 2008 donors, borrowing other people\u2019s names seems to have been a requirement.\n\nAnd look, it\u2019s not like every moment of D\u2019Souza\u2019s presence in this country has been a violation of law \u2014 even if it does rub the regime the wrong way. Nor does his day-to-day life ooze identity theft, tax evasion, bank fraud, Social Security fraud, Medicaid fraud, Medicare fraud, food-stamps fraud, and the like. Those crimes, instead, fill out the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of our \u201cundocumented\u201d legions. So ubiquitous is illegal-alien crime that the benumbed Beltway ruling class \u2014 very much including its Republican-establishment division \u2014 now just shrugs and says, What difference, at this point, does it make?\n\nWhy no difference for them but a life-altering difference for D\u2019Souza? Because he\u2019s not among the favored outlaws of our law-unto-himself president.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the team, \u201camnesty\u201d does not begin to describe the immunity windfall. Sic the IRS on American citizens in order to frustrate their participation in election campaigns? No worries . . . and no prosecutions, not even for officials who take the Fifth in congressional testimony because they believe answering questions will confirm their criminality. Case closed: No need even to interview the victims, innocent people who were nonetheless intimidated by the prospect of audits, fines, civil lawsuits, criminal prosecution, and, above all, prohibitive legal fees \u2014 the wages of both compliance and resistance. After all, the victims opposed Obama. As they say at Alinsky, Inc.: \u201cWe won, get over it.\u201d\n\nBenghazi? Remember: The serial derelictions of the president\u2019s duty to protect Americans under siege? Obama\u2019s instigation of an unauthorized war with no vital American interests at stake \u2014 a war that empowered anti-American jihadists? The NATO campaign that abetted the Qaddafi murder \u2014 notwithstanding the ban on assassinations of heads of state and our government\u2019s prior representation that Qaddafi was an important U.S. counterterrorism ally? Oh well . . . as so memorably put between chuckles by Secretary \u201cWhat Difference\u201d herself: \u201cWe came, we saw, he died!\u201d On to the minimum wage.\n\nThen there\u2019s the gargantuan Obamacare con job: the sedulous administration lying, the willfully false lulling, the law\u2019s unconstitutional enactment, the lawlessly imperial \u201cwaivers,\u201d the shameful subsidies to buy off members of Congress and their staffs, the unlawful IRS enforcement in states that declined to participate, the transparent campaign to usher in a single-payer government takeover by breaking the health-care insurance system. It is the most massive fraud in American history, and there will be no investigations or prosecutions. Take heart, though: Republicans have a plan that is right on schedule to repeal Obamacare by, oh, around 2024, the same year Paul Ryan\u2019s boffo budget plan brings Leviathan\u2019s ledgers into balance. Oh wait, check that: It turns out the latest Ryan plan relies on Obamacare to balance the budget. Sounds as promising as his new \u201cenforcement first . . . make that last\u201d immigration plan.\n\nWe could go on about faithful execution of the laws, Obama-style: the non-recess recess appointments; the Justice Department\u2019s racially discriminatory civil-rights enforcement; the Solyndra \u201cgreen-energy\u201d boondoggle, featuring Obama\u2019s blatant misrepresentations of a publicly traded company\u2019s financial health and his subsequent override of a federal law meant to protect taxpayers \u2014 the better to shield his cronies from losses when the company inevitably collapsed. (Now that\u2019s Obamacare!) But such offenses are not the half of it. What is most breathtaking is the Obama administration\u2019s vindictiveness.\n\nIn late September 2012, the president and his myrmidons tirelessly labored to deceive the nation into believing the Benghazi Massacre they\u2019d recklessly bungled into was actually caused by an obscure, virtually unseen video \u2014 the trailer for an anti-Mohammed movie called Innocence of Muslims. Benghazi was not the only context for this duplicitous claim. For years, Obama and Secretary What Difference had colluded with Muslim-supremacist governments (the Organization of Islamic Cooperation) to \u201cwaive\u201d First Amendment protections in deference to sharia blasphemy standards that ban all negative criticism of Islam. Remember Obama at the U.N., just two weeks after our ambassador was murdered, proclaiming to the world that \u201cthe future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.\u201d\n\nWith his Benghazi story exploding, Obama needed a prop \u2014 someone to make an example of, someone to be sacrificed for the sake of the phony narrative. His minions dutifully set their sights on the hapless Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the Innocence of Muslims producer.\n\nA few years back, Nakoula had opened bank accounts using fake names and stolen Social Security numbers \u2014 again, crimes of the sort the Obama administration and the Republican establishment think we should overlook when committed by illegal aliens. The sentencing judge thought the crime so minimal that Nakoula spent only a year in jail before being sprung on \u201csupervised release\u201d \u2014 i.e., he was, like tens of thousands of former prisoners, free but under light monitoring by a probation officer.\n\nAfter the Benghazi terrorist attack, it emerged that Nakoula had produced the scapegoat video. In theory, that activity was completely protected by constitutional free-speech principles; in practice, however, the administration was hell-bent on blaming the video and its maker for both the massacre and the violent proclivities of Islamic radicalism. Agents were thus dispatched to arrest Nakoula in the dead of night. He was grilled about making the film \u2014 meaning: He was interrogated about exercising his First Amendment rights. He was prosecuted for a \u201csupervised-release violation\u201d culled, in part, out of false statements about the production of the video. After being held without bail as a purported \u201cdanger to the community,\u201d Nakoula was sentenced to another year in prison \u2014 as much time as he\u2019d served for the underlying bank fraud.\n\nUnderstand, in normal law enforcement this never happens. Agents and prosecutors are supposed to be too busy with real crimes to probe non-suspects over activity that is palpably not criminal. Furthermore, nonviolent criminals suspected of, at best, petty supervised-release violations are not arrested \u2014 they are given summonses to appear in court on their own recognizance. They are not detained without bail but left at liberty until the court date. And rarely, absent commission of a serious new crime, are they sent to jail on a first supervised-release violation. Instead, the judge gives them a tongue-lashing, warns them to honor the supervised-release terms from now on, and sends them on their way. With jails overcrowded, it often takes three or four violations before a court will finally re-incarcerate a convict.\n\nBut you don\u2019t get normal law enforcement if you run afoul of Obama and if your torment would have just the right in terrorem effect. Nakoula was too useful to pass up: For Americans, the administration framed him as the villain in its \u201cblame the video\u201d charade; for Muslims, he became Exhibit A of Obama\u2019s plan for people who dare \u201cslander the prophet of Islam.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to the unfortunate Dinesh D\u2019Souza: not just a prominent conservative and Christian activist, not just a harsh critic of progressivism and the academy, but a highly visible Obama detractor. D\u2019Souza is author of the Roots of Obama\u2019s Rage and co-producer of the equally controversial film 2016: Obama\u2019s America. They purport to trace the president\u2019s politics to the Communism and anti-colonialism of his father. While some commentators found the book insightful, it has also been panned, and not just from the left (see, e.g., Andrew Ferguson\u2019s scathing review in The Weekly Standard). Still, it was a big bestseller and, in conjunction with the movie, drew the ire of the White House, where you\u2019d be better off slandering the prophet of Islam than critiquing Obama.\n\nSo now the Obama administration has indicted D\u2019Souza for not one but two felony charges, arising out of alleged campaign-finance irregularities. Specifically, he is accused of corruptly reimbursing straw donors to the campaign of Wendy Long, Republican candidate in the New York Senate race \u2014 contributions D\u2019Souza could not lawfully make himself because he was already \u201cmaxed out\u201d at the $5,000 ceiling.\n\nI do not know D\u2019Souza well. I have no idea whether he made reimbursements, much less did so willfully. I have no doubt, though, that this is a manifestly vindictive prosecution. The $20,000 amount of the offense alleged is puny \u2014 a negligible fraction of the Solyndra scam and a figure that would not even register in comparison to the billions lost by victims who were told that if they liked their health-care plans they could keep them. It is the kind of case on which the government routinely declines criminal prosecution, handling, instead, by an administrative fine.\n\nD\u2019Souza has no criminal record. Moreover, contrary to myriad voter-fraud violations that Attorney General Holder will not lift a finger to pursue, the transactions at issue posed no conceivable threat to the integrity of the election process: Ms. Long lost by 46 points. As observed by no less than Harvard\u2019s Alan Dershowitz (an Obama supporter), \u201cThis is clearly a case of selective prosecution.\u201d There would, the professor added, be \u201cno room in jails for murderers\u201d if the Justice Department made a practice of such prosecutions.\n\nEven more offensive, to my mind, is count two \u2014 the charge of making false statements to the government. To commit the species of campaign-finance violation alleged in count one, the defendant necessarily must cause the straw donor to file a false contribution report with the Federal Election Commission. That is, you cannot commit the donation offense without simultaneously committing the false-statement offense. For the government to charge both smacks of double jeopardy: being twice prosecuted for the same, single offense.\n\nWhy such a heavy-handed indictment? Because Congress deemed campaign-finance violations worth less than $25,000 to be so trivial that a maximum jail sentence of only two years is prescribed (see Title 2, U.S. Code, Sec. 437g(d)(1)(D)). You can also be certain the sentencing guidelines would prescribe no jail time at all. Yet, by gratuitously piling on another felony, Obama and Holder portray D\u2019Souza as a serious crook and subject him to the onerous potential of seven years in prison \u2014 all for an episode that ordinarily would not be prosecuted at all.\n\nAs Legal Insurrection\u2019s Bill Jacobson notes, the 2008 Obama campaign was caught illegally hiding not $20,000 but nearly $2 million in irregular contributions (in addition to dragging its feet on the return of millions more in suspect donations). You probably don\u2019t remember that because \u2014 I know this will shock you \u2014 the Obama Justice Department didn\u2019t prosecute anyone. It was considered a mere hiccup: resolved by a fine considerably smaller than the $500,000 in bail D\u2019Souza was forced to post lest he be detained pending trial on his multiple-felony indictment for conduct worth 25 times less that amount.\n\nPersecuting the Left\u2019s foes and foils may be \u201csocial justice,\u201d but it is not justice. And a president who does not dispense justice is not fit to be president.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute.

Sounds as promising as his new \u201cenforcement first\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0make that last\u201d immigration plan.\n\nWe could go on about faithful execution of the laws, Obama-style: the non-recess recess appointments; the Justice Department\u2019s racially discriminatory civil-rights enforcement; the Solyndra \u201cgreen-energy\u201d boondoggle, featuring Obama\u2019s blatant misrepresentations of a publicly traded company\u2019s financial health and his subsequent override of a federal law meant to protect taxpayers \u2014 the better to shield his cronies from losses when the company inevitably collapsed. (Now that\u2019s Obamacare!) But such offenses are not the half of it. What is most breathtaking is the Obama administration\u2019s vindictiveness.\n\nIn late September 2012, the president and his myrmidons tirelessly labored to deceive the nation into believing the Benghazi Massacre they\u2019d recklessly bungled into was actually caused by an obscure, virtually unseen video \u2014 the trailer for an anti-Mohammed movie called Innocence of Muslims. Benghazi was not the only context for this duplicitous claim. For years, Obama and Secretary What Difference had colluded with Muslim-supremacist governments (the Organization of Islamic Cooperation) to \u201cwaive\u201d First Amendment protections in deference to sharia blasphemy standards that ban all negative criticism of Islam. Remember Obama at the U.N., just two weeks after our ambassador was murdered, proclaiming to the world that \u201cthe future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.\u201d\n\nWith his Benghazi story exploding, Obama needed a prop \u2014 someone to make an example of, someone to be sacrificed for the sake of the phony narrative. His minions dutifully set their sights on the hapless Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the Innocence of Muslims producer.\n\nA few years back, Nakoula had opened bank accounts using fake names and stolen Social Security numbers \u2014 again, crimes of the sort the Obama administration and the Republican establishment think we should overlook when committed by illegal aliens. The sentencing judge thought the crime so minimal that Nakoula spent only a year in jail before being sprung on \u201csupervised release\u201d \u2014 i.e., he was, like tens of thousands of former prisoners, free but under light monitoring by a probation officer.\n\n#page#After the Benghazi terrorist attack, it emerged that Nakoula had produced the scapegoat video. In theory, that activity was completely protected by constitutional free-speech principles; in practice, however, the administration was hell-bent on blaming the video and its maker for both the massacre and the violent proclivities of Islamic radicalism. Agents were thus dispatched to arrest Nakoula in the dead of night. He was grilled about making the film \u2014 meaning: He was interrogated about exercising his First Amendment rights. He was prosecuted for a \u201csupervised-release violation\u201d culled, in part, out of false statements about the production of the video. After being held without bail as a purported \u201cdanger to the community,\u201d Nakoula was sentenced to another year in prison \u2014 as much time as he\u2019d served for the underlying bank fraud.\n\nUnderstand, in normal law enforcement this never happens. Agents and prosecutors are supposed to be too busy with real crimes to probe non-suspects over activity that is palpably not criminal. Furthermore, nonviolent criminals suspected of, at best, petty supervised-release violations are not arrested \u2014 they are given summonses to appear in court on their own recognizance. They are not detained without bail but left at liberty until the court date. And rarely, absent commission of a serious new crime, are they sent to jail on a first supervised-release violation. Instead, the judge gives them a tongue-lashing, warns them to honor the supervised-release terms from now on, and sends them on their way. With jails overcrowded, it often takes three or four violations before a court will finally re-incarcerate a convict.\n\n#ad#But you don\u2019t get normal law enforcement if you run afoul of Obama and if your torment would have just the right in terrorem effect. Nakoula was too useful to pass up: For Americans, the administration framed him as the villain in its \u201cblame the video\u201d charade; for Muslims, he became Exhibit A of Obama\u2019s plan for people who dare \u201cslander the prophet of Islam.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us back to the unfortunate Dinesh D\u2019Souza: not just a prominent conservative and Christian activist, not just a harsh critic of progressivism and the academy, but a highly visible Obama detractor. D\u2019Souza is author of the Roots of Obama\u2019s Rage and co-producer of the equally controversial film 2016: Obama\u2019s America. They purport to trace the president\u2019s politics to the Communism and anti-colonialism of his father. While some commentators found the book insightful, it has also been panned, and not just from the left (see, e.g., Andrew Ferguson\u2019s scathing review in The Weekly Standard). Still, it was a big bestseller and, in conjunction with the movie, drew the ire of the White House, where you\u2019d be better off slandering the prophet of Islam than critiquing Obama.\n\nSo now the Obama administration has indicted D\u2019Souza for not one but two felony charges, arising out of alleged campaign-finance irregularities. Specifically, he is accused of corruptly reimbursing straw donors to the campaign of Wendy Long, Republican candidate in the New York Senate race \u2014 contributions D\u2019Souza could not lawfully make himself because he was already \u201cmaxed out\u201d at the $5,000 ceiling.\n\nI do not know D\u2019Souza well. I have no idea whether he made reimbursements, much less did so willfully. I have no doubt, though, that this is a manifestly vindictive prosecution. The $20,000 amount of the offense alleged is puny \u2014 a negligible fraction of the Solyndra scam and a figure that would not even register in comparison to the billions lost by victims who were told that if they liked their health-care plans they could keep them. It is the kind of case on which the government routinely declines criminal prosecution, handling, instead, by an administrative fine.\n\nD\u2019Souza has no criminal record. Moreover, contrary to myriad voter-fraud violations that Attorney General Holder will not lift a finger to pursue, the transactions at issue posed no conceivable threat to the integrity of the election process: Ms. Long lost by 46 points. As observed by no less than Harvard\u2019s Alan Dershowitz (an Obama supporter), \u201cThis is clearly a case of selective prosecution.\u201d There would, the professor added, be \u201cno room in jails for murderers\u201d if the Justice Department made a practice of such prosecutions.\n\nEven more offensive, to my mind, is count two \u2014 the charge of making false statements to the government. To commit the species of campaign-finance violation alleged in count one, the defendant necessarily must cause the straw donor to file a false contribution report with the Federal Election Commission. That is, you cannot commit the donation offense without simultaneously committing the false-statement offense. For the government to charge both smacks of double jeopardy: being twice prosecuted for the same, single offense.\n\nWhy such a heavy-handed indictment? Because Congress deemed campaign-finance violations worth less than $25,000 to be so trivial that a maximum jail sentence of only two years is prescribed (see Title 2, U.S. Code, Sec. 437g(d)(1)(D)). You can also be certain the sentencing guidelines would prescribe no jail time at all. Yet, by gratuitously piling on another felony, Obama and Holder portray D\u2019Souza as a serious crook and subject him to the onerous potential of seven years in prison \u2014 all for an episode that ordinarily would not be prosecuted at all.\n\nAs Legal Insurrection\u2019s Bill Jacobson notes, the 2008 Obama campaign was caught illegally hiding not $20,000 but nearly $2 million in irregular contributions (in addition to dragging its feet on the return of millions more in suspect donations). You probably don\u2019t remember that because \u2014 I know this will shock you \u2014 the Obama Justice Department didn\u2019t prosecute anyone. It was considered a mere hiccup: resolved by a fine considerably smaller than the $500,000 in bail D\u2019Souza was forced to post lest he be detained pending trial on his multiple-felony indictment for conduct worth 25 times less that amount.\n\nPersecuting the Left\u2019s foes and foils may be \u201csocial justice,\u201d but it is not justice. And a president who does not dispense justice is not fit to be president.\n\n\u2014 Andrew C. McCarthy is a senior fellow at the National Review Institute.

After all, the poor fellow didn\u2019t do anything wrong \u2014 not really. He just wanted to participate fully in our national life, in our democratic process. He didn\u2019t want to hide \u2014 he was forced to take cover by our draconian, inhumane campaign-finance laws.\n\nMr. D\u2019Souza\u2019s real crime, the only offense that really matters in Washington these days, is being an Obama critic. Oh, they say he borrowed a couple of people\u2019s names, but his real mistake was doing it in the Wendy Long Senate campaign. For Obama 2008 donors, borrowing other people\u2019s names seems to have been a requirement.\n\n#ad#And look, it\u2019s not like every moment of D\u2019Souza\u2019s presence in this country has been a violation of law \u2014 even if it does rub the regime the wrong way. Nor does his day-to-day life ooze identity theft, tax evasion, bank fraud, Social Security fraud, Medicaid fraud, Medicare fraud, food-stamps fraud, and the like. Those crimes, instead, fill out the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of our \u201cundocumented\u201d legions. So ubiquitous is illegal-alien crime that the benumbed Beltway ruling class \u2014 very much including its Republican-establishment division \u2014 now just shrugs and says, What difference, at this point, does it make?\n\nWhy no difference for them but a life-altering difference for D\u2019Souza? Because he\u2019s not among the favored outlaws of our law-unto-himself president.\n\nIf you\u2019re on the team, \u201camnesty\u201d does not begin to describe the immunity windfall. Sic the IRS on American citizens in order to frustrate their participation in election campaigns? No worries\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0and no prosecutions, not even for officials who take the Fifth in congressional testimony because they believe answering questions will confirm their criminality. Case closed: No need even to interview the victims, innocent people who were nonetheless intimidated by the prospect of audits, fines, civil lawsuits, criminal prosecution, and, above all, prohibitive legal fees \u2014 the wages of both compliance and resistance. After all, the victims opposed Obama. As they say at Alinsky, Inc.: \u201cWe won, get over it.\u201d\n\nBenghazi? Remember: The serial derelictions of the president\u2019s duty to protect Americans under siege? Obama\u2019s instigation of an unauthorized war with no vital American interests at stake \u2014 a war that empowered anti-American jihadists? The NATO campaign that abetted the Qaddafi murder \u2014 notwithstanding the ban on assassinations of heads of state and our government\u2019s prior representation that Qaddafi was an important U.S. counterterrorism ally? Oh well\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0as so memorably put between chuckles by Secretary \u201cWhat Difference\u201d herself: \u201cWe came, we saw, he died!\u201d On to the minimum wage.\n\nThen there\u2019s the gargantuan Obamacare con job: the sedulous administration lying, the willfully false lulling, the law\u2019s unconstitutional enactment, the lawlessly imperial \u201cwaivers,\u201d the shameful subsidies to buy off members of Congress and their staffs, the unlawful IRS enforcement in states that declined to participate, the transparent campaign to usher in a single-payer government takeover by breaking the health-care insurance system. It is the most massive fraud in American history, and there will be no investigations or prosecutions. Take heart, though: Republicans have a plan that is right on schedule to repeal Obamacare by, oh, around 2024, the same year Paul Ryan\u2019s boffo budget plan brings Leviathan\u2019s ledgers into balance.
