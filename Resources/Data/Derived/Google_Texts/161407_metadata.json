Harrison\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2013 It\u2019s nice to know that there can be fun in Congress, and not only partisan wrangling.\n\nThe U.S. Senators from Oregon are betting their colleagues from Ohio on the big college football game, with the winners of the bet to collect their due on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe national championship game Monday night between Ohio State and Oregon will also be a contest between Oregon\u2019s U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley on one side and Ohio\u2019s U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman on the other. Wyden, Merkley and Brown are Democrats. Portman is a Republican\n\n\u201cIf Oregon beats Ohio State on Jan. 12, Senators Brown and Portman have agreed to learn how to \u201cthrow the O\u201d sign with instructions from their Oregon colleagues and from the Oregon Duck if and when the Ducks visit Washington, DC as national champions,\u201d Wyden said\n\nOn the other hand, if Ohio State defeats Oregon, Senators Wyden and Merkley have agreed to help their Ohio colleagues spell \u201cO-H-I-O.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make this wager in full confidence that Oregon will win Monday night with its high-octane offense led by Heisman winner Marcus Mariota and its swarming, ball-hawking defense,\u201d Wyden and Merkley said. \u201cAnd we of course look forward to showing our friends from Ohio how to make the universal symbol for Ducks\u2019 dominance.\n\n\u201cAs a proud alum of The Ohio State University \u2013 I look forward to watching the Buckeyes bring home the first ever college football playoff championship,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe waterfowl of Eugene will put up a strong and respectable effort but will ultimately migrate back to Oregon empty handed. I accept Sens. Wyden and Merkley\u2019s wager and look forward to helping them spell out the name of our great state after the game. Go Bucks!\u201d\n\n*\n\nUnited States Senate\n\nLIQUID NATURAL GAS \u2014 U.S. Senator Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) has joined Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) and Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico) to introduce the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. The bipartisan bill would speed up the approval process for exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to countries which do not have free trade agreements with the United States. Prior to approving applications to export natural gas to countries which do not have free trade agreements with the United States, the Secretary of Energy must make a public interest determination which includes a public comment period. The LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act specifically requires a decision on any LNG export application within 45 days after the environmental review document for the project is published.\n\n*\n\nPETRAEUS PROSECUTION \u2013U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California), on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program on Sunday, Jan. 11, said former CIA Director General David Petraeus has \u201csuffered enough\u201d in the wake of the discovery that he allegedly leaked classified documents to Paula Broadwell, his mistress and biographer. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t perfect. He made a mistake. He lost his job as CIA director because of it. I mean, how much do you want to punish somebody? It\u2019s done. It\u2019s over. He\u2019s retired. He\u2019s lost his job. How much does [the] government want?\u201d She responded to a question about the U.S. Justice Department considering bringing more charges against Petraeus.\n\n*\n\nBOOKER SWEARING-IN \u2014 Ezra Friedlander is an Orthodox Jew who handles public relations, media strategy, and the staging of events for non-profit organizations in the greater New York area and in Washington D.C. Many of his clients represent Jewish causes, particularly but not exclusively in the Orthodox community. In the Sunday e-mailbox of San Diego Jewish World we found two examples of Friedlander\u2019s work: A congratulatory photo of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) with Sen. Charles Schumer (D-New York) and Friedlander following the former Newark mayor\u2019s first swearing-in for a full 6-year Senate term. Another item from Friedlander told of Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop being honored by the Hudson County (N.J.) Jewish Business Alliance, recently formed by David Rosenberg to enable small business owners to network with elected officials. Fulop, described by Englander as a rising star in New Jersey politics, evidently was pleased by the gathering at the Fabuwood headquarters in Jersey City. He commented: \u201cWorking with our small businesses is one of the ways we will ensure Jersey City continues to grow and advance. It was a productive meeting and a great opportunity to get to know many of our local business owners and listen to their ideas.\u201d\n\nHouse of Representatives\n\nREDISTRICTING \u2014 U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee) has reintroduced the John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting (FAIR) Act to take the decennial congressional apportionment process, which often leads to partisan gerrymandering, out of the hands of politicians and give it to an independent redistricting commission. Congressman Cohen also introduced the FAIR Act in the 113th Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s time to take politics out of the redistricting process,\u201d said Congressman Cohen. \u201cCongress is so polarized today that we\u2019re unable to find common ground on the major issues facing our country. Instead of solving our nation\u2019s problems, Congress is just kicking the can down the road and waiting until the next election for answers. I believe that if we eliminate the gerrymandering of districts we will help get more accomplished for our country.\u201d\n\n*\n\nWOMEN\u2019S CAUCUS \u2014 Congresswoman Lois Frankel (D-Florida) has been elected Vice Chair of the Congressional Women\u2019s Caucus for the 114th Congress. \u201cFor more than 30 years, the Women\u2019s Caucus has championed women\u2019s issues in our country and around the globe \u2013 putting aside partisanship and embracing collaboration,\u201d said Congresswoman Frankel. \u201cI look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve the lives of women and families.\u201d Reps. Kristi Noem (R-South Dakota) and Doris O. Matsui (D-California) will serve as Co-Chairs. Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Indiana) will be the Republican counterpart to Congresswoman Frankel, both serving as Vice Chairs. Founded in 1977, the Congressional Women\u2019s Caucus has been a leading advocate on issues advancing the lives of women and families. Caucus members have helped pass legislation on tougher child support.\n\n*\n\nGREAT LAKES \u2014 U.S. Rep. Sander Levin has joined a bipartisan group of House lawmakers in introducing the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2015, which continues the work of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative created by the Obama Administration in 2010. \u201cOver the last six years, Congress has provided more than $1.9 billion for the GLRI, which funds restoration efforts in the Lakes, including cleaning up toxic hotspots; fighting aquatic invasive species, like the Asian carp; restoring critical habitat; and addressing polluted runoff that contributes to beach closures and harmful algal blooms in the Lakes,\u201d Levin said. enforcement, promoting women\u2019s health, helping women business owners, and protecting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.\n\n*\n\nHEALTH CARE \u2014 Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Illinois) introduced the Public Option Deficit Reduction Act. This bill would create a publicly run health insurance plan that would be available in every Obamacare marketplace, an option that would save $158 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pursue legislation that builds upon Obamacare,\u201d Schakowsky said. \u201cThe Public Option Deficit Reduction Act is just that type of legislation. It would save consumers even more money, offering premiums that are 5 to 7 percent lower than private insurance plans and decreasing our deficit by $158 billion over 10 years. The public option means more transparent, lower-cost health care for Americans. This would be a win for consumers, taxpayers and our economy.\u201d\n\n*\n\nCalifornia State Legislature\n\nBULLET TRAIN \u2014 \u201cHigh speed rail won\u2019t just benefit travelers,\u201d says Assemblyman Richard Bloom. \u201cIt has the potential to stimulate economic development across our state, especially in areas such as the Central Valley. The bullet train represents a new mode of transportation that, once complete, will allow riders to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco quickly and without dependence on carbon emitting fossil-fuels. Other countries that have built high speed rail systems, such as Spain, Japan and France, have seen dramatic changes in the ways in which travelers move between destinations, shifting away from less environmentally-friendly modes of transport, such as cars and airplanes. As our economy grows, the demand for travel, both business and leisure, will continue to increase. Our current transportation infrastructure has become strained, with airports such as LAX struggling to meet demand. When voters approved bond funding for high speed rail, they made it clear that they are ready for this modern, greener mode of transportation. Building the bullet train is an investment in California\u2019s future.\u201d\n\n*\n\nPortions of this column dealing with Jewish women in the Congress are sponsored by Jane Galinson in memory of her father Murray Galinson.\n\n*\n\nHarrison is editor of San Diego Jewish World.
