He was ordered to serve three years on probation, perform 45 days of community service and attend 52 drug and alcohol counseling sessions.\n\nGreen, whose real name is Thomas DeCarlo Callaway, did not attend the hearing.\n\nGreen, 40, won a Grammy for the hit \"Forget You.\" He also appeared as a judge on the NBC competition show \"The Voice\" and left the show after he was charged.\n\nAfter entering the no-contest plea, Green posted a series of messages on Twitter, including one that read: \"Women who have really been raped REMEMBER!!!\" Green later tweeted an apology, but the statements led to the cancellation of a reality show and several concert appearances.\n\nProsecutors rejected a rape count against Green when he was charged with the felony drug charge in October 2013. His attorney Blair Berk has said Green had consensual sex with the woman to whom he gave ecstasy.\n\n___\n\nAnthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judge ends CeeLo Green's supervised probation in drug case - AP News: LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge removed CeeLo Green from .05/27/2016 3:38:09AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge removed CeeLo Green from supervised probation on Wednesday after", "title": "AP News - Judge ends CeeLo Green's supervised probation in drug case", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2016/04/13/judge-ends-ceelo-greens-supervised-probation-in-drug-case-n2148047", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\104\\637010b4-a3e2-4155-8c2f-fd704250b903.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge removed CeeLo Green from supervised probation on Wednesday after", "title": "AP News - Judge ends CeeLo Green's supervised probation in drug case", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/us/2016/04/13/judge-ends-ceelo-greens-supervised-probation-in-drug-case-n2148047", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/104/637010b4-a3e2-4155-8c2f-fd704250b903.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Judge ends CeeLo Green's supervised probation in drug case, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Prosecutors rejected a rape count against Green when he was charged with the felony drug charge in October 2013.\nHe was ordered to serve three years on probation, perform 45 days of community service and attend 52 drug and alcohol counseling sessions.\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge removed CeeLo Green from supervised probation on Wednesday after saying the singer had complied with his sentence in a felony drug case that involved giving a woman ecstasy during a 2012 dinner.\nDuring a hearing, Superior Court Judge David Herriford agreed with a recommendation from probation officials that Green no longer needed to report to a probation officer.\nGreen surpassed the number of community service hours he was required to perform and was praised for having a cooperative attitude in his final probation report."}
