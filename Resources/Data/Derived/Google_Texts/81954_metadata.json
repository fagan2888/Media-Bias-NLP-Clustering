Burke came close when he said the Democratic Party was in danger of becoming a \u201cparty of death.\u201d Bishop Michael J. Sheridan of Colorado Springs has repeatedly suggested that Catholics shouldn\u2019t be able to receive Communion if they vote for politicians who differ from church teaching on a few \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d matters: abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, same-sex marriage \u2014 and more recently, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate.\n\nThe most intense call to the ballot box came from Peoria Bishop Daniel R. Jenky, a Holy Cross priest who referred to the \u201ccalculated disdain of the president of the United States\u201d in a homily ahead of the 2012 presidential election. \u201cHitler and Stalin, at their better moments,\u2019\u2019 Jenky said, \u201cwould just barely tolerate some churches remaining open, but would not tolerate any competition with the state in education, social services, and health care. In clear violation of our First Amendment rights, Barack Obama \u2014 with his radical pro-abortion and extreme secularist agenda \u2014 now seems intent on following a similar path.\u201d\n\nNone of the protests that followed claimed that Jenky hadn\u2019t made himself clear.\n\nNow, though, the red papal loafer may be on the other foot, with economic conservatives being called out.\n\nIn Washington this week, the cardinal some consider the pontiff\u2019s \u201cvice-pope\u2019\u2019 mocked them outright at a conference called \u201cErroneous Autonomy: The Catholic Case against Libertarianism.\u201d The Religion News Service story on the smackdown of trickle-down ran under the headline, \u201cCatholic and libertarian? Pope\u2019s top adviser says they\u2019re incompatible.\u201d\n\nThat adviser, Cardinal Oscar Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga, the archbishop of Tegucigalpa, Honduras, was introduced by AFL-CIO president Richard L. Trumka, and preached against deregulation and \u201cworshipping idols, even if that idol is called \u2018market economy.\u2019 \u2019\u2019 Rodr\u00edguez also called trickle-down economics a \u201cdeception,\u2019\u2019 and said the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the market steals from and strangles the poor: \u201cWe are no longer to trust the blind forces and the invisible hand of the market. This economy kills. This is what the pope is saying.\u201d\n\nSome libertarians have described the pope\u2019s economic views as naive and uninformed \u2014 and Rodr\u00edguez returned the favor. \u201cMany of these libertarianists do not read the social doctrine of the church, but now they are trembling before the book of Picketty,\u2019\u2019 he said, referring to French economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s best-seller, \u201cCapital in the Twenty-first Century,\u201d on the wealth disparities that have us headed into a new Gilded Age.\n\nIn some ways, the fight is over competing interpretations of the American story, said Meghan J. Clark, a moral theologian from St. John\u2019s University. The libertarian telling of that story stars a frontiersman who carves the American West out of nothing, in radical autonomy, with only a hunting knife. Only, doesn\u2019t that self-made man creating something out of nothing sound a lot like God? \u201cThat\u2019s the [Catholic] problem with libertarianism,\u2019\u2019 Clark said. \u201cIt depends upon a human person who creates himself, and there\u2019s no way to make that harmonious with Christ.\u201d\n\nThe economy created by all those frontiersfolk is the unfettered free market, and Pope Francis himself recently reiterated his view that it is \u201can inhumane system. I didn\u2019t hesitate to write in . . . \u201cEvangelii Gaudium\u2019 (\u201cThe Joy of the Gospel\u201d) that this economic system kills,\u2019\u2019 Francis told reporters on his plane en route to Rome from Jerusalem. \u201cAnd I repeat this.\u201d\n\nOf course, Pope Benedict XVI, too, spoke out against \u201cthe prevalence of a selfish and individualistic mindset which also finds expression in an unregulated financial capitalism.\u201d Pope Francis may or may not even know who the budget-cutting Catholic Congressman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) is.\n\nIt\u2019s Francis\u2019s constant refrain, however, that we walk with Christ by staying close to the poor. And Tuesday\u2019s \u201cErroneous Autonomy\u201d conference was without any doubt an attack on the politics of Ryan and other potential Republican presidential candidates, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who describes himself as \u201clibertarianish,\u201d and his fellow tea party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).\n\nThe Rev. Robert A. Sirico, of the Michigan-based libertarian Acton Institute, said the conference seemed designed to \u201ccreate a straw man, shoot it down, and make political hay,\u201d but did not accurately define or reflect views held by any but the most \u201cextreme Randians or anarchists.\u201d Not only is the market far from unfettered, he said, but there\u2019s evidence that its expansion lifts people up rather than leaving them behind.\n\nHe was invited to come and sit in the audience and be instructed, he said, but no libertarian Catholic was asked to speak or sit on a panel at the day-long event.\n\nOne of the conference organizers, Michael Sean Winters, whose anti-libertarian work the cardinal quoted extensively at the top of his remarks, said the event was very consciously not a debate, in the same way that during the Cold War, \u201cthe objective wasn\u2019t to dialogue with communism; it was to defeat it.\u201d\n\nThe meeting wasn\u2019t partisan, he said, since majorities in both parties hold some libertarian, \u201cleave-me-alone\u201d beliefs, with Democrats shooing government out of the bedroom and Republicans out of every other sphere of life. And \u201cthe Catholic critique isn\u2019t based on economics; we think they\u2019re wrong about what it means to be a human person.\u201d\n\nSteve Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies, which sponsored the conference, argued that like Christianity, libertarianism \u201coffers a comprehensive worldview that informs ethics and art, lifestyles and culture, and even relationships and psychologies. Surely it\u2019s as evident in a NARAL woman\u2019s claim that \u2018It\u2019s my body,\u2019 in the art of the \u2018selfie,\u2019 and in the doomsday prepper\u2019s fantasy of self-reliance, as it is in rancher Cliven Bundy\u2019s claim that common grazing land is \u2018my property.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBishop Blase Cupich of Spokane, Wash., argued that libertarianism is a direct threat to faith: \u201cOur ability to call people to believe in a gracious God\u201d is compromised, he said in an interview, if \u201cthe cards are stacked against\u201d the poor.\n\nSuch gentle, theological warnings against both the excesses of autonomy and of the free market are a far cry from Bishop Jenky\u2019s Hitler references.\n\nYet on the political front, it\u2019s worth remembering that recent attempts to herd Catholic voters haven\u2019t gone well, and may even have backfired; despite the efforts of a number of American bishops to cast President Obama as \u201cpro-abortion\u201d and anti-Catholic, he won the Catholic vote in 2008 and 2012.\n\nAnd at election time, it\u2019s unclear that the \u201cyou can\u2019t be Catholic and libertarian\u201d argument would work any better than \u201cyou can\u2019t be Catholic and pro-choice\u2019\u2019 has.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Catholics, libertarianism, Pope Francis, Cardinal Oscar Rodriguez Maradiaga, Richard Trumka, Evangelii Gaudium, The Joy of the Gospel, Paul Ryan, Pope Benedict XVI, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Michael Sean Winters, National Catholic Reporter, Meghan J.
