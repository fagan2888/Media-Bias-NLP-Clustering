Chris Swain, a 6-foot-1, 245-pound fullback, had a pair of short-yardage scores for the Midshipmen (4-0).\n\nIt was Navy\u2019s largest margin of victory in the series since 1978.\n\nAir Force (2-2) committed a season-high four turnovers, all in Navy territory. Karson Roberts, who was just 5 for 12 for 73 yards with an interception, ran for his team\u2019s lone touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nNow in its 44th year, the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Trophy is presented annually to the winner of the football games among the three major service academies \u2014 Army, Navy and Air Force. The Falcons won the trophy last season after beating Navy 30-21 and Army 23-6.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Keenan Reynolds leads Navy football past Air Force", "title": "Keenan Reynolds leads Navy football past Air Force", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/03/keenan-reynolds-leads-navy-football-past-air-force/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-03T17:26:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-03T17:26:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccae8\"", "article_summary": "Now in its 44th year, the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Trophy is presented annually to the winner of the football games among the three major service academies \u2014 Army, Navy and Air Force.\n\u2014 Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds ran for 117 of his 183 yards in the first half and the Midshipmen began their quest to reclaim the Commander-in-Chief\u2019s Trophy with a 33-11 victory over Air Force on Saturday.\nThe Falcons won the trophy last season after beating Navy 30-21 and Army 23-6.\nReynolds completed 4 of 10 passes for 117 yards with a touchdown on a wet, windy day.\nAir Force (2-2) committed a season-high four turnovers, all in Navy territory."}
