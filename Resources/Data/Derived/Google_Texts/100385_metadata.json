Lathrop said the union would not be making demands that will surprise the chains when the negotiations start.\n\n\u201cIt won't change much,\u201d Lathrop said of UFCW's negotiating strategies. \u201cWe still want to hold on to our affordable care, solidify our pensions and maybe get our members a raise.\u201d\n\nThe three major chains have, over the course of the last three contracts, bargained as a group, and Lathrop expects that format will remain when talks begin in February.\n\nStater Bros. Markets usually negotiates with the union separately.\n\nKendra Doyel, vice president for public affairs at Ralphs, confirmed the start of talks in an email.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to working together to reach a fair agreement for sustainable jobs for the future,\u201d Doyel said in the email.\n\nThe union contract covers workers at about 700 stores, from the Central Valley to the Mexican border, including 377 in Orange County, about 70 in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and 12 in Long Beach. More than 20,000 grocery workers in the area are covered by these deals.\n\nBoth sides are mindful of the situation that boiled over into a 141-day labor dispute in 2003 and 2004 when contract talks quickly became acrimonious.\n\nVons locked out its employees in October 2003, and the union countered that by calling a strike at Ralphs and Albertsons.\n\nBy the time the clash ended in March 2004, picket lines in front of the three chains and most of their distribution centers had cost them an estimated $2 billion in lost sales.\n\nWorkers, most of whom were not paid much more than $15 per hour, were forced to live on small union-funded strike benefits for 4\u00bd months.\n\nIt was widely regarded as the highest profile and most damaging labor dispute in Southern California in the last half-century.\n\nThe two rounds of negotiations that followed, in 2007 and 2011, were ultimately successful but not easy. In 2011, the two sides agreed to extend the contract when it expired in March, but it took more than six months after that, with help from a federal mediator, to reach an agreement.\n\nThe cost of health care and the deductibles workers were asked to shoulder for medical insurance were considered the biggest issues.\n\nRalphs had said they would close all their stores in the event of a strike, and Albertsons and Vons were openly recruiting replacement workers.\n\nWhen the deal was finally reached in September 2011, insiders said the two sides were possibly less than an hour away from throwing up their hands and dealing with a walkout.\n\nChanges in the overall situation in Southern California since then include a better economy and the advent of the Affordable Care Act. Lathrop, the Local 1167 president, believes this round of talks will be different.\n\n\u201cI do believe that the companies are doing fine, although they always have been reluctant to let go of any money,\u201d Lathrop said. \u201cBut the economy is pulling out of it, and I think they see that.\u201d\n\nKroger, the parent company of Ralphs and Food 4 Less, reported a net profit of $299 million in its most recent quarter. Safeway, the corporate parent of Vons and Pavilions, had more than $65 million in profit.\n\nAlbertsons, which had been owned by Minnesota-based Supervalu, was one of several chains sold to investor group Cerberus Capital Management last year. The deal was for $100 million in cash, and the buyer assumes about $3.2 billion in debt.\n\nHowever, some recent contract talks across the country, in the Seattle and New York City areas, went down to the wire before a deal was announced, much like the 2011 scenario in Southern California.\n\nThe Albertsons sale underscores some of the changes the grocery industry has seen in the last few years. The chain, which had been struggling, closed five inland stores in 2012.\n\nA few weeks ago, the chain's new owner announced it was shuttering 26 more Albertsons stores nationwide.\n\nAt the same time, the lingering effect of the recession has given rise to discount grocery chains such as Family Dollar and WinCo increasing their footprints.\n\nAldi, a Chicago-based discount supermarket chain, recently received approval from Moreno Valley planning officials for a distribution center. Aldi plans a West Coast expansion but has not announced any store sites.\n\nIt adds up to a supermarket landscape with new players, most of which do not have workers represented by unions \u2013 a factor they use to keep prices low. It is something that management of the traditional groceries will be taking into account as talks with UFCW begin.\n\n\u201cThe employers will be working to negotiate a contract that makes economic sense for the companies and our employees in an increasingly challenging marketplace,\u201d Carlos Illingworth, a Vons spokesman, said in an emailed statement.", "article_metadata": {"geo.placename": "Santa Ana", "geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "business", "description": "Business: Grocers, union ready for another round | union, workers, most, chains, lathrop, albertsons, contract, talks, last, vons", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "JACK KATZANEK", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Southern California's three largest supermarket chains and the union that represents most of their employees will move to the negotiating table in about a week, renewing what has been, for more than a decade, usually a dramatic and difficult process.", "title": "Grocers, union prepare for new talks", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/union-599995-workers-most.html", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/n0fcs5-b781258450z.120140203063547000g831iaua5.2.jpg", "locale": "en-US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ocregister", "image": {"src": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/n0fcs5-b781258450z.120140203063547000g831iaua5.2.jpg"}, "description": "Southern California's three largest supermarket chains and the union that represents most of their employees will move to the negotiating table in about a week, renewing what has been, for more than a", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Grocers, union prepare for new talks"}, "content_author": "JACK KATZANEK", "fb": {"app_id": 107698536003308}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/thumb/n0fcs5-b781258450z.120140203063547000g831iaua5.2.jpg", "content_type": "article", "ICBM": "33.745573, -117.867834", "Keywords": "union, workers, most, chains, lathrop, albertsons, contract, talks, last, vons", "publication_date": "2014-02-03", "access-type": "free", "section": "business", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "content_title": "Grocers, union prepare for new talks"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1766\"", "article_summary": "Both sides are mindful of the situation that boiled over into a 141-day labor dispute in 2003 and 2004 when contract talks quickly became acrimonious.\nLathrop said the union would not be making demands that will surprise the chains when the negotiations start.\nIt is something that management of the traditional groceries will be taking into account as talks with UFCW begin.\nVons locked out its employees in October 2003, and the union countered that by calling a strike at Ralphs and Albertsons.\nKendra Doyel, vice president for public affairs at Ralphs, confirmed the start of talks in an email."}
