Now a post-doc resident at Horizon, Kim works under Saira A. Jan, Horizon\u2019s director of clinical pharmacy management and a clinical professor at the Rutgers pharmacy school.\n\nBorn and raised in New Jersey, Kim, 24, speaks both English and Korean. Since mid-2013, she\u2019s recruited nearly 40 Rutgers pharmacy student to volunteer at community health events to help New Jerseyans make sense of health care lingo and the complexities of signing up for health insurance. Several of the pharmacy student volunteers are bi-lingual, in Korean or Spanish.\n\nKim said she was motivated to become a health literacy advocate after closely following the 2010 passage and subsequent rollout of the Affordable Care Act and realizing, \u201cI was confused about the ACA myself\u201d \u2014 even though she\u2019s spent six years in pharmacy school and has worked in a retail pharmacy.\n\nClick here to subscribe to NJBIZ's e-newsletters\n\nThe Rutgers pharmacy students have participated in several community health fairs around the state, including the annual health fair sponsored by the Korean Medical Program of Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, which in September drew about 1,500 members of the state\u2019s Korean-American community. In October the students were at a Halloween event at Great Adventure, introducing health care concepts to young adults. This Saturday, Kim and other Rutgers pharmacy students will be at the Woodbridge Mall for Horizon\u2019s \u201cInsure-A-Thon,\u201d an event aimed at encouraging uninsured New Jerseyans to get covered.\n\nHorizon spokesman Tom Vincz said the community outreach partnership with Rutgers is \u201cone of many examples of how Horizon works with New Jersey organizations, and New Jersey\u2019s best and brightest, to improve health care understanding, access and quality for our state\u2019s diversity-rich population.\u201d\n\nKim said the program is helping the state\u2019s ethnic communities while also providing on-the-ground education for the pharmacy students, who like other health care professionals \u201cneed to be able to understand a person\u2019s culture and traditions, so we can understand where they are coming from to help us better manage their health.\u201d\n\nShe said the students aren\u2019t marketing Horizon products, but are \u201cgoing out into the community to create awareness about the benefits of health insurance. The goal is to empower individuals so they have the information to make the right decision for themselves.\u201d\n\nFor many of the uninsured, she said being able to afford coverage is a challenge; the students talk about how to weigh the costs and benefits. Under the ACA, individuals who buy health insurance at HealthCare.gov can get federal subsidies to make the coverage more affordable; the subsidies are on a sliding scale, phasing out entirely at four times the federal poverty level or about $46,000 for an individual.\n\nThe students explain how deductibles and co-pays work, and help individuals find a plan that covers any medications they\u2019re taking. They also talk up the importance of regular screenings to identify and manage chronic diseases, like high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nKim said the students explain the differences among the various levels of coverage available on HealthCare.gov, \u201cand help people understand, if you have a specific disease and you go more frequently to the doctor, maybe plan A won\u2019t be as great as plan B.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think having students who speak their language talk to them about the importance of health insurance and health in general\u201d is a key value of the program, she said.\n\n\u201cWhen people are able to speak with someone who understands their culture \u2014 that really opens up their hearts to the students. And that gives us the opportunity to really sit down with them and take time to discuss this,\u201d she said.\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nNJBIZ presents the 24 Lists of Christmas, Day 3: Top Engineering Firms\n\nDoctors' offices must be wary of data breaches as use of electronic records grows\n\nPort Authority's $7.8B budget focuses on infrastructure", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Improving health literacy among New Jersey's diverse ethnic populations \u2014 and helping the uninsured get health coverage \u2014 is the goal of a community outreach collaboration among Rutgers U", "title": "Rutgers, Horizon BCBSNJ partner to improve health literacy among N.J.'s ethnic population | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20141205/NJBIZ01/141209820/rutgers-horizon-bcbsnj-partner-to-improve-health-literacy-among-njs-ethnic-population", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20141205/NJBIZ01/141209820/AR/0/AR-141209820.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Improving health literacy among New Jersey's diverse ethnic populations \u2014 and helping the uninsured get health coverage \u2014 is the goal of a community outreach collaboration among Rutgers U", "creator": "@bethfitzgerald8", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20141205/NJBIZ01/141209820/AR/0/AR-141209820.jpg"}, "title": "Rutgers, Horizon BCBSNJ partner to improve health literacy among N.J.'s ethnic population | NJBIZ", "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Improving health literacy among New Jersey's diverse ethnic populations \u2014 and helping the uninsured get health coverage \u2014 is the goal of a community outreach collaboration among Rutgers University pharmacy students and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc84d\"", "article_summary": "Now a post-doc resident at Horizon, Kim works under Saira A.
