In response to Doug Burgum's slick TV ads on Wayne Stenehjem supporting

Obamacare, my wife summed it up like this:

"Wayne Stenehjem has always looked out for North Dakota people. When Obamacare was implemented and forced upon America, our state legislature decided not to implement an

Obamacare Exchange, like many other states. When Wayne saw that North Dakota families

and individuals would not be able to afford health insurance, he reached across

party lines in the case known as KING vs BURWELL. If that lawsuit would have

been successful, it would have eliminated the credits to help low-income families

pay health insurance premiums. Wayne has always opposed Obamacare but this

law was not the way to eliminate it. Wayne Stenehjem has always looked out for

our best interests."

Nicely put by my wife, Cathy.

As a North Dakota farm boy I say it like this: The Obamacare bull was let out of

the corral by Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and President Obama. In 2010, Obama signed it into law. Attorney General Stenehjem signed on early with a Florida lawsuit to block it.

He, along with other AGs, opposed it since it was — and still is — unconstitutional.

I'm dealing with it now, however, and I'm glad Stenehjem's action allowed the credits

to keep coming so I can pay premiums for coverage. If the King vs Burwell

lawsuit would have been successful, I wouldn't have health insurance.

I'm grateful to Stenehjem for making this Obamacare bull better suited to my

needs.

I believe Doug Burgum means well and is a great guy, but he

needs to get off the Obamacare bull, because he will be riding this bull off into

the sunset. Come the day after the election in November, we will experience the

most beautiful sunrise we ever have seen as we welcome our new governor,

Wayne Stenehjem, into his new office.
