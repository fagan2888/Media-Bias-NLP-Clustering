But Republican voters won\u2019t follow suit. Instead, they are likely to cast their votes largely based on who looks most committed to repealing President Obama\u2019s tenuously perched signature legislation.\n\nThe only two candidates at the debate who mentioned Obamacare as anything more than an afterthought were Scott Walker and Ted Cruz. Walker said that \u201cyou start on day one with repealing Obamacare. I'm the only one on this stage that\u2019s actually got a plan, introduced an actual plan to repeal Obamacare on day one.\u201d In his last words of the debate, Cruz said, \u201cYou want to know what I\u2019ll do as president? It is real simple. We\u2019ll kill the terrorists, we\u2019ll repeal Obamacare, and we will defend the Constitution, every single word of it.\u201d\n\nAt an event sponsored by Heritage Action on Friday, Cruz took another important step in positioning himself as a candidate focused on repeal. He charged that \u201cmost of the other candidates aren\u2019t willing to fight the fight to repeal Obamacare.\u201d Heritage Action CEO Mike Needham then asked him, \u201cDo you support a refundable tax credit as part of a replacement to Obamacare.\u201d Cruz replied that he is \u201copen to considering\u201d such an approach, \u201cas long as it\u2019s consistent with those principles that I laid out\u201d\u2014that is, \u201cempowering patients\u2026not a government bureaucrat.\u201d\n\nThis is big news, because it has been clear for a long time (for reasons detailed here) that any conservative alternative that can pave the way to full repeal must feature a refundable tax credit. If Cruz were to propose such a tax credit, he would undoubtedly propose one that isn\u2019t income-tested, is refreshingly simple, encourages the use of health savings accounts, minimizes the role of the IRS, is genuinely a tax credit and not a subsidy to insurance companies, would cut federal spending in dramatic fashion, and would cut taxes even versus the pre-Obamacare status quo.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "2016 Elections,Health Care,Jeffrey H.
