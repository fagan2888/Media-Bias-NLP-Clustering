The WalletHub study still shows that whites in Connecticut are much more likely to be insured than blacks or Hispanics.

With the third open-enrollment period for health insurance upon us and 11.7 percent of the U.S. population still lacking coverage, the personal finance website WalletHub conducted an in-depth analysis of 2015’s States with the Highest & Lowest Uninsured Rates.

For the second year in a row, WalletHub’s analysts drew upon the most reliable data to estimate the rates of uninsured pre- and post-Obamacare for the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

For a broad perspective of those rates, they broke the national figures down to the state level and other categories, including age, race and income level.

When it comes to having the most uninsured residents, Massachusetts was No. 1 with 3.28 percent uninsured, followed by Vermont, 4.95 percent, Hawaii, 5.27 percent, D.C., 5.28 percent, and Minnesota, 5.88 percent.

Connecticut was No. 7 as 6.93 percent of residents were uninsured in 2014. More than 74,000 residents have registered for insurance since 2010, according to the report.

Health Insurance Coverage in Connecticut:

Obamacare reduced the adult uninsured rate by 28.50 percent between 2010 and 2014.

The uninsured rate for whites is 50.92 percent lower than that for blacks.

The uninsured rate for whites is 72.00 percent lower than that for Hispanics.

The uninsured rate for higher-income households is 60.98 percent lower than that for lower-income households.

The rate of publicly insured is 31.77 percent.

The rate of privately insured is 68.23 percent.

The rate of employer-based health insurance coverage decreased by -3.50 percent between 2010 and 2014.

The uninsured rate pre-Obamacare was 9.09 percent and has fallen to a current rate of 6.93 percent, with 74,734 persons gaining health insurance coverage.
