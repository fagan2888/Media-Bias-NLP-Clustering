Charles Gaba, operator of the the Obamacare tally-tracking site ACASignups.net, had expected there would be about 220,000 people who signed up under the grace period by now.



"Certainly, it's lower than I thought it might be," said Gaba. "What I'm wondering is...as we approach the 15th [of April], is there going to be a big spike?"

HealthCare.gov's special enrollment period, which began March 15 and runs through April 30, is available to people who only this tax season learned they were subject to a tax penalty for failing to have health insurance in 2014. The fine is the higher of $95 per adult, or 1 percent of taxable household income. That penalty increases to the higher of $325, or 2 percent of household income in 2015.

Eleven other states and the District of Columbia are also allowing a special enrollment period on their Obamacare exchanges for their residents. Washington state's exchange last week said that about 4,000 people had signed up for its special enrollment period, a tally equal to 11 percent of HealthCare.gov's total. Three states—Colorado, Idaho and Massachusetts—are not offering grace periods.

These special enrollment periods were granted by the federal government and the participating state exchanges in recognition of the fact that millions of people remain unaware of Obamacare's individual mandate and associated penalty for failing to have coverage. Federal officials said this will be a one-time offer—they do not plan on having a special enrollment season in 2016, despite the fact that open enrollment for that year will end even earlier than it did this year.
