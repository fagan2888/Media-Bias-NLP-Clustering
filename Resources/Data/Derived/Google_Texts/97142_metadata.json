She found a 9 percent drop in rates in Indianapolis from 2015 to 2016.\n\n\u201cIt could just be that the premiums in Indianapolis were higher than they needed to be in 2014,\u201d Cox said. \u201cNow that insurers have that experience, they\u2019re more comfortable lowering their rates to be more competitive.\u201d\n\nBut, Cox noted, not every area that started with high rates has seen them fall.\n\nRates in Anchorage, Alaska, were high in 2014 and have gone up by double digits since then. A 40-year-old nonsmoker there will pay $719 a month for a benchmark plan next year, compared with $298 in Indianapolis.\n\nThe Indiana health insurer dropping rates the most is MDwise Marketplace, which cut premiums by an average 19 percent.\n\nThe nonprofit said this summer that health care usage has been lower than anticipated since it started offering plans for the first time this year. In addition, the company expected the health of those buying insurance in 2016 to improve because Indiana\u2019s expansion of Medicaid moved the poorest people off the individual insurance market into the government program.\n\nThe fact that exchange enrollment in parts of Indianapolis has been higher than the national average is another indication the overall pool could be healthier, a key way of keeping premiums down, Cox said.\n\nAnthem, the insurer that covers the most Hoosiers buying plans on the exchange, is raising rates by about 4 percent on average, according to rate filings with the Indiana Department of Insurance.\n\nAnthem customer Les Kiesel, of Haubstadt, however, said the premium for his family plan is increasing from $1,068 a month to $1,269, a 19 percent increase.\n\n\u201cAnthem has totally priced me out,\u201d he said.\n\nKiesel, 47, said he hasn\u2019t seen any control in insurance costs in recent years. Instead, he thinks he\u2019s buying coverage that \u2014 because of its high deductible \u2014 protects him against only major bills, but without the low premiums that used to be available for \u201ccatastrophic\u201d plans.\n\n\u201cAll I am getting is peace of mind knowing that if one of my kids get leukemia or whatnot, my maximum out-of-pocket cost is going to be $13,000,\u201d he said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released its analysis of premium changes as the agency gears up for open enrollment of 2016 plans to begin Sunday.\n\nJulia Holloway, who runs the HealthCare.gov outreach and assistance program for Affiliated Service Providers of Indiana, said people have been calling for the past month to make appointments to sign up for coverage.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re ready to re-enroll and looking forward to looking at some new options,\u201d Holloway said. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of positive feedback from people. They\u2019re enjoying their plans, but they also like the option of being able to have choice.\u201d\n\nThe average consumer who switched plans from 2014 to 2015 paid a lower monthly premium, according to the government.\n\nShopping around is particularly important for people who qualify for subsidies because the value of the tax credit is tied to the benchmark plan. That creates competition among insurers to offer lower costs.\n\n\u201cThe flip side of that for consumers is that they may need to switch plans every year, which can be difficult for a lot of people,\u201d Cox said.\n\nMore than 219,000 Hoosiers selected a plan through last year\u2019s open enrollment period.\n\nBy the end of June, however, the number of Hoosiers with an active policy had fallen to 167,261. Those who dropped out could be receiving coverage through Medicaid or an employer plan, or might have stopped paying their premiums for other reasons and are uninsured.\n\nNearly 9 in 10 who still had exchange plans were receiving tax credits to help pay their premiums, an average subsidy of $215 a month. Credits are available to people earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level, which is about $95,000 for a family of four.\n\nThe federal government estimates that, nationally, nearly 8 in 10 returning customers will be able to buy coverage for less than $100 a month after tax credits.\n\nIn Marion County, a 40-year-old nonsmoker has 67 plans to choose from that range in price from $243 a month for an IU Health Plan with a $6,500 deductible, to $495 a month for an Anthem plan with a $1,000 deductible. Someone making $25,000 a year would qualify for an estimated $156 in monthly tax credits, which would make the cheapest plan $87 a month.\n\nEmail Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com.
