In an editorial published this morning, the Journal argued that President Obama is guilty of \u201cflagrant contempt for regular political order\u201d by taking executive action to make changes to the Affordable Care Act and limit deportations for certain classes of undocumented immigrants. \u201cWhen the executive suspends or rewrites laws across health care, drugs, immigration and so much else, elected legislators are stripped of their constitutional role,\u201d they observe.\n\nBut the Journal is not without hope. Their sudden concern for the concentration of power in the executive branch has a new champion: Speaker John Boehner. News that Boehner intends to introduce legislation to initiate a lawsuit against the Obama administration\u2019s executive overreach has left the Journal editorial board impressed with the Speaker\u2019s solemn commitment to responsible government:\n\nThe Beltway press is portraying Mr. Boehner as merely serving carrion to the tea party vultures, and no doubt he hopes in part to sate the political appetites of the backbench. But we doubt he\u2019d wager the House\u2019s reputation, and his own, on a novelty lawsuit that the courts wouldn\u2019t hesitate to toss as frivolous. From what we know of the Speaker\u2019s deliberations, he\u2019s been persuaded on the merits.\n\nWho would have guessed that John Boehner and the House of Representatives had reputations to wager? Boehner\u2019s personal approval rating sits at 31 percent. Congress\u2019 approval rating is a muscular 16 percent. There\u2019s not a whole lot either could do to make the public hate them more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WSJ's editorial board praises Boehner's seriousness as the speaker sets himself up for another humiliation", "author": "Simon Maloy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "WSJ's editorial board praises Boehner's seriousness as the speaker sets himself up for another humiliation", "title": "Boehner\u2019s frivolous, embarrassing lawsuit impresses the Wall Street Journal", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/26/boehners_frivolous_embarrassing_lawsuit_impresses_the_wall_street_journal/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/john_boehner5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WSJ's editorial board praises Boehner's seriousness as the speaker sets himself up for another humiliation", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/john_boehner5.jpg", "title": "Boehner\u2019s frivolous, embarrassing lawsuit impresses the Wall Street Journal", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Boehner\u2019s frivolous, embarrassing lawsuit impresses the Wall Street Journal", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, deportations, executive orders, Executive power, GOP, House GOP, House Republicans, House Speaker John Boehner, Immigration Reform, John Boehner, Politics, The Wall Street Journal", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe41d9\"", "article_summary": "Their sudden concern for the concentration of power in the executive branch has a new champion: Speaker John Boehner.\nWho would have guessed that John Boehner and the House of Representatives had reputations to wager?\nBut we doubt he\u2019d wager the House\u2019s reputation, and his own, on a novelty lawsuit that the courts wouldn\u2019t hesitate to toss as frivolous.\n\u201cWhen the executive suspends or rewrites laws across health care, drugs, immigration and so much else, elected legislators are stripped of their constitutional role,\u201d they observe.\nThere\u2019s not a whole lot either could do to make the public hate them more."}
