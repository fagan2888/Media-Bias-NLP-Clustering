Through clear skies, they were able to view steamy water vapor molecules. The results were published today in the journal Nature.\n\nThe discovery of water vapor may immediately trigger giddy feelings \u2014 water is one of the building blocks of life, as we know it. However, the clear skies are just as exciting. Usually thick atmospheres prevent more in-depth study of Neptune-sized exoplanets.\n\n\u201cWhen astronomers go observing at night with telescopes, they say \u2018clear skies\u2019 to mean good luck,\u201d explained co-author Jonathan Fraine, who is from the University of Maryland. \u201cIn this case, we found clear skies on a distant planet. That\u2019s lucky for us because it means clouds didn\u2019t block our view of water molecules.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "NASA discovered the exoplanet, HAT-P-11b, outside of our solar system", "title": "Water vapor and clear skies discovered on Neptune-sized planet", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NASA discovered the exoplanet, HAT-P-11b, outside of our solar system", "title": "Water vapor and clear skies discovered on Neptune-sized planet", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/24/water_vapor_and_clear_skies_discovered_on_neptune_sized_planet/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/PIA18837-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NASA discovered the exoplanet, HAT-P-11b, outside of our solar system", "title": "Water vapor and clear skies discovered on Neptune-sized planet", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/PIA18837-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Gray", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Discovery, exoplanet, HAT-P-11b, ideas, JPL, life, NASA, Planet, Space, Water", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3138\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Discovery, exoplanet, HAT-P-11b, ideas, JPL, life, NASA, Planet, Space, Water, Innovation News, NewsA major discovery was announced on Wednesday by NASA: Water vapor and clear skies were discovered on a Neptune-sized exoplanet outside of our solar system \u2014 124 lightyears away.\nThrough clear skies, they were able to view steamy water vapor molecules.\nThe discovery of water vapor may immediately trigger giddy feelings \u2014 water is one of the building blocks of life, as we know it.\n\u201cIn this case, we found clear skies on a distant planet.\nHowever, the clear skies are just as exciting."}
