(Spoiler alert: Plot discussion of Netflix’s “House of Cards.”)

A major plot development in the third season of Netflix’s “House of Cards” has caused the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to clear the air.

In the third season, which released on Netflix in its entirety Friday, President Frank Underwood, played by actor Kevin Spacey, decides to twist the meaning of the Stafford Act, a real law that deals with disaster relief, in order to fund his America Works program. By declaring unemployment as a national emergency, Underwood is then able to reappropriate FEMA money to America Works.

But the real-life FEMA took to Twitter on Monday to dispute the fictional president’s interpretation of the law, Time fema-tweet/” target=”_blank”>reported.

“Hey, Frank Underwood: We’re not on board with claiming your own emergencies. #HouseofCards,” fema/status/572490865962303488” target=”_blank”>the agency tweeted Monday afternoon to its 381,000 followers.

The message, which was retweeted nearly 300 times, was accompanied by an image that said, “Here’s what the Stafford Act is for: save lives; protect property, public health, or safety; avert threat of catastrophe.”
