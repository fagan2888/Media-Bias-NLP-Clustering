Adapt or die.\n\nThat is some serious survival of the fittest, or a whole lotta\u2019 death of the inflexible.\n\nAnd it is probably a scary thought, or should be, for those who sit at the top of the healthcare mountain right now. Today\u2019s king of the castle can be tomorrow\u2019s court jester. Look no further than the words of Charles Darwin, who really should have been a management consultant:\n\n\u201cIt is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change.\u201d \u2013Charles Darwin\n\nHalf a century ago, life expectancy of a firm in the Fortune 500 was around 75 years. Now it\u2019s less than 15 years and declining even further, according to Steve Demming in an article called \u201cWhy Big Companies Die.\u201d\n\nI looked up the original Fortune top 10 and found they were General Motors, Exxon, US Steel, General Electric, Esmark, Chrysler, Armour, Gulf Oil, Mobil, DuPont.\n\nEven though those 10 companies were the giants of their time, there has been pretty significant turnover at the top. The current top 10 are: WalMart, Exxon, Chevron, Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Philips 66, General Motors, Ford, General Electric and Valero Energy.\n\nAs you can see, only three of 10 have maintained their place at the top. Of the seven no longer in the top, their fate was as follows:\n\n\u2022 US Steel exists, but no longer in Fortune 500\n\n\u2022 Esmark is a mid size company with $400 mm in revenue and no longer qualifies for the list\n\n\u2022 Chrysler went bankrupt and its assets were acquired by Fiat\n\n\u2022 Armour and Company was sold and broken into parts\n\n\u2022 Gulf Oil was merged into Standard Oil, which later became Chevron\n\n\u2022 Mobil Oil was merged into Exxon\n\n\u2022 DuPont has moved from #10 to #86 on the list\n\n\u201cI think it inevitably follows, that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct.\u201d\n\nHere are the healthcare companies that are included in the 2014 Fortune 500:\n\n\u2022 Insurance: United, WellPoint (Anthem), Aetna, Humana, Cigna, Centene, HealthNet, WellCare, Molina Healthcare\n\n\u2022 Services: HCA, Community Health Systems, Tenet, DaVita Healthcare Partners, Universal Health Services, Vanguard Health, Kindred Healthcare, Express Scripts, Quest Diagnostics, Omnicare, LabCorp of America, Quintiles\n\n\u2022 Medical Products: Abbott, Medtronic, Baxter, Stryker, Becton Dickinson, Boston Scientific, St. Jude\n\n\u2022 Pharmaceutical: J&J, Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly, Abbvie, Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Gilead, Biogen Mylan, Celgene, Allergan\n\n\u2022 Wholesalers: McKesson, Cardinal, AmeriSource Bergen, Henry Schein, Owens & Minor\n\nThat\u2019s 45 companies, almost 10 percent of the current Fortune 500. And if you go by history, some 86 percent of them are doomed to obscurity or worse if they don\u2019t learn how to adjust to life after the giant asteroid hits earth, also known as the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cIt is always advisable to perceive clearly our ignorance.\u201d\u2014Charles Darwin\n\nMany of these companies are making sincere attempts to modernize and modify their businesses to change with the times.\n\nInsurance companies are trying to become technology and outsource service companies selling to providers. The provider companies are trying to become insurance companies or something akin to them. The medtech and pharma companies are trying to adopt technology and services models to augment relationships with consumers or otherwise turn themselves into consumer products companies. The wholesalers are trying to become big data businesses.\n\nEveryone in healthcare is betting on technology as the answer while, ironically, the technology companies like Apple, Google and Oracle and Intuit are betting on healthcare. Whether this results in the tech companies becoming the new healthcare names on the list or, a giant cataclysmic self-cancelling exercise as healthcare and technology giants pass each other in the hallway, remains to be seen. In some cases these former strangers\u2014healthcare and technology companies\u2014are collaborating to find their way onto the road to the future, wherever that leads.\n\nI was recently told by one of the very large entities on the healthcare Fortune 500 list that they were undertaking certain activities (challenges, accelerator sponsorship, etc.) to \u201ccheck the innovation box,\u201d thus completely minimizing the import of the undertakings.\n\nThat company best be looking over its shoulder for a guy with a black hood and a scythe. Actually, if it\u2019s a startup that\u2019s coming to eat his lunch it will probably be a guy with a black hoodie, but you get my point.\n\n\u201cWe are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps\u201d\u2014Charles Darwin\n\nLisa Suennen is Managing Partner at advisory firm Venture Valkyrie.
