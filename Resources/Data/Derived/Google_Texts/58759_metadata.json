That trio put those moments aside and reached the third round, where more significant challenges could await.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019m capable of playing great tennis,\u201d the top-seeded Williams said. \u201cJust haven\u2019t seen it yet.\u201d\n\nCalling her performance \u201cnot professional,\u201d Williams was sloppy as can be for stretches in a 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 victory over 105th-ranked Anna-Lena Friedsam, a German who had never won a Grand Slam match until this week.\n\nWilliams committed 21 unforced errors in the first set alone, 52 in all.\n\n\u201cI was a little bit nervous (in the) first set,\u201d Friedsam said, \u201cand I think Serena was a bit nervous, too.\u201d\n\nThe American was particularly subpar with her serve, which she said she hasn\u2019t been able to work on properly in practice because of an elbow injury that led her to withdraw from a clay-court tournament in Rome this month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not using it so much as a weapon,\u201d Williams said about her serve. \u201cSo hopefully it will get better.\u201d\n\nShe double-faulted eight times and allowed Friedsam to accumulate 15 break points, four of which were converted.\n\n\u201cI know my level is literally 100 times better than I played today,\u201d the 19-time major champion said, rolling her eyes, \u201cso I think I take more solace in the fact I can play better, as opposed to the fact that that\u2019s the best I could play. Then I would be in trouble.\u201d\n\nNext comes 27th-seeded Victoria Azarenka, a former No. 1 player and two-time Australian Open champion.\n\nEven if she is 15-3 against Azarenka, including wins in the 2012 and 2013 U.S. Open finals, Williams acknowledged: \u201cI do know if I play the way I did today, I probably won\u2019t be winning my match. So I\u2019m going to have to step it up a level.\u201d\n\nThe top-seeded Djokovic and Murray, seeded No. 3, both will take on talented young Australians for berths in the fourth round. Djokovic faces 19-year-old Thanasi Kokkinakis, while Murray meets 20-year-old Nick Kyrgios. There hadn\u2019t been a teenager in the men\u2019s third round at Roland Garros since 2008, but now there are two: Kokkinakis and Croatia\u2019s Borna Coric, 18.\n\nCoric eliminated 33-year-old Tommy Robredo, who was seeded 18th, 7-5, 3-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4, and now will meet Jack Sock, a 22-year-old American.\n\n\u201cAll of them \u2014 Kyrgios, Kokkinakis and Coric \u2014 are showing some great skills and potential to be \u2026 top players,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a long way ahead.\u201d\n\nDjokovic proclaimed the pain in his upper right leg \u201cnothing serious, really\u201d after taking a medical timeout late in the second set of his 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 win over Gilles Muller. For a few minutes, things did not look promising for Djokovic \u2014 prone on the court, getting massaged by a trainer.\n\nBut he eventually moved a step closer to completing a career Grand Slam. There was a gaffe at 4-1 in the third set, though, when Djokovic casually watched a ball by Muller sail long but touch the edge of his racket before hitting the court.\n\nThe point went to Muller, who broke there.\n\n\u201cNever, never, ever happened. And it should never happen again,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI guess a little bit of lack of concentration. \u2026 It was funny to me, because I was 4-1 up, double-break. If it was 2-all, or 2-3 down, I wouldn\u2019t be smiling, for sure.\u201d\n\nMurray stretched his post-wedding winning streak to 12 matches by defeating Joao Sousa 6-2, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1.\n\nMurray had won all 12 previous sets the pair had played against each other. So it appeared to be a big deal when Murray was cited for a time violation by the chair umpire shortly before frittering away the second set.\n\n\u201cI was struggling,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThere was pressure building.\u201d\n\nBut he dealt with the difficulty, just as Djokovic and Williams did, and moves on to a new test.\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at twitter.com/HowardFendrich", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray advance at French Open", "title": "Serena Williams, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray advance at French Open", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/28/serena-williams-novak-djokovic-andy-murray-advance-at-french-open/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150528_083909_serena-williams.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150528_083909_serena-williams.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-28T08:38:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:02:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb9c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere was pressure building.\u201dBut he dealt with the difficulty, just as Djokovic and Williams did, and moves on to a new test.\nPARIS \u2014 For Serena Williams, it was a bad right elbow that led to some shaky serving and a dropped set.\nFor Novak Djokovic, first it was a balky right hip that needed treatment from a trainer; later came an embarrassing mistake.\nSo I\u2019m going to have to step it up a level.\u201dThe top-seeded Djokovic and Murray, seeded No.\nFor a few minutes, things did not look promising for Djokovic \u2014 prone on the court, getting massaged by a trainer."}
